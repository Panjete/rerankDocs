according to national public health data about 15 million scorpion envenomings resulting in 20003000 deaths are recorded annually worldwide 12 while large regions in the northern hemisphere such as the united states canada europe and russia as well as australia in the southern hemisphere are not associated with severe scorpionism 3 more than two billion people living in northern saharan africa african sahel south africa near and middle east southern india eastern andes mexico and south america are at risk of being stung by scorpions 1 climate change together with urban expansion and poor city sanitation management in many of these areas have increased the likelihood of encountering scorpions for instance in brazil alone malign incidences with scorpions have nearly doubled from 64000 to 124000 annual envenoming cases since 2012 4to date over 2000 scorpion species have been described the vast majority of the scorpion species that are dangerous to humans belong to the buthidae family 5 but some species in the families of scorpionidae and hemiscorpiidae have also been classified as harmful 67 geographical distributions of most of these medically significant species correlate with the local prevalence of scorpionism hence the density of dangerous species is especially high in northern africa iran saudi arabia brazil mexico and venezuela 389 local pain is often the first symptom of scorpion envenoming which may set in only minutes after a sting has occurred depending on the scorpion species the symptoms can progress to severe complications over the course of a few hours inducing a massive release of neurotransmitters scorpion venom neurotoxins usually cause sweating nausea vomiting hypersalivation restlessness and in more severe cases arrhythmia unconsciousness and heart failure which may lead to death 10 however in spite of the hazardous and life-threatening effects of scorpion envenoming therapeutic properties of scorpion body parts and venoms in ancient medicine have been utilized by humans for thousands of years 10 nowadays the potential therapeutic value of different scorpion venom compounds is being increasingly investigated as these compounds may represent promising leads for the development of new pharmaceuticalsin this review we survey the field of scorpion venom research from different angles focusing both on the detrimental and beneficial properties of scorpion venom toxins first scorpion venom compounds together with clinical manifestations and symptoms of different levels of scorpionism are introduced then currently available treatments and research into new alternatives ie next-generation antivenoms are discussed finally the latest reported results from the scientific literature focusing on the widespread potential applications of scorpion venom compounds are presentedpeptides from the long scorpion toxin superfamily are 5576 residue-long molecules with generally four disulfide bridges 13 due to their mode of action they can also be called sodium channel toxins natxs as their main targets are sodium ion channels 12 this family can be further divided into two groups  and -natxs depending on their specific interaction with the voltage-gated na channels figure 1ab -natxs block site 3 of sodium ion channels and therefore inhibit the inactivation of the channels and prolong their action potential in contrast -natxs interact with site 4 of na channels and shift the activation voltage of the channels to a more negative potential which results in channel inactivation opposite to the effects of site 3 toxins 14 it is noteworthy that not all natxs can be assigned to these two groups for example cn12 from centruroides noxius and ts2 from tityus serrulatus venom structurally resemble a -natx but exhibit an -natx effect figure 1c 1516 in addition aah it4 a toxin from androctonus australis hector displays both  and -natx effects 11the short scorpion toxin family is composed of peptides of 2364 residues in length with three or four disulfide bridges these peptides also known as potassium channel toxins ktxs mainly act as potassium ion channel blockers figure 1d 17 considering their sequences and cysteine pairs ktxs can be divided into       and -ktx groups 1819 the -ktx group which is considered to be the largest subgroup of the short scorpion toxin family contains 2342 residue-long peptides with three or four disulfide bridges 20 the -ktx group comprises longer chain peptides of 5057 residues in length 21 the -ktx group can be found in the genera centruroides mesobuthus and buthus and it mainly blocks the human ether--go-go-related gene herg channels 22 instead of having a cs  structure similar to the   and -ktx subfamilies toxins of the -ktx group are composed of two parallel short -helices connected by a -turn that is stabilized by two disulfide bridges yet their interaction with potassium ion channels is similar to that of the -ktx group 23although the   and -ktx groups do not contain a cs  motif they are mentioned in the continuation of other ktxs the -ktx group contains a kunitz-type structural fold with a double-stranded antiparallel -sheet flanked by an -helix in both the c-terminal and n-terminal segments since the kunitz-type structural folds are the active domains of proteins that inhibit the function of serine proteases -ktxs exert both protease and potassium channel-inhibiting properties 24 the -ktx group similar to calcins contain an inhibitor cystine knot ick motif see section 22 that contains a triple-stranded antiparallel -sheet stabilized by three cystine linkages 2526 the -ktx group has recently been defined and so far it has just two members ts11 and ts12 from t serrulatus venom ts11 shows less than 50 identity with ktxs from other subfamilies ts11 similar to  -ktxs contains an ick motif however -ktxs possess only three disulfide bridges while ts11 has four disulfide bridges assembled in a unique pattern 19this small but growing family of scorpion toxins consists of calcium channel-modulating peptides such as imperacalcin imperatoxin maurocalcin hemicalcin hadrucalcin opicalcin urocalcin and vejocalcin 27 sharing high sequence similarity 78 identity calcins include an ick motif stabilized by three disulfide bridges 28 calcins mainly act as agonists of ryanodine receptors ryrs which are intracellular ligand-activated calcium channels that are found in endoplasmicsarcoplasmic reticulum membranes ryrs play an essential role during excitationcontraction coupling in cardiac and skeletal muscles by releasing ca2 from intracellular reservoirs 29 in general calcins induce long-lasting subconductance states on the ryr channels which lead to an increase in the intracellular ca2 level and subsequently contractile paralysis 30calcins also present the ability to pass through cell membranes without causing their lysis 31 it has been hypothesized that the clustering of positively charged basic residues on one side of the calcins gives them a dipole moment that possibly interacts with negatively charged membrane lipid rafts such as gangliosides once these toxins interact with the outer membrane interaction between the hydrophobic regions of the toxin and the inner membrane is favored and the toxin is transiently translocated further electrostatic interactions with negatively charged molecules from the cytoplasm trigger the entrance of calcins into the cell without disrupting its membrane 32 this feature makes the calcins excellent candidates for intracellular drug delivery since they can enter cells without disrupting them even when large membrane-impermeable molecules are conjugated to them 33a calcium channel modulator distinct from the toxins that act on ryrs was recently identified through transcriptome analysis of t serrulatus and designated as a cell-penetrating peptide cpp-ts the synthetic cpp-ts is the first described scorpion toxin that activates ca2 signaling through the nuclear inositol 145-trisphosphate receptors this toxin together with the calcium channel toxin-like bmca1 from mesobuthus martensii forms a new subfamily of calcium toxins and shows promising anticancer effects see section 48 34it is noteworthy that calcins are not the only cell-penetrating scorpion toxins the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily v member 1 trpv1 is a chemosensory ion channel which is also known as the wasabi receptor generally trpv1 is activated through a unique mechanism involving the covalent modification of specific cysteine residues located within the channels cytoplasmic n-terminus recently it has been reported that wasabi receptor toxin watx from urodacus manicatus venom is capable of activating this receptor this means that watx can cross the plasma membrane and bind to the same allosteric nexus that is covalently modified by other agonists 35ndbps are small 1356 amino acid-long peptides with a very heterogeneous composition compared to scorpion peptides with disulfide bridges ndbps do not present a conserved or predictable structure-function relationship 36 most of these peptides are cationic molecules that display notable structural flexibility in aqueous solutions these peptides exhibit a random coil conformation however under membrane-mimicking environments such as 5060 of aqueous trifluoroethanol they readily adopt an amphipathic -helical structure 37 this characteristic enables them to interact with a broad spectrum of biological targets however they do not have any known specific molecular targets 3839few enzymes have been found in scorpion venoms in part because up until recently interest has been focused on small proteins and peptides however during the past years hyaluronidases phospholipases and metalloproteases among other enzymes have been detected in venoms of different scorpion speciesdifferent hyaluronidases have been identified in different families of scorpions including buthidae bothriuridae and urodacidae 40 it is known that these enzymes potentiate the toxicity of venom by disrupting the integrity of the extracellular matrix and connective tissues surrounding blood vessels at sting point and they thereby ease the systemic diffusion of other relevant scorpion toxins 41 it has recently been demonstrated that hyaluronidases also play an essential role in venom distribution from the bloodstream to the target organs 42 the same study also indicated that the neutralization of hyaluronidases could be considered as a first-aid strategy in scorpion envenoming treatmentphospholipases are known to be potent hemolytic agents as they disrupt cell membranes by hydrolyzing phospholipids they can also cause tissue necrosis and hemorrhages phospholipase activity has been detected in several scorpion species including opisthacanthus cayaporum 43 and heterometrus laoticus 44generally venoms from tityus species exhibit significant proteolytic activity and the first scorpion metalloprotease was discovered in the venom of t serrulatus 45 metalloproteases and serine proteases have also been detected in t discrepans venom 46 and apart from tityus species in the venom of hemiscorpius lepturus 47 it is believed that proteases play a key role in activating toxin precursors through post-translational modifications 48 in addition these enzymes inhibit platelet aggregation modulate cytokine production and activate the complement system 4950 altogether these effects facilitate the diffusion of scorpion venom toxins via the degradation of matrix proteinsonly a very limited number of studies on non-peptidic scorpion venom compounds have been reported however it has been shown that the venoms of some scorpions including m tamulus contain serotonin which is a monoamine that may cause vomiting and considerable local pain in scorpion envenomings 51 the metal and salt composition of some scorpion species have also been evaluated by al-asmari et al 52 in their study they found copper zinc calcium magnesium iron lead manganese arsenic and nickel ions in the venom of a bicolor a crassicauda and leiurus quinquestriatus they suggested that these components are associated with enzyme activity as they probably act as enzyme cofactors in addition two 14-benzoquinone compounds with antimicrobial activity have recently been isolated from the venom of diplocentrus melici a scorpion species endemic to mexico 53 see table 1 moreover it has been reported that one of the low-molecular-weight compounds with anticoagulant activity isolated from the heterometrus laoticus venom is adenosine which is a well-known inhibitor of platelet aggregation 5455conventional plasma-derived antivenoms are produced by the purification and digestion of polyclonal immunoglobulin g igg molecules harvested from the plasma of hyperimmunized animals such as horses or sheep these polyclonal antivenoms can cause severe adverse reactions due to their heterologous origin 65 and are known from the field of snakebite envenoming to generally possess low percentages of venom-neutralizing antibodies 6667 moreover conventional antivenoms may have limited efficacy against the medically most important toxins such as small neurotoxins as these toxins are often weakly immunogenic and therefore fail to raise a strong antibody response in the production animal 68 nonetheless the administration of these types of antivenoms is effective for clinical use and has been life-saving since the 1900s thus plasma-derived antivenoms are still the standard of treatment for systemic scorpion envenomings 69recently in pursuit of finding alternatives to equine iggs for scorpion envenoming treatment strategies involving avian egg-yolk-derived immunoglobulin ys igys have been developed 70 in contrast to equine iggs avian igy antibodies are obtained noninvasively from egg yolks from laying hens that have been immunized with scorpion venom these igy molecules have been argued to activate the mammalian complement system much less than animal-derived iggs and not interact with rheumatoid factors they are produced in amounts comparable to those found in the plasma of large mammals and have been argued to be more affordable previous studies on igy-based antivenoms against snake and scorpion venoms have demonstrated that neutralizing antibodies can be raised by this method albeit with lower neutralizing capacity than antibodies present in plasma-derived antivenoms 71 nevertheless there has been a slightly increased interest in the use of egg-yolk-derived igy antibodies for antivenom manufacture 72737475 as an example in a recent study it was demonstrated using a rescue assay involving mice that the lethality of a australis hector aah venom could be neutralized with igy antibodies however in addition to having the same drawbacks as equine iggs in terms of polyclonality and batch-to-batch variation avian-derived igys are phylogenetically even more distantly related to mammals 76 and still require the use of production animals for their manufacture therefore it seems likely that the development of next-generation antivenoms based on recombinant monoclonal antibodies and antibody fragments may be a more promising research avenue for developing effective safe and cost-competitive antivenoms with defined therapeutic composition for future envenoming therapyin the field of next-generation antivenoms the development of phage display technology and recent advances in toxicovenomics have enabled researchers to pursue new therapeutic strategies with the purpose of creating better envenoming therapies 77 these technology-driven approaches have made it possible to identify the most toxic and thus medically relevant components in a given venom and to efficiently and systematically discover human monoclonal antibodies against these components in turn this has paved the way for developing recombinant antivenoms with anticipated improved safety profiles compared to conventional antivenoms as an example using phage display technology the discovery of a human monoclonal single-chain variable fragment scfv antibody against t serrulatus toxins serrumab was reported in 2012 78 this monoclonal antibody was demonstrated to have a high neutralizing capacity against -toxins from t serrulatus while it was also capable of cross-neutralizing toxins from c suffusus suffusus and l quinquestriatus more recently in 2019 the field of recombinant scorpion antivenoms took another step forward when the discovery of a broadly-neutralizing monoclonal scfv antibody scfv 10fg2 capable of neutralizing an estimated 13 different neurotoxins from different scorpion species belonging to the centruroides genus was reported 79 using a rescue assay this study demonstrated that scfv 10fg2 was capable of neutralizing 3 ld50s of freshly obtained whole venoms from five different scorpion species belonging to the centruroides genus in 110 and 120 molar ratios of venom to antibody the implementation of broadly-neutralizing antibodies in the formulation of recombinant antivenoms is a significant simplification in their pharmaceutical composition since the inclusion of only a few broadly-neutralizing antibodies may be sufficient to neutralize the entire venoms of several different species reducing the product complexity of recombinant antivenoms is an important challenge to solve to enable cost-competitive manufacture of such medicines 8081next to scfvs single-domain vhh antibodies also known as nanobodies nb are being intensively explored for their utility in relation to recombinant antivenoms nbs are native to the immune system of camelids and sharks and constitute the smallest natural antibody fragments known to date 82 the low molecular mass of nbs allows for their distribution into deep tissues throughout the body 8384 this property in addition to their high ex vivo stability and low immunogenicity makes them an interesting format for the development of next-generation scorpion antivenoms 585 as an example of their utility a preclinical study on a bispecific nb targeting aahi and aahii toxins from a australis venom demonstrated that this nb was able to provide in vivo protection against 100 ld50s of intracerebroventricularly administered aahi toxin to nb molar ratio of 12 and 5 ld50s of subcutaneously administered whole venom these results were significantly better than controls in which equimolar amounts of traditional equine antibody fragments were unable to neutralize 2 ld50s of subcutaneously administered whole venom 86 finally using a murine model it was demonstrated that low molecular mass toxinnb complexes seemed to be quickly cleared through glomerular filtration while uptake in the liver remained low 87 thus these studies demonstrated that nbs may possess promising pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics similar studies on h lepturus and hottentotta saulcyi with comparable results also support the notion that nbs may find their utility for developing novel treatments for scorpion envenomings 8388finally monoclonal iggs are another recombinant antibody format that has been investigated for its ability to neutralize animal toxins as an example in vivo lethality studies assessing the neutralization capacity of several murine monoclonal iggs have shown positive results for the neutralization of a australis and c noxius toxins 66 in the future however it is likely that research in this area will focus more on human monoclonal iggs rather than non-human iggs as human iggs have a range of benefits over heterologous iggs an overview of the benefits and drawbacks of different antibody formats can be found elsewhere 66in the past century antimicrobial drugs revolutionized the control of diseases caused by microorganisms such as bacteria fungi viruses and parasites however due to the global problem of antimicrobial resistance amr development new antimicrobial agents are crucially needed for the 21st century these agents must be discovered at a rate that is sufficiently fast to combat the evolving rate of multidrug resistance mdr in microorganisms 92 natural product research holds promise for providing new molecules as a basis for novel antimicrobial drug development in 1991 it was reported that the folding pattern of charybdotoxin a ktx isolated from l quinquestriatus hebraeus venom was strikingly similar to that of the insect antibacterial component defensin 93 this discovery set the stage for studies on scorpion-derived antimicrobial peptides amps which have led to a large number of discoveries that may be of relevance for therapeutic applications comprehensive reviews on the different classes of amps found in the venom of several scorpion species can be found elsewhere 9495 here the focus will be directed only on more recent discoveries with an overview of amps with bactericidal activity that have been reported in the last five years which is summarized in table 1recently the spotlight has been put on the general and intrinsic multifunctionality of scorpion venom components including amps 103 for instance native scorpion amps uyct3 and uyct5 from u yaschenkoi and an enhanced uyct peptide designated as d3 were demonstrated to be potential bioinsecticides and promising candidates for the engineering of aphid-resistant crops when pea aphids acyrthosiphon pisum that are known as severe agricultural pests were fed with these amps the amps displayed activity against aphid bacterial symbionts and reduced the number of symbionts leading to a reduction in pest survival and delay in pest reproduction 111 meucin-49 from m eupeus also showed insecticidal activity in addition to having broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria 103 the red and blue benzoquinones from d melici are multifunctional components that besides showing antibacterial activity also exert cytotoxic effects on neoplastic cell lines in mouse models of mdr tuberculosis infection blue benzoquinone showed comparable activity to commercially available antibiotics while it did not cause adverse side effects in healthy mice 53 similarly the low molecular mass chitosan obtained from m gibbosus had a strong inhibitory effect against the bacterium l monocytogenes and the yeast c albicans in addition its antibacterial activity against b subtilis and s enteritidis was higher than the antibiotic gentamicin 99despite the multifunctionality and desirable potent action against microbes natural scorpion amps generally have cytotoxic effects on eukaryotic cells which is an obstacle that must be overcome to this end protein engineering techniques have been used to improve the potency and spectra of antimicrobial activity of the natural scorpion amps 107112113 employing these techniques it has been demonstrated that scorpion amps can be effectively used as scaffolds to design more specific and less harmful antibiotics 114115 in addition combining low concentrations of fast-killing scorpion amps with classical antibiotics is another approach that can be pursued in order to circumvent their cytotoxic effects against eukaryotic cells 116 all in all using natural scorpion amps as scaffolds for the rational design of novel antimicrobial agents and mixed formulations of antibiotics opens a new window of research to be pursued in the futurethe most important opportunistic fungal pathogens that are responsible for high mortality especially in hospitalized and immunocompromisedcritically ill patients belong to the candida aspergillus cryptococcus and pneumocystis genera 117 it has been reported that the prevalence of invasive fungal infections has increased from 63 in 1999 to 20 in 2013 118 among the aforementioned genera candida is the most common cause of fungal infections worldwide and invasive candidiasis occurs in more than 100000 patients every year 119 antifungal drug resistance among candida species is increasingly reported and the emergence of mdr c glabrata which can acquire resistance following exposure to antifungal agents presents significant challenges in many medical centers 120 moreover only three drug classes are licensed for monotherapy against candida infections including azoles polyenes and echinocandins 120 therefore new antifungal drug candidates from additional drug classes are sought after a summary of the scorpion-derived antifungal agents reported in the last five years is found in table 2stigmurin selected and synthesized based on a transcriptomic analysis of the t stigmurus venom gland exhibits both antibacterial and antifungal activity it is effective against the gram-positive bacterial species s aureus including methicillin-resistant strains stigmurin has also been demonstrated to be effective against the fungi c albicans c krusei and c glabrata with low toxicity against healthy human erythrocytes 98 these data suggested that stigmurin could be considered for the treatment of candidiasis more recently two analog peptides stiga6 and stiga16 were designed from the original peptide that demonstrated improved antimicrobial and antifungal activity these peptides could inhibit the growth of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria as well as c albicans c krusei and c glabrata at lower minimal inhibitory doses compared to stigmurin 106 stiga6 and stiga16 also showed high antiparasitic activity against trypanosoma cruzi see section 44 this study demonstrated that rational design using scorpion toxins as scaffolds may be useful for obtaining leads with improved therapeutic features against a wide range of pathogens including fungifew antiviral vaccines and drugs are commercially available against the more than 200 viruses known to infect humans 124 which is a situation that has been highlighted by the current sars-cov-2 pandemic and puts an emphasis on the importance of discovery and development of new antiviral agents to this end venomous animals are considered by many researchers as promising sources for such discoveries 124125 while some scorpion toxins show specific antiviral effects against just one type of virus other toxins are active against several different viruses mucroporin-m1 a derivative of mucroporin from the lychas mucronatus venom presents antiviral activities against three rna viruses measles mev severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus sars-cov and influenza h5n1 binding assays demonstrated that there is a significant and specific interaction between immobilized mucroporin-m1 on cm5 biosensor chips and mev following the mixing of 1  103 plaque-forming units per milliliter pfuml of mev with different concentrations of mucroporin-m1 and incubating the mixture for 1 h at 37 c two probable mechanisms of action were assessed these assessments included measurements of the direct effects of mucroporin-m1 on the virus through the inhibition of mev plaque formation and evaluation of the compounds ability to compromise the infectivity of the virus through the suppression of mev replication the results showed that mev infectivity could be inhibited almost completely by 10 gml of mucroporin-m1 within 40 min in a similar way mucroporin-m1 showed inhibitory effects against both sars-cov and h5n1 pseudoviruses 126 later it was demonstrated that mucroporin-m1 can inhibit the replication of the hepatitis b virus through the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk pathway and downregulation of hnf4 in vitro and in vivo 127 given the dual inhibitory activities against viruses and bacteria mucroporin-m1 may be considered as a lead compound for treating viral and bacterial co-infections mucroporin-m1 also serves as an example demonstrating the potential of peptides from scorpion venoms to be used as scaffolds for designing multifunctional antiviral agentsanother example is the recombinant peptide rev37 from the scorpion euscorpiops validus which was been demonstrated to possess inhibitory effects against dengue virus type 2 denv-2 hepatitis c virus hcv zika virus zikv and herpes simplex virus type 1 infections at non-cytotoxic concentrations the inhibitory effects of rev37 against denv-2 hcv and zikv infections were determined in the hepatoma cell line huh7 via real-time fluorescent quantitative pcr for mrna in the infected cells rev37 was able to reduce the level of denv-2 hcv and zikv infection at the mrna level at a concentration of 10 m by 91 97 and 87 respectively since the cellular entry processes of these four viruses are similar it has been suggested that a specific molecular mechanism in which the rev37 peptide alkalizes acidic organelles to prevent low ph-dependent fusion of the viral membrane to the endosomal membrane blocks the release of the viral genome from the endosome to the cytoplasm and thus restricts viral late entry 128 the propensity to cause adverse reactions lack of or low efficacy and high price of the very few vaccines and therapeutics that are available against the aforementioned viruses 129130 emphasize that rev37 may be a relevant lead that possibly could be developed into an antiviral drugsmp76 a scorpine-like peptide from the venom of s maurus palmatus is another recent example of a scorpion-derived agent that is effective against different viruses the recombinantly expressed peptide rsmp76 can inhibit rna replication and protein synthesis of denv-2 and zikv in primary mouse macrophages the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line a549 the huh7 cell line and the human monocytic cell line thp-1 in a dose-dependent manner at a concentration of 10 mm the inhibitory effects of rsmp76 were 757 against infections caused by denv-2 tsv01 and its more virulent strain ngc while for zikv infection inhibition was evaluated to be 738 although the detailed molecular mechanisms of the rsmp76-induced inhibitory effects need to be elucidated it seems that the mechanism of inhibition did not include direct inactivation of the viral particles it has been suggested that rsmp76 suppresses an established viral infection by upregulating interferon- expression through the phosphorylation of the interferon regulatory factor 3 which enhances type-i ifn responses and thus inhibits viral infection 131 since the achievement of viral clearance is very difficult antiviral agents such as rsmp76 that can suppress established viral infections are considered to be more efficient than traditional antiviral therapeutics which exert their antiviral effects through the direct inactivation of viral particles or the inhibition of viral cell entry 131 enhancing the protective effects of host innate immunity such as interferon ifn activation by antiviral agents such as rsmp76 may potentially circumvent the development of drug resistance and the effects of genetic variability in the viral genome 132 these examples selected from dozens of ongoing studies demonstrate the potential of scorpion-derived peptides to be developed as antiviral therapeuticsparasitic diseases are considered a health problem particularly in developing countries where people are frequently infected by parasites belonging to the genera plasmodium trypanosoma and leishmania among others 133134 since antiparasitic therapeutic agents available for clinical use are often toxic 135 there is an urgent need for the discovery and development of novel therapeutics 136scorpion toxins have been demonstrated to possess inhibitory effects against a number of parasites scorpine purified from pandinus imperator venom was the first isolated scorpion toxin that demonstrated antiprotozoan effects against plasmodium berghei 137 later on recombinantly expressed scorpine produced 98 mortality in the sexual stage of p berghei and 100 reduction in p falciparum parasitemia 138 similarly meucin-24 and meucin-25 two linear ndbps synthesized from a cdna library of the m eupeus venom gland demonstrated antimalarial activity both peptides inhibited the development of p berghei and killed intra-erythrocytic p falciparum parasites at micromolar concentrations without harming mammalian cells 139 making them potential candidates for antimalarial therapiesscorpion-derived agents can be effective against other parasites as well taenia solium pork tapeworm is a parasite responsible for taeniasis intestinal infection and cysticercosis tissue infection in humans 140 in 2010 t solium cysticercosis was added to the list of major neglected tropical diseases of the world health organization who 141 t crassiceps is another species of the taeniidae family of tapeworms that due to extensive antigen similarity with t solium functions as an experimental model to test and screen promising antigens before testing them in pigs 142 it has been demonstrated using in vitro assays that hge36 a naturally occurring truncated form of a scorpine-like peptide from the hoffmannihadrurus gertschi venom can reduce the viability of t crassiceps larval cysts at submicromolar concentrations while having a minimal effect on human lymphocytes 143 this study demonstrated that scorpion-derived agents may hold potential as therapeutic agents for human cysticercosis diseasehuman african trypanosomiasis sleeping sickness and american trypanosomiasis chagas disease are induced upon infection with the protozoan parasites t brucei and t cruzi respectively being considered endemic in latin america chagas disease is a potentially life-threatening illness that affects 67 million lives according to the who 144 in an in vitro assay it was recently demonstrated that stigmurin and its analogs stiga6 stiga16 stiga25 and stiga31 show high antiparasitic activity against epimastigote forms of t cruzi that is a form naturally found in the gut of infected insect vectors 106113 stiga6 and stiga16 have also been shown to have activity against trypomastigote forms of t cruzi which are mainly found in the blood of patients in the acute phase of chagas disease in addition these peptides demonstrate higher antiparasitic activity at a lower concentration compared to benznidazole which together with nifurtimox are currently available as chagas disease medicines 106 therefore stiga6 and stiga16 may be utilized in the development of therapeutics against chagas diseaseit has been demonstrated that leishmania parasites are sensitive to peptides with antimicrobial and ion channel inhibitory activity since scorpion venoms are rich sources of such peptides borges et al demonstrated that t discrepans crude venom and its main fractions tdi ii and iii could inhibit the growth of promastigote forms the motile long-elongated flagellated infective form of the leishmania parasite that develops in the midgut of the sandfly of l mexicana l braziliensis and l chagasi that eventually led to parasite death in vitro 145 unfortunately to the best of our knowledge leishmanicidal activity of compounds from the venoms of other scorpion speciesfamilies has not been reported and it should be investigated whether the leshmanicidal effects are restricted to the genus tityusbradykinin is a potent endothelium-dependent vasodilator peptide with hypotensive properties that belongs to the kinin group of proteins the angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inactivates bradykinin by degrading it 146147 the inhibition of ace via bradykinin-potentiating peptides bpps such as captopril which is derived from a peptide found in the venom of the lancehead viper bothrops jararaca has been established as a clinically approved strategy for preventing hypertension 148the multifunctionality of scorpion toxins is in the limelight once again regarding the bradykinin-potentiating effects of scorpion venoms it has been demonstrated that the c-terminal fragment of bmkbpp an amp from m martensii venom with antibacterial and antifungal activities shows significant sequence similarity with the peptide k12 which is a known ace inhibitor from b occitanus venom in an in vitro assay using guinea pig ileum segments of nearly 3 cm in length both bmkbpp whole peptide and its c-terminal fragment bmkbpp-c demonstrated bradykinin-potentiating activity at a concentration of 50 nm however bmkbpp whole peptide and bmkbpp-c were less potent than peptide k12 with bmkbpp-c being more active than the whole peptide 149 the sequence similarity between a fragment of a toxin and bpps is also observed for t serrulatus venom peptides the n-terminal of ts3 an -toxin acting on voltage-gated sodium channels demonstrated a striking sequence similarity with ts10 former peptide t that is a known bpp 150 ts10 was originally reported as an ace inhibitor since it could inhibit the ace-catalyzed hydrolysis of bradykinin 151 later using male wistar rats and their aortic rings in vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated that the n-terminal of ts3 ts31-14c12s and ts10 were not able to directly inhibit ace activity instead they induced a strong vasodilatory effect that could be reversed in the presence of the nitric oxide no synthase inhibitor n-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester l-name this suggests that ts10 and ts31-14c12s play their role by activating molecular targets in the vascular endothelium which leads to no production and eventually vasodilation 150 in addition it has been reported that t serrulatus hypotensins tshpt-i ii iii and iv and tisth from t stigmurus also potentiate bradykinin through improvement of the endothelial function and no release in rats 152153 these cases show that scorpion peptides can potentiate bradykinin through mechanisms other than ace inhibitionbesides vasodilation and hypotension scorpion-derived bpps play important roles in other physiological processes it is estimated that a considerable number of cancer patients receive radiation therapy during their course of illness 154 however radiation therapy might lead to side effects including radiation-induced heart disease rihd in patients having lymphoma breast lung and esophageal cancer 155156 it has been demonstrated that bpps obtained from l quinquestriatus improved cardiomyopathy induced by -radiation in rats probably by acting as a scavenger of free radicals to protect the heart from negative effects derived from radiation exposure 157several scorpion toxins can modulate the immune system 158 indeed the contribution of released inflammatory mediators eg cytokines eicosanoids and reactive oxygen species and activation of the complement system is well explored in the envenoming pathophysiology following scorpion stings 57158159 for instance an increase in the regulatory cytokines interleukin il-10 and il-4 has been observed in experimental envenomings by a australis hector and c noxius as well as in real human envenomings by t serrulatus 160161162163 although most of the studied scorpion toxins exhibit pro-inflammatory effects and activate the immune system 2058160164165 a few of them demonstrate potential therapeutic applications by controlling the immune responses and acting as immunosuppressive agentsthe most studied class of immunosuppressive scorpion toxins is the blockers of voltage-gated potassium channel type 13 kv13 although many cells express kv13 most of the studies have focused on effector memory t cells tem due to the high expression profiles of kv13 the tem cells are a subpopulation of t cells regarded as an attractive pharmacological target because of their role in the development of autoimmune diseases 166 a recent review covering the structure and function of these channels as well as the therapeutic implications of blocking kv13 using toxins derived from scorpion venom has summarized the studies of more than 60 scorpion toxins from the androctonus buthus mesobuthus lychas parabuthus leiurus centruroides and tityus genera 167beside kv13 channels other ion channels such as kv31 and kv21 have also been demonstrated to be important for t-cell activation and function 168169 pucca et al described ts6 and ts15 from t serrulatus which block kv21 and inhibit the proliferation and function of different t-cell subpopulations in vitro the study also showed that ts15 was capable of inhibiting delayed-type hypersensitivity dth response in vivo indicating the potential of the peptide to be developed into a treatment for autoimmune diseases 169 another study performed by xiao et al described the immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties of st20 a disulfide-bridged -ktx found in the venom of scorpiops tibetanus in vitro functional studies showed that this peptide was able to inhibit the expression of the cell surface marker cd69 as well as the secretion of il-2 tumor necrosis factor tnf- and ifn- in activated human t cells in vivo experiments using a rat autoimmune disease model showed that dth was ameliorated in the presence of st20 170 thus new immunosuppressive therapeutic drugs may be derived from scorpion venom toxins which can be optimized in regard to structure and function possibly facilitating the future use of such agents in clinical settingsgenerally scorpion stings are reported as very painful events most known scorpion toxins are known to modulate voltage-gated ion channels mainly sodium and potassium channels 20 voltage-gated sodium nav channels play a key role in nociception pain 171 the nav channels comprise a family of nine homologous -subunits nav11nav19 which together with -units 14 generate the ion-conducting pore 172 however only four nav channel subtypes are involved in pain nav11 nav16 nav17 and nav19 173174175176 throughout the last decades scorpion toxins capable of inducing pain mediated by these channels have been widely explored 20177178179180 most recently two peptides hj1a and hj2a have been isolated from the hottentotta jayakari venom that are potent agonists of nav11 demonstrating dual  activity by modifying both the activation and inactivation properties of the channel hj1a and hj2a may be used as alternative tools for developing selective nav11 modulators for the treatment of epileptic diseases such as dravet syndrome 181 in addition scorpion toxins that induce pain mediated by different ion channels such as voltage-gated potassium channel 42 kv42 182 and trpv1 35183 have also been encounteredmoreover scorpion toxins capable of controlling pain ie analgesics have been reported in the literature many of these analgesic toxins are not toxic to mammals as they belong to a group of insect-specific neurotoxic  or -toxins that interact with nav kv andor cav pathways 114184185186187188 during the last two decades over 20 scorpion venom-derived peptides and proteins have been reported to exert anti-nociceptive effects in vitro and in vivo due to the absence of toxicity in mammals and comparable effects to standard of care medications such as carbamazepine most of the scorpion-derived proteins are intriguing agents that could be used for future development of analgesics the scorpion m martensii previously known as b martensii karsch has been thoroughly studied as the source of more than 15 analgesic peptides 189190 analgesic properties have also been reported in a mauretanicus mauretanicus ammviii -anatoxin l quinquestriatus quinquestriatus lqqit2 -toxin h laoticus hetlaxin -toxin b occitanus tunetanus botaf -toxin and t serrulatus tsntxp table 3 however there is still much unexplored venom territory for future discovery in the field of analgesic venom componentsin 2019 rigo et al reported the presence of anti-nociceptive effects of a non-toxic protein from t serrulatus tsntxp 191 this protein is described to be structurally similar to nav-modulating neurotoxins such as ts7 however tsntxp is non-toxic to animals effects of tsntxp were studied in 184 adult male and female swiss mice in regard to acute and neuropathic pain the results demonstrated that tsntxp has potent anti-nociceptive properties in both models which is potentially due to a substantial reduction of glutamate release these results combined with the lack of acute adverse effects suggest that tsntxp may possibly be utilized in future pain treatmentthe discovery of specific and selective anticancer drugs that can directly act on tumors display a synergistic effect with existing chemotherapeutics or function as cargoes for drugs with low bioavailability is significantly on the rise 216 chlorotoxin ctx from l quinquestriatus venom is a molecule that interacts with chloride channels ctx was the first scorpion-derived agent that demonstrated inhibitory effects on glioma cell migration and invasion it also exhibited the advantage of being able to penetrate deep into tumor tissue 217218 since the discovery of ctx the list of scorpion crude venoms and isolated toxins with anticancer activity has been growing rapidly hence a comprehensive review of all reported compounds exceeds the scope of this review but can be found elsewhere 216217218219 here we present a few cherry-picked recent studies with the most significant findingst serrulatus crude venom was tested in 2019 for possible anticancer effects against the siha and hela cervical cancer cell lines and the venom was shown to induce apoptosis in hela cells 220 wang et al had previously obtained similar results with the crude venoms of h liangi and m martensii the two venoms were tested for potential anticancer effects toward hela cells and both venoms showed dose-dependent anti-proliferative and apoptosis-inducing effects through upregulation of the cdk-inhibitor p21 however neither of the venoms showed significant effects on non-cancer huvec-21 cells suggesting specificity toward cancer cells 221 additionally the venoms of a crassicauda and l quinquestriatus have been examined using breast mda-mb-231 and colorectal hct-8 cancer cell lines 222 this examination revealed that the venoms exhibited significant time and dose-dependent cytotoxicity and that they caused an increase in the number of apoptotic cells and reactive oxygen species for both cancer cell lines when the cell lines were subjected to the venoms the observed arrests in the cell cycle could be an indication of tumor suppressor p21 upregulation and could hence suggest selectivity toward cancer cells anticancer properties have been recently associated to the crude venom of rhopalurus junceus and a mix of five peptides from the same venom 223224 despite generating promising results further investigations on the aforementioned scorpion crude venoms are needed to characterize the effective anticancer constituents among other venom componentsin 2018 li et al constructed a scorpion venom library of a australis and a mauretanicus that led to the discovery of a highly potent novel anticancer peptide from a mauretanicus named gonearrestide this peptide was subsequently tested against several colorectal cancer cell lines dld-1 hke3 dks8 and hct116 and the glioma cell line u-251 extensive in vitro in vivo and ex vivo studies on hct116 cells demonstrated that this peptide possessed high specificity toward cancer cells could significantly arrest the cell cycle in the g1 phase and could thus strongly inhibit tumor growth additionally proliferation and cytotoxicity studies with the non-cancer human epithelial cell lines fhc colon mcf-10a breast and human erythrocytes only identified negligible off-target effects of gonearrestide 225 another study by benaissa et al investigated the activity of the negatively charged fractions of a australis venom against du145 prostate cancer cells and successfully identified strong anti-proliferative effects mediated by the nav16-directed peptide aahiv 226 however regardless of its potent anti-proliferative effects this peptide was not able to inhibit cell migration another study on agap and agap-sypu2 from m martensii venom see section 47 for their analgesic effects demonstrated that these two peptides possessed in vivo antitumor properties in mouse ehrlich ascites tumor models and mouse s-180 fibrosarcoma models 213227 furthermore agap showed strong anticancer effects including the inhibition of stemness epithelialmesenchymal transition migration and invasion toward mcf-7 and mda-mb-231 breast cancer cells 228 it also inhibited the voltage-gated proton channel hv1 229 which has been investigated as a possible target for cancer therapy and has been extensively reviewed elsewhere 230 two studies on a third m martensii peptide bmkn2 indicated that this peptide could selectively induce apoptosis in cancerous human oral cells while normal cells were affected to a much lesser extent 231232 another interesting study highlights a newly discovered short 14 residues peptide from b occitanus tunetanus rk1 with potent anticancer effects toward glioblastoma u87 and melanoma igr39 cancers 233 while showing no apparent in vivo neurotoxicity toward intracerebroventricularly injected mice rk1 was demonstrated to possess cytotoxicity against u87 and igr139 cells in vitro and it was able to inhibit cell proliferation and migration of these two cancer cell lines rk1 also inhibited angiogenesis in a chicken chorioallantoic membrane model a cell-penetrating peptide cpp from t serrulatus venom named cpp-ts is the final promising member of the long list of scorpion-derived agents with anticancer effects discussed here using a cpp-ts-derived peptide subpeptide1439 a study demonstrated that this peptide has selective internalization properties in specific cancer cell lines such as sk-mel-188 hep g2 caco-2 mda-mb-231 a549 and du 145 which make it a potential intranuclear delivery tool for cancer cell targeting 34 these handful of studies from the growing body of recently published papers indicate the potential of utilizing scorpion venoms as a source for discovering new cancer therapeuticsthe large diversity of scorpion venom components has fueled a wide range of studies on these molecules from toxicology to antivenom development and therapeutic applications in particular therapeutic applications of scorpion venom compounds have attracted a lot of attention due to the urgent need for either finding or improving treatments against a broad spectrum of diseases the emergence and spread of superbugs amr microorganisms represent an increasingly serious threat to global public health which is projected to get much worse in the years ahead therefore the exploration of the utility of novel bioactive molecules scaffolds and mechanisms of action represents a potentially powerful approach to develop new antimicrobial therapeutics and diagnostic tools for current and future diseases dozens of scorpion-derived bioactive molecules have been shown to possess promising pharmacological properties of which around 100 have been mentioned in this review these pharmacological properties of scorpion-derived bioactive molecules include antimicrobial immunosuppressive bradykinin-potentiating analgesic and anticancer effects among others in addition to chlorotoxin which has already entered clinical trials the cpp-ts peptide which is a potential intranuclear delivery tool for targeting cancer cells is likely to be a molecule receiving significant scientific interest in the future however before venom-derived biotherapeutics can be introduced to the market a number of technological issues must be overcome including obtaining access to material venoms and toxins characterizing isolated venom components establishing manufacturing approaches for novel compounds and reducing the potential propensity to cause adverse effects especially for long-term therapy nevertheless the scientific literature reviewed here shows several examples of promising scorpion venom-derived proteins and peptides that may be used as leads for the development of new biotherapeutics thus if the data observed in vitro and in preclinical models translates well to the clinical setting there may indeed be great promise in exploiting the benefits of scorpion toxinsthe advancements in next generation sequencing technologies such as 454 1 or solexa 2 have led to an increased interest in the deep sequencing of samples from mixed populations when the sequences of interest are largely similar and only a few salient differences exist within these populations it is difficult to quantify or to identify the important trends with existing tools the msa is a useful visual aid when analyzing a small set of sequences within a sample but to identify important trends within a large number of sequences or among multiple sets of deeply sequenced samples a more quantitative approach is necessary existing tools such as bioperl 3 biopython 4 and samtools 5 are useful for efficiently generating manipulating and storing msas but statistical metrics and visualizations for the comparison of the samples that the msas represent do not existthe applications we have implemented in andes allow an investigator to identify and compare the variations within a sample or among multiple samples three independent projects that have used andes will be described in the results and discussion section the first project involved quantifying on a whole genome level the mutation rates and the locations of novel variations for a coronavirus that had been passaged 10 consecutive times in cell culture the depth of sequencing was derived from a single solexa run for each of 3 selected passages this exemplifies how andes can be used to compare temporally separated samples to analyze genome-wide mutation trends and to identify specific variations for further analyses in the second project andes was used to differentiate between the strains of human influenza h1n1 sequences that were deposited into genbank because the majority of human h1n1 sequences were generated from the circulating seasonal strain there were little or no consistent annotations in the genbank records to differentiate them from the collected sequences of the 2009 swine-origin influenza pandemic in this case the sequencing depth was accumulated across data that were deposited by a community of influenza researchers the clustering and analyses of the dataset made it possible to design strain-optimized degenerate pcr primers for the purpose of sequencing both seasonal and swine origin h1n1 genomes the final project described is an application of the andes toolset to assess the sequencing accuracy and identify loci-specific sequencing errors for a 454 titanium sequencing run performed on a subregion of the 16s rrna gene 16s rdna the deep sequencing of clonal copies of a 16s sequence provided the data to empirically determine actual pcr and sequencing error rates this has played a critical role in characterizing the nature of sequencing errors on downstream analysesthe fundamental data structure of the andes suite of tools is the position profile this data structure contains the number of nucleotides that support each position of the analyzed region of interest andes currently supports the conversion from the output of clustalw6 ie aln files however the format of the position profile is relatively trivial therefore the encoding of output from an alternative alignment application should be readily supported alignments generated with razers7 muscle 8 and amoscmp 9 tools have also been successfully converted into position profiles and analyzed figure 1 shows the input msa that the resultant position profile in figure 2 was created from each column in the position profile is calculated by summing the number of nucleotides or gap contributions at each position each line of the position profile is essentially a probability mass function pmf with support at a t g c and - gap when the values are normalized and sum to 1 gaps introduced at the beginning or end of the msa are assumed to be caused by read termination so these gaps are not considered to be nucleotide variations and are therefore ignored bases with iupac ambiguity codes 10 in the alignment are given equal weight for each nucleotide they represent for example the iupac code m represents a or c so 05 will be contributed to both a and c position counts the major allele is also stored in the profile for visual convenience the number of lines in the position profile is the gapped length of the consensus sequence for the msathe alignment of two or more profiles is important for comparing or merging their contents into a new composite profile profile merging may be used to pool multiple sample profiles together or to accumulate the sequencing results from a previously partitioned sample since the compute time of an all-versus-all msa tool such as clustalw has an exponential growth rate 8 as a function of the number of sequences in a run n it is recommended to reduce n and take advantage of parallel computation resources this can be accomplished by dividing n across s independent runs with smaller input sizes of ns and then performing a final merge across the s profilesprofile alignment in andes involves computing the major allele for each position based on the underlying nucleotide composition if the most common allele at a position is a gap then the most frequent allele that caused the gap to open is used as the major allele the representative major alleles for each profile are then aligned with clustalw the results from the clustalw alignment are then used as a proxy to the underlying nucleotide distributions since the quality of the profile alignment can only be as good as the algorithms used to align the major alleles andes also allows for the integration of alternative msa tools such as muscle which can also produce clustalw-like output to complete the profile merge the new position frequencies are then summed for each column using the major allele positions as proxies similarly for a profile comparison the corresponding positional frequencies between the two aligned profiles are then comparedthe root mean square deviation rmsd plot is a visualization of the differences between the nucleotide distributions along the alignment of two or more samples in the rmsd plot the alignment between two sequences is represented along the x-axis and the computed rmsd value for each nucleotide position between two aligned samples is represented along the y-axis figure 3 to compute the rmsd for each nucleotide position the standard rmsd formula 11 was modified to compare the nucleotide distributions between each samplermsdxyipzatgcpxippyip25pxip and pyip are the probabilities of nucleotide p at position i for the sample x and y respectively the nucleotide p is an element of the nucleotide set a t g c - where the - character represents a gap that was necessary to align the two profiles the position i ranges from 1 to the length of the gapped alignment l the number of insertions and deletions indels that were necessary to align the sequences in the msa are also included for each position the denominator within the square root operator 5 is the number of symbols in the nucleotide set usedthe minimum rmsd value of 0 occurs when the distributions of nucleotides are identical between the two alignments for a specific position the maximum value of 0632 is generated if the allele of one sample is completely different than the second sample for example if sample x consisted of 100 ts and sample y consisted of 100 gs another important rmsd value is 0316 this value occurs when one sample is biallelic for example at and the other sample is partially similar with a single allelic representation of a see figure 4 and 5 for sample calculations of the two casessummary rmsd values between two samples can be computed by taking the arithmetic mean of the rmsd value for every position along the length of the alignment l these summary values can be used to generate a distance matrix among all samples see table 1the shannon entropy se is a measure of uncertainty or information content in a random variable when applied to the distribution of nucleotides at a single position it represents the amount of variation at that position a normalized shannon entropy nse can be computed by using a logarithm of base 5 the number of supports for the distribution for the calculation this nse has a range between 0 and 1 where 0 represents no variation only a single allele is represented in the sample and 1 represents maximum variation the uniform existence of a t g c and gapssexipzatgcpxiplog5pxippxip is the probability of nucleotide p at position i for the sample x the nucleotide p is an element of a t g c - where the - character represents a gap that was necessary to align all the sequences within the sample the position i ranges from 1 to the length of the gapped alignment l the number of insertions and deletions indels which were necessary to align the sequences in the msa are also included for each position the se plot is generated by plotting the alignment of a single sample along the x-axis versus the se on the y-axis for example figure 6 a summary se value for a single sample can be computed by taking the arithmetic mean of the se for every position along the length of the alignment l since the se can be calculated within a single sample it is useful for quickly identifying regions or positions of variability without the necessity of choosing an ideal reference sequencethe base conversion probabilities between two samples or within a single sample can be computed between aligned profiles given an alignment of all sequences in the samples the following formula which is based on the definition of conditional probability is utilizedpxpyqi1lpxippyiqi1lpyiqthis formula computes the probability of base q in aligned position i in sample y converting to base p in aligned position i in sample x summed over all aligned positions p and q are from the nucleotide set a t g c - i is the nucleotide position range between 1 to the length of the gapped alignment l computing base conversion frequencies is useful for determining if there are any unexpected pressures in mutation rates towards particular nucleotides or sequencing error biases one will typically see a significantly higher base conversion rate between transitions ag or ct than transversions other remaining combinationsinter-sample cluster analyses can be performed by first computing the distance matrix among all samples with the rmsd formuladistancexy1li1lrmsdxyithe matrix can be loaded into a statistics package such as r 12 and a multidimensional scaling mds plot or dendrogram may be computed and plotted mds is a statistical technique used to convert an n dimensional description of the relationship between samples eg a distance matrix into a lower dimensional plot eg 2d as a result samples with similar characteristics are reflected in the plot by their close spatial proximity to each other sample r code has been provided in the andes tool set to perform these cluster analyses based on the generated distance matricesthe detection of polymorphisms and the generation of a representative consensus sequence both depend on the investigators threshold for determining the significance of underlying variations for example this threshold may be the rate of sequencing errors or the prevalence of a minor allele that the investigator would like to eliminate from the consensus sequence it is common to automatically assign iupac ambiguity codes to certain base positions even when the existence of the alternative base or bases has a low frequency eg 1 representative alternatively consensus sequences may be manually edited or entire sequences may be eliminated from the set of representative input sequences in the effort to reduce the dominance of ambiguity codes in the final consensus sequence these workarounds are tedious and the elimination of specific sequences from the set of sequences under analysis leaves the final consensus sequence potentially skewed towards the representation of only the most common variants downstream processes such as degenerate primer design will then be forced to compute on a non-representative consensus to generate the most representative consensus sequence it is preferable to use the largest sample possible since this will represent the population of interest most accurately and minimize the effects of random errorsprofile to consensus generation automatically converts a position profile into a consensus sequence using the standard iupac ambiguity codes the benefit of using a position profile to generate a consensus sequence is the ability to perform filtering a priori using either a nominal or percent cutoff when a nominal threshold-based filter is applied the nucleotide frequencies for each position that do not exceed the specified threshold are set to zero by not changing the values of the nucleotide frequencies that exceed the threshold their relative proportions are still maintained when applying a percent cutoff filter the positional nucleotide frequencies are first normalized into positional probability mass functions pmfs an application of threshold-based filtering can be to remove low levels of nucleotide representations as a result of sequencing errors or to prioritize the depth of variation allowed in the consensus sequencean example of the effect of filtering based on nucleotide probability is shown in figure 7 in this example the ambiguity code assigned to the position was d because the position required representation for the existence of a t and c in the sample a sequencing error upper bound rate of 5 was determined and used as a threshold for filtering low prevalence nucleotide representations the necessity for a c representation was removed allowing the new ambiguity code to become a w representing a or t assuming the representation of c was a result of sequencing error the w ambiguity code is a more accurate representation of the allelic composition at that position for the sampleif deep sequencing is performed on a homogenous or clonal population then it is possible to estimate the average quality value qv that should have been assigned to each position independent of the quality values assigned by the sequencing technologys base caller this is useful for comparing the actual error rate to that of the base callers quality value for example to properly calibrate the sequencing qv or to set alternative thresholds of sequence quality based on actual acceptable error rates the standard formula for qv isqvi10 log10perrithe probability of an error perri is estimated for each position i asperri1maxpzatgcpxipthe probability of an error is defined as the probability of not attaining the most common allele if the empirically determined error rate is 0 then the qv is set to 40 ie 00001 errors per base if the coverage depth allows for the determination of error rates less than 00001 then a qv of greater than 40 is optionally permitted most base callers limit their maximum qv to 40 although there is no theoretical limitto compare or merge the positional nucleotide distributions across multiple profiles it is necessary to first perform a global profile alignment so that homologous nucleotide positions can be determined to demonstrate the profile alignment strategy based on using the major allele as a proxy 2900 sequences a sample size divisible by 2 4 and 10 were randomly sampled from the 2913 avian influenza mp segments that were available from genbank and multiple degrees of partitioning and merging were compared against the reference profile which was generated without any partitioning or merging the results of this experiment show the effect of partition size and count on both profile generation accuracy and compute timethe accuracy of the partition and merge strategy was measured and illustrated with the rmsd plot the split and merge of 2 4 and 10 partitions were plotted against the reference as seen in figure 8 most nucleotide distributions between merged profiles were identical to the reference with an rmsd value of 0 exceptions occurred around 450 bp a dinucleotide repeat and at the 5 and 3 ends where even the reference msa was questionable due to improper gapping the combination of lower sequencing quality towards the 3 end of sequences mismatching sequence lengths and short tandem repeats typically contribute to poor end msas overall the merging of profiles was accurate even across 10 partitionstiming statistics measuring the reduction of both serial and parallel compute times using this partition and merge strategy are laid out in table 2 parallel compute times were estimated as the sum of the parallel times for sequence alignment profile generation and profile merge the serial compute times used the sum of the serial times for the same 3 steps the parallel compute time for each step was estimated as the longest running job among partition compute times and the serial compute time was estimated as the sum of all partition compute times when the input sequences were split into 10 partitions serial and parallel speedup factors of 44x and 4135x were observed respectively with very little degradation of profile generation accuracydeep sequencing platforms such as 454 solexa and solid provide opportunities to explore genetic diversity of populations at much greater resolution than sanger sequencing development of quantitative and visual analyses of genome-wide variations are critical for identifying trends and assessing their biological significance figure 3 is an example of a root mean square deviation rmsd plot applied to a study of viral diversity using deep sequencing data that was generated from a series of coronavirus cov passages the coronavirus utilized in this study was engineered to produce a rapidly mutating phenotype viral rna from the 1st 5th and 10th passages was subjected to rt-pcr and amplicons were deeply sequenced with solexa 13 reads were mapped onto a sanger sequenced reference cov sequence genbank accession ay278741 using razers and a position profile was generated for each of the sequenced passages the approximate coverage depth for base positions ranged from 500x to 1000x there was significantly greater sequencing depth for positions covered by overlapping amplicons the rmsd plot was then generated based on the positional rmsd values computed between the position profiles for each of the passages and the reference the blue green and red glyphs represent variations from the 1st 5th and 10th passages respectively for each base position from the rmsd plot one can determine that the positional distributions of nucleotides have increasingly deviated from the reference with the association of annotation not presented an investigator can quickly determine which genes may have been impacted and focus on their analysesthe shannon entropy se plot was then generated to further investigate the variation within the sample of the cov population sequenced in the 10th passage figure 6 the se plot facilitates distinguishing which positions in the sequenced genomes have higher than background levels of variation most of the positions in the analyzed region from 25500 - 28000 bp have an se close to zero which would indicate that a single allele was dominant an se analysis over time may show se values for specific positions increase as the viral population began to adapt to growth in the cell culture and then decrease if an advantageous variation increasingly dominates in the population positions with consistently high se values over time may be experiencing little or no selective pressure for example in figure 6 the variation seen in the se plot was higher than the background in the region between 26000 and 26700 this region encompasses the envelope protein and membrane protein orfs of the cov this data may suggest to researchers that an experiment could be designed to investigate the role of these particular proteins to the covs adaptation to growth in cell culturea nucleotide conversion table was computed between the 1st and 10th passage on the same region of the cov genome that was analyzed for the rmsd and se plots table 3 this nucleotide conversion table summarizes the probability that a base in the 1st passage will change to another base by the 10th passage 1st passage nucleotides have been labeled for each row on the left of the table and 10th passage nucleotides have been labeled for each column at the top of the table for example there is a 047 probability that a g in the 1st passage will become an a by the 10th passage transition probabilities ag or ct which have been highlighted in bold tend to be greater than transversion probabilities from the table the probability of the transition from ga 047 is greater than the transversion probabilities for gt 008 or gc 006 however the at 024 and tg 035 transversions have higher rates than the ag 018 and tc 028 transitions this contributes additional evidence that there may be some selective pressure acting upon this region of the genome especially if these probabilities depart significantly from those computed for the entire length of the genome when using the same sequencing technologyestablishing a baseline for sequencing technology specific systematic sequencing errors is especially important for the nucleotide conversion analyses since these computed values are absolute rather than relative to another samples positional nucleotide distribution since every read contributes to the overall analysis rather than a vote towards a consensus sequence the impact of sequencing errors on individual reads must be considered most sequencing technologies either include a step to amplify the target dna or require quantities of dna which required the investigator to perform dna amplification a priori it has been estimated that pcr amplification will introduce an upper bound on sequence quality which is dependent on the fidelity of the polymerase excluding pcr slippage and mispriming taq dna polymerase has been demonstrated to produce error rates of at least 10-5 for base substitutions and 10-6 for frameshift errors 14 the application of the nucleotide distribution-based filtering tools an integral part of andes allows the user to define a threshold for differentiating between base conversions which may be significant versus those that should be attributed to sequencing or pcr errorsan important capability of andes is the ability to compute the summary distances between deep sequencing results to produce an n  n distance matrix when a large group of sequences can be partitioned for example temporally andes can be used to quantify the differences among each partition with the help of statistical cluster analyses tools partitions that contain the variations of interest can be identified as an example the hemagglutinin ha coding segments of human influenza a h1n1 sequences were downloaded from ncbi and were grouped according to the collection date that was annotated in their respective genbank records sequences were grouped into biweekly partitions when possible if the collection day was not available then the sequence was assigned to the partition with the same month with a null day for example if the collection date for a sample was june 2008 then the samples sequence would be assigned to the 2008-06-00 partition if the collection year was the only information recorded then the sequence would be assigned to a partition with a null month and a null day for example 2008-00-00 for each partition clustalw was used to align all the sequences within the partition and a position profile was generated a distance matrix was then generated by computing the summary rmsd value between every position profile and r the statistical software package was used to produce a dendrogram with the hclust function figure 9 as apparent from the dendrogram the human h1n1 samples that were collected from march to june 2009 have much greater sequence similarity than those collected from june 2008 to january 2009 this may be attributed to the sudden focus of h1n1 sequencing performed on potential swine origin viral samples that were collected starting march 2009 many other applications can be imagined for comparing position profiles across partitions for example investigating influenza diversity among different avian species or association of viral clades by geographic locationthe ability to analyze groups of similar sequences that have been objectively partitioned either spatially or temporally allows individual partitions of interest to be identified the underlying position profiles of these partitions can then be merged together to generate a new cumulative position profile from which a consensus sequence can be generated for downstream applications such as degenerate primer design for example suppose it was determined that the mutation rate for a circulating virus caused a percentage of previously designed primers to fail at an unacceptable level for high throughput sequencing over a period of 4 months by downloading sequences from genbank and building partitions of new sequences on a weekly basis an incrementally merged profile consisting of an arbitrarily defined time period extending into the past can be quickly generated after the merged profile has been converted into a consensus sequence with an appropriate threshold set to achieve the desired sensitivity the currently used primers can be tested in silico on the new consensus sequence to determine which regions will not have the minimum required coverage depth due to predicted primer failure new primers can then be designed on these regions based on the new consensus because all of the sequences are included in the cumulative position profile manual intervention is not necessary to decimate redundant sequences as a result it is possible to generate a consensus sequence that more closely represents the genotypes of the viral variants in circulation accurately and in a timely mannerto identify the nature of sequencing artifacts and how they may impact the analyses of a 16s metagenomic sample andes was applied to compute empirically-determined quality values on a set of 454 titanium sequencing runs these actual quality values were compared against those assigned by the 454 base caller or associated with sequence features such as homopolymer runs briefly a mock community consisting of 22 known microbial organisms from the phyla actinobacteria bacteroidetes deinococcus-thermus firmicutes and proteobacteria was established pcr amplification targeted 3 variable regions of the ribosomal 16s gene each approximately 500 bp in length pcr products were then sequenced using 454 titanium the resultant sequences were then analyzed using the blast algorithm 15 against the 16s reference database consisting only of the mock community in order to associate each sequence with an organism and 16s copy with the highest similarity for each organism 16s copy variable region combination a partition of sequences was created and amoscmp was used to align the partitioned sequences against the specific organism 16s copy variable region reference sequence a position profile was then generated based on the amoscmp results figure 10 is an example of the estimated quality values along one of the organism 16s copy variable region combination partitions the average coverage depth was 10514 the majority of positions had error rates of less than 1 in 100 qv  20 these average qvs were then compared against the average of qvs for each position assigned by the 454 base caller in order to determine how well 454 assigned quality values correlated to actual error rates further correlation analyses were also performed after aggregating by nucleotide type and length of homopolymer runs not shownthe results from the studies indicate that there was little correlation between empirically determined quality values and the 454 assigned quality values this suggests that many of the sequencing errors are unpredictable with current error models the consensus sequences from 454 assemblies are generally of high quality because the availability of coverage depth ameliorates the impact of random errors systematic errors such as those caused by homopolymer runs which cannot be addressed with additional sequencing depth are known and accepted to be a source of error that needs be addressed in downstream processing however the level of individual error rates cannot be dismissed if they are intended for downstream cluster analyses an important step prior to establishing operational taxonomic units otus an example of the frequency of errors along the length of an organism 16s copy variable region combination is shown in figure 10 this pattern of random error along the entire length of the alignment is consistent with the difficulties that have been observed when using individual 454 sequences to establish otus in order to estimate population diversity 16 contrary to initial supposition addressing errors from homopolymer runs alone is not sufficient to solving the problem of accurately establishing otus tools such as andes which allow an investigator to produce an accurate local and global view of deep sequencing results serves to make the identification of these trends more visible so they may eventually be addressed correctlyas discussed in the merging and comparing profiles subsection the alignment of two profiles uses the major allele for each positional distribution as the proxy for the alignment while this works well for most datasets that have been analyzed it would be preferable to use the rmsd distances between positions as actual mismatch penalties this would make the full nucleotide distribution at each position available for optimally determining whether introducing a gap or a substitution was more suitablethe increasing cost efficiency of deep sequencing provides us with a great opportunity for asking questions about and exploring the potentially complex structure of variations within an evolving nearly homogeneous population or a shared biomarker we have explored the application of the andes tool sets toward understanding mutation rates of a coronavirus aiding in the cluster analyses of seasonal versus swine origin h1n1 flu partitions and exploring the quality of a deep sequencing technology itself andes provides a useful tool set and a basis for the comparison of complex samples at the level of positional nucleotide distributions both visually and statistically these tools will help to

bam mrd lde designed and ran experiments and generated data kl wrote the manuscript all authors read and approved the submitted manuscriptcoronaviruses have been known to medicine for some time 1 but it is of course only very recently that the coronavirus sars-cov-2 the covid-19 virus new and dangerous to humans was identified it is believed to be related to an initial cluster of pneumonia cases associated with a seafood and fresh meat market in wuhan china 2 current case rates at the time of writing are close to one million with close to 60000 deaths the genomic relationships to other coronaviruses were quickly examined by lu et al to shed light on the origins epidemiology and receptor binding of the virus 2 on january 17th 2019 the wuhan isolate genbank entry mn9089473 replaced mn9089472 and mn9089473 probably represents an adequate stable description of the sequence for research into that strain isolate and was immediately investigated by the present author 34 originally it was seen by authorities as a coronavirus outbreak but not as sars severe acute respiratory syndrome however its genomic relationships examined in ref 34 also showed many fairly close correlations with the genomes of sars-cov in the previous human but not pandemic outbreaks and in pigs bats and civets and the emphasis was on finding subsequences that are well conserved across coronavirus strains and species the earliest patients suffering from what is now called covid-19 had overall 9998 genome sequence identity to the above wuhan isolate so that one may reasonably say that it is the origin of covid-19 and its virus sars-cov-2 2 the earlier wuhan isolates also related with 88 identity to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-like coronaviruses collected in 2018 in zhoushan china but differed more from sars-cov at about 79 and mers-cov at about 50 2 the wuhan and related isolates revealed a coronavirus that resides in the subgenus sarbecovirus of the genus betacoronavirus 2 and although genetically distinct from its predecessor sars-cov it appeared to have similar external binding proteins meaning here the spike glycoprotein discussed extensively in the present paper see section 13 below for introduction to this protein which also discusses some further early identified genomic correlations in addition the rest of this present paper discusses many other genomic relationships relevant to the design of synthetic vaccines and therapeutic antagonists againstcovid-19one problem is that covid-19 is a new pathogen posing a global threat and so presents new challenges both in primary prevention where a vaccine is required and in secondary prevention where a therapeutic compound ideally in a pill is required to treat patients who are infected it might also present challenges for tertiary prevention which seeks to remedy a persistent level of infection or to prevent recurrence even to essentially the same strain as discussed in section 12 a main problem of concern and a point of the present paper is the likely appearance of new strains with resistance to vaccines and therapeutic agents at the time of writing confirmed cases double globally every 6 days and undetected cases are expected to be much higher the current plateauing of reported cases in china offers a glimpse that this this should attenuate soon but estimates of how and when are varied with a significant portion of humanity already infected there is enhanced probability of successful escape mutations in the genome of the virus development of vaccines and perhaps particularly therapeutics that could but do not take account of this by targeting less variable protein regions could be a huge waste of resource and a dangerous delaycovid-19 is of course by far the most serious but not the first sars outbreak of concern to humans and coronaviruses have for decades been of veterinary concern 1 however it still remains true that zoonotic coronaviruses have only rather recently seriously impacted humans as far as is known they include sars-cov 2002 betacoronavirus subgenus sarbecovirus and mers-cov 2012 betacoronavirus subgenus merbecovirus although the idea that sars-cov-2 was distinct from sars-cov was originally discouraged distinction is here a matter of degree by usual criteria they are fairly closely related genetically clustering within betacoronavirus subgenus sarbecovirus until very recently sars-cov effectively sars-cov-1 was the primary reference point and model regarding molecular and functional details and it remains importantshortly after the appearance in genbank of the apparently final version of the wuhan seafood market isolate mn9089473 2 the present author compared a variety of coronavirus genomes 34 the krsfiedllfnkv protein subsequence was seen as a potential achilles heel because it is exposed or potentially exposable being required for proteolytic activation cleavage and importantly is also a well-conserved feature on the surface of the virus 34 being well conserved suggests that mutations are much less easily accepted meaning that the virus is less likely to survive more than one or two generations as discussed below the conservation is in a region of protein on the virus surface concerned with at least one step of lung cell entry interesting because coronaviruses seem to be able readily adjust to alternative means of entry possibly hinting at additional roles for the subsequence whether or not that is the case the above motif seems a likely primary target for synthetic vaccines and a basis for drug discovery and was proposed as such 34 it is a motif that was found to be quite well conserved even in more distantly related coronaviruses 34 and the present paper also explores how far that seems to extend it includes the common cold coronaviruses another potential subsequence of interest popular with researchers is also examined the ace2 binding domain discussed below but the above remains popular with the present author because of its relatively high degree of conservationat first glance of the three kinds of prevention tertiary prevention ie including trying to insure that the disease does not recur seems the least worrying in the present authors opinion however it relates to a specter that recently haunted covid-19 vaccine research and which might still cause some concerns this is the question of why there is no significant immunity acquired by the body to prevent recurrence of common cold of which up to roughly 30 of cases are believed to be due to coronaviruses fortunately at time of final writing of this paper news reports indicate that neutralizing antibodies can be found in patients who have had covid-19 however with the risks of escape mutations of the virus in mind it remains worthwhile considering whether the subsequence krsfiedllfnkv again found to be well conserved 34 across many coronaviruses 34 is still present in common cold coronavirus this is in order to force better immune response by targeting using synthetic or cloned vaccines with this epitope most common cold strains fall into one of two coronavirus serotypes oc43-like and 229e-like which are the main examples discussed below while the common cold is generally considered as mainly an upper respiratory tract infection and a mundane inconvenience common human coronaviruses betacoronavirus hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 as well as alphacoronavirus hcov-229e also cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in children and the elderly some discussion is also given to hcov-hku1 in this paperthe above motif krsfiedllfnkv occurs in the spike glycoprotein 4 responsible for initial binding of previous sars coronaviruses to lung cells and their activation of the spike protein by a proteolytic cleavage 5 6 7 the spike glycoprotein or just spike protein is the familiar spike that studs the surface of the coronavirus giving it the appearance of a crown to electron microscopy hence corona latin crown after the completion of the first version of the previous paper 3 a bat virus with 9741 identity of the amino acid sequence of the spike protein discussed extensively in the present paper was entered into genbank as entry qhr633001 as of the time of final writing this on april 2nd 2020 there is 100 match of this protein with entry yp0097243901 that appears to be a same or similar to the above wuhan isolate the top hundred non-redundant matching entries found using mn9089473 by blastp at httpsblastncbinlmnihgovblastcgi see below for mn9089473 spike protein used here vary from the above 100 match down to 7580 such as aau046461 which is a civet isolatein viruses proteins of a similar protruding nature eg the hemagglutinin of influenza a are primary targets for vaccine development and important targets for development of therapeutic drugs that seek to block the virus from infecting host cells at the time of the current project only the three dimensional structures of the sars-cov spike proteins of the earlier sars outbreak was known eg refs 8 which has only 7581 sequence match to sars-cov-2 3 note that it is customary to write sars-cov rather than sars-cov-1 rna viruses mutate with high frequency but so far the differences in spike proteins in emergent sars-cov-2 variants are much less at the time of the study in late february and early march 2020 the amino acid residue sequences of the spike proteins of covid-19 isolates from different states and countries such as california brazil taiwan and india remain identical or almost so for example with respect to the original wuhan isolate 2 phenylalanine f is replaced by cysteine c as residue 797 in a swedish isolate and alanine a is replaced by valine v as residue 990 in an indian isolate as of 21st march 2020 largest variants in the sars-cov-2 genome as a whole show 999 nucleotide sequence match which for a genome of 29858 rna bases suggests approximately 30 base changes and of the order of 5 in the spike glycoprotein gene of 3821 nucleotides that then suggests roughly 1 to 3 amino acid differences in the spike protein of current march 2020 sars-cov-2 variants consistent with the above more specific observations of isolates from california etc a single amino acid change can of course sometimes have significant effect eg on the aggressive character of a coronavirus and so be considered as creating a new strain some new strains are being reported at the time of writing but to the authors knowledge none of them are spike protein variations and more specifically none are as yet in the krsfiedllfnkv subsequencethe left hand side of fig 1
shows the sars-cov previous sars s1 spike glycoprotein within the trimer that makes up the spike the right hand side shows sars-cov-2 the sars of current concern all human sars coronaviruses and indeed the spike proteins of many other related coronaviruses appear similar in overall conformation and the variations seen in experimental structures are probably more to do with crystallization or other preparation methods particularly regarding solvent details and ligands sars-cov on the left has been well studied and still serves as the reference model in order to fuse with and infect cells the spike protein needs to be in an open state presumably the closed state makes it less vulnerable to antibodies on the left fig 1 also shows the approximate positions of the cleavage points superimposed on the protein data bank pdb entry 5xlr for sars-cov reading from the n-terminus of s1 the important functional elements of sars coronaviruses deduced from sars-cov studies 56 and applicable to sars-cov-2 are the s1 n-terminal domain s1-ntd the s1 c-terminal domain s1-ctd the s1s2 site as the first protease cleavage site as a loop between a pleated sheet and a-helix the fusion peptide fp associated with a highly disordered loop between two a-helices which contains the second cleavage site s2 and a heptad repeat hr the arginine r in the conserved motif krsfiedllfnkv that was of interest in the previous study 2 is the cleavage point in s2recall that the krsfiedllfnkv subsequence associated with s2 is potentially important not least because it must be exposed or exposable because it permits proteolytic cleavage and therefore the site cannot be well shielded the experimental three dimensional structures of coronavirus spike proteins do not for the most part reveal the large amount of glycosylation that protects most of the spike protein surface possibly the major problem however is not so much in the selection of accessible surface regions as a basis for design entry inhibitor and vaccine design 89 but that the coronavirus readily escapes from such agents by mutation including in the spike protein 1011 this is the further importance of being a highly conserved motif ie a subsequence that does not readily change from strain to strain except for a conservative sidechain replacement in more remote strains of course as one carries the study forward to more distantly related viruses one expects the motif to differ at some stage and this is investigated later below in contrast nonetheless the pigag motif associate with the s1s2 cleavage site disappears in coronaviruses that are not too distantly related 34 as noted above a high degree of conservation of krsfiedllfnkv in the face of genetic indicates that it is in some way important to the virus presumably for the proteolytic activation cleavage andor initial binding to lung cells but there could be other interactions with other proteins ie to reduce an inflammatory response as discussed later belowmodern computer-driven strategies and the kind of chemical products that they help produce differ substantially from the earlier and more familiar approaches in which the computer played little if any role in large part this is due to the invention of automatable peptide synthesis by merrifield in 1963 who used solid phase peptide synthesis based on crosslinked polystyrene beads 12 traditional vaccines are purely biological being composed of dead or attenuated strains of pathogen meaning mainly viruses and bacteria in contrast a synthetic vaccine is a vaccine consisting mainly of synthetic peptides but also sometimes carbohydrates often linked to a carrier protein to render it immunogenic such vaccines produced via chemical synthesis are safer because they do not involve cell-derived material or biological processes for production their purity can be controlled as in the case of classical drugs the worlds first synthetic vaccine was created in 1982 from diphtheria toxin by louis chedid scientist from the pasteur institute and michael sela from the weizmann institute in 1986 manuel elkin patarroyo created spf66 the first version of a synthetic vaccine for malaria primarily applications so far have been veterinary many early vaccines used dead samples of foot and mouth disease virus to inoculate animals but they caused real outbreaks scientists discovered that a vaccine could be made using only a single key protein from the virus and later also found that loops from the surface proteins could be cloned or used in cloned or synthetic constructs novartis vaccine and diagnostics among other companies developed a synthetic approach that very rapidly generates vaccine viruses from amino acid sequence data in order to be able to administer vaccinations early in a pandemic outbreaktraditional vaccines have so far remained the popular choice but during the h1n1 outbreak in 2009 they only became available in large quantities after the peak of human infections this was a learning experience for vaccine companies creating vaccines synthetically would be currently more expensive but has the ability to increase the speed of production and to retune and fine tune the solution to combat new variations in pathogens this is all especially important in the event of a pandemic synthetic vaccines are also considered to be safer by researchers than vaccines grown from eg eggs or from bacterial cultures in the latter case there may even be other viruses present cloned proteins can however reflect the same desirable principles regions of pathogen amino acid sequence acting as epitopes see below can be presented as loops at the surface of a cloned protein the general idea is that synthetic vaccines are freer of contaminants and focus on the essential features of the required immune response they can also be developed in a more logical step by step approach for example sometimes diagnostics are considered as a useful early step on the way to a vaccine since they are only required to raise antibodies in animals such as sheep for diagnostic kit production not to be safe in humans and also raise immune system memory and a cellular as well as antibody responsesynthetic vaccines also have the advantage that they can be seen as cartridge vaccines meaning that they contain bits and pieces that can readily be replaced by others to update the vaccine in order to combat new strains of pathogen a synthetic vaccine thus has several functional components looking somewhat like a swiss army knife under the electron microscope the key component reproduces the essential features of a pathogen protein that the immune system sees it is an epitope that typically means a patch of some 5 to 20 amino acid residues reproduced as a short peptide epitopes can be considered as haptens haptens are substances with a low molecular weight such as peptides small proteins and drug molecules that are generally not immunogenic and require the aid of a carrier protein to stimulate a response from the immune system in the form of antibody production there are two main types of epitope b and t discussed in theory section 2 a synthetic vaccine consists of t-epitopes as haptens for cell response and immune system memory molecular adjuvant eg muramyl dipeptide and possibly excitatory or anti-inhibitory peptides b-epitopes are good for raising antibodies in eg sheep to use in diagnosticsbiosensors all attached to or cloned into a carrier protein the latter must be safe but at the same time sufficiently different from any human protein to avoid autoimmune disease used extensively as a carrier protein in the production of antibodies for research biotechnology and therapeutic applications keyhole limpet hemocyanin klh is the most widely employed carrier protein and least for studies using laboratory animals for humans the food and drug authorities may have other preferences for carrier protein but klh illustrates the desired features its large size and numerous epitopes generate a substantial immune response and abundance of lysine residues for coupling haptens allows a high haptencarrier protein ratio increasing the likelihood of generating hapten-specific antibodies because klh is derived from the limpet a gastropod it is phylogenetically distant from mammalian proteins thus reducing false positives in immunologically-based research techniques in mammalian model organisms and clinically avoiding autoimmune effects so far the food and drug authorities do not seem to have favored synthetic vaccines for human use but this may be more to do with the peptides themselves than the carrier proteins available the earlier methods of peptide synthesis did not achieve high levels of purity however this has changed and quite elaborate peptides as well as proteins can be made facilitated by making peptide synthesizers run fast to avoid the slower side reactions and by methods that join shorter synthetic peptides into longer chains 43 44 45 46one of the original motivations for the present study was to capture experience and design strategies from vaccine diagnostic and antagonist design 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 methods by the author and colleagues ranged from the expert system approach to automated bioinformatics and protein modeling 26 27 28 29 and automated drug design eg ref 30 31 32 33 more recently there has been an automated approach based on the proposed q-uel language 34 35 36 37 the more fine-grained principles for the design of synthetic peptide vaccines and antagonist peptides made of d-amino acids are discussed in some detail in the previous paper 3 a variety of bioinformatics techniques are available to help in development of these solutions eg refs 38 39 40 41 as well as computational eg ref 42 and synthetic techniques eg ref 43 the q-uel language 33 34 35 36 37 used in the preceding work 3 is also a means of gathering relevant information from the world wide web efficiently when encountering a new problem such as an epidemic caused by a new virus or at least a problem new to the researcher 3437 it also enables more automated interaction with websites for publically available bioinformatics tools the motivation for this was all the stronger because the popular highly integrated approach to bioinformatics called the biology workbench at the university of san diego supercomputer center has been no longer available for some time 38 however the standard bioinformatics tools eg ref 39 40 41 used in the present study can of course be used readily by researchers reasonably experienced in bioinformaticsalthough peptidomimetics containing amino acids that would not occur in normal ribosome-based biosynthesis have been considered by authors as a basis for haptens in synthetic vaccines they are in the authors opinion probably best considered as potential therapeutic antagonists in the present study the specific aims include design of molecules to impede binding and activation of the spike glycoprotein at the surface of lung cells 5 6 7 synthetic peptides copied from subsequences in the spike protein could be used directly for such clinical purposes but then an important design step would be to render them resistant to biodegradation by human proteases this is typically by inclusion of d-amino acid residues 44 45 46previously in the authors personal opinion peptides and peptidiomimetics have been currently best considered as first steps in the research and development of small organic in a pill molecules of the traditional kind favored the by the pharmaceutical industry their role there nonetheless is a powerful one linking amino acid sequences seen in nature conveniently already designed by millions of years of evolution to typically smaller novel organic molecules designed to have van-der-waals and electrostatic features in the binding site however the authors reticence has been largely based on cost including cost in changing traditional production strategy and in the reservations of food and drug authorities but fairly recently all that appears to be changing thpdb httpcrddosddnetraghavathpdb includes an example of a manually curated repository of peptides and related molecules approved by the us food and drug administration fda over some 70 peptide drugs are approved in the us and other major markets and those in pipelines and in or approaching clinical trials may now be exceeding 200 entries as natural compounds peptide drugs are typically less toxic than more traditional chemical candidates although d-amino acids are not natural features of ribosomal production of peptides and proteins human metabolism can handle them they occur in gut microbes and ingested material and in human proteins they form spontaneously in a kind of aging process from some amino acids in situ in protein sequences eg l to d-aspartate diverse d-amino acids such as d-serine d-aspartate d-alanine and d-cysteine are found as free amino acids and small peptides as well as in some proteins and quite commonly in mammals they are often found having playing important roles in the nervous system for example n-methyl-d-aspartate nmda receptors are associated with learning and memory and d-serine d-aspartate and d-alanine bind to those receptors hydrogen sulfide generated from d-cysteine reduces disulfide bonds in receptors and potentiates their activity peptides made of d-amino acids resist not only normal proteolytic degradation but also resist an immune response unless attached to a carry protein 4446 they persist some 46 days in the body which is an ideal time period for pharmaceutical action and are ultimately degraded to safe products probably mainly in the peroxisomes and by enzymes in the kidneys 4446 the negative aspect is that they do have higher entropy to overcome than many drugs of more traditional form but in practice this appears to be more a barrier to computer simulation of binding than to the real molecule as extensively discussed belowstudying the binding of synthetic peptides or small organic molecules to human proteins benefits from computer simulations of the solute-solvent system and it was early found that these should ideally include water molecules in a detailed way because there are hydrogen bonding options between water molecules and amino acid residues which are not particularly intuitive 4748 in most cases the spatial locations of hydrogen atoms are deduced rather than seen in experimental protein and peptide three dimensional structures this is likely to impact considerations of docking ligands to protein targets in the present authors opinion this provides a beneficial possibility for retroinverso designs 3 made by reversing the sequence and using d-amino acids that has the unfortunate or complicating effect of interchanging the c

o and nh groups in the backbone of the synthetic peptide 3 the beneficial possibility is that for example a repulsive cooc electrostatic interaction between a synthetic peptide and the spike protein could be ameliorated in the manner cohoc where the h is a water serine or threonine hydrogen atom or by cohohoc albeit that in practice the water molecule likely lies more to the side of the oo interaction vector somewhat similar considerations apply to any nhhn interactions that can ameliorated by the lone pair orbitals of an oxygen atom both could also involve tautomerization andor rearrangement of internal hydrogen bonding networks eg in the manner  ohoh  to  hoho  today to take care of such matters researchers consider docking of ligand to protein and high grade molecular dynamics simulations of the overall solute-solvent system by molecular dynamics at least as the final refinement step 49 but even the awareness that the above compensations and others can take place can make it worthwhile to synthesize and test a proposal somewhat similarly design of peptide synthetic vaccines and diagnostics can make direct use of peptides duplicating sequence motifs in the pathogen protein found by bioinformatics and relatively simple computational tools after that researchers often go straight to synthesis and experimental immunological testing of the constructs rather than using complex simulations 50 51 52 epitope predictions for sars-cov-2 simply meaning the choice of amino acid residue subsequences to synthesize for synthetic vaccines but also for peptidomimetic antagonists have been made by several authors eg ref 53 they have typically made use of extensive historical experimental data about the amino acid residue sequences of epitopes such as the epitope database and analysis resource iedb and the virus pathogen resource vipr eg ref 53the immune system by its nature can make its own adjustments to recognize pathogens and vaccines but designing some kind of therapeutic antagonist against virus binding to the lung cells requires rather more consideration about what human protein the spike protein is binding bioinformatics as the study of biosequences is a powerful tool but it is well known that having the detailed three dimensional structure of the human protein target for a potential new pharmaceutical agent or to which a virus attaches is a great benefit to rational computer-aided design studies specifically investigating human protein binding and activation of previously known sars viruses have for some years been carried out by several groups eg refs 54 55 56 57 it seems reasonably well agreed that angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 ace2 is responsible for binding the sars associated with the 2002 outbreak combined with a proteolytic cleavage to activate the spike protein for which type ii transmembrane serine protease tmprss2 is the current popular candidate 3 several three dimensional structures are known for ace2 complexed with sars spike protein eg protein data bank pdb entry 6acg and of variants of the latter eg tmprss2 protein data bank entry 2oq5however the full story involving human cell surface proteins with which sars-cov-2 interacts in order to infect and replicate is possibly not quite as firmly established at the time of this present study as some summaries would suggest the origin of the general problem for a more detailed conformational chemistry approach is that diversity of genome and means of infecting cells are readily generated in nature in the case of different virus hosts virus strains and species jumps and it is long established that the binding shows variation in the receptors used that correspond to viral groups there have been alternative proposed candidates for initial binding receptors eg carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 ceacam1 and various dipeptidyl peptidases highly virulent coronaviruses that form syncytia between cells can even spread in a receptor-independent fashion even when an initial binding receptor such as ace2 is identified for a coronavirus initial uncertainty or enduring complexity for the rest of the entry process may be the norm many other human proteases present in the lung seem capable of cleaving various sites on the spike protein and which could cause its activation for example a variety of proteases such as trypsin tryptase clara mini-plasmin human airway trypsin-like protease hat and tmprss2 transmembrane protease serine 2 are known to cleave the glycoprotein hemagglutinin ha of influenza a viruses as prerequisite for the fusion between viral and host cell membranes and viral cell entry human airway trypsin like protease hat tmprss3 tmprss4 tmprss6 have also all been considered by sars researchers at various stages other human proteins that might have similar involvement to the above in the sars-cov-2 case and that are also affected by the same antagonists against the sars-cov-2 targets in the preceding paragraph have also attracted the attention of researchers the trypsin-like serine protease hepsin which has a fairly broad action and which is significantly inhibited by a diverse set of ligands a particular example of one such binding is represented by protein data bank entry 5ce1 even intracellular proteases could be released on cell damage resulting from the first wave of lung infection or from other disease or tissue trauma some variants and strains may use other as yet unknown proteins or sugars to assist entry it is also plausible the spike protein might be activated by other proteases on exit from the epithelial lung cells so allowing it efficiently to infect other cells the spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 also has the so-called furin cleavage sequence prrars or prrars which is an extension to the so-called pigag motif of ref 3 consistent with the present authors preferred choice of krsfiedllfnkv motif coronaviruses with high sequence homology such as that isolated from a bat in yunnan in 2013 lack the furin cleavage sequence nonetheless because furin proteases are abundant in the respiratory tract sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein might be cleaved on exit from cellseven if the means of binding activation and entry is well established for a viral strain recall that a single rna base difference resulting in a single amino acid residue difference could alter all that and there also appear to be several other possibilities that the virus can exploit in parallel indeed somewhat similarly potential inhibitors of sars entry andor activation proposed by researchers eg refs 58 59 60 may work by several routes in parallel and significantly at least three mechanisms were reported in one relevant study 60once a target protein and its relevant binding site are clearly understood methods are available for screening available ligands binding molecules to bind to those sites as potential antagonists or even for growing or evolving antagonist molecules in those sites whether smaller organic molecules 29 30 31 or peptides 32 pharmaceutical chemists have long used evidence and hunches to deduce a pharmacophore ie an abstract description of recurrent molecular features that are necessary for molecular recognition of the ligand by the protein 3 a pharmacophore ultimately implies at least a schematic model of the interfacial surface between ligand and protein but in practice a pharmacophore tends to be either considered from the perception of the ligand one compares similar inhibitors etc or from the perception of the binding site one compares positions of key residues in the binding site the choice depends on the quality of each kind of data but could involve both historically drug design was frequently based only on indirect deduction of binding site features using the chemical features of the ligands which successfully inhibit or in a few instances excite a response this is essentially the use of quantitative structure activity relationships qsar in effect the perception of the binding site was indirect and typically based on the chemists expertise and hunches and so often extremely fuzzy subsequent elucidation of many protein structures with clear pictures of their binding sites led to a crisper physical perspective exemplified by a study 49 that included many ligand molecules in the present investigation and so faced some similar issues in the approach which may now be considered traditional docking calculations are fast using grid maps that consist of a three dimensional lattice of regularly spaced points centered on some region of interest of the protein target under studyas discussed above ace2 and tmprss2 are very likely correct targets but again they are not necessarily the only targets even for cell entry of current sars-cov-2 and the mechanisms used by each new coronavirus strain can differ as the result of even a single amino acid residue change in such circumstances the conservation of the krsfiedllfnkv motif might be considered suspicious the activation cleavage is at the arginine r and workers tend to conclude that this site is more essential for action than s1s2 and mutation of the arginine r specifically inhibits trypsin-dependent fusion in both cellcell fusion and laboratory assays but also with the arginine retained many other proteases can active the spike protein as above and others can do so in laboratory conditions because of the conservation one might therefore hold the seemingly reasonable hypothesis that this site is not also susceptible to cleavage and activation by other extracellular proteolytic enzymes but also doing something else whether or not this is so all this complexity makes detailed interaction models of spike protein binding and activation difficult and while the best bet for ranking the choices of target protein may currently seem obvious making a reasonable currently conventional choice which is actually an incorrect assumption can delay productive research into therapeutic agents in the case of the hunt for prevention and cure of virus diseases and particularly covid-19 there seems to be increased justification for a fuzzier set-theoretic picture of a pharmacophore as an ensemble of different binding sites or of ligands in a ligand-oriented perspective as follows many of these and perhaps all suggest that even if one is using an incorrect picture of the mechanisms of entry and replication even using the wrong or less important protein target one might achieve some success in brief summary the justifications for the ensemble pharmacophore in the coronavirus case ie the contributions to fuzziness include parsimony that proteins and parts of proteins sometimes have more than one function 12 encouraged by limited numbers of accessible sites due to eg glycosylation and exemplified by parallel alternative mechanisms of cell entry multiple methods of drug action escape from scientific defense measures by virus mutation polymorphism of human proteins involved different expression levels of human proteins involved and the potential problem of the specter of vaccine development concerns about missing the appropriate region of the virus that allows common cold viruses to escape the appropriate immune response to the above may be of course added the fact that even if an experimental researcher is convinced of the value a specific protein as appropriate target the picture for the computational chemist is a fuzzy one the system itself real and simulated is to be seen as a statistical mechanical ensemble of multiple states sampled over the population of molecules and across their conformational behavior in time not least protein binding sites are often partially disordered before binding and in any case there may be several binding modes picking the right one can be difficult because there is a fine balance between solvent and conformational entropy and entropy is notoriously hard to compute 12given this argued uncertainty as to the nature of the target protein and its binding site a broader initial net as an ensemble pharmacophore can help docking approaches are continually being improved by researchers and recently include ways of combining features that could ultimately relate to different protein binding sites while many authors of these studies include the word ensemble in their discussion of pharmacophores they appeared to be significantly different to the particular means of combining multiple pharmacophores that was explored here however the present author has had his attention drawn to some that are rather similar and the approach of kumar 33 appears to particularly akin especially in regard to distributions of expected values and use of weighting kumars description 33 thus suffices and briefly stated it explores the ability of an ensemble of selected protein-ligand complexes to populate pharmacophore space in the ligand binding site assesses the importance of pharmacophore features using poisson statistical and information-theoretic entropy calculations and generates the pharmacophore models with high probabilities a scoring function then combines all the resultant high-scoring pharmacophore models there is one significant operational difference between kumars approach and that used here recall that in the more traditional docking approach it is the ligand as candidate drug that is typically seen as the variable and constantly changing and in many studies evolving the ligand chemistry with the pharmacophore is the basis of drug design 29 30 31 32 ref 49 related to the present study has aspects of that applied in a different way kumars approach can however combine the perspective of both pharmacophore and ligand as conceptual variables despite that the present authors approach as used in the present overall project considers one candidate ligand at a time this seems less efficient from the point of view of designing candidates and not even as smart as the older single non-probabilistic pharmacophore approaches 29 30 31 32 nonetheless a single simpler one-ligand-at-a-time strategy is both adequate and appropriate in the present case this is because there is already a data collection of candidate antagonists to build on 49 as discussed in section 17approaches of the ensemble pharmacophore kind are currently highly recommended for investigation of sars-cov-2 and for the spike protein in particular again because of some uncertainties and the likely multiple functions of some spike protein features however it has not as yet had significant impact in the present study the approach actually taken remains consistent in the sense that inclusion of one particular source for a pharmacophore an enzyme considered by the author was evidently going to dominate the ensemble because of certain similarities in the antagonists of sars virus entry and inhibitors of the enzyme 3 given the knowledge available at this time that choice is not however obvious as followswhat may be more controversial is the case when there is a representative choice and it is a protein that is not obviously relevant to the target protein or simply not on the radar of coronavirus researchers what makes it a candidate is not necessarily that it is relevant to viral infection and not necessarily that it has an evolutionary relationship to proteins that are considered relevant although this is a question addressed briefly in this paper rather it may simply be based on the pragmatic notion that there may be ligands potential binding molecules as antagonists which are common to both more popular choices human target proteins and a less obvious candidate the small organic molecule emodin has been found to inhibit sars coronavirus entry 5859 as also so have other compounds some of which have emodin-like features 360 similar molecules and importantly emodin itself are also inhibitors of 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 an example of a steroid binding enzyme 61 it is normally anchored within the endoplasmic reticulum through an n-terminal transmembrane domain its involvement as a protein target is here based on a chemical justification a biological justification might be that this enzyme is involved in the inflammation response which a coronavirus might also benefit by inhibiting if so the goal is not of course to help the virus by inhibiting at the same target which it would also gain by inhibiting but rather to inhibit protein targets more crucial to it ie for cell entry and possibly replication which are even more crucial to the virus some inhibition of 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 might even be a desirable thing because excessive or prolonged inflammation including in response to pathogens is well known to be potentially damaging to the host an excessive inappropriate immune response may also include the basis of allergic reactions and even of autoimmune diseasesa pragmatic reason for this choice of protein as pharmacophore is that was also one of those protein-ligand interaction systems that have been well studied by the present author and collaborators 49 such studies pursued the idea of using a more rigid molecular framework including the steroid framework and fragments of it as a more rigid scaffold for active drug groups 49 importantly that study and subsequent work has already established data base of compounds that bind to 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 and it includes many molecules including some discussed in this paper that again have some of the features of emodin it also includes many weak binders that could also be much stronger binders at what turns out to be a more obviously relevant protein target these issues can be addressed quickly in the laboratory and certainly seem worthy of investigation before addressing the more popular targetsthere was a further implication in the previous paper 3 though not a requirement for its main arguments that the peptides designed on the basis of the krsfiedllfnkv motif bind the same krsfiedllfnkv site as do emodin-like molecules that seems currently to be an even less reliable assumption than the assumption that the above steroid dehydrogenase enzyme is relevant to coronavirus biology and it is not of course an assumption that even matters if either a peptidomimetic andor small organic molecule is found effective however again keeping in mind that there are a limited number of accessible conserved sites in the spike protein and that these may be involved in multiple mechanisms as discussed above common targets for action of both peptides and smaller organics like emodin seems plausible partially the problem is extensive glycosylation it is well known that glycosylation plays an important role in receptor-ligand recognition but also have structural influence in receptor-ligand recognition because of its bulky shape caused by branched side chains for that and other reasons it may be that the krsfiedllfnkv site is with just a little variation almost the only site on the spike protein that is persistently recognizable in coronavirus strains and so presumably carrying out an important function and accessible as also discussed in this paper angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 binding is however also considered in this papera number of ideas and principles borrowed in established and recent design of synthetic vaccines and petidomimetics were used see ref 3 for discussion and eg ref 63 64 65 66 67 as well as some of the ideas that lie behind the popular zinc data base 68 as discussed in refs 34 the present investigation started as a use case for the hyperbolic dirac net hdn and particularly the associated q-uel language for automated inference 34 35 36 37 the theory has been discussed elsewhere eg in refs 34 35 36 37 which relate more to the practical and general uses of q-uel these considerations are less important here because present studies can be reproduced by standard bioinformatics and molecular modeling means nonetheless it is doubtful that the research for refs 34 could have been done and written up so rapidly without the aid of q-uel to interact with websites of the world wide web gather knowledge and facilitate use of the publically available bioinformatics tools 3the challenge is ultimately one of molecular recognition but in practice many key principles for hapten design relate to distinguishing types of naturally occurring epitope by the term epitope in this paper is meant continuous epitope though several smaller epitopes may be joined to represent a discontinuous epitope in which conformation and relative position in space can sometimes be important while a synthetic construct implies the use of synthetic chemistry typically combined with a judicious carrier protein to which the peptide is linked chemically constructs can also be obtained by cloning using protein engineering principles 12 the terms b-epitope and t-epitope relate to the traditional picture of a bone marrow b or thymus t response b cell epitopes occur at the surface of the protein against which an immune system response is required they are recognized by b cell receptors or antibodies in their native structure and are concerned with the bone marrow response and antibody production t epitopes may be buried inside protein structures and released by proteolysis and are traditionally considered as concerned with a cellular response and immune system memory ie active immunity continuous b cell epitope prediction is very similar to t cell epitope prediction the focus is on b-epitopes here though a b-epitope can also be or overlap with a t-epitope especially if it has a significant content of hydrophobic residues prediction of these has traditionally been based has mainly been based on the amino acid properties such as hydrophilicity charge exposed surface area and secondary structure there are many predictive algorithms available but the present author prefers a more expert system kind of approach that incudes experimental data though the above biophysical considerations certainly still play a strong role see belowthe previous paper 3 focused primarily on design of synthetic peptides as infection antagonists however partly for the reason of greater conformational flexibility discussed below smaller less flexible organic molecules ie with fewer rotatable bonds are the traditional province of the synthetic chemist rather than use of an automated peptide synthesizer are preferred for pharmaceutical application consideration of peptides is more often considered as merely a useful intermediate step in more traditional pharmaceutical compound design biodegradability per se of peptides is not the main concern since including d-amino acids in the design prevents proteolysis in preliminary docking and simulation studies the peptides do bind to 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 but less strongly and with several binding modes 3 this weaker binding is not in itself a contraindication of the idea that these peptides bind at the same site as the more rigid non-peptide molecules because it is an expected consequence of the much greater flexibility of peptides compared with molecules with for example multiple aromatic ring scaffolds conventional wisdom eg ref 12 frequently uses the rule-of-thumb that the total change in intramolecular bond rotational entropy of a peptide ligand is roughly tstotal  15 kcal mol1 per residue at 300 k corresponding approximately to a 12-fold reduction in conformational freedom per residue on binding because van der walls and hydrogen bonding tend to be very roughly equivalent for peptides in water and in well bound forms the water entropy effects known as hydrophobic effects along with electrostatic forces play an important role in determining the balance of energies and final outcome krsfiedllfnkv would thus cost about 195 kcalmol entropic contribution to bind rigidly primarily compensated by hydrophobic contacts at up to about 17 kcalmol in going from an aqueous to a non-polar environment ie 221 kcalmol for a 13 residue peptide or analogue of krsfiedllfnkv that example would not favor binding but the proper calculation is in the details which of should show balance that favors good binding if that is found to be the case experimentally despite the above comments the flexibility of peptides does provide more opportunities to fit a specific binding site ie they can show some accommodation and they are more tolerant to imperfections in the design process however this is also an argument for their importance as an intermediate step in the design of more conventional pharmaceutical agentsthe main methods are essentially standard bioinformatics approaches as used in ref 34 some methods eg rules for epitope prediction are best discussed in context in results section 4 the q-uel methods specifically for bioinformatics are discussed in ref 37 and those for computational chemistry and docking of compounds are those using krunch as described in ref 3 and the appendix to ref 49 they are somewhat unorthodox by focusing on heuristics to handle the multiple energy minimum problem but the end effect is probably similar to that of long runs using high grade molecular dynamics calculations given opportunities for calibration 49 epitope predictions lie in more traditional one dimensional bioinformatics and in this paper and the previous paper depended on predictions using a gor4 secondary structure prediction of -helix h extended chain or -sheet e and coil or loop c the reason for this and the particular use of gor4 is discussed in ref 3 but briefly it is in part because sections predicted by runs of c tend to be immunogenic even if they are incorrect as structure predictions 3 however charged residues in -helices and -sheets are believed to be occasionally b-epitopes and short sections extended chain can effectively imply loops the core and initial rules for b-epitope prediction used in the present study considerisurface exposure when a three dimension structure is known but allowing for conformational adjustment to expose residue when in a likely disordered or flexible loop scores 2iiknown exposure based on other kind experiment which also recognizes the possibility that a partially buried site by the above criteria can be brought to the surface on binding notably for proteolytic cleavage 3iiiruns of amino acid from the set stnqy score 1 from the set dekhr they score 2 and from the set livfcm they score 1ivruns of secondary structure prediction as coil or loop c though runs of three or less e and the first and last three of helix h can be considered as c for this purpose score 1 andvthe motif nxstx of asparagine n serine s or threonine t where x means not a proline p scores 2 however this will not permit a corresponding peptidomimetic or vaccine without considering glycopeptide synthesis technology see discussion below which would justify a negative score depending on the technology available
in addition these may be combined with predictions based on significant homology with proven epitopes in data bases which has already been done by several groups for sars-cov-19 eg ref 54for sources of data concerning covid-19 virus spike proteins genbank and the protein data bank were the main sources there was some use of in-house collections of data eg of typical b-epitopes and t-epitopes although publically available collections would probably serve the same function there was also use also of a data base of non-peptide ligand molecules of potential interest already generated during and since the work described in ref 49 that was used where appropriate many of these molecules including emodin are also found on the public zinc data base 69 as indicated in results section 4 below but several including derivatives of carbenoxelone are not and these derivatives are of interest as potential coronavirus antagonists to look up an entry on the zinc data base by the codes used in this and other papers one can go to httpzinc15dockingorgsubstancesand enter zinc00011032 in an automated approach such as that favored by q-uel a variable such as a perl variable mol to zinc00011032 and is set an the q-uel application goes to httpzinc15dockingorgsubstancessearchqmol any references to experimental binding results concern data from cited papers and see for example ref 68 for typical methods used for natural herbal compounds as discussed in ref 3 q-uel helped gather these in the form of q-uel knowledge representation tags so they become part of the growing knowledge representation storein regard to peptides and proteins table 1
used in ref 3 shows the standard iupac one-letter codes used for amino acid residues in sequences throughout this paperconservative replacements are those common substitutions from a peptide design perspective but for example phenylalanine f isoleucine i and alanine a are seen as natural substitutions that appear in discussion of spike protein sequence motifs later below these amino acid residues have hydrophobic sidechains but they are not conservative replacements but rather substantially different size a reasonable explanation is of course that sidechain size conservation matters less when the sidechains are at exposed at the surface of the protein similar notions underlie the idea that what can readily replace what is not always an equal probability in each direction in that respect table 1 tends to reflect the changes that are used in the present project for design when starting from epitopesthe previous paper 3 should not give the impression that the specific motifs discussed and particularly krsfiedllfnkv are the only sections likely of the sars-cov-2 spike protein to be of interest in the above respect the preference for one choice was based on a conservation across many strains suggesting that the site has an important function and is likely at the spike surface and b avoiding the shielding of the spike protein by extensive glycosylation the dramatic effect of relaxing these restrictions is a major point of this section in which a large number of candidates are found over-prediction is not necessarily a bad thing because once a laboratory has a peptide synthesizer and other tools for constructing and testing designs it is relatively easy and cheap to test and reject ideas and more problematic to miss opportunities the intention here is also to cover most possibilities to enable index numbers to be assigned to them according to their order in the sequence putative epitope 1 etc consequently in future one may then readily refer to the index number or speak of a new proposal or experimental epitope extending overlapping or even lying between two of these epitopes they are primarily to be seen as b-epitope predictions though they are favored if some t-epitopic character is also expectedan initial step is based on adding up weights as described in methods section 32 in practice there was also some judicious use of expertise and an epitope data base in an attempt to refine assignments recall that the trimeric sars coronavirus sars-cov spike glycoprotein consists of three s1s2 heterodimers some of these will be shielded by that configuration during most of the life cycle of the virus but not necessarily in every s protein monomer and also shielded by glycosylation the higher scoring predicted epitopes in the sequence below are underlined and in bold and are primarily to be considered as b-epitopes but with some extension to include t-epitope character where possible also included in these predictions are those using the immune epitope database and analysis resource iedb and the virus pathogen resource vipr which have already been made 54 see later below these are shown in underlined bold and in italics in the following and since some are contiguous sections that look like a single long representation in the following they are also stated separately below it is apparent that while focus was on just krsfiedllfnkv if strain variation and glycosylation are ignored then much of the spike protein sequence contains epitope candidates
many of the epitopes predicted in the present study overlap with prediction made using the immune epitope database and analysis resource iedb and the virus pathogen resource vipr 54 and these comprised the following1davdcaldplsetkctlks ftvekgiyqtsn2vcgpkkstnlvknkcvnfnfngltgtgvltesnkkflpfqqfgrdiadttdavrdp3qtleilditpcsfggvsvigtntsnqvavlyqdvnctevpvaihadqltptwrvystgs4fsqilpdpskpskrsfie5fgagaalqipfamqmayrfngi
recall that one of the reasons for the original single preferred candidate krsfiedllfnkv was that many of predicted epitopes contain evidence of glycosylation reflecting the last of the rules v in methods section 31 above that rule has however a special status and the present author has tended to consider them undesirable for synthetic vaccine or diagnostic development it indicates likely glycosylation of the protein the bulky oligosaccharides so attached can be immunogenic but they are rather difficult to work with synthetically traditionally expected to make bulk production expensive and may be variable in structure which cannot typically be seen in detail in experimental three dimensional protein structures typically as obtained by x-ray crystallography or high grade electron microscopy antibodies that are raised against the glycosylated surface patch of the protein or corresponding synthetic glycopeptides may be specific for their carbohydrate units these can be recognized irrespective of the peptides or in the context of the adjacent amino acid residues conformation and exposure of b-peptide epitopes of glycoproteins may be modulated by glycosylation because of intramolecular carbohydrate-protein interactions the beneficial versus undesirable effects of glycosylation in synthetic vaccines is also a complex matter glycosylation may be essential for reactivity with the antibody but conversely it may in effect inactivate the capabilities of a section of amino acid sequence to function as a b-epitope which seems to be a very good reason for giving the glycosylation motif a strong negative rather than positive score unfortunately this will depend on the structure of the antigenic site and antibody fine specificity and the recognition mechanisms involved are not fully clear there is a usually positive aspect however in the current view that similar effects of glycosylation apply to t-cell-dependent cellular immune and igg antibody responses and that glycosylated peptides can elicit glycopeptide-specific t cell clones after being bound and presented by mhc class i or ii molecules it is of course only a positive aspect if the intended effect is obtained by the synthetic constructthe overall spike glycoprotein protein sequence shown above changes across the coronaviruses but the krsfiedllfnkv subsequence is most notable amongst the exceptions it extends to the common cold coronaviruses with minor variation and may imply a better targeted approach to stimulate immunity for common colds caused by the rhinovirus recent research suggests misdirection of antibody responses against a non-protective epitope as a mechanism how the virus escapes immunity and so permits recurrent infections 71 a clearer understanding of conserved subsequences in coronaviruses may also help tune the action of toll-like receptors to initiate the appropriate response these are a class of proteins that play a key role in the innate immune system they are single-pass membrane-spanning receptors usually expressed on sentinel cells eg macrophages and dendritic cells that recognize structurally conserved molecular features of pathogens 72despite concerns about two or more strains of covid-19 virus appearing these are not big changes for present purposes it is sufficient to consider the sequence of the original wuhan isolate as reference in comparisons for present purposes ie for comparing the spike protein sequences of other coronaviruses recall that as discussed in introduction section 13 at the time of the study in late february and early march 2020 the sequences of the spike proteins of covid-19 isolates from different states and countries such as california brazil taiwan and india remain identical or almost so for example with respect to the original wuhan isolate 2 phenylalanine f is replaced by cysteine c as residue 797 in a swedish isolate and alanine a is replaced by valine v as residue 990 in an indian isolate neither of these relate to the sequence motif krsfiedllfnkv of particular interest herein the initial studies 34 the genome of the common cold coronavirus and particularly the sequence of the spike protein was considered sufficiently far from that of the covid-19 virus so as to be less relevant to that problem while looking at differing sequences is essential for detection of conserved motifs very different and less relevant pathogens are unlikely to preserve them except perhaps as pattern matches involving quite complex substitution rules however the appearance of the covid-19 krsfiedllfnkv motif does appear in common cold coronaviruses and with typically at most two relatively conservative substitutions that is in the sense of preserving hydrophobic sidechain as discussed above in methods section 3 the conservative aspartate d and asparagine n replacement is also fairly common in the motif in the sequences examined an example shown below is a clustal omega alignment of the covid-19 virus spike protein original wuhan seafood market isolate genbank entry mn9089473 with spike proteins representatives members of the two major common cold coronaviruses strains 229e and oc43 genbank entries np0735511 and aiv419871 despite radical sequence differences for the spike protein sequences overall only 128 identity well within the range for a random match the underlined sequence motif krsfiedllfnkv of covid-19 virus is essentially retained as that sequence except that alanine a replaces phenylalanine f in the common cold coronavirus which is moderately conservative at the surface of a protein and a conservative leucine for valine substation in one case in the sequence not shown of hcov-hku1 which is often associated with more serious cases of cold-like diseases the above motif is still noticeable as rsffedllfdkv in which the isoleucine i is replaced by phenylalanine f the a for f modified motif rsaiedllfdkv is also found in the coronaviruses of dogs cats rodents pigs rabbits camels ferret badgers raccoon dogs amongst others all of these might be eaten by humans in certain countries and notably they are for the most part species that live in close proximity to humans
the pigag motif does not show up in the above alignment as is also the case in many other distantly related coronaviruses 34 however there is a subsequence pigtnyrscestt in the hcov-hku1 spike protein that appears to relate to pigagicasyqtq in the covid-19 virus recall that hcov-hku1 is a common cold virus albeit usually associated with more severe lower respiratory tract cases in contrast not only does the krsfiedllfnkv motif stand out as potentially important to the covid-9 virus by virtue of such comparisons but also a match with that motif is almost the only continuous stretch of amino acid residues in most alignments like that above the subsequence kwpwyiwl is an exception that is of interest and a characteristic feature of many sars coronaviruses it is not however considered further in the present paper except to note that it does not appear to be associated with a covid-19 virus spike protein proteolytic cleavage site these sites are most prominently
as one looks out to more distant relatives there are a number of variations in the krsfiedllfnkv motif which despite large variations in spike protein sequence as a whole are still recognizable in the spike proteins of coronaviruses of diverse various host species as shown for some examples in table 2
 the most noticeable variation is the occasional substitution of the cleavage point arginine r by a g rather than disrupt the possibility of cleavage however it is seemingly displacing that role to a arginine r or lysine k that lies to the n-terminal left side of the motif it is interesting that this commonly retains firmly the iedllf core of the motifthe notion that the krsfiedllfnkv motif overall plays an important role and presumably a common or similar function across at least a very large number of known coronaviruses still seems a reasonable one most important of course is that it is at least the case for the sars-cov-19 virus and its near relatives at this time no match with a coronavirus in genebank has been detected by the author by blast-p using queries with no phenylalanine f eg rsaiedllldkv rsaiedllidkv rsaiedlladkv rsaiedllmdkv rsaiedllwdkv and rsaiedllydkv as queries but the search has not been exhaustive because it would not be too contradictory to any of the current hypotheses if some were found in the group with the inserted glycine g replacement of initial argine r by the similar positively charged lysine k is common however as long as the motif is significantly recognizable no histidine h as opposed to initial arginine r has been foundthe motif cannot extend to other strains indefinitely as recognizable because at some point the evolutionary tree will bring up virus and hosts subject to quite different selective pressures and the motif is not the definition of coronaviruses however it still persists as recognizable in birds such as duck eg genbank kx266757 kc119407 white-eye bird cov hku nc016991 magpie-robin shama cov hku18 nc016993 strains a selction which spans a large range of coronavirus genome sizes see the alignments below compared with the wuhan seafood market isolate genbank mn9089473 showing the motif underlined and in bold
some indication of the limit of the survival of the motif rsfiedllfnkv as the researcher departs from sars-cov-19 might be given by the nidoviruses other than coronaviruses somewhat coronavirus-like nidoviruses are common as eg reptile viruses the order nidovirales contains enveloped positive-strand rna viruses with the largest known rna genomes nidoviruses have been identified in snakes they appear to be most closely related to coronavirus subfamily torovirinae and might be best represented as a genus in this subfamily sequences suggestive of rsfiedllfnkv eg knfidlllagf do occur in genomes such as the ball python genome but these really lie beyond the limit of serious detection for example clustal omega gives 18 exact match between the wuhan isolate and spike protein nidovirus 1 of the reptile shingleback but the motif is barely recognizable
including fish nidovirus of the pacific salmon genbank qeg082391 is notable here because it supports the above alignment because it is preserved but gtlywldy of the salmon nidovirus is far from krsfiedl and the nearest preceding plausible cleavage point is an arginine r 10 residues in the n-terminal direction to the left however a similar occurs in some mammalian coronaviruses and so that residue may still play a similar role as an activation cleavage
looking for similar motifs in human proteins has a somewhat different motive it makes sense in that if there is significant match with subsequences they might represent features of proteins to which both the spike protein and other human proteins may bind irrespective of any other justification for commonality even if coincidental as epitopes similar to those in a proposed synthetic vaccine they are always of possible interest in assessing the risk of cross-reaction and inducing autoimmunity in synthetic vaccine designs and on certain occasion with peptidomimetics that induce an immune response perhaps by a binding strongly to a human protein that the designer did not intend as discussed in ref 3 there is a motif match at 56 identity with 77 coverage is with tumor protein d55 isoform 2 homo sapiens id np0010018742 and similarly with tumor protein d52-like 3 homo sapiens id aah337921 next match is in regard to neprilsyn entries at only 56 match and 55 coverage none of these are sufficient close of concern regarding induction of an autoimmune response some fairly close matches of krsfiedllfnkv and of the a for f modified motif rsaiedllfdkv have come to light that might plausibly have a biological significance if supported by biological relevance but are more likely to be random matches selecting only for human proteins hits vary from 100 cover with 50 identity to 62 cover with 92 identity these hits cannot be considered significant for peptides of this length in isolation from other evidence however a few seem worth recording for future reference in regard a potential biological function for the virus as already noted 3 rrsfidelafgrg a section of a human semaphorin genbank np0012432761 produced in response to lung disorders running rsaiedllfdkv itself in blastp generates 100 coronavirus hits rnareellfd is found in human mhc class ii antigen genbank axn555881 rnareellfd is found in human immunoglobulin heavy chain junction region genbank mcg496331 dllfekv is found in human tubulin gamma complex associated protein 6 isoform crad genbank eaw735101 e3 is of interest with 75 identity 87 matches for sfleellfin khksfleellf in ubiquitin the cellular e3 ubiquitin ligase ring-finger and chy zinc-finger domain-containing 1 rchy1 have been identified as interacting partners of the viral sars-unique domain sud and papain-like protease plpro with the involvement of cellular p53 as antagonist of coronaviral replication down-regulation of p53 is a major player in antiviral innate immunity 72 again however these matches remain tenuous genbank has of the order of 02 billion nucleic acid sequences but a 13 residue peptide can have 81920000 billion sequenceswhile the krsfiedllfnkv motif remains favored by the author as a target at this time identifying the amino acid residues in ace2 and the spike protein is important it may for example involve conserved residues that are not together in a continuous sequence while a conserved run of amino acid residues is sufficient to be on the list of candidates for an important site important sites are not necessarily conserved runs of amino acid residues here is shown that there is some conservation but significant variation compared with rsfiedllfnkv subsequences rsfiedllfnkv and pigagicasy  r discussed in ref 3 as motifs associated with activation cleavage sites do not lie in the receptor ace2 binding domain of the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein the relationships between the whole spike protein and the receptor binding domains in pdb entries 6m17 and pdb 6vw1 are shown in the alignment below note that the above receptor binding domain precedes the above motifs in the sequence a three dimensional perspective is required for an appreciation of the important sequence features in fig 2
 the pdb 6vw1 binding domain is on the right bound to ace2 on the leftof course not all the receptor binding domain is interacting intimately with ace2 the sections of the receptor binding domain that do interact with ace2 are also shown underlined to facilitate deeper analysis the loops on the spike protein receptor binding domain were initially classified as loops abcde and f in order of visual perspective then joined into three subsequences 1 2 3 that contain these loops the part of the spike glycoprotein sequence that represents the receptor ace2 binding domain can be shown by considering the proteins used in the two structural determinations 6m17 and 6vw1 in the protein data bank shown below in an alignment made using clustal omega alignment note that the above receptor binding domain precedes the above motifs in the sequence
the amino acids residues in bold and underlined font are the subsequences of ace2 that interact with the above spike protein ace2 binding domain loops which are indicated above each subsequence these include some longer range electrostatic interactions and potential solvent effects those also in italics dkfnheaedlfy

dkfnheaedlfy and kgdfr have particularly strong interactions
as a reference perspective the full sequence for ace2 as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 isoform x1 homo sapiens genbank entry xp0115438511 is as follows the part in the three dimensional structure above is in bold underlined font
note that at least in these particular experimental structures there is an involvement of glycosylation-like molecules for example in 6vw1 there are well localized n-acetyl-d-glucosamine -d-mannose and 12-ethanediol molecules that make significant interactions in a glue-like manner and essentially glue around the edges however there no obvious indication of involvement of glycosylation in the main interior interaction face of the complex the intimate interactions are protein-protein ie between amino acid residuesprimarily but not solely ace2 and spike glycoprotein association involves interaction between the bent -helix residues 1954 stiee  nyntn of ace2 and an extended chain configuration effectively a stretched loop that runs from residue 485500 gfncy  ygqpt of the spike glycoprotein and involves or ends in loops 3a 3b and 3f in the case of ace2 interacting with the ace2 binding domain of the spike glycoprotein one could in principle imagine blocking the ace2 as receptor with a mimic of the spike protein surface or blocking the receptor binding site of the spike glycoprotein protein with a mimic of the ace2 receptor surface in other kinds of infection the former is usually considered more plausible but the latter would not interfere with normal function of ace2 and it is of course essentially the way in which immune system and notably antibodies work possibly the main argument against this second choice it is that it is essentially equivalent to using antibodies raised against the spike protein ie in effect passive immunization 
at the time of final writing various news articles are drawing attention to potential use of the upper sequence or parts of it which is that of the -helix of ace2 for example httpsscitechdailycommit-chemists-have-developed-a-peptide-that-could-block-covid-19 in the above alignment the helix contains 35 residues and the extended chain below contains 16 they have similar length as is as expected for such structures an -helix has a rise of 15  per residue along its axis and there are in typical protein helices with turn variations that imply up to 20  the -strand or a similar extended chain in the spike glycoprotein that interacts with it has a rise of circa 35  per residue this general geometry naturally puts the two sequences above in roughly the one-to-one spatial correspondence shown note that this is not intended to be a sequence match representation these chains have to interact in that respect there is a lack of charged residues acidic and basic sidechains in the extended chain of the spike glycoprotein in structure 6vw1 although an aspartic acid d replaces the serine s in some strains arginine r replaces asparagine n in others and so on eg see blastp alignments later below a detailed backbone view is confusingly cluttered but one may identify residues that interact at the boundary between ace2 and spike protein all sidechains in the above spike protein subsequence gfncyfplqsygfqpt either make close contact or are likely to have some influence at the interface it is perhaps useful to have the initial mental picture that very roughly speaking the planes of the peptide groups are tangential to the above -helix surface rather than constituting an extended chain that makes an edge-on approach as even fig 2 suffice to makes clear however the extended chain like any so-called extended chain in proteins in practice is essentially a visible helix of larger pitch resembling a very stretched-out -helix and is itself slightly supercoiled to wrap around the ace2 -helix in this case this tends to follow the elbow or bend in the -helix staying roughly parallel to the local axis of the -helix so as to make intimate contact overallif gfncyfplqsygfqpt is to be use as an epitope analogue the cysteine c may be tested as a convenient linker to a carrier protein otherwise replaced by serine s as a close analogue as far as peptide antagonists are concerned the difficulty with using the above sequences stiee  and gfncy  is that they are readily degraded by host proteases this would not occur if the peptide is made entirely of d-amino-acid restudies a retro-inverso peptide 346 is made up of d-amino acids in a reversed sequence to the subsequence which is seeks to mimic and in the extended conformation assumes a side chain topology similar to that of the original native peptide but with backbone nh and carbonyl co groups interchangednh3-dextro-nwsalssqyfldeaehnfkdlftkaqeeits -coo

these are peptidomimetics of the subsequences sequences stiee  in ace2 and gfncy   in the spike glycoprotein respectively the cysteine c in  cnfg in the second molecule may be a convenient linker for an epitope for a vaccine but should be replaced by serine s in an antagonist recall that the problem of having the backbone amide nh and carbonyl co groups interchanged is that if in the original section of backbone being mimicked any nh and co groups form a hydrogen bond with recipient and donor groups in the protein those hydrogen bonds are now disrupted in the intended competitive antagonsist eg they would be unstable nhhn or cooc interactions it would thus seem a significant advantage in using the ace2 mimic because that is essentially an -helix which uses up its backbone amide and carbonyl groups however retro-inverso -helices are not typically found in the areas that have shown some degree of success 47 such as antigenic mimicry it would nonetheless seem to be of value to test both of the retro-inverso peptides in laboratory studiesas to developing the above further both as the basis of a synthetic vaccine or as a peptidomimetic and as to the worth of extending the studies to small organic drug molecules everything in the above depends on the extent to which gfncyfplqsygfqpt can produce escape mutations which might soon rend such solutions useless as in the previous paper we can relate this to variations of the above sequence bother in closer and much more distant relatives as the following shows using blastp we do not have to go very far from sars-cov-2 to find matches with only part of this sequence coverage and differences within that area of partial matchin the original wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate wuhan-hu-1 genbank id mn9089473 the subsequence in this regions is fncyfplqsygf and the following are examples of coverage as found by blastp
the last of the above blastp at httpsblastncbinlmnihgovblastcgi match results differs in total alignment by clustal omega at httpswwwebiacuktoolsmsaclustalo as follows but of course this illustrates the high degree of variation that occurs as one proceeds on to coronaviruses less related to the wuhan seafood market isolate that is believed to be associated with the origin of covid-19
for completeness note that the alignment obtained in the region that blastp indicated is as follows
phenylalanine f commonly immediately precedes many of these matching subsequences ncyfp ncywp etc and the conservative substitution tryptophan w substitution for the second phenylalanine f is also very common so it may be worth noting that fnctwp is a subsequence in the mammalian vomeronasal type-2 receptor 1 on sensory cells within the main nasal chamber that detects heavy moisture-borne odor particles and fnctwp is also found in in dynein many viruses require the minus-enddirected dynein motor complex transport on microtubules from cell surface toward the nucleus and dynein in addition to kinesins for the transport toward the plasma membrane however a direct connection to viral infection while tempting is far from obvious as to any mechanistic or evolutionary explanation also dynein nuclear shuttle transport may be less relevant to the coronavirus an rna virus but certainly rna viruses can rely on the dynein system eg hanta virus uses it for endoplasmic reticulum-golgi intermediate compartment at very least the above illustrates the kinds of further perhaps immediately less obvious functions that the above ace2 binding domain of the spike glycoprotein and the above motif might havewithin the coronaviruses there is some degree of conservation that suggests that ncywplndygf is a segment for the virus to conserve and a hint that fnctwpgf is the key part but there are soon very clearly significant variations across coronaviruses of different hosts as we depart from the wuhan seafood market isolate compared with the rsfiedllfnkv motif in the s2 cleavage regions 3 small organic drugs design to mimic this section or simply designed to designed to antagonize ace2 binding are thus potentially susceptible to escape mutations ie rapid appearance of drug resistance11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 which is inhibited by emodin was an interim model pharmacophore of choice 3 at this point in the development of the argument for optimal targets for vaccines and therapeutic antagonists the above target fits in as follows while the above regarding ace2 binding must be kept in mind for antagonist development as noted above the motif is not well conserved and so could be prone to development of escape mutations ie acquired resistance to vaccines and therapeutic antagonists because of the dominant theme of an ace2 -helix interacting with an extended chain loop of the spike glycoprotein the structure of the interaction region is fairly easy to deduce for various sars strains and there was as yet no obvious strongly recurrent theme of significant conserved residues that are discontinuous ie not together in the same subsequence that could be interacting closely with ace2 at the same time while emodin appears to act at the ace2 binding site 58 it remains of interest because there are complexities 5960 as discussed in introduction section 16 notably the ace2 binding domain of the spike protein and the binding sequence discussed above might bind other human proteins and might have other functions that emodin and related compounds related in the sense that they are at least consistent with pharmacophore features might inhibit a priori the binding properties of emodin and the choice of 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 as model pharmacophore could equally relate to the rsfiedllfnkv site or some other site or a mix of several the case for interaction vomeronasal type-2 receptor 1 and dynein discussed above was at best marginal but these examples illustrated the diversity other kinds of functions important to the virus that might apply in any event any relations between emodin and similar and potentially related molecules remains of interest to impeding sars-cov-2 entry and the worse casualty would be the continuity of the story developed above which is intended to illustrate a flow of reasoning in using the standard tools of bioinformatics11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 is interesting as accommodating a great variety of ligands at the steroid binding site but not without a degree of specificity as to general features of the ligands and so far these resemble those of potential sars-cov-2 therapeutics keeping in mind the refutation principle 3 that a pharmacophore or contribution to a pharmacophore ensemble the dehydrogenase is worthy of use until a new ligand or other information proves otherwise so far pharmacophore validation here ie a demonstration that it is a suitable pharmacophore model until proven otherwise has been based circumstantially on emodin and compounds looking chemically similar to it that are known in practice or argued theoretically to interact with sars virus entry in some way and bind at least weakly experimentally or computationally to 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 3 a review of compounds that are known experimentally to inhibit the dehydrogenase and known experimentally inhibit coronavirus entry replication and maturation is being prepared however validation is also extensively based on a weaker but larger body of preliminary binding studies involving a variety of antagonists of coronavirus infection and very often other kinds of virus infection that also bind at least very weakly to the dehydrogenase see discussion on very weakly below most of these emodin-like and otherwise were first found by q-uel knowledge gathering tools as used in the initial coronavirus study 3 combined with very early candidate selection rules based on estimates of the mean binding strength of groups when binding well note that a hydrogen bond worth about 4 kcalmol is nonetheless effectively zero when binding well because it is relative to binding to water in contrast aromatic and large aliphatic and are worth circa 3 kcalmol due to hydrophobic interactions which depend on being considered relative to water there are more complex electrostatic and intramolecular entropic considerations beyond present scope noting that at least preliminary study of the interaction with 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 is the arbitrator weak and very weak candidates are also considered because there may be multiple binding modes that will take a great deal of computer time to explore but which could yield lower binding fre energiesthis produces a fairly mixed bag of compounds based on the argument that viruses and coronavirus in particular may use each of its limited number of exposed or exposable sites for several purposes and the coronavirus seems to be able to readily adjust to new mechanisms under the selective pressure of drugs and vaccines the details of these molecules and studies are the subject of a further paper that will also discuss some interesting unifying themes briefly they include many names as hoped-for drugs against the coronavirus that appear in the news and internet discussion it is convenient to see them as dividing into three classesiquinone-like a quinone is any of a class of aromatic compounds having two carbonyl or ketone co functional groups in the same six-membered ring though in quinone-like the author includes include many compounds resembling steroid fragments that may have many or just one carbonyl groups and several rings this group includes 910-anthraquinone and derivatives that relate to many important drugs some with suggestive laxative and antiinflammatory functions collectively called anthracenediones they include ubiquinone as coenzyme q and various shorter aliphatic chain forms hydroxyl-decyl-ubiquinone and shorter aliphatic chain forms laxatives such as dantron emodin and aloe emodin and some of the senna glycosides antimalarials such as rufigallol antineoplastics used in the treatment of cancer such as mitoxantrone pixantrone and the anthracyclines caution is reuired in reading this list as a list of potential therapeutics because anthraquinone derivatives rhein aloe emodin or anthrone that lacks the methyl group parietin physcion to some extent emodin itself and chrysophanol extracted from cassia occidentalis are toxic and known to cause hepatomyoencephalopathy in children it is a medical term effectively defined to cover lethargy jaundice and altered senses of children in india after consumption of cassia seedsiisteroid-like this group includes some plant steroid-like compounds such as carbenoxolone itself from liquorish licorice and others found in soy and sprouts17-estradiol the endogenous ligand responsible for the growth and development of many tissues diethylstilbestrol a synthetic estrogen 7-methyl-benzaanthracene-39-diol a possible natural product from a common polyaromatic hydrocarbon is also of interest this group resembles group i but the concern for this group ii is that molecules like emodin that are known to antagonize viral or other infections are generally smaller so it possible that a more relevant pharmacophore would sterically exclude a large steroid-like ringiiiquinine-like these should not be confused with quinone-like quinine is an alkaloid derived from cinchona bark used to treat malaria and as an ingredient of tonic water a common feature is nonetheless the abundance of aromatic and other rings that in the quinine-like case include nitrogen so variously resembling pyrimidines purines histidine and tryptophan this group is of current considerable interest as potential thereputics for covid-19 of particular interest are chloroquine theophylline tavipiravir baloxavir marboxil some ace and ace2 inhibitors can be classified in this group they are weak but not very weak binders as discussed later below camostat a serine protease inhibitor that has been considered as a potential therapeutic for covi-19 is convenient to place in this class because of its analogues but it does not itself include a nitrogen atom within a ring
there are several possible intriguing biological connections that will be discussed elsewhere one might be briefly mentioned when considering combined therapeutic use of a member of each set ubiquinone-like compounds can inhibit ubiquinone sites that work in concert with nadh and nadph cofactor sites the latter in turn are often inhibited by the quinine-like membersmany other above compounds generally bind very weakly though steroid-like compounds are strong binders and many quinine-like compounds are medium binders these are discussed below binding strength is of course a matter of degree rt where r is the gas constant and t the absolute temperature is 0593 at 298 k ie circa 06 at biological temperatures so 1 kcalmol is not significant above thermal noise free energies of 2 3 4 and 5 correspond to binding association constants of 5 148 786 and 4160 the above free energies are usually expressed as negative for the perspective from the associated system considering that absolute values are much less reliable than relative values in this field one might conservatively consider a binding energy of 35 kcalmol as worthy justification for keeping a compound on a list if one does not wish to reject prematurely and this seems reasonable if one still has in mind the refutation principle this includes the mental picture that a model pharmacophore such as 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 has a fairly large cavity which does not provide strong steric inhibition to the candidate ligands but new evidence might show that a large ligand such as a steroid might be too big to fit the real target which the experimental data is describing in other words deficiencies in the pharmacophore model will start to show up when considering larger potential drugsthere is also the benefit of using 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 as model pharmacophore that the present author has a data base of experimental and computational studies on compounds that bind to it it should be stated nonetheless that any case for any common evolutionary relationship between this dehydrogenase and the spike protein binding receptor ace2 would be at best marginal 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 has 292 residues and ace2 has 613 there is a 24 identity match of amino acid residues in the region of best possible match of the dehydrogenase there is also further 19 conservative substitution clustal  ie conservation between groups of strongly similar properties with a score greater than 05 on the pam 250 matrix if taken alone this would provide some basis for further exploring a relationship admittedly the conventional rule of thumb is that any two sequences are considered homologous if they are more than 30 exact amino acid residue matches and strictly speaking this should apply over their entire lengths this is discussed in chapter 8 of ref 12 and a brief review of standard tools is given in refs 237 nonetheless caution is required because the 30 exact match criterion is well known to miss many easily detected homologs and 1520 is sometime found supported by evidence of evolutionary and functional relationship for example alignments between common cold and sars-cov-2 spike proteins already discussed above are in this range but there is every good reason to believe a common ancestry there is an overall conformational similarity and essential features of some sequence motifs are preserved there is some sense of comparable fold motifs with ace2 comprising two 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 folds the dehydrogenase is a bundle of some 12 well defined roughly parallel and antiparallel -helices of up to about 30 residues interspersed by 7 short -pleated sheet strands ace2 has some 20 well defined predominantly and very roughly parallel and antiparallel -helices of up to about 30 residues interspersed by 6 short -pleated sheet strands if there is a common evolutionary origin of 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 and ace2 domains it is distant but it remains marginally possible and more extensive conformational analysis is underwaythere is even less evidence of homology between 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 and tmprss2 although a serine residue is highly conserved in the catalytic site in both cases which arguably makes it worthy of some initial exploration tmprss2 comprises distinct cystine rich scavenger domain residues 150242 and a serine protease domain residues 255484 clustal o124 multiple sequence alignment gives an exact match of amino acid of only 175 there are some grounds for further investigation in the future there is also further 175 conservative substitution clustal  see above for tmprss2 there are some suggestive short section matches in same order of appearance eg aqyyys with ayyyys vvshc with vvshc lyhsd with lfhdd and gilrqs with galrqe which by some arguments slightly increase statistical significance no significant conformational homology is apparent so it is even more likely to be a chance match and any argument for similarity between the proteins would be on the basis of some kind of convergent evolution based on certain common ligands recalling again that the coronavirus might benefit from inhibiting an inflammatory responsepreliminary studies on the panel of ligands discussed below suggest some degree of binding 45 kcalmol and better ie more negative to both the above and 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 but these studies are still not fully complete and low energies may yet be obtained the most substantial data base of results that can reasonably be considered final is in large part from the original studies 49 there carbenoxolone was automatically evolved by automatic editing of its chemical structure under the combined selective pressure of improve binding to 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 while avoiding significant match with compounds covered by all us patents 49 and subsequent docking and high grade molecular dynamic simulations were carried out on ibms blue gene 49 many subsequent studies have however been carried out on using krunch on a personal computer because in the initial study it predicted well the blue gene results providing that the krunch binding energies obtained were corrected or refined to fit the blue gene results by a linear regression formula 49recall again that it is on the basis of similarities between some compounds that antagonize sars virus entry and bind the steroid dehydrogenase plus a notable commonality in the case of emodin ie it binds both that this model pharmacophore was chosen since emodin and many other compounds of interest contain two or three or more aromatic rings it is reasonable at least as an initial tactic that one may regard them as pieces of the steroid ring system and start them in the steroid binding cavity in the same plane as the steroid ring in such a case involving minor variations as sidechains on the original steroid core the way to make initial fit to using carbenoxolone as guide is obvious however the flat view of a steroid is misleading the steroid ring system can buckle in various cis-trans combinations of bonds in the rings and the longer sidechain conformations preferred on the basis of intramolecular energy are perhaps not obvious although the rotation barriers for most of the transitions are clearly above the thermal energy kt energy conformations 06 kcalmol the associated energy demands for buckling of parts of the steroid ring system of variously and roughly 2550 kcalmol are less that the ligand-receptor binding the associated energy demands are below the gain in energy from ligand-receptor binding to the protein target this is shown in the high grade quantum mechanical hartree-fock gamess calculations on blue gene in the original study 49 but which have not been described in the literature minimized energy conformers of steroid-like compounds considered are shown in fig 3
such calculations in vacuo are less reliable for the charged species but one may obtain a qualitative assessment from relative values and comparative uncharged species these compounds are also shown more clearly from the chemists perspective in two dimensional formula format later below fig 4
shows one of early analogues of carbenoxolone the thioketone derivative cbos1 discussed later below in the 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 steroid binding site the particular interest in this compound is as follows since in the original study 49 krunch judged this as the strongest binder at 168 kcalmol this compound was frequently used as a starting template for initial docking configurations when using krunch this is even though a it is probably an unlikely choice for a chemist to use in practice because of likely oligimerization of the thioketone groups and even though b corphos also known as cortisol 21-phosphate cortisol phosphate hydrocortisone-21-phosphate or 21-hydrocortisonephosphoric acid was the strongest at 168 kcal mol when using instead the amber force field for molecular dynamics on ibms blue gene 49 the thioketone still retained a reasonable binding energy of 163 kcalmol in the latter study however ie effectively the same binding strength within the state of the art fig 4 does not of itself give details any ligand-protein interactions but see discussion in ref 349 although it does illustrate the tightest of fit that is except to the lower right of the thioketone ring of the ligand which does appear to relate to genuine opportunities for additional groups to be added to carbenoxolone at that positioncarbenoxolone and initial closely related derivatives derived in that study 49 are shown in fig 4 binding in the range 17 to 14 kcalmol accuracy and limited realism of such methods does not really justify more precise statements on binding energy and the classification of binding below is as strong medium and weak but see ref 49 for more detail on some of the compounds authors variously consider binding energies 5 to 9 as a safe requirement for significant binding but again this is subject to considerations of accuracy and almost all agree that it is only the relative values that are significant note that while they are often interpreteted as estimates of binding free energy the entropy component particularly of the aqueous solvent and solute-solvent intercations is difficult to estimate experimental binding values of ligands in general in biological systems typically range from 4 to 16 kcalmol though over 95 lie in the range 7 to 13 kcalmol the thiioketone derivatives are more of theoretical interest in binding studies because in practice they may cause oligmerizationrecall that the two peptide analogues of features of the spike protein of interest 3 are as followsoriginal l-mimetic nh3-gpskrsfiedllfnkvtlac-coo

so far simulations only show these to be binding relatively weakly at 10 and 8 kcalmol respectively but these compounds are highly flexible with a theoretical internal in vacuo conformational entropy corresponding to about 195 kcalmol as discussed in theory section 2 show multiple binding modes and conformers on binding and may not yet be complete a high performance computer like ibms blue gene used in the earlier drug design study 49 would certainly helpin fig 6
is shown a set of compounds from the zinc data base 69 and most were identified from the original 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 study 49 and subsequent studies these bind significantly by usual criteria but more weakly they are in the range found for the synthetic peptides of interest but have much less conformational freedom a small few not shown here did appear in the original higher grade studies but the reasonable binding energies could not be reproduced for reasons that are not as yet clear
fig 7
shows some weaker binding results using krunch 49 great caution is required in drawing conclusions from the compounds in fig 3 camostat is definitely of interest as an inhibitor of the ace2 protein to which the spike protein initially binds for cell entry and does seem effective in blocking entry 74 and similarly hepsin results are of related interest eg as it is a potential alternative entry point the ace inhibitors also looked initially interesting by virtue of certain similarities to the other potential ligands and of course because of their binding in this theoretical study but most of the traditional ace inhibitors are commonly viewed as not inhibiting ace 2 taking a drug such as valsartan that acts on ace might up-regulate ace2 so facilitating virus entry 75 but emerging information is revealing a complicated picture see discussion and conclusions there are possible explanations that would still allow for competing with spike protein binding but these seem somewhat unlikely most probably the binding is sufficiently weak that the normal substrate and also the spike protein displace it aromatic group interactions may be important here 76some consideration has been given to prediction of ligand binding site motifs but so far these have proven essentially negative as regards interesting results that might shed any further light on the above although some clues may well have been missed binding sites are often comprised of conserved residues that are not contiguous continuous in a sequence which will require further and more detailed study although subsequences of 26 amino acid residues in length are worthy of a quick preliminary study because they are commonly involved in ligand interactions the matches involved in here as judged by blastp and clustal omega are not statistically significant but one might think of weak matches as ligand binding site predictions in much the same way that one thinks of epitope predictions in much of the present paper the structure of emodin carbenoxolone and related compounds have involved discussion of aromatic rings and hence phenylananine f tyrosine y and tryptophan w and more generally amino acid residues with hydrophobic character very polar subsequences are also strong binders of charged ligands or have a role for charged molecules or inorganic ions in some way as far as such subsequences in the coronavirus spike protein are concerned very polar charge-pattern motifs such drets and dreds are common in ligand binding some of the molecules that may be of interest as antagonizing sars entry activation or replication in some way in the present authors experience specifically motifs like this were of initial interest in the present project because sars-cov nonstructural proteins have zinc finger motifs and ret and especially red are common in prosite motifs at httpsprositeexpasyorgcgi-binprositeprositesearchfullpl including zinc-finger motifs this is not considered directly relevant to the spike protein but for example respectively in genbank entry aia622401 and dreds and drets align with srldkv in three-way clustal omega alignment with srldk of the original wuhan spike protein sequence mn9089473 and drldt of np0735511 spike protein however these and many similar alignments also illustrate considerable sequence variation and the weak matches are not close in the sequence to the subsequences of interest neither for coronavirus spike protein nor human proteins of potential discussed above as far as ace2 is concerned the closes match with drets and dregs is drkkps but this weak match again lays well away from regions of current interest eg in the sequence from the region that interacts with the spike glycoprotein dteta and drfin do occur in the c-terminal half of human 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 but again these are expected to be coincidental matcheslike the first vaccines 77 therapeutics too have of course been drawn directly or almost directly from nature until the late 19th century when chemical synthesis became a science and only in the 1970s did use begin to made of computers for rational drug design the advantages of still seriously considering herbal remedies is that they tend to be tolerated by cells because they are produced in cells they are already subjected to hundreds of years of human trial are often economic solutions for bulk production and are leads for further drug development and discovery the principal non-peptide compounds considered above as possible therapeutics have such convenient and herbal sources as reviewed previously 3 the herbal extract emodin is a convenient product extracted from rhubarb buckthorn and japanese knotweed and several fungi the previous paper 3 also noted that emodin had certain molecular similarities with anti-inflammatory drugs such as carbenoxolone derived from an extract glycyrrhizic acid from liquorish licorice that variously inhibit or are believed to inhibit human11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 the above does not guarantee efficacy of emodin carbenoxolone against sars-cov-2 not least because even the emodin studies concerned sars-cov not sars-cov-2 and the case for the dehydrogenase is circumstantial but these and related substances are worthy of investigation indeed this paper has described a number of compounds that bind the dehydrogenase importantly however recall that the weak binders that are also ace inhibitors may be more dangerous and promote infection because they upregulate ace2 75 nonetheless that situation is not resolved as followsthe above considerations as to the action and possible usefulness are empirical observations that are largely independent of bioinformatics and molecular computation and they are even independent of whether the correct human protein targets discussed here are correct and relevant however it would be valuable to know what might relate ace2 and 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 and ideally also understand why both enzymes might benefit the coronavirus by interaction with them also this paper could not provide any evidence of an evolutionary relationship between these proteins despite certain similarities or with tmprss2 so far there is no obvious relationship with the dehydrogenase and some other studies by the author on other transmembrane serine proteases do not as yet suggest any relationship without such connections the dehydrogenase can only be considered as a rather arbitrary model pharmacophore as such it is possibly meritorious as correctly representing an ensemble of multiple targets but that may be fortuitous and hence only to be used until refuted by evidencenonetheless possible clues as to mutual relevance of these human protein targets might come noting their tissue distribution and considering how this may relate to their biological role as regards ace2 its mrna is known to be present in virtually all organs studying sars entry into human cells hamming et al 78 considered their most remarkable finding to be the substantial surface expression of ace2 protein not only on lung alveolar epithelial cells but also enterocytes of the small intestine as in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organ studied oral and nasal mucosa nasopharynx lung stomach small intestine colon skin lymph nodes thymus bone marrow spleen liver kidney and brain there is the attractive prospect that several many herbal remedies considered as laxatives interact with ace2 and inhibit sars-covid-2 entry recall that emodin is an antagonist of both ace2 59 60 61 and 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 62 in the past 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 has been considered to be distributed mainly in the human liver with no detectable levels in the intestine or kidney mostly membrane-bound and retained in the liver microsomal fraction 79 this was not however the finding of bruley et al 80 they found it to be highly expressed in glucocorticoid target tissues including liver and notably the lung and modest levels in the brain it was also found in modest levels in adipose tissue where it is of medical interest that selective increase expression occurs in obese humans and rodents and is likely to be of pathogenic importance in the metabolic syndrome 80 lung expression appears to be managed differently a new promotor that the authors discovered and called p1 predominated in lung while the previously known promotor predominated in liver adipose tissue and brain 79researchers therefore need to sort out an intriguing web of information it is possible that a complex web of laxative and anti-inflammatory effect may provide clues by somehow relating to the bodys attempts to reject and eject viruses of this kind and the viruss attempts to resist it is well known that some covid-19 patients complain of stomach upsets and diarrhea to recapitulate the essential themes in terms of action in the alimentary tract recall again that emodin had earlier been shown by several groups of researchers eg refs 79 to inhibit sars-cov entry into cells apparently initially by binding ace2 and emodin is taken as a herbal laxative licorice has conversely been sometimes taken as a soother for alimentary disorders and carbenoxolone has been used commercially in the past specifically to treat peptic ulcers intriguingly carbenoxolone is also known to influence the renin-angiotensin system involving ace2 so at least there appears to be a connection in terms of networks of physiological control as noted above while traditionally 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 has been thought of as a liver enzyme many researchers have indicated that both ace2 and the dehydrogenase are available in both lung and intestinal tract eg ref 78 79 80 this all hints also that some of the other laxatives that work in a similar stimulatory way might block viral entry on ace2 and perhaps other targets and should be explored of course absolutely nothing should be done by patients without physician direction because dosages are difficult matters not least in herbal products and there are potentially serious side effects on such as salt balance and blood pressure and some might cause birth defects all potentially worse than covid-19 would be for most people but more worryingly still the situation is not settled and physicians and patients could take action in the wrong direction gurwitz 81 has emphasized that the picture is even more complex he examined reports from china suggesting that a mechanism of production of lung injury during the viral infection may be due to excess free angiotensin-ii which might be displaced from ace2 by the sars virus particles if so then increasing the amount of ace-2 could be desirable and administering angiotensin receptor antagonists could beneficially upregulate the production of ace-2 it now becomes important to examine medical records of patients who have and who have not been infected by sars-cov-2 with a particular eye on who is and who is not taking ace inhibitorsas noted in section 14 merrifield developed first solid phase peptide synthesis on crosslinked polystyrene beads in 1963 12 somewhat like natural compounds discussed above peptides and petidomimetics are potentially important first steps in more detailed rational design of small organic molecules convenient as traditional in a pill drugs however as in the present paper the ability to propose specific peptides and peptidomimetics does depend on bioinformatics and benefits from some computational chemistry note that in this case one is thinking largely not of screening natural products but now considering truly novel molecules using theoretical methods because they do not yet exist the variations in the krsfiedllfnkv motif that might be appropriate to synthetic vaccine and peptidomimetic antagonist design suggest the following where the amino acid residues in square brackets   represent alternatives g means an optional glycine insertionkrgsailfailfedillfandskv
the above is also valid as a regular expression ie a match query in operating systems and software more generally and colloquiallypositive charge-optional glycine-serine-hydrophobic-hydrophobic-glutamate-aspartate-hydrophobic-leucine-phenylalanine-hydrophilic or alanine-lysine-valineconsiderations at the n-terminus and c-terminus to design a synthetic vaccine and the retro-inverso approach for a peptidomimetic agonist are described in ref 3other variations appear as the strain becomes more distant there is not a universal clear indication of any sharp point of departure although the above glycine g insertion is evidence that a significant jump can happen one may therefore ask what variations should be included with the emphasis on sars-cov-2 only closely and medium distance relatives are of interest with the purpose of prevent mutations that escape from vaccines and antagonists and elude diagnostics as far as sars-cov-2 is concerned krsfiedllfnkv is a satisfactory basis because a large number of coronaviruses significantly different from sars-cov-2 preserve it or in a few cases have very conservative substitutions it may well be that the fact that residues are for example hydrophobic or positively charged is sufficient to for the approach to be applicable to other mammalian coronavirus diseases if successful for the above basic motif form attempting to tackle the common cold is not a priority in other words it may well be that an immune response against krsfiedllfnkv will also illicit a response against the motif variants providing of course that krsfiedllfnkv elicits a response itself it remains that this motif is one of very few subsequences that still recognizable when moving on to rather distantly related coronaviruses such as those of the common coldone feature of both fig 5 fig 6 fig 7 is of course the constant appearance of aromatic rings and this is also noticeable in many of the studies of antagonists against sars virus binding and activation of course the aromatic ie benzene ring makes copious appearance in many pharmaceutical agents in any event because they provide rigid scaffolds for added groups supported by many long-established recipes for synthesis the compounds in fig 5 fig 6 fig 7 should be distinguished from those such as lopinavar ritonar promazine and particularly niclosamide that have been explored for sars viruses in the past because these are targeted by drug designers against the sars virus own protease required for maturation of the assembling virus nonetheless some of these do have a visual similarity to the compounds in fig 3 particularly niclosamide which is normally a medication used to treat tapeworm infestation also in the present case prevalence of aromatic rings in fig 1 fig 2 fig 3 is hardly surprising since carbenoxolone and derivatives shown in fig 1 were the starting point for their evolution or selection from the zinc data base nonetheless there is in principle nothing to constrain the evolution to aromatic chemistry 49 and later unpublished studies did produce molecules departing from aromatic chemistry however these bound relatively weaklywith the possible importance of aromatic rings and avoidance of escape mutations by the coronavirus in mind a question is whether occasional loss of phenylalanine f from the krsfiedllfnkv motif discussed above contests the tentative hypothesis that the peptidomimetic candidates derived from krsfiedllfnkv bind to a similar site as the smaller organic ligands considered here because of two phenylalanine residues f in the original motif and a tendency to several benzene rings in the case of organic ligands the answer is perhaps there seems to be a need to have one aromatic ring present in the motif and no match with a coronavirus in genebank was detected by the author by blast-p using queries with no phenylalanine f eg rsaiedllldkv rsaiedllidkv rsaiedlladkv rsaiedllmdkv rsaiedllwdkv and rsaiedllydkv as queries though as also noted above the search has not been exhaustive it would not be too contradictory to any of the current main hypotheses if some examples were found the fact that tyrosine y does not seem to readily substitute here for phenylalanine f from which it differs only by a hydroxyl oh ie phenolic group suggests an important hydrophobic feature of the pharmacophore at that pointof course many or most drug-like molecules contain at least one aromatic ring and this is almost certainly because they can form especially strong stacking interactions in the binding site one very relevant report in the same month of writing the present paper emphasizes that the use of protein and other fragments to characterize binding pocket and determine the strengths of ligand-protein interactions is common in both a computational and experimental approach and that aromatic interactions are both strong and need special attention 76 because of resonance and the special nature of the  orbitals the strength of stacking is best calculated using high level quantum mechanical approaches not empirical force fields 76 however as these calculations are performed in vacuum solvation properties are neglected and this led to the proposal of a grid inhomogeneous solvation theory gist to describe the properties of individual heteroaromatics and complexes this gave good correlation for the estimated desolvation penalty and the experimental binding free energy and prediction of binding sites 76a main conclusion is that peptide krsfiedllfnkv remains of special interest as well conserved across coronaviruses other sites and other proteins of the virus may of course emerge as the solutions to this formidable problem all aspects of the virus must be considered however even the ace2 binding domain is significantly more prone to accepted mutations the recurrence of the core features of the krsfiedllfnkv motif over so many diverse species reminds us of zoonotic origins and it might be recalled that jenner the inventor of vaccination consider that many and perhaps all plagues of mankind might ultimately be of animal origin 7622 23 24 25 70 73this paper is provided to the community to promote the more general applications of the thinking of professor paul a m dirac in human and animal medicine in accordance

as of 4 april 2020 1139207 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 have been reported worldwide 1 examination of the full-length genome revealed that the coronavirus responsible for covid-19 namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a -coronavirus in the same subgenus as the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars virus but in a different clade 2 the structure of the receptor-binding gene region is very similar to that of the sars coronavirus in which both employ the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 for cell entry 2 ace2 a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system ras is a homolog of ace where its expression can be identified principally in the heart kidney and airway epithelial cells 3 it functions as a carboxypeptidase by converting angiotensin ii to angiotensin-17 thereby opposing the vasoconstrictive effect of angiotensin ii 4currently available epidemiological studies have reported an increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease cvd including hypertension among patients who developed a severe subtype of covid-19 510 for example the study by guan et al 5 which is one of the earliest analyses of the characteristics of chinese patients with covid-19 reported that the prevalence of coronary heart disease was more than fourfold higher among patients who developed the combined primary endpoint of admission to an intensive care unit mechanical ventilation or death relative to patients with less severe outcomes in addition more recent studies 9 10 that evaluated covid-19-associated cardiac injury observed a high prevalence of hypertension 598635 coronary heart disease 293327 cardiomyopathy 154 and chronic heart failure 146 among covid-19 patients complicated with cardiac injury which is independently associated with mortality with covid-19since then researchers tend to favor an association of cvd with the severity of covid-19 11 12 nevertheless interpreting such an association should be done with caution since the validity of such an association is hampered by an unclear definition of cvd including hypertension adopted in these studies 510 without knowing the baseline cvd status of patients it is hard to suggest that cvd is an added risk factor for developing severe covid-19 infection moreover the available studies originated from china therefore the generalizability of such an association to the global population is limited patients with underlying cvd are likely to experience excessive morbidity from any cause because they have diminished circulatory reserve to meet the excessive demands on the cardiovascular system furthermore since the prevalence of cvd is increased with age age may act as a confounding factor available studies also reported that older patients with covid-19 tend to develop a severe course of the disease including the development of cardiac injury 510 future studies with age-stratified analysis could shed some light on the association of cvd with the severity of covid-19 infectionon the other hand some researchers have called to consider the safety of ras inhibitors including ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii type i receptor blockers arbs among patients with covid-19 11 12 there has been speculation that patients with covid-19 who are receiving these agents may be at increased risk for adverse outcomes given that ace2 is a functional receptor for sars-cov-2 and ras inhibitors can increase ace2 levels 11 12 however an increased level of ace2 upon exposure to ras inhibitors has not been a universal finding while some animal studies 1318 have noticed an increased expression of ace2 upon exposure to ace inhibitors or arbs other studies reported otherwise 19 20 the findings from human studies 2124 have discredited the association of levels of ace2 with the use of ace inhibitors and arbs although one study 25 did notice an increased urinary secretion of ace2 in hypertensive patients treated with the arb olmesartan but not with other ace inhibitors and arbs furthermore another study 26 demonstrated an increased gene expression for ace2 in the small intestine of patients under ace inhibitorarb treatment compared with untreated controls in addition the elevation of serum ace2 was only found in patients with unsatisfactory blood pressure control utilizing ace inhibitor therapy as reported in a study among hypertensive subjects 27 therefore the effect of ras inhibitors on ace2 among human subjects is mainly due to the expression of ace2 in the plasma kidney and gastrointestinal system and is not the known effect if any of ras inhibitors on the expression of ace2 in human airway epithelial cells furthermore increased expression of ace2 did not correspond to increased ace2 activity in an animal study 16 and it is not known if the biological effect on ace2 would wane immediately upon discontinuation of ace inhibitors and arbsthe role of ace2 in coronavirus infection is still controversial although ace2 is a prerequisite for infectivity of sars-cov the presence of other co-factors seems to be important for efficient cellular infection since sars-cov was also identified in cell types lacking ace2 expression 28 in addition the upregulation of ace2 is not entirely harmful since paradoxically an increased level of ace2 might protect against coronavirus-induced lung injury 29 binding of the coronavirus spike protein to ace2 leads to ace2 downregulation which in turn results in excessive production of angiotensin ii 30 as angiotensin ii increases pulmonary vascular permeability it could produce lung injury and impair lung function 30 31 coincidentally a study that investigated the clinical and biochemical parameters of patients with covid-19 observed that levels of angiotensin ii were higher compared with healthy controls 32 moreover angiotensin ii levels were linearly associated with lung injury supporting the hypothesis that angiotensin ii is responsible for lung injury in covid-19 as previously mentioned the clinical course of covid-19 can be complicated by cardiac injury manifested by increased biomarkers which portends a worse prognosis and ace2 plays a significant role in myocardial recovery response 9 10 33 indeed in some of the heart samples from patients who died from sars the presence of viral rna was identified which was associated with reduced ace2 protein expression 34the safety issue of ace inhibitors and arbs has since created great concerns on social media sites but emerging data are reassuring a retrospective observational study 35 published in the chinese language reported that the use of ace inhibitors or arbs did not differ significantly between patients who recovered and patients who died from covid-19 suggesting that the use of ras inhibitors may not result in worse prognosis although a conclusion on the safe use of ras inhibitors could not be firmly drawn from this study due to the limited number of patients receiving ras inhibitors n  22 however another recent retrospective study 36 reported that covid-19 patients with underlying hypertension taking ace inhibitorsarbs had a much lower proportion of critical disease 93 vs 229 p  0061 and a lower mortality rate 47 vs 133 p  0283 than their hypertensive counterparts not receiving an ace inhibitorarb furthermore patients taking ace inhibitorsarbs had significantly lower levels of c-reactive protein and procalcitonin when compared with patients not receiving an ace inhibitorarb suggesting a potential anti-inflammatory function in covid-19ras inhibitors could be indicated for chronic heart failure or chronic kidney disease in which self-discontinuation of these agents without prior consultation with physicians may lead to decompensation within days to weeks further compromising cardiopulmonary reserve in patients at risk of covid-19 37 38 the benefits that are specific to ace inhibitorsarbs may not be recapitulated by other antihypertensive agents for these diseases while no data have been reported on the effect of temporary discontinuation of ras inhibitors on mortality among patients with covid-19 the shreds of evidence extrapolated from other patient settings suggest harm in which studies from the veterans affairs healthcare system showed that non-resumption of arbs within 2 days or ace inhibitors within 14 days after surgery was associated with higher 30-day mortality rates 39 40 the risk of fall in the elderly population from abruptly stopping long-term medication eg ace inhibitors could result in significant adverse consequences by increasing the risk of fractures and bleedingin conclusion although cvd has been reported as one of the most common comorbidities among patients with severe covid-19 the association of cvd with the severity of covid-19 has yet to be confirmed since thus far there is no biological connection between cvd and viral replication in addition the established benefits of ace inhibitors and arbs in cvd outweigh the uncertain risks among patients at risk of covid-19 since available evidence demonstrated no direct pathological relationship between ras blockade and covid-19 therefore we echo the position statements table 1 of some of the major cardiovascular societies 41 to discourage the discontinuation of ace inhibitors or arbs in patients with covid-19 such statements should provide reassurance to clinicians who would like to continue using ace inhibitors and arbs among patients at risk of covid-19 furthermore an ongoing clinical trial of covid-19-infected patients receiving an ace inhibitorarb randomized to either an alternative antihypertensive medication or continuation of the ace inhibitorarb therapy may provide a definitive answer to this debate 42coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a newly recognized infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 since the outbreak in december 2019 it spreaded rapidly and eventually caused an ongoing worldwide pandemic according to the world health organization who as of june 22 2020 sars-cov-2 has infected over 8000000 people and resulted in more than 460000 deaths the lack of effective anti-viral therapy and rapid emergence of covid-19 have placed frontline physicians in a difficult position of battling an unknown disease with unproven conventional therapies thus it is important to fully and correctly understand covid-19 pathophysiology to effectively treat patients in order to minimize morbidity and mortality published literature indicates that the highest risk of death is in patients with previous heart disease and other cardiovascular comorbidities de rosa et al 2020renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas inhibitors which include angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii receptor type 1 blockers arbs are widely used for treatment of hypertension heart failure and coronary heart disease sars-cov-2 can bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a receptor to facilitate cell fusion and entry which suggests a direct interaction between sars-cov-2 and the raas which may compromise normal raas functionhypertension in patients who develop covid-19 is a common occurrence in a study including 1099 confirmed covid-19 patients from 552 hospitals in china 237 of these patients had hypertension guan et al 2020 in another study cerebrovascular disease was observed in 22 of 32 non-survivors from 52 patients in the intensive care unit yang et al 2020b additionally zhang et al reported that hypertension was the most common comorbidity of severe covid-19 patients present in 30 of the hospitalized individuals zhang et al 2020a ace inhibitors and arbs are first-line treatments for patients with hypertension a recent review demonstrated that application of ace inhibitors or arbs could significantly upregulate ace2 expression and enhance its activity thus raising a valid concern that these treatments may facilitate the infectivity of sars-cov-2 south diz  chappell 2020 in addition ace inhibitors can lead to increased activation of the kallikrein-bradykinin system elevated bradykinin expression can induce airway hyperresponsiveness and pulmonary edema which could potentially lead to the deterioration of covid-19 patients aztatzi-aguilar uribe-ramirez arias-montano barbier  de vizcaya-ruiz 2015 cao et al 2020 based on these concerns some researchers have suggested that ace inhibitors and arbs should be discontinued in covid-19 patients with hypertension diaz 2020 esler  esler 2020 fang karakiulakis  roth 2020conversely covid-19 can induce severe cardiac injury shi et al 2020a which would benefit from the treatment with raas inhibitors covid-19-induced cytokine storm and increased raas activation might enhance the inflammation in the lungs and other organs c chen li hang  wang 2020b romero orias  weir 2015 therefore there is an urgent need to develop guidelines for the use of these drugs during sars-cov-2 infection in this review we discuss the effects of ace inhibitors on bradykinin-induced signaling in the cardiovascular system the roles of raas activation in the covid-19 induced cytokine storm and lung inflammation and examine recent clinical outcomes observed with raas inhibitors in covid-19 patientshuman covs hcovs belong to the coronavirinae subfamily that are classified into 4 phylogenic clusters    and  covs zhang et al 2018 among all covs 7 prominant strains from the  and  subgroups can infect humans madjid

respriratory distress they each have distinctive properties table 1
 sars-cov-2 is most infectious with a reproductive number r0 estimated by the who of 2025 by comparison sars-cov and mers-cov have respective r0 estimates of 1719 and 07 respectively petrosillo viceconte ergonul ippolito  petersen 2020 meanwhile mers-cov and sars-cov infections elicit higher risk of organ damage multi-organ failure and death than sars-cov-2 in contrast sars-cov-2 appears to more often be associated with asymptomatic disease arons et al 2020 case reports of mers patients reveal elevated creatinine lactate dehydrogenase ldh alanine aminotransferase alt and aspartate aminotransferase ast which suggest renal and liver damage al-tawfiq et al 2014 arabi et al 2014 chafekar  fielding 2018 patients with sars and covid-19 show signs multiple organ damage including effects in the heart kindey and liver gu et al 2005 zhang et al 2020b the average of fatality rate is lowest in covid-19 patients with estimated death rates of 07 10 and 30 for covid-19 sars and mers patients respectively madjid et al 2020the major structural proteins of covs are the spike protein s small envelope protein matrix protein m and nucleocapsid protein n genomic comparisons reveal that sars-cov-2 shares 82 nucleotide identity with sars-cov but is less similar to mers-cov 50 nucleotide identity fig 1
 chan et al 2020 the 3-terminus of the genome contains the four major structural proteins and eight accessory proteins 3a 3b p6 7a 7b 8b 9b andor f14 although sars-cov-2 is closely related to sars-cov there are some notable differences between the two strains for example the 8a protein is absent in sars-cov-2 while present in sars-cov the 8b protein in sars-cov-2 is 121 amino acids compared with 84 amino acids in sars-cov protein 3b is much shorter in sars-cov-2 22 amino acids than in sars-cov 154 amino acids wu et al 2020 it remains unclear the extent to which these differences alter virulence or mortality both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 binds to the same surface protein ace2 while mers-cov enters host cells via binding to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 petrosillo et al 2020 relative to the sars-cov spike protein the sars-cov-2 spike protein contains several amino acid changes which increase salt bridge formation and hydrophobic interactions and strengthen ace2 binding gheblawi et al 2020 these changes may contribute to virulence and the considerably larger global spread of sars-cov-2 compared to sars-cov gheblawi et al 2020ace2 is a transmembrane protein that plays a central role in down- regulation of raas gheblawi et al 2020 when co-expressed with transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 ace2 acts as receptor for sars-cov-2 cell entry guzik et al 2020 ace2 expression is considerably reduced after sars-cov and sars-cov-2 infection jung choi you  kim 2020 interaction between ace2 and the receptor binding domain rbd of the s1 subunit on the viral spike protein facilitates virus entrance endocytosis of sars-cov-2 along with ace2 into endosomes reduces surface ace2 expression k wang gheblawi  oudit 2020a viral entry of sars-cov-2 subsequently upregulates adam metallopeptidase domain 17 adam-17 which mediates ectodomain shedding of ace2 patel et al 2014 adam-17 activation also mediates liberation of membrane bound cytokine precursors including il-4 and ifn- which repress ace2 mrna expression wang gheblawi  oudit 2020a sars-cov-2 activation of raas combined with reduced ace2-mediated conversion of angiotensin ii ang ii to ang-17 results in increased angii accumulation ang ii activates the angiotensin receptor type 1 receptor at1r to trigger a signaling cascade whereby activation of erkp38 map kinase signaling results in upregulation of adam-17 to initiate a positive feedback loop that limits ace2 expression patel et al 2014 in addition inflammation-induced lung injury leads to apoptosis of clara cells and type ii alveolar epithelial cells which are major ace2-expressing cell subsets reduced survival of these cells also contributes to the down-regulation of ace2 fig 2
 wiener cao hinds ramirez  williams 2007clinical outcomes in covid-19 patients are strongly associated with the pre-existing health status of infected patients cvd comorbidities increase mortality of patients with covid-19 shahid et al 2020 cvd comorbidities have direct consequences upon sars-cov2 infection for example patients with abnormally high blood pressure may exhibit increased apoptosis not only in the heart but also in the kidney which may be exacerbated by the additional stress of sars-cov2 infection gonzalez et al 2003 hamet et al 1995 over the course of severe covid-19 biomarkers indicating heart injury become elevated mehta et al 2020 shi et al 2020b in a washington state case series of 21 critically ill covid-19 patients 7 patients 33 developed cardiomyopathy and 4 19 developed acute renal injury arentz et al 2020 ace2 expression in human heart might be one potential mechanism underlying heart injury during infection with sars-cov-2 however sars-cov-2 infection-induced cytokine storm may also contribute to cardiovascular injury chen li chen feng  xiong 2020atissue kallikrein produces kinin and bradykinin peptides by cleaving its substrate kininogen in addition to its role in production of angiotensin ii ace mediates bradykinin degradation thus both kinin and bradykinin are increased with use of ace inhibitors fig 3
 increased bradykinin levels are believed to be responsible for the dry cough adverse effect observed in some patients on ace inhibitors moreover kinin and bradykinin peptides can also participate in shock and respiratory allergy thus well-known side effects suggest that ace inhibitors may aggravate lung inflammation and cause lung dysfunction during covid-19despite the potential adverse effect of dry cough on respiratory tract the kallikreinkinin system kks has many positive functions which may ameliorate cvd fig 3 in experimental models the expression of human tissue kallikrein caused significant reduction of blood pressure in fructose-induced hypertension rats but did not affect blood pressure of non-fructose-fed normal rats yao yin shen chao  chao 2007 accumulating evidence indicates that the kks is capable of exerting organ protection apart from its blood pressure-lowing effect an in vivo study showed that the infusion of kinin improved renal function of hypertensive rats and lowered the corresponding increase in capase-3 activity chao et al 2007 recombinant adeno-associated virus raav mediated human tissue kallikrein exerted a protective effect on myocardial apoptosis in spontaneous hypertensive rats shrs specifically by modulating the activity of caspase-3 through the b2 receptor yan wang  wang 2009 tissue kallikrein not only reduced blood pressure but also attenuated remodeling of the myocardium large blood vessels and kidney wang et al 2004 in addition tissue kallikrein efficiently protected against diabetic nephropathy and chronic renal failure tu et al 2008 yuan et al 2007 zhao et al 2003 it has also been suggested that tissue kallikrein prevents apoptosis and ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction yao et al 2007in summary bradykinin may improve blood pressure regulation and provide organ protection in hypertensive patients since organ injury often determines mortality in hypertensive patients infected with sars-cov-2 we hypothesize that the by product of increased bradykinin levels induced by ace inhibition may provide more benefit than harm in cvd-comorbid covid-19 patientsmany studies have demonstrated that ang ii-induced hypertension and the accompanying vascular inflammation result in organ damage chen et al 2017 chen et al 2019 gonzalez et al 2015 yang et al 2018 il-6 plays an important role in mediating heart damage genetic disruption of il6 markedly attenuates the cardiac injury and inflammation induced by ang ii which suggests that il-6 acts downstream of the ang ii effector chen et al 2017 chen et al 2019 gonzalez et al 2015 yang et al 2018 ang ii also induces the production of other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnf- and il-1 guo et al 2011 several studies suggest that ang ii not only acts as a vasoactive peptide that regulates blood pressure but also works as an inflammatory cytokine causing cardiovascular remodeling gibbons pratt  dzau 1992 griendling minieri ollerenshaw  alexander 1994 sadoshima  izumo 1993 during the immune response activated by sars-cov-2 a cytokine storm is often observed in severe cases serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-6 il-2r and il-1 are elevated huang et al 2020 qin et al 2020 xu et al 2020 increased markers of this cytokine storm such as serum il-6 predict poor outcome in patients with severe covid-19 cao 2020 covid-19 patients also have elevated ang ii levels which are positively associated to viral load and lung injury liu et al 2020 thus sars-cov-2 infection dysregulates ang ii over-activates the immune response and augments the cytokine storm that causes organ damage the inhibition or the blockage of raas may be helpful to attenuate the inflammatory storm and prevent end-organ damageace2 plays an important role in the regulation of angiotensin signaling the generation of ang ii is well understood liver-derived angiotensinogen atg is cleaved by renin into ang i which is further processed by ace to ang ii and is converted by ace2 into ang-17 ang-17 is generally considered cvd-protective it counters the action of ang ii through a g protein-coupled receptor grcr mas previous studies demonstrated that both sars-cov-2 and sars-cov which caused the sars epidemic in 2003 spike proteins s proteins bind to the extracellular domain of ace2 sars-cov-2 uses ace2 abundantly expressed in pulmonary epithelium kidney and heart for intracellular entry fig 3 after infection by sars-cov-2 ace2 expression is reduced crackower et al 2002 imai et al 2005 kuba et al 2005 animal models of infection with sars-cov showed that ace2 downregulation resulted in pro-inflammatory responses including lung injury and cardiac contractility impairment crackower et al 2002 imai et al 2005 kuba et al 2005 if sars-cov-2 infections progress similarly to sars-cov the virus may deteriorate a patients condition via two mechanisms first lower ace2 expression decreases the degradation of ang ii overabundance of ang ii has multiple deleterious cardiovascular consequences including elevating blood pressure cardiomyocyte apoptosis cardiac infiltration by macrophages and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines second less ace2 reduces the formation ang-17 and its cvd-protective vasodilatory anti-inflammatory anti-fibrillatory and anti-proliferatory effects lelis freitas machado crespo  santos 2019 patel zhong grant  oudit 2016 in particular ang-17 can diminish il-6 tnf- macrophage infiltration vascular cell adhesion protein 1 vcam-1 and increase nitric oxide release together these effects increase the survival of cardiomyocytes during inflammation simoese silva silveira ferreira  teixeira 2013 moreover ang-17 promotes resolution of vascular inflammation in vivo by decreasing vcam-1 il-6 and mcp-1 zhang et al 2015 decreased levels of ace2 may lead to a deficiency of ang-17 production and contribute to tissue damage in covid-19 although ace inhibitors and arbs do not directly affect ace2 they can indirectly lead to increased ace2 activity and ang-17 expression hanff harhay brown cohen  mohareb 2020 a study by ferrario and co-workers showed that ace inhibitor caused a 25-fold rise of plasma ang-17 concentrations and an approximately 25 increase of ace2 expression in the left ventricle ferrario et al 2005 thus the usage of ace inhibitors and arbs may have a potential benefit in preventing covid-19-triggered organ damage via its upregulation of ang-17 and depletion of ang iiin conclusion dysregulation of raas due to increased ang ii and decreased ace2 can lead to a harmful inflammatory response and worsening of elevated blood pressure ace inhibitors and arbs may have a potential role in preventing the harmful effects by directly countering ang ii and upregulating ace2acute respiratory distress syndrome ards is a common and devastating development in patients with covid-19 ards is characterized by high permeability pulmonary edema severe hypoxemia and acute respiratory distress wosten-van asperen et al 2011 diffuse alveolar damage and an acute inflammation response characterized by high vascular permeability increased vascular tone and fibroblast activation play a central role in ards pathophysiology marshall et al 2002 local raas signaling occurs in the lung as lung fibroblasts alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells are capable of synthesizing raas components wosten-van asperen et al 2011 considerable evidence suggests that dysregulation of raas and increased ang ii levels induce ards symptoms including hypoxemia vasoplegia

elevated in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf of patients with ards idell et al 1987 a polymorphic insert that reduces ace expression and activity is associated with reduced ards severity marshall

regulated by the raas merad  martin 2020 in addition alveolar macrophages are associated with tissue repair and fibrosis generation in covid-19 patients ramachandran et al 2019 lastly ace inhibitors decrease oxygen free radical production generated by lung alveolar macrophages suzuki et al 1999since ace is detectable in the entire alveolar capillary network of human lung conversion from ang i to ang ii can rapidly occur in the pulmonary circulation metzger franke bohle alhenc-gelas  danilov 2011 excessive ang ii can lead to significant effects during covid-19-induced ards through several

vasoconstriction can result in pulmonary edema yamamoto et al 1997 ang ii can also induce endothelial expression of il-8 e-selectin p-selectin cc-chemokine ligand-5 ccl5 and ccl2 which increase

cells to increase reactive oxygen species ros and cause vascular injury bernstein et al 2018 in addition ang ii reduces alveolar epithelial cell survival by accelerating cellular apoptosis with an ec50 of just 10 nm wang et al 1999 epithelial apoptosis is linked to subsequent fibrotic responses shetty et al 2017prolonged hyperinflammation in ards or covid-19 can cause progressive tissue damage unchecked inflammation can induce a state of dysregulated tissue repair and lung fibrosis lung fibrosis thickens alveolar walls reduces lung compliance obliterates alveolar air spaces and impairs gas exchange ang ii is implicated in tissue repair or when in excess lung fibrosis uhal li piasecki  molina-molina 2012 acting through the angiotensin ii receptor type 1 at1r ang ii activates p38 and p4244 mapk induces dna synthesis and fibroblast proliferation konigshoff et al 2007 marshall mcanulty  laurent 2000a marshall puddicombe cookson  laurent 2000b furthermore ang ii activates fibroblasts synthesis and deposition of extracellular matrix ecm including type i collagen that thickens alveolar walls and reduces lung compliance uhal et al 2012 finally during the severe ards or covid-19 patients often suffer from septic shock prolonged ang ii signaling induces at1r phosphorylation and desensitization which is a major cause of the vascular hyporesponsiveness that leads to pulmonary vasoplegia levy et al 2018 together this data suggests that ang ii may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatement many vascular pathophysiologies of covid-19ace2 is an indispensable regulator in the raas that counteracts ace and ang ii lower ace2 has deleterious cardiovascular consequences and also worsens lung functional decline compared to wt mice ace2-deficient mice had impaired lung function and higher mortality in sepsis-induced lung injury imai et al 2005 severe lung failure in ace2-deficient mice could be rescued by inactivation of ace and at1r blockage imai et al 2005 arbs can prevent downregulation of ace2 during lps-induced ards suggesting that raas inhibitors may also protect against lung damage in patients with sars wosten-van asperen et al 2011 furthermore downregulation of ace2 can lead to elevated activation of ace and ang ii li et al 2008 simoese silva et al 2013 which can exacerbate the physiological progression of ards in covid-19 thus despite acting as the receptor for sars-cov-2 ace2 activity is likely protective during covid-19 disease progressionin conclusion elevation of ace and ang ii and down-regulation of ace2 can exacerbate sars-cov-2 induced ards drugs that target ace and ang ii ace inhibitors and arbs may play an important role in abrogating the inflammatory response vasoconstriction and vq mismatching that causes clinical deterioration in patients with covid-19animal models and clinical experience suggest both beneficial and deleterious effects of ace inhibitors and arbs in patients suffering from covid-19 this uncertainty raises concerns regarding the overall effect of raas inhibitors after sars-cov-2 infection sriram  insel 2020 such concerns should not be ignored examination of clinical outcomes of raas inhibitor application in covid-19 patients should be a top priority zhou et al 2013accumulated clinical data demonstrates that hypertension is associated with higher mortality in patients with covid-19 sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers wang et al 2020b zhou et al 2020 guidance on management of high blood pressure is required for this special situation a jointly published statement by american heart association aha the american college of cardiology acc and the heart failure society of america strongly recommended continuation of ace inhibitorarbs zhang zhu et al 2020b although we have illustrated that ace inhibitorsarbs can theoretically benefit covid-19 patients with hypertension further evidence regarding the effect of ace inhibitorarb usage is indispensable several clinical studies based on the application raas inhibitors in covid-19 patients with hypertension were carried out in the past few months table 2
a large-scale study included 1128 hospitalized patients with hypertension and covid-19 infection from nine hospitals in hubei province china zhang dong et al 2020a during the 28-day follow up all-cause mortality of patients in the ace inhibitorarb group was significantly lower than in the non-ace inhibitorarb group 37 7188 versus 98 92940 in addition incidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation 00 in ace inhibitorarb group versus 23 in non-ace inhibitorarbs group and septic shock 32 in ace inhibitorarb group versus 80 in non-ace inhibitorarb group were also lower the findings in this multi-center retrospective cohort study provide compelling evidence for potential beneficial effects in ace inhibitors and arbs and supports continuous usage of these drugs in hypertensive covid-19 patients a more recent retrospective study by yang et al in april 2020 reported similar observations yang et al 2020a hypertensive covid-19 patients using ace inhibitorsarbs had lower proportion of critically ill patients 93 versus 229 and mortality rate 47 versus 133 than hypertensive covid-19 patients that were not on ace inhibitorsarbsjung et al reported a nationwide cohort study on the use of raas inhibitors in covid-19-related outcomes in south korea jung et al 2020 among the 5179 confirmed sars-cov-2 patients raas inhibitor use did not alter mortality adjusted or 088 95 ci 053144 p  60 jung et al 2020 among hospitalized covid-19 patients with hypertension in-hospital mortality was lower 9 in patients given raas inhibitors than those not treated with raas inhibitors 13 although this difference was not statisticaly significant p  14 jung et al 2020 multivariate analysis that adjusted for baseline co-morbidities revealed no independent association between raas inhibitor use and risk mortality among hypertensive covid-19 patients adjusted or 071 95 ci 040126 p  25 jung et al 2020 similarly mancia et al retrospectively examined 6272 patients and found no association between raas inhibitor use and susceptibility or evolution of covid-19 mancia rea ludergnani apolone  corrao 2020 adjusted or for risk of sars-cov-2 infection was 096 95 ci 087107 for ace inhibitors and 095 95 ci 086105 for arbs while the risk of severe covid-19 or death was 091 95 ci 069 to 121 for ace inhibitors and 083 95 ci 063 to 110 for arbs mancia et al 2020 these data suggest that treatment with ace inhibitorsarbs did not increase the likelihood of sars-cov-2 infection or the risk of death in patients with covid-19gao et al retrospectively analyzed 850 hospitalized covid-19 patients with hypertension and found no significant difference in mortality between raas inhibitor-treated 183 patients 22 mortality and non-raas inhibitor-treated subjects 527 patients 36 mortality p  774 gao et al 2020 further meta-analysis including three additional studies in china revealed a lower risk of mortality associated with raas inhibitor treated vs non-raas inhibitor treated hypertensive patients relative risk 065 95 ci 045094 p  02 gao et al 2020while these studies suggest a potential protective effect of raas inhibitors in treatment of covid-19 patients we should interpret them with extreme caution like all retrospective studies these studies are limited by sample selection biases the pool of raas inhibitor-treated patients likely have multiple or more severe co-morbidities and might be expected to have worse outcomes than non-raas-inhibitor-treated patients confounding factors may also contribute to reduced hospitalization or mortality for example raas inhibitor-treated subjects may seek more routine or intensive medical care or have heightened awareness that leads to more diligent hygiene andor social distancing in addition these findings may not replicate in other populations geographically and ethnically diverse cohorts and randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to better understand the specific effect of raas inhibitors in covid-19 patientstwo recent studies suggest the interesting finding that while ace inhibitors might reduce covid-19 morbidity arbs have a less pronounced effect khera et al reported that of 2263 hypertensive sars-cov-2 patients those treated with ace inhibitors were 40 less likely to be hospitalized than those not treated with ace inhibitors while there was no reduction in hospitalization in patients treated with arbs khera et al 2020 milne et al analyzed gene expression of 1051 lung tissue samples and discovered that ace inhibitor treatment was associated with significantly lower expression of the ace2 co-receptor tmprss2 in contrast tmprss2 expression was not altered in patients treated with arbs milne yang timens bosse  sin 2020 these data provide a potential mechanistic explanation for a protective role of ace inhibitors but not arbs in covid-19 treatmentour review of the recent literature suggests potential for protective effects of continued treatment of cvd covid-19 subjects with ace inhibitors andor arbs specifically 1 ace inhibitors attenuate the deterioration of ards in covid-19 patients by limiting both ang ii-dependent and ang ii-independent pro-inflammatory signaling 2 ace inhibitors limit breakdown of bradykinin which attenuates hypertension and prevents ventricular apoptosis and remodeling that worsen after sars-cov-2 infection and 3 ace inhibitors suppress tmprss2 expression which is an essential co-receptor for sars-cov-2 cell entry based on the available evidence of clinical studies and previous animal research we believe that there is no reason to discontinue the use of ace inhibitors or arb drugs in patients with covid-19 and hypertension or other cardiovascular comorbidities this recommendation is in accordance with the major professional societies bavishi maddox  messerli 2020 whether ace inhibitorsarbs provide protection in covid-19 patients without history of cvd remains unknown further studies need to be conducted in order to provide a definite answerthis work was supported by grants from the 1013039501100001809national natural science foundation of china 91839302 81630010 and 81790624 and tongji

es025034 to dcz no funding bodies had any role in study design data collection and analysis decision to publish or preparation of the manuscriptthe authors have declared that no competing interests existthe recent severe acute respiratory syndrome sars due to coronavirus 2 cov-2 infection pandemic and subsequent spread of the disease called covid-19 brought back to discussion a topic already highlighted during the sars-cov-1 and coronavirus-related sars known as the middle east respiratory distress syndrome mers of 2002 and 2013 during those outbreaks it was observed a particularly elevated incidence of cardiovascular disease among patients who were also characterized by being elderly and in particular during the mers prevalently male 1 2another main topic of the discussion is the role of the angiotensin-converting enzyme ace 2 indeed this carboxypeptidase has been identified as a functional receptor for the spike protein of the coronaviruses outer membrane including sars-cov-2 3 ace2 is strongly expressed in the epithelium of different organs such as the kidney heart and lungsace2 shares a large affinity to the amino peptidase ace that is target to the ace inhibitors a class of antihypertensive drugs ace inhibitors represent the most used class of cardiovascular agents in the world for the treatment of epidemic cardiovascular conditions such as hypertension and heart failure although not directly inhibited by ace inhibitors ace2 is affected by chronic treatment with this class of drugs which leads to an increase in ace2 expression in several tissues 4 interestingly this feature is also shared by another class of drugs the angiotensin receptor-1 blockers arbs whose chronic administration is as well able to increase the level of expression of ace2 and also its activity as assessed by the circulating levels of the ace2 product angiotensin 17 5 these findings support the concern that the treatment with renin-angiotensin system ras inhibitors could make covid-19 symptoms more severe due to increased expression of ace2remarkably both issues have been re-proposed in the occurrence of the present epidemic of covid-19 in particular the issue of the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases among covid-19 patients is proposed by observational data obtained in chinese 6 and italian patients 7in this context we still lack the analysis of the confounding effects of age on the apparent association between cardiovascular disease covid-19 infection and clinical severity indeed the observed prevalence of male and elderly patients observed especially in the italian covid-19 population is a confounding factor that needs to be corrected for before any conclusive association is drawn this concern has been expressed by many 810similarly the ace2 upregulation argument has never been demonstrated in humans indeed while there is conflicting evidence from animal studies that arbs probably not ace inhibitors may upregulate membrane-bound ace2 in tissue-specific manners eg heart but not kidney these data cannot be extrapolated to humans and are not sufficient to support facilitation of sars-cov-2 entry 9 in particular it has never been demonstrated that the ace2 upregulation in the human lung occurs upon ras inhibition and even less that this causes a worsening of the covid-19 disease furthermore it can also be speculated that ace2 upregulation is protective indeed it has been shown that the binding of coronavirus to ace2 leads to the downregulation of ace2 11 which in turn causes an aceace2 imbalance and to the excessive production of angiotensin ii by the related ace enzyme this excess of angiotensin ii stimulates angiotensin ii receptor type 1 at1r and might cause an increase in pulmonary vascular permeability and lung damage 12 therefore according to this hypothesis the upregulation of ace2 caused by the chronic intake of at1r and ace inhibitors could be protective through two mechanisms first by blocking the increased production of angiotensin 17 which has been advocated as a possible mechanism of protection for the lung second by reducing the production of angiotensin ii it removes a cause of lung damage 13in this context of uncertainty there are advocates within the scientific community raising their voices for the cessation of ace inhibitors and arbs among patients taking these drugs that is claimed for both the prevention of the infection and the attenuation of the symptoms in case of infection these speculative claims are then taken over by the laical press starting a word of mouth that sustains panic behaviors among the general populationthe italian society of hypertension siia therefore takes a clear and firm position in line with statements by other international societies see table 1 siia states the following itemsthere is no evidence to associate hypertension or other cvds with covid-19 disease if hypertension was a predisposing factor for coronavirus infection there should be more hypertensives among covid-19 patients than observed in the general population to date there is no evidence that people with hypertension are overrepresented among those infected with covid-19there is no clinical evidence in humans that associates the intake of ace inhibitors or arbs with covid-19 disease at present we can neither say that they improve nor say they worsen the susceptibility to coronavirus infectionthere are no clinical data in patients that can confirm the harmful effect not even the protective one of ace inhibitors and arb in the context of the covid-19 epidemicfurthermore siia reiterates that subsequent points
aacute suspension without medical control of cardiovascular therapy and specifically of antihypertensive treatment increases the occurrence of acute events including hypertensive emergencies heart failure decompensation heart attacks and strokebthe favorable effects of ace inhibitors and arbs on the control of the progression of cvds in general and in particular of hypertensive patients have been confirmed for many years and for this reason ras inhibitors represent central agents for the management of cardiovascular conditions that cannot be easily substituted 10cin hypertensive patients with covid-19 or at risk of covid-19 infection ace inhibitors and arbs treatment should be maintained according to the recommendations contained in the 2018 escesh guidelines 10dsimilarly in all patients currently on therapy with ace inhibitors arbs and in the case of patients with heart failure also the arnis these drugs must not be suspendedein patients with covid-19 with severe symptoms or sepsis ace inhibitors and arbs like all other antihypertensive drugs should be used or discontinued on a case by case basis taking into account current guidelines
siia hopes and promotes further research that analyzes the constantly increasing data on the impact of hypertension and antihypertensive drugs in particular ace inhibitors and arbs on the clinical course of covid-19 infections in order to update these positions as new evidence becomes availablein particular to clarify which mechanism is prevalent and has a role in the clinical manifestation of covid-19 siia has launched a fact-finding investigation to verify the impact of therapy with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system on the onset and clinical manifestation of the disease covid-19 this observational research is based on an online questionnaire made of 18 questions to collect information on medical history and the evolution of the disease in covid19 patients id nct04331574 clinicaltrialsgovas of 24 may 2020 over 5 millions people in the world have been confirmed as having the 2019 novel coronavirus disease covid-19 an infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 initially called 2019-ncov before 11 february 2020 which is part of the coronaviridae family of positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses that includes sars-cov and mers-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus both of which also cause severe respiratory infections the death count in china so far has been over 1700 but the number is expected to go higher with the increasing number of confirmed and non-confirmed cases the medical research community is vigorously seeking a treatment to control the infection and save the lives of severely infected patientsjust a few weeks after the covid-19 outbreak the complete genome of sars-cov-2 was determined and reported to genbank accession mn908947 viruses were also isolated from patients to understand the genomic characteristics and mechanism of the viral infection as revealed by the analysis the sars-cov-2 shared 79 sequence identity to sars-cov in one study sars-cov-2 was found to be closely related to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-like coronaviruses with 875 and 876 shared identity 1 in another study sars-cov-2 was 96 identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus 2despite the high sequence identity between the sars-cov-2 and the sars-cov in the open reading frame regions the envelop spike protein s-protein 3 which mediates the infection of sars-cov via the human host protein ace-2 has only about 80 shared sequence identity between the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 1 within the s-protein the receptor docking domain has a higher divergence with four out of five critical ace-2 interacting amino acid residues replaced in the sars cov-2 however structural modeling indicated that the four residues in the sars-cov-2 retain a structural conformation similar to that of sars-cov and the sars-cov-2 s-protein should be able to bind ace-2 with reasonable affinity4 indeed studies by zhou et al using cells expressing human ace-2 confirmed that the sars-cov-2 could infect cells via the same protein on ace-2 as sars-cov did 2 thus one option to treat the infection is to search for an inhibitor that can prevent the interaction of the sars-cov-2 s-protein with human ace-2 the availability of the genome sequence of sars-cov-2 allows us to establish structural models for the s-protein 4the rna of coronaviruses encodes polyproteins that can be processed by viral proteases to yield mature proteins the same mechanism is shared by picornaviruses and retroviruses patients treated with protease inhibitors appeared to have much better clinical outcomes than without using the inhibitors sars death 288 vs 24 5 molecular dynamics simulations have revealed that by molecular docking to the active site of the main protease 3cl of sars-cov both lopinavir and ritonavir could induce conformation changes and potentially interfere with infection by sars virus 6 we expect the same will apply for sars-cov-2 the crystal structure of the sars-cov-2 protease 3clpro was just recently reported by liu et al 7 thus another option to treat the sars-cov-2 infection is to search for inhibitors of the sars-cov-2 3clprowith these models and crystal data we performed in silico studies of potential inhibitors of the sars-cov-2 s-protein and 3clprothe 3cl proteases three-dimensional crystal structure was retrieved from the protein data bank pdb id 6lu7 and it was applied as the receptor for molecular docking after a cleaning with chimera the ligands observed ie fda-approved drugs 2454 structures in total were retrieved from the bindingdb httpswwwbindingdborg and the structures of the ligands were further optimized with avogadro the force field applied for geometry optimization was mmff94the sars-cov-2ace-2 structure was retrieved using the function of the comparative modeling of the chimera interface with the modeler version 923 13 for the preparation of the sars-cov-2ace-2 structure the target template sequence was retrieved from zhang et als work and the sars-covace-2 pdb id 6acd served as a template as it was also the top candidate from basic local alignment search tool blast results because sars-cov and sars-cov-2 have an 88 similarity the 3d structure can be predicted with a high accuracy next the sequence alignments were performed using sars-cov as a template then the model was built followed by refining the loops side chain optimization and model optimization when the homology model was generated it was further validated using the whatcheckprocheck program 14 for basic parameters like torsion angle rotational angle bond length etc finally this model was used as receptor for docking purposes the loop refinement and side chain optimization were performed using chimera 114 by selecting the active region all the parameters were the default of the versionit is noteworthy that this calculated work was performed before the crystal structure of the covid-19 s-protein was released 6lzg 6vw1 etc after the crystal structures were released their structures were compared with ours and the structures overlaid well figure 1 with 9322 of its residues in the allowed region and a minor difference on the top right loop which was not a site that interacts with the ace-2 so a re-calculation was not conducted using the new crystal structuresfor the sars-cov-2 3cl inhibition calculation the input files for autodock vina were prepared in the receptors original file pdb format and ligands files sdf format using autodocktools-156 after minimizing the grid box was set at 2200   2200  2200  along the x y and z axis respectively the docking site was defined at 100  when using the autodock vina the grid box was set into the docking site at the h41 c145 and e166 regions according to the docking site of the coronavirus main proteinase 3cl of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars then the receptor file pdbqt format for docking purposes was prepared by the addition of polar only hydrogen atoms the removal of all water molecules and the calculation of the gasteiger charge the instructed command prompts were used for the docking process the docking output file includes the docking energy in kcalmol which is an indication of the binding affinityefficiency of one specific ligand to the receptor molecule and the interaction of the ligands with the receptor hydrogen bond pi-pi stacking etcfor the sars-cov-2 s-protein inhibition calculation the pdb files of the sars-cov-2 s-protein were generated using the homology modeling method in chimera the template used for this was the sars-cov s-protein after minimization the input file was prepared using autodocktools-156 the grid box which was a rectangular shaped area that covered all the possible docking sites of the sars-cov-2 s-protein with its receptor ace-2 was chosen as 2200   4200  2200  along the x y and z axis respectively the docking site was defined at 100  when using the autodock vina then the receptor file pdbqt format for docking purposes was prepared by the addition of polar only hydrogen atoms the removal of all water molecules and the calculation of the gasteiger chargethe docking results were ranked in the order from high to low in different modes according to the docking scores docking energy kcalmol the ligands with the most negative docking scoresie the highest affinitieswere selected for the visualization of the docked complexes using chimera 9the docking energies of the sars-cov-2 s-protein and human ace-2 were calculated using bioluminate 1517 and then compared to the docking energies of the sars-cov s-protein and human ace-2 to verify whether those ligands can be used for blocking the interaction of the s-protein with human ace-2 the docking energies of the sars-cov-2 s-proteinligands and human ace-2 were also calculated the solvation model used was vsgb 18 and the force field chosen was opls2005 19 for all the docking energy predictionstable 1 shows the binding affinity of several ligands with sars-cov-2 3cl protease sorted according to the docking scores binding affinities calculated from the autodock vina figure 2 shows the docking of those with high docking scorestadalafil dasatinib and saquinavirwith the protease in the docking sites of the proteasewe modeled ligands that may bind at a large docking area on the top of the s-protein that interacts with ace-2 red cycle in figure 3a table 2 shows the binding affinities of several ligands with the highest docking scores toward the top docking side of the s-protein figure 3bi shows the dockings of several ligands with the sars-cov-2 s-proteinto understand whether these ligands are reasonably good inhibitors that block the interaction of the sars-cov-2 s-protein with ace-2 the docking energy of the s-proteinligand complex with ace-2 was calculated and the results are listed in table 3 for comparison the docking energy between the sars-cov s-protein and ace-2 was also calculated and the score was 927 kcalmol which was close to the 786 kcalmol reported by xu et als work 4 the docking energy between the sars-cov-2 s-protein and ace-2 was calculated to be 822 kcalmol suggesting a slightly weaker interaction than that of the sars-cov s-protein with ace-2 the observation is similar to that reported by xu et als work 4 table 3 shows that more than half of those ligands docking onto the sars-cov-2 s-protein do not significantly change the interaction of the sars-cov-2 s-protein with ace-2ie they are not inhibitors to block the interaction of the sars-cov-2 s-protein with ace-2 however ergotamine amphotericin b vancomycin zafirlukast and lanicor showed that once they were bound to the s-protein the interactions of these complex with ace-2 were no longer energetically favored interactionsie these ligands acted as desired inhibitors that can efficiently block the interaction of the sars-cov s-protein with ace-2 among these ergotamine and amphotericin b are most promising since they demonstrate the highest docking energy to the sars-cov-2 s-protein table 2 thus they are strongly suggested as the core drugs for clinical trials to treat covid-19 patients considering the severe and potentially lethal side effects of amphotericin b 28 ergotamine and vancomycin seem be the top choicesdisulfiram lopinavir and ritonavir are the three approved and active protease inhibitors against sars and mers indeed lopinavir and ritonavir were successfully used to treat a patient in thailand in jan 2020 our results show that among these ligands saquinavir tadalafil rivaroxaban sildenafil dasatinib vardenafil montelukast are most promising due to their higher docking scores  85 kcalmol which coresponds to  1 m ic50 than others all of these scores appear better than that of the antiviral drug lopinavir 82 kcalmol as a comparison the docking scores reported for lopinavir with the viral rna polymerase is 83 kcalmol 18 it is a remarkable observation that some sars-cov-2 inhibitors such as indinavir could not block the interaction of the sars-cov-2 s-protein with ace-2 while other inhibitors such as ergotamine and amphotericin b can effectively inhibit such interaction this is somewhat confusing since all of these three compounds dock on the same docking site that is marked by the red circles in figure 3the grove between an extended insertion that contains the 56 strands and the receptor-binding motif rbm loop 28 to comprehend what caused the significant difference we overlaid the structures of the three docked compounds and ace-2 on the sars-cov-2 spike protein in figure 4 the comparison clearly shows that ergotamine red and amphotericin b blue extend further out toward the ace-2 and thus effectively block the interaction of the sars-cov-2 spike protein with ace-2 while indinavir green clings to the sars-cov-2 spike protein leaving room for ace-2 to interact with the spike proteinfor the inhibition of the sars-cov-2 3cl protease saquinavir tadalafil rivaroxaban sildenafil dasatinib vardenafil and montelukast are most promising due to their high docking scores  85 kcalmol which were more negative than those of other ligandsamong these that showed an excellent inhibiting property to block the interaction of sars-cov-2 s-protein with ace-2 in table 3 ergotamine amphotericin b and vancomycin are the most promising since they are also among the highest to bind to the sars-cov-2 s-protein as shown in table 2for more active results a combination of 3cl protease inhibitors and ergotamine may be consideredfor many decades the roles of the renin-angiotensin system ras have been studied in physiology and multiple disorders in particular cardiovascular diseases 1 2 angiotensin ii ang ii a key effector peptide of the ras exerts multiple biological functions including the vasoconstriction and sodium balance involved in blood pressure homeostasis angiotensin-converting enzyme ace plays a central role in generating ang ii from angiotensin i ang i 3 4 figure 1
 and ace inhibitors or ang ii receptor blockers exhibit beneficial effects in cardiovascular diseases capillary blood vessels in the lung are a major site of high-level expression of ace 5 thus the lung is an important organ in generating circulating ang ii acting as a classical circulation-borne endocrine system in contrast to this endocrine ras model numerous studies have highlighted the importance of local rass 6 for example an increase in endothelial ace expression in the muscularized intra-acinar arteries of lungs was shown both in patients with pulmonary hypertension 7 and in rats with hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension 8 in addition to ace other components of the ras are expressed in lungs including renin 9 angiotensinogen 10 and ang ii receptors 11in 2000 ace2 a homologue of ace was identified its discovery instantaneously added a new complexity to the ras 12 13 although ace2 functions similarly to ace as a carboxypeptidase ace2 has a different substrate specificity 12 13 14 shown by in vitro analyses using recombinant ace2 protein whereas ace removes dipeptides from the c-terminus of peptide substrates generating the octapeptide ang ii from the decapeptide ang i 3 15 ace2 cleaves a single residue from ang ii generating angiotensin-19 12 13 and a single residue from ang ii to generate angiotensin-17 12 genetic inactivation of ace using homologous recombination results in a phenotype characterized by spontaneous hypotension reduced male fertility and kidney malformation 16 by contrast targeted disruption of murine ace2 resulted in increased systemic ang ii levels and impaired cardiac contractility in aged mice 17 loss of ace on an ace2 background reversed this cardiac phenotype 17 thus ace2 appears to be a negative regulator of the ras and counterbalances the function of ace figure 1the importance of the ras in lung diseases has recently re-emerged since the identification of ace2 as a severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus receptor during several months of 2003 sars  a newly identified illness  spread rapidly from china throughout the world causing more than 800 deaths 18 19 a novel coronavirus was identified as the sars pathogen which triggered atypical pneumonia characterized by high fever and severe dyspnea 18 19 the death rate following sars coronavirus exposure approached almost 10 of infected people owing to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards ards is the most severe form of acute lung injury and is characterized by pulmonary oedema accumulation of inflammatory cells and severe hypoxia 20 21 clinical as well as experimental animal studies have implicated ace in the pathogenesis of ards 22 23 24 ace2 is expressed in the lungs of healthy and diseased humans 25 and recent ards and sars studies have shown that ace2 protects murine lungs from severe acute injury 26 27 importantly these experiments also revealed that ace2 is an essential receptor for sars infections in vitro and in vivo 27 28 in this review we review the role of the ras in particular of the sars receptor ace2 in lung diseases focusing on pulmonary hypertension pulmonary fibrosis and acute lung injury the possible applications of blocking the ras andor modulating ace2 for the treatment of lung diseases are discussedpulmonary hypertension is characterized by elevations in pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance caused by multiple etiologies including primary pulmonary hypertension chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd high altitude or pulmonary embolism abnormal pulmonary vasoconstriction and pulmonary vascular remodeling are major pathological features seen in most forms of pulmonary hypertension 29 30 although ang ii is well known as a potent vasopressor peptide in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension ang ii seems to play a role in pulmonary vascular remodeling rather than pulmonary vasoconstriction in in vitro cell culture models ang ii has been shown to directly cause growthproliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells largely through ang ii type i at1 rather than through type ii at2 receptors 31 figure 1 in pulmonary hypertension in vivo the expression of ace is increased in the endothelial layer of small as well as elastic pulmonary arteries 7 32 in addition in hypoxic but not monocrotaline-treated 33 pulmonary hypertensive rats both ang ii binding and the number of at1 receptors are increased 34 35in human patients an association between an ace insertiondeletion polymorphism the d allele of the human ace gene confers increased ace activity in plasma and pulmonary hypertension has been reported this association is however controversial for instance one study showed that the ace dd genotype is associated with less right ventricular hypertrophy 36 whereas another reported a correlation between the ace dd genotype and the severity of symptoms 37 pharmacologic treatment of animals with either an ace blocker or an ang ii receptor antagonist inhibited pulmonary vascular remodeling associated with the development of pulmonary hypertension in chronically hypoxic rats or mice 38 39 or in monocrotaline-treated rats 40 by contrast tissue ace-deficient mice which exhibit undetectable lung ace activity but retain 34 of the ace activity in plasma show the same remodeling of pulmonary arterioles as do wild-type mice 41 in addition despite earlier studies of acute ace inhibition 42 43 44 a recent pilot study on patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to copd showed that treatment with the at1 receptor blocker losartan 50 mg showed no statistically significant beneficial effect in terms of pulmonary artery pressure exercise capacity or breathlessness score 45 the discrepancy between hypoxic rat studies and this human trial might be caused by differences in the pathogenesis of hypoxic rats versus patients with copd-related pulmonary hypertension further studies are required to solve these important issuespulmonary fibrosis is a frequent response to insults or injuries to the lung etiologies include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis sarcoidosis irradiation-induced pneumonitis or ards excess deposition of extracellular matrix proteins is a key feature of interstitial fibrosis in the lung the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis includes endothelial and epithelial cell injury influx of inflammatory cells and the production of chemical mediators leading to the proliferation and activation of fibroblasts 46 47 although there are various initiating mechanisms and etiologies the terminal phases of fibrosis are commonly characterized by the proliferation and progressive accumulation of connective tissue replacing normal functional parenchymaang ii immunoreactivity is also significantly increased within lung fibroblasts macrophages and bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium after irradiation 48 in addition angiotensinogen is produced by fibroblasts from fibrotic but not normal human lung ang ii upregulates the expression of the profibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor-1 which is involved in both the conversion of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts and the accumulation of collagen 49 figure 1 an in vivo role for ang ii in pulmonary fibrosis has been implied from animal models with bleomycin- or irradiation-mediated lung injury in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats or mice ace inhibitors or at1 receptor blockers can attenuate epithelial apoptosis interstitial fibrosis and collagen deposition 50 51 52 in irradiation-induced lung fibrosis ace inhibitors attenuate endothelial dysfunction and fibrosis in rats 53 conversely retrospective comparison of the incidence of irradiation-induced lung injury between subjects who took ace inhibitors and those who did not failed to reveal a protective effect 54 however serum concentrations of ace inhibitors used by subjects in the human study would be expected to be considerably less than those achieved in the animal models cited above as there are no published prospective or retrospective studies regarding the use of other ace inhibitors or at1 receptor blockers in human pulmonary fibrosis induced by factors other than irradiation it is therefore still unclear if inhibition of the ras would indeed have beneficial effects on lung fibrosisards is the most severe form of acute lung injury and affects approximately one million individuals worldwideyear with a mortality rate of at least 3050 20 21 ards can be triggered by multiple diseases such as sepsis aspiration trauma acute pancreatitis or pneumonias following infections with sars coronavirus or avian and human influenza viruses recent cohort studies of ards showed a significant association between an ace insertiondeletion polymorphism and the susceptibility and outcome of ards 23 24 the dd genotype frequency was increased in patients with ards compared with a control cohort 23 in addition the ace dd allele was significantly associated with mortality in the ards group 23 another study showed that patients carrying the ace ii genotype have a significantly increased survival rate 24 thus from the results of inhibitor experiments in rodents 22 and ace allelic correlation studies in humans 23 24 it has been suggested that the ras could play a role in acute lung failureour group has investigated the role of ace2 in ards by using ace2 knockout mice in acid-aspiration-induced ards endotoxin-induced ards and peritoneal sepsis-induced ards ace2 knockout mice exhibited severe disease compared with control mice that express ace2 26 loss of ace2 expression in mutant mice resulted in enhanced vascular permeability increased lung edema neutrophil accumulation and worsened lung function importantly treatment with catalytically active but not enzymatically inactive recombinant ace2 protein improved the symptoms of acute lung injury in wild-type mice as well as in ace2 knockout mice 26 thus ace2 plays a protective role in acute lung injury mechanistically the negative regulation of ang ii levels by ace2 accounts in part for the protective function of ace2 in ards for example at1 receptor inhibitor treatment or additional ace gene deficiency on an ace2 knockout background rescues the severe phenotype of ace2 single mutant mice in acute lung injury 26 in addition ace knockout mice and at1a receptor knockout mice showed improved symptoms of acute lung injury 26 therefore in acute lung injury ace ang ii and at1 receptors function as lung injury-promoting factors 26 55 whereas ace2 protects against lung injury 26 figure 2
 these findings suggest that the beneficial effects of ace inhibitors or at1 receptor blockers in lung injury models induced by bleomycin or irradiation observed in the earlier studies derive largely from their effects on the acute phase of those injurieswithin a few months following the publication of the sars-cov genome 56 57 ace2 was identified as a potential receptor in cell line studies in vitro 28 ace2 has been demonstrated to bind sars-cov spike and to support syncytia formation the fusion of spike-protein-expressing cells into large multinucleated cells that can also be seen in real sars infections using a mouse sars infection model with ace2 knockout mice our group provided evidence that ace2 is indeed essential for sars infections in vivo 27 when ace2 knockout mice are infected with the sars coronavirus they become resistant to virus infection 27 virus titers from the lung tissues of infected ace2 knockout mice were 105-fold lower than those isolated from the lung of sars-cov-infected wild-type mice 27 the lung histology from ace2 knockout mice challenged with sars coronavirus showed no signs of inflammation 27 whereas some but not all sars-infected wild-type mice displayed mild inflammation with leukocyte infiltration 27 58 thus ace2 is an essential receptor for sars infections in vivodespite many studies on sars-cov the reasons why sars-cov infections trigger severe lung disease with such a high mortality in contrast to other coronaviruses remain a mystery accumulating evidence indicates that severe sars infections are dependent upon the burden of viral replication as well as on the immunopathologic consequences of the host response for review see 59 60 in addition to the aberrant activation of immune systems our own studies have implicated the involvement of the ras in sars pathogenesis firstly ace2 is a critical sars receptor in vivo and secondly ace2 and other components of the ras play a central role in controlling the severity of acute lung failure once the disease process has been initiated 27 figure 2 intriguingly wild-type mice infected with sars-cov showed markedly downregulated ace2 expression in lungs 27 similarly treatment with recombinant sars-spike protein in the absence of any other virus components downregulates ace2 expression in vitro and in vivo 27 thus sars-cov-infected or spike protein-treated wild-type mice resemble ace2 knockout mice and similar to ace2 mutant mice spike-treated wild-type mice show markedly more severe pathology of acute lung injury additionally in spike-treated mice ang ii peptide levels were increased and the worsened ards symptoms could be partially reversed by at1 receptor blocker treatment 27 by contrast spike does not affect the ards symptoms in ace2 knockout mice 27 thus the downregulation of ace2 expression in sars-cov infections might play a causal role in sars pathogenesis especially in disease progression to ardsang ii plays roles in tissue remodeling and fibrotic changes through acting on fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells thereby contributing to the pathogenesis or progression of pulmonary fibrosis or pulmonary hypertension this notion is strongly supported by the successful treatment of these disease conditions using ace inhibitors or at1 receptor blockers in animal models however pilot clinical trials have failed to observe significant beneficial effects of ace inhibitors on radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis or positive effects of at1 receptor blockers on copd-related pulmonary hypertension recently the critical importance of the ras in the pathogenesis of acute lung disease ie ardsacute lung injury has emerged hypothetically the ras appears to contribute to the initial severity of lung diseases rather than to later stages that define chronic fibrosis and tissue remodeling in line with this notion the dd polymorphism of the ace gene has been associated with the incidence of pneumonias in japanese elderly patients 61 and mortality of ards patients 23 24 importantly ace2 has been identified as a key sars receptor and ace2 protects murine lungs from acute lung injury induced by acid aspiration endotoxin shock peritoneal sepsis or sars spike challenge these findings might provide the opportunity to develop ace2 as a novel drug for ards that develops in emerging lung infectious diseases such as avian influenza a h5n1 62 or other diseases that affect lung function 63 because ace2 is an non-specific protease it would also be interesting to investigate the role of ace2 and its metabolites including angiotensin-17 des-arg9-bradykinin apelin and dynorphin in ards 14 we look forward to the use of angiotensin system-modulating agentsmolecules in particular ace2 as novel therapeutic agents to treat severe acute lung failure a syndrome that currently affects millions of people without any effective drug treatmentpapers of particular interest published within the annual period of review have been highlighted

the world is currently faced with the outbreak of a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov the new virus sars-cov-2 emerged in december 2019 in the city of wuhan china and is the causative agent of a respiratory syndrome now known as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-1912 efforts aimed at curbing the spread of sars-cov-2 and finding effective treatments are ongoingearly epidemiological observations indicate that sars-cov-2 infects all age groups but older men with chronic illnesses may be more severely affected there is a preponderance of men 581 compared with women 419 testing positive for covid-192 and in the previous sars-cov epidemic in 2003 men had a higher mortality than women 219 vs 132 p  000013 whether men with the current sars-cov-2 virus also have a worse mortality outcome is becoming apparent as recent report indicate that 70 of patients that died of covid-19 in italy were men4 and mainly elderlythe increased vulnerability of older people with cardiovascular disease and comorbid conditions could be related to increased concentrations of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace256 and ace2 is known to be increased in heart failure7 ace2 is not only an enzyme but also a functional receptor on cell surfaces for both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 and is highly expressed in the heart testis kidneys and lungs812 and shed into the plasma some reports have suggested that inhibitors of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas increase plasma ace2 concentrations513 although these speculations are not supported by a substantial body of researchwe therefore investigated plasma concentrations of ace2 in two large and independent cohorts of men and women with heart failure according to the use of raas inhibitorsfrom the biology study to tailored

disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has abruptly reached pandemic proportions sars-cov-2 is a member of the betacoronavirus family as well as sars-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and mers-cov middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus since the beginning of 2020 the number of confirmed cases of covid-19 has dramatically increased worldwide leaping to more than a million by march 2020 1 although the majority of covid-19 patients develop mild to moderate clinical features 2 severe pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multi-organ failure leading to high death rate may develop notably marked sex differences have emerged in covid-19 prevalence and prognosis in particular the age-specific risk of disease is reported to be significantly higher in males than in females except under the age of 50 years moreover the age-specific risks of death and hospitalization is at least two fold higher in males than in females among all age ranges 3 furthermore patients with advanced age and underlying pathologies mainly hypertension diabetes and cardiovascular disease cvd are more prone to experience severe form of the disease 4 even though the overall mortality considerably varies among countries the fatality-rate by age groups displays very similar patterns rising consistently in the 6069-year age group 5 importantly the presence of comorbidities further increases mortality in a sample of 355 patients who died of covid-19 in italy the prevalence of diabetes was 355 5 not so differently from covid-19 the spread of diabetes has known no boundaries and the number of affected people has reached nearly half a billion worldwide 6 the number of deaths attributed to diabetes and its complications was around 42 million in 2019 6 notably more than 65 of diabetic patients are over 65 years old 7 thus although with extremely different connotations covid-19 and diabetes are two pandemics that share the burden of a wide diffusion in the elderly population and a dramatic impact on global mortality and economic health resourcesthis short review is focused on some open questions emerging from the effort to fully understand the link between covid-19 and diabetes mainly in the context of possible harmful or beneficial effects of commonly used drugs in patients with diabetes on the course of covid-19 infectiondiabetes is reportedly a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide a conceivable link between diabetes and infectious diseases has been postulated in particular lower respiratory tract infections are known to be rather common and severe in the elderly with type 2 diabetes t2d 8 although evidence suggests that diabetes is unlikely to significantly increase the susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection a higher risk of worse covid-19 progression and outcomes has been observed 9 the mechanisms underlying this association are not completely clear yet but the exacerbated pro-inflammatory cascade and the impaired immune response in diabetic patients with covid-19 are suspected to be crucially involved in particular increased levels of pro-inflammatory markers such as leukocyte and neutrophil count pro-calcitonin c-reactive protein ferritin and circulating cytokines that trigger the cytokine storm namely il-6 il-8 il-2 receptor tnf- have been detected in diabetic patients with severe covid-19 compared to patients without diabetes 10 furthermore an altered immune response in diabetic patients possibly due to impaired lymphocyte neutrophil and monocytemacrophage function has been long hypothesised especially in the presence of poorly controlled glycaemia 11 12 higher concentrations of d-dimer and fibrinogen hallmarks of severe forms of covid-19 have been also reported in patients with diabetes compared to patients without diabetes suggesting that these patients might be more prone to develop coagulation abnormalities in the course of the infection known to be significantly associated with worse prognosis 10 13in a recent retrospective study involving chinese patients n  904 with moderate severe or critical disease the major risk factors for mortality and poor outcomes were evaluated among the enrolled patients 15 n  136 had diabetes including t2d type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes overall diabetes increased the odds of in-hospital death and poor prognosis diabetic patients were older and had significant alterations of several laboratory parameters associated with poor prognosis compared to patients without diabetes in particular they had higher levels of d-dimer while female diabetic patients had increased ldh and neutrophil count compared to non-diabetic patients cvd was more common in men with diabetes than in non-diabetic men notably in multivariable regression analysis insulin therapy was independently associated with poor prognosis c-reactive protein was the only independent risk factor for either mortality or poor prognosis in patients with covid-19 and diabetes 14 besides this further research is also needed to clarify whether hypoglycaemia might also contribute to adverse outcomes and increased mortality in covid-19 patients with diabetes 15patients with diabetes have high prevalence of high blood pressure and are at increased risk of cvd 16 hence the treatment of hypertension largely includes drug classes that have demonstrated to reduce cardiovascular events such as angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs 17 since ace converts angiotensin i into angiotensin ii a potent vasoconstrictor and sodium-retentive agent the blockage of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas leads to an effective reduction in blood pressure ace shows homology with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 the receptor to which the transmembrane spike glycoprotein on the surface of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 binds allowing the internalization of the virus by the alveolar cells and other cell types 18 ace2 which is clearly not a direct target of ace inhibitors is a ubiquitous mono-carboxypeptidase that converts angiotensin ii into the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic angiotensin-17 contrasting its potent vasoconstrictor sodium-retentive pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects indeed angiotensin-17 binding to the mas receptor induces nitric oxide release protecting against tissue injury 19 another known substrate of ace2 is angiotensin i which is converted into angiotensin-19 20 21 the latter is in turn converted into angiotensin-17 by ace therefore competing with angiotensin ii for its binding 22limited animal and in vitro studies have reported an upregulation of ace2 induced by arbs and to a far lesser extent by ace inhibitors predominantly in the heart and in the kidney the effect is partly explained by an increase in local levels of angiotensin ii induced by arbs but not by ace inhibitors 20 indeed arbs block angiotensin ii type 1 at1 receptors and consequently increase the availability of the substrate angiotensin ii which upregulates ace2 21 based on this assumption it has been speculated that the treatment with arbs and ace inhibitors might favour the entry of sars-cov-2 into the lung cells therefore increasing the risk for adverse outcomes and severe forms of covid-19 infectionconversely a beneficial effect of a background therapy with arb on the course of the disease has been supposed two complex mechanisms might support this hypothesis firstly angiotensin ii by binding to its receptor at1 might enhance the shedding of trans-membrane ace2 promoted by adam17 a disintegrin and metalloprotease therefore releasing soluble ace2 locally the soluble form of ace2 is unable to mediate sars-cov-2 internalization as it is no longer annexed to the cell membrane 21 secondly the up-regulation of ace2 probably induced by arbs might not necessarily have negative effects as sars-cov-2 internalization in the lung cells inevitably induces the downregulation of ace2 the increase in its substrate angiotensin ii a potent vasoconstrictor and pro-inflammatory agent might contribute to an exacerbation of lung injury indeed in animal models of lung injury a clear association between the activation of the angiotensin ii-at1 signalling and the severity of lung damage has been observed while the detrimental effects of this cascade are counterbalanced by the activation of the ace2-angiotensin-17-mas receptor axis 23 specifically in models of sepsis or acid aspiration which frequently cause acute lung injury and ards ace2 knockout mice experienced a more severe tissue damage characterized by marked inflammatory cell infiltration increased vascular permeability lung oedema and bleeding compared to wild-type mice similarly angiotensin ii type 2 at2 receptors knockout mice had a more marked lung damage in the same models the injection of recombinant human ace2 protein into ace2 knockout mice considerably decreased the severity of lung injury 24 in line with these findings the pre-treatment with recombinant human ace2 was able to reduce inflammatory cell infiltration and tissue injury in a mouse model of respiratory syncytial virus infection 25 evidence from clinical studies is still rather limited in patients with ards recombinant human ace2 increased angiotensin-17 and decreased angiotensin-ii concentrations even though the study was prematurely discontinued for the lack of clinical improvement 26 overall evidence from animal models suggests a conceivable pneumo-protective role of both ace2 and at2 receptor in the context of lung injury a loss of pulmonary ace2 might therefore have harmful effects exacerbating inflammation and promoting respiratory distress and fibrosis in the same way the activation of ace angiotensin ii and at1 receptor axis might exert detrimental effects worsening lung damage the rationale of raas inhibition is therefore counterbalancing these effects by reducing angiotensin ii and increasing ace2 notably arb and ace inhibitors attenuated lps-induced lung injury in several preclinical studies 2731 recently milne et al analysed gene expression of ace2 ace agtr1 encoding for at1 tmprss2 transmembrane protease serine 2 requested cofactor for the internalization of sars-cov-2 and adam17 in a large number of healthy lung tissue samples collected from patients undergoing lung resection for cancer a significant association between use of ace inhibitors and reduced ace2 gene expression was observed differently the use of arbs was not linked to relevant changes in ace2 expression but was significantly correlated to increased ace and decreased agtr1 expression 32 although these findings are quite in contrast with data from animal studies it should be highlighted that gene expression rather than protein concentration was analysed and that the collected tissue samples did not exhibit lung injury or ards covid-19 results in severe lung damage and an imbalance of the raas system in this context cannot be excluded recently in a pilot study covid-19 patients were found to have higher levels of circulating angiotensin ii compared to healthy subjects and a correlation between angiotensin ii concentration and the severity of the disease was observed as well 33 thus the effects of ace inhibitors and arbs might be very different in extremely damaged context and should be therefore explored in animal models of covid-19mounting evidence from recent clinical studies suggests that raas inhibitor use is not related to an increased risk of covid-19 infection or poor outcomes in a retrospective cohort study of 18472 patients screened for covid-19 test positivity was not significantly associated with ace inhibitor or arb therapy 34 similarly in a us study no relationship emerged between prior ace inhibitor or arb use and the increased likelihood of a positive sars-cov-2 test result adjusting for relevant confounding factors 35 in an italian community-based casecontrol study no association was found between ace inhibitor or arb treatment and covid-19 infection although the use of these drugs was rather frequent due to high prevalence of cvd 36 overall these findings excluded an increased risk of covid-19 infection in patients already treated with raas inhibitorsother studies have evaluated the link between covid-19 progression and raas inhibitor therapy in a recent korean population-based cohort study involving 5179 covid-19 patients the use of ace inhibitors or arbs was not associated with a higher mortality risk after adjustment for confounders 37 in a recent systematic review including a total of n  23565 covid-19 patients from different countries ace inhibitor or arb use was not associated with increased severity of covid-19 illness 38 interestingly in a meta-analysis of more than 19000 covid-19 patients from seven cohort studies and five casecontrol studies the use of raas inhibitors was not linked to a higher risk of covid-19 infection severity or mortality whereas mortality risk was significantly lower in patients treated with ace inhibitors or arbs compared to those treated with other antihypertensive drugs 39taking together data from observational studies indicates that raas inhibitor therapy is unlikely to have a negative impact on the course of the infection however whether patients with covid-19 might take advantage of initiating these drugs or not in terms of disease progression and outcomes should be explored in clinical trials which are still ongoingcvd is a well-known major complications of diabetes the risk of developing cvd is 2- to fivefold higher in patients with t2d than in non-diabetic patients mainly due to diabetes-related coronary atherosclerosis 40 in addition diabetic cardiomyopathy may occur independently of coronary artery disease likely developing from t helper 1 driven responses within the cardiomyocyte 41 42 besides the common clinical features of covid-19 cardiovascular damage may occur in nearly 12 of patients 43 being a cause of major concern due to a high related mortality the mechanisms underlying this complication are largely unknown the direct viral damage and the destabilization of coronary plaques reportedly are suspected to play a consistent role notably in a sample of 187 patients with covid-19 guo et al observed that the presence of background coronary heart disease or cardiomyopathy was associated with frequent occurrence of myocardial damage highlighted by a marked increase in serum troponin t in the course of the disease 44 accordingly mortality was considerably higher among patients with myocardial injury and concomitant cvd 694 than in patients without cvd 375 remarkably a considerable percentage of patients displaying myocardial injury had diabetes 30 compared to patients without myocardial injury 89 myocardial injury may therefore contribute to the poorer outcomes observed in diabetic patients with covid-19 45 of note patients with myocardial injury were more prone to develop malignant arrhythmias ards coagulopathy and acute kidney injury which explained high mortality 44 importantly ace inhibitors and arbs were broadly used in patients with myocardial injury but mortality did not significantly differ between treated and non-treated patients although consistent evidence excluding harms or suggesting benefits of raas inhibitors on covid-19 patients with hearth injury is lacking most arbs were able to increase ace2 expression in the hearts of animal models of arterial hypertension 46 even in this pathological context the possible effects of these drugs should be further elucidated as the down-regulation of ace2 in cardiomyocytes and in blood vessels induced by sars-cov2 internalization might exacerbate myocardial injury and endothelial dysfunction compromising heart function in patients with diabetes and underlying cvd 20 47in addition patients with t2d have high rate of lipid alterations and statins are the first line therapy for dyslipidaemia remarkably evidence from preclinical studies suggests that statins might modulate ace2 expression in several tissues including the heart it has been observed that atorvastatin increased ace2 protein expression in the heart and in the kidney of rabbits with atherosclerosis 48 in another study diabetic rats displayed significantly lower expression of ace2 and impaired systolic and diastolic function compared to control rats and the combined treatment with insulin and fluvastatin was associated with higher levels of ace2 compared to non-treated diabetic rats 49ace2 is a multi-substrate enzyme and is a targeted by several molecules although extremely limited there is evidence in animal studies that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ppar- agonists which are insulin-sensitizer drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes t2d might increase the expression of ace2 in different tissues in an animal model of hypertension the insulin-sensitizer rosiglitazone modulated the ace2angiotensin-17angiotensin ii axis in aortic tissue and lowered blood pressure by increasing the expression of ace2 50 similarly in high fat diet fed rats an animal model of obesity pioglitazone increased the expression of ace2 in insulin-sensitive tissues liver adipose tissue and skeletal muscle likely through the modulation of renin-angiotensin system 51ace2 is widely distributed in human tissues and remarkably its expression was found to be even lower in the lung than in other sites 4 hence other mediators are thought to play a role in facilitating sars-cov-2 infection the priming by the serine protease tmprss2 is requested for the binding of ace2 and the internalization of sars-cov-2 tmprss2 cleaves the s protein in s1 and s2 subunits a necessary step for membrane fusion and viral internalization which contextually drags ace2 into the alveolar cells 18 in light of this both antibodies targeting s-protein and tmprss2 inhibitors might prevent sars-cov-2 entry in lung cell 18 individuating other possible candidate co-receptors is therefore of great importance for the development of new therapeutic strategies to contrast the infectiondpp4 is a ubiquitously expressed cell surface exopeptidase with important metabolic functions it mainly regulates the bioactivity of gut-derived hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 glp-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide gip they stimulate insulin secretion in response to oral glucose administration known as the incretin effect 52 the dpp4 inhibitors dpp4i are commonly used drugs for the treatment of t2d they prevent the degradation of incretins by inhibiting the catalytic activity of dpp4 as a result -cell insulin secretion is potentiated and glycaemia is significantly reduced independently of its catalytic function dpp4 displays inflammatory and immune functions 53 indeed it is expressed mainly by t-lymphocytes and is involved in their activation and proliferation 54 interestingly pro-inflammatory factors significantly increase dpp4 expression in circulating immune cells 55 unlike sars-cov and sars-cov-2 which binds to ace2 to entry into lung cells dpp4 is the functional receptor for mers-cov 56 hence several mouse and human monoclonal antibodies preventing protein s binding to dpp4 have given promising results for the treatment of mers 57 of note it has been recently reported that dpp4 shares patterns of expression with ace2 in the lung precisely in alveolar type 2 cells the main target of sars-cov-2 58 vankadari et al have recently set up a docking model of dpp4 and the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein 59 they predicted several dpp4 residues that might be involved in the interaction with sars-cov-2 s1 domain of the spike protein also targeted by other coronaviruses that enter the host cells through the functional receptor dpp4 however further validation is needed to draw conclusions and to establish whether the possible adhesion between dpp4 and spike protein may play a role in sars-cov-2 infection consequently there are some important issues to be addressed before claiming possible beneficial effects of dpp4 modulation on covid-19 60 according to data from chen et al in patients with diabetes and moderate-severe covid-19 the use of dpp4i did not significantly impact on mortality and clinical outcomes 14the presence of diabetes considerably influences the course of covid-19 infection being a risk factor for poor outcomes in limited preclinical studies ace2 expression was found to be modulated by several players in different tissues most of them are largely employed in the treatment of diabetes such as antihypertensive and to a considerably lesser extent insulin-sensitizers and statins in light of this the potential harmful or protective effects of these treatments in covid-19 infection might be an interesting soil for further research to date data supporting that these drugs clearly interfere with sars-cov-2 access in lung cells or in other tissues are completely lacking it should be stressed that in the absence of evidence from consistent clinical studies the discontinuation or the adoption of these therapies in the attempt to influence the course of the infection is strongly discouragedwhether the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs mitigates or exacerbates sars-cov-2 infection remains unknown1 experts have postulated based on the effect of the drugs and the mechanism of virus entry that ace inhibitors and arbs could be beneficial harmful or have no effect on people infected with sars-cov-213 evaluations of the mechanism of action of these drugs also suggests differences between the outcomes of patients with ace inhibitors and arbs4 there is evidence from randomized controlled trials predating coronavirus disease-19 covid-19 suggesting a decrease in risk of all-cause pneumonia with ace inhibitors an effect not observed with arbs5recent studies that have focused on the association of ace inhibitors and arbs with the risk of mortality among patients hospitalized with covid-19 suggest that these drugs are not harmful6 with some suggesting that ace inhibitors may reduce this risk of in-hospital death179 these studies were limited by their designs which lacked an active comparator47 moreover no large national study has addressed the association of these drugs with outcomes among individuals in the outpatient setting infected with sars-cov-2 the issue is important because these drugs are widely available and inexpensive and if beneficial could modify disease course and improve outcomes alternatively if they increase risk they could be compounding the harm caused by the virusaccordingly we sought to conduct a large national study of the association of ace inhibitors and arbs with outcomes in patients with hypertension we specifically evaluated the association of the use of ace inhibitors and arbs among patients with hypertension so that we could have an active comparator other antihypertensive agents also to provide information about the association in inpatients we conducted a study of the association of ace inhibitors and arbs on mortality among people with hypertension who were hospitalized with covid-19 we stratified all our assessments by insurance groups due to substantial differences between the two populationswe conducted 2 studies of patients with hypertension  the first study included individuals who tested positive for sars-cov-2 as an outpatient and the second included patients hospitalized with covid-19 in addition to a diagnosis of hypertension we prespecified our study population to include individuals that were receiving at least 1 antihypertensive agent further to account for medical comorbidities we created robust propensity score matched cohorts of patients treated with ace inhibitors arbs and other antihypertensive agents we evaluated the success of our matching algorithms through explicit assessments of covariate balance across all comparisons and evaluation of exposure groups on falsification endpointsdue to systematic differences among enrollees in medicare advantage and commercial insurance programs and the enhanced risk of adverse outcomes with covid-19 among older individuals who are overrepresented in medicare1013 we evaluated the association of these drugs with outcomes in analyses stratified by insurance groupswe used de-identified administrative claims for medicare advantage and commercially insured members in a research database from a single large us health insurance provider the database contains medical emergency inpatient outpatient and pharmacy claims for services submitted for third party reimbursement available as international classification of diseases tenth revision clinical modification icd-10-cm and national drug codes ndc claims respectively these claims are aggregated after completion of care encounters and submission of claims for reimbursementthere were two additional data sources that included information on covid-19 and could be linked to the claims first the limited outpatient testing dataset included information on sars-cov-2 test results for members who underwent outpatient testing for sars-cov2 at 49 hospital-based free-standing outpatient and third-party labs in all states across the united states with over 90 of tests submitted by third-party lab vendors second the inpatient covid-19 dataset included a daily-updated record of covid-19 inpatient admissions for all insurance enrollees with claims information representing those admitted to a hospital with a primary or secondary diagnosis of covid-19 etable 1 along with their current disposition admitted discharged transferred expired or unknownwe constructed cohorts of patients for each of the two studies first for the outpatient study we identified outpatients who tested positive for sars-cov-2 we included individuals at least 18 years of age with at least 6 months of enrollment in medicare advantage or commercial insurance from january through december 2019 and available claims data a diagnosis of hypertension in one or more claims and receiving one or more anti-hypertensive agents and tested positive for sars-cov-2 positive in an outpatient setting between march 6 2020 and may 3 2020 efigure 1 the medicare advantage and commercially insured individuals in the study represented all individuals with available claims in the unitedhealth groups clinical research database that satisfied the inclusion criteria we evaluated the association of ace inhibitors and arbs respectively on the risk of hospitalization in this outpatient cohort compared with patients on other antihypertensive medicationssecond for the second inpatient study we identified an inpatient cohort of adults hospitalized with covid-19 this included all patients age 18 years with at least 6 months of health insurance enrollment in 2019 with available claims data a diagnosis of hypertension in one or more claims were receiving one or more anti-hypertensive agents and were hospitalized with a principal or secondary diagnosis of covid-19 between january 5 2020 and may 10 2020 efigure 2 we evaluated the association of ace inhibitors and arbs respectively on the mortality of hospitalized individuals in this cohort compared with patients on other antihypertensive medicationsfor both studies a diagnosis of hypertension was based on icd-10 codes etable 1 and drug treatment for hypertension was defined by the receipt of one or more agents included in the 2017 american heart association hypertension guidelines14 these include first-line agents of ace inhibitors arbs thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics and dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers as well as second-line agents of beta-adrenergic antagonists alpha blockers centrally acting alpha agonists loop diuretics potassium sparing diuretics mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and direct vasodilators individual drugs listed in etable 2 the information on the latter was derived from pharmacy claims and was defined by a cumulative supply greater than 30 days between july 1 2019 and december 31 2019we identified 2 mutually exclusive exposure groups 1 patients receiving ace inhibitors and 2 those receiving arb with or without other agents we used an active comparator for these analyses that included all remaining patients with a diagnosis of hypertension who received one or more anti-hypertensive agents from drug classes other than ace inhibitor or arb these agents include all first and second line antihypertensive agents based on the 2017 aha guidelines for hypertension14 with the use of individual agents defined by one or more pharmacy claims for at least 30 days of medication supply for the agent between july and december 2019 in sensitivity analyses we restricted the control group to individuals receiving at least one first line anti-hypertensive agent from drug classes other than ace inhibitor or arbwe combined information from inpatient and outpatient claims in 2019 to identify potential confounders of the association of the ace inhibitors and arb use and patient outcomes we included patient age sex race conditions that would represent potential indications for selective use of ace inhibitors or arbs diabetes myocardial infarction heart failure and chronic kidney disease and each of the additional comorbidities included in the charlson comorbidity index peripheral vascular disease cerebrovascular disease hemi- or paraplegia dementia chronic pulmonary disease rheumatologic disease diabetes with chronic complications malignancy metastatic solid tumor mild liver disease moderate-to-severe liver disease acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or human immunodeficiency virus the icd-10 codes corresponding to these variables are included in etable 1 appendix race was available only for medicare advantage members we included information on the total number of anti-hypertensive agents prescribed to patients using pharmacy claims finally regional clustering of cases was identified using location of sites submitting claims for laboratory testing for sars-cov-2 and hospital site for in-hospital outcomesin the outpatient study the primary outcome was inpatient hospitalization for covid-19 defined as a hospitalization with a principal or a secondary diagnosis of covid-19 in a linked inpatient dataset etable 1 we assessed mortality during this inpatient hospitalization as a secondary outcomein the inpatient study the primary outcome was in-hospital mortality in addition we evaluated a secondary composite outcome of death or discharge to hospice and hospital length of stayin both outpatient and inpatient studies we created propensity score-matched cohorts of patients with hypertension treated with ace inhibitors arbs or other antihypertensive medications for this we constructed a non-parsimonious multivariable logistic regression model with receipt of ace inhibitors arb or other antihypertensive as the dependent variable for example we modeled the receipt ace inhibitor or another other anti-hypertensive excluding arb to determine each patients likelihood of receiving these agents based on their measured clinical characteristics we applied this strategy to different pairs of treatment comparisons ace inhibitor vs others arb vs others and ace inhibitor vs arb briefly we performed 11 matching between recipients based on propensity scores with a caliper width of one-tenth of the standard deviation of the logit of the propensity score4 we pursued 100 iterations to find the lowest mean absolute standardized difference among matched variables we matched our cohorts on age gender race insurance type conditions that may lead to selective use of ace inhibitors and arbs ie diabetes myocardial infarction heart failure and chronic kidney disease each of the comorbidities in the charlson comorbidity index and the number of anti-hypertensive agents used for the patient to account for regional clustering of care practices and response to the covid-19 pandemic we explicitly accounted for census region of lab testing site or inpatient facility in our modelswe evaluated the performance of propensity score matching using several strategies first we assessed the propensity score distributions in the unmatched and matched cohorts and calculated an equipoise metric to summarize the degree of overlap in characteristics of patients receiving these drugs1516 this represents the proportion of individuals in the unmatched groups that had a propensity score between 03 and 07 representing a state of equipoise between the two drugs a value greater than 05 implies two drugs are in empirical equipoise with a higher a value indicating a lower likelihood of confounding by indication15 next we evaluated the standardized difference between matched covariates before and after propensity score matching specifically we evaluated whether our matching algorithm achieved a standardized difference of 10 between matched cohort suggestive of adequately matched groups1617 second we evaluated the success of our matching algorithm using a priori defined negative control outcomes we chose two negative control or falsification endpoints  claims for gastroesophageal reflux disease and ingrown nail - that are unlikely to be affected by the treatment assignment and a directional effect would represent covariate imbalance16 third we evaluated whether our propensity matched cohort were also adequately matched on other therapeutic classes for non-antihypertensive agents that were not directly included in the matching algorithm these strategies were designed to evaluate the potential for residual confounding after creating propensity score matched cohorts finally we evaluated our observations for robustness by assessing treatment effects in 100 iterations of the propensity score matching algorithm evaluating whether our findings were consistent across these iterations that varied on the degree of matching of individual covariateswe describe differences between patients treated with ace inhibitors and arbs compared with other anti-hypertensive agents and between those treated with ace inhibitors using chi square test for categorical variables and t-test for continuous variables as the duration of follow up was expected to vary across individuals in both outpatient and inpatient covid-19 cohorts we evaluated their effects in time-to-event analyses with cox-proportional hazards models in both unadjusted and propensity score-matched cohorts to reduce bias from residual differences in matched covariates in our evaluation of patient outcomes we included the covariates included in our propensity score matching algorithm as independent variables in these models18 we repeated these analyses without this additional covariate adjustmentfor the outpatient study the index date was represented by the day of positive covid-19 test as an outpatient the period of the study was measured in days from the positive covid-19 and the outcome of interest was hospitalization for the inpatient study the index date was represented by the first day of hospitalization with covid-19 the period of the study was measured in days from admission and the outcome of interest was death since hospitalization could end with either patients death or being discharged alive we created a cause-specific cox proportional hazards model which is a competing risk analysis1921 both analyses were censored at the end of the observation period on may 10 2020given systematic differences between patients enrolled in medicare advantage and commercial insurance particularly with older age higher comorbidity burden and higher risk of covid-19 complications among medicare advantage enrollees we evaluated quantitative and qualitative interactions between insurance type and treatment groups for the assessment of our outcomes we also created propensity score-matched cohorts within the each of the two insurance subgroupsanalyses were performed using open source r 340 cran and python 382 all hypothesis tests were 2-sided with a level of significance set at 005 except for interaction tests where the level of significance was set at 010 given the exploratory nature of study statistical tests were not adjusted for multiple testing the yale institutional review board and the unitedhealth group office of human research affairs exempted this study from other review as all activities were limited to retrospective analysis of de-identified data and accessed in accordance with health insurance portability and accountability act regulationsamong 6885 patients who tested positive for sars-cov-2 and had at least 6 months of enrollment in medicare advantage or commercial insurance and in pharmacy benefits with their insurance 2263 had a diagnosis of hypertension with the use of at least one anti-hypertensive drug efigure

consistent with the primary analysis etables 68 the 100 iterations of propensity score matching algorithm found a lower risk of hospitalization with ace inhibitors across all iterations with a p-value of less than 005 in 97 of 100 iterations in the medicare advantage populationin this first national study of ace inhibitors and arbs in outpatients testing positive for sars-cov-2 we found that overall these drugs did not confer additional risk or benefit however among those in medicare advantage ace inhibitors were associated with an almost 40 significantly lower risk of hospitalization for covid-19 an effect not observed with arbs among those hospitalized for covid-19 we did not find a benefit or a harm of these medications collectively the findings do not support a change to the current use of these medications but given the lack of effective therapies to mitigate the harm of the virus this study does provide a rationale for testing the use of ace inhibitors in older patients to reduce the risk of severe sars-cov-2 infectionour design has several attributes that should provide confidence about the findings even though it is observational our study was restricted to people with hypertension who were receiving at least one anti-hypertensive agent thereby limiting our assessment to individuals receiving treatment for the same chronic illness and therefore equally likely to seek care for healthcare needs for covid-19 in all analyses we explicitly compared individuals with equipoise for receiving either drug treatment moreover we did not find any evidence of confounding by disease severity in choice of therapy in our assessment of a priori defined falsification endpoints further our study included individuals from across the united states thereby limiting the effect of hospital or regional care practices that may bias an evaluation of treatment effectsour observations extends the prior evidence of supporting safety of ace inhibitor treatment in covid-1947922 we show the safety of these agents in outpatient sars-cov-2 infected individuals which complements the studies of those who were hospitalized4722 also ours is a national study which complements the single center or single region studies23our study does have an intriguing finding in the subgroup of individuals enrolled in medicare advantage we find that ace inhibitors were associated with a significantly lower risk of hospitalization following an infection with sars-cov-2 in the outpatient setting these patients are older more frequently have comorbidities and were more vulnerable to severe covid-19 disease47 these findings are particularly relevant as the medicare advantage group represented over 90 of all covid-19 hospitalizations in our inpatient cohort also interestingly we did not find the same association for arbs despite clinical equipoise in the use of these drugs our findings are consistent with prior evidence from randomized clinical trials that a reduced risk of pneumonia with ace inhibitors that is not observed with arb5our study of in-hospital outcomes adds to the literature on studies that have reached contrasting conclusions regarding the role of ace inhibitor therapy and in-hospital mortality among hospitalized covid-19 patients we did not find a significant association with mortality consistent with others that have not found such an association42324 however our findings contrast with certain studies that have found lower mortality in hospitalized covid-19 patients treated with ace inhibitors722 notably the studies that have evaluated mortality risk with covid-19 before have not consistently been designed to detect potential causal association of drug therapy with outcomes7 relied on case control designs22 pursued potentially biased assessment by using comparators not receiving any therapy47 or are based on data from single health centers423 moreover some have studied both ace inhibitors and arbs together despite potentially different mechanisms and effects on patient outcomes5there some rationale for why there may be a specific ace inhibitor effect there is preclinical evidence that suggests a possible protective role for ace inhibitors in covid-19 ace inhibitors but not arbs are associated with the upregulation of ace-2 receptors325 these receptors modulate the local renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system interactions in the lung tissue26 the presence of ace2 receptors therefore exerts a protective effect against the development of acute lung injury in infections with sars coronaviruses which lead to dysregulation of these mechanisms and endothelial damage2728 further our observations do not support a theoretical concerns of adverse outcomes due to enhanced virulence of sars coronaviruses due to overexpression of ace2 receptors in cell cultures  an indirect binding site for these virues29 however the pathophysiological effects of ace inhibitors in sars-cov2 infection and the development of clinical disease are likely complex and require dedicated investigationour study has important implications for 4 ongoing randomized trials as none of them align with the observations of our study6 of the 4 trials 3 are testing the use of ace inhibitors or arbs in the treatment of hospitalized covid-19 patients and 1 is using a 10-day course of arbs after a positive sars-cov-2 test to prevent hospitalization6 however our study suggests that the most appropriate strategy to test in a trial would be the prophylactic use of ace inhibitor to prevent hospitalization which is not being tested in any current studythe findings of our study should be interpreted in light of the following limitations first the study is observational and despite robust methods and explicit assessments of residual confounding understanding the potential protective role of ace inhibitors in covid-19 requires a dedicated randomized controlled trial second we do not know the proportion of patients receiving these antihypertensive agents that continued to be treated with these drugs during the illness and the association of their continued use or cessation with patient outcomes third all included data elements are contingent upon individuals seeking care for that ailment or filling a medication using their insurance provider and would not be captured if they chose to self-pay however we do not expect that any sizeable proportion of insured individuals would defer insurance coverage for their care fourth we cannot account for differences in timing of presentation of patients relative to their symptom onset however we limited the effect of differential presentation by patients across exposure groups by focusing on patients receiving treatment for the same medical comorbidity ie hypertension and only varying the class of drugs moreover we included patients across the us and accounted for clustering of patients thereby limiting the effect of local practice patterns that may affect hospitalization thresholds therefore it is unlikely patients care seeking behavior would be affected by knowledge of their underlying disease finally while our analyses of hospitalization use all available evidence for disease severity we do not have granular details on real-time inpatient treatment of patients with covid-19 and whether certain presentation or care characteristics are associated with in-hospital outcomes instead our study evaluates the association of only pre-hospital factors with patient outcomes during hospitalizationin conclusion the use of ace inhibitors and arbs was not associated with the risk of hospitalization or mortality among those infected with sars-cov-2 however there was a nearly 40 lower risk of hospitalization with the use of ace inhibitors in the medicare population this finding merits a clinical trial to evaluate the potential role of ace inhibitors in reducing the risk of hospitalization among older individuals who are at an elevated risk of adverse outcomes with the infectionthe sars-cov-2 virus a newly discovered member of the coronavirus family was first described at the end of 2019 in wuhan china as the third severe respiratory syndrome caused by a coronavirus 1 due to its easy spread via droplets and direct contact it quickly spread globally leading the world health organization to declare it a public health emergency 2 most countries around the world are taking measures aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus as the main mechanism of fighting the disease 2 some of those measures have had a significant impact on peoples lives many countries have imposed travel restrictions 3-4 leaving millions of people having to change travel plans the psychological and economic impact of mandatory isolation following possible exposure to the virus is another matter of concern 5-7clinically the disease presents after an incubation period of between 2 and 14 days 8 the cdc reports that the most common symptoms are fever cough and shortness of breath while dyspnea chest pain confusion and cyanosis represent alarm symptoms that should prompt people to seek medical attention 8 the largest meta-analysis available at the time of writing this article reports that fever and cough are the presenting symptoms in 89 and 72 of patients respectively 9 fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms were also frequently reported 10 hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most commonly reported comorbidities 10-12 older individuals and those with comorbidities were more likely to develop end-organ damage requiring icu admission 11 acute respiratory distress syndrome ards acute kidney injury aki and cardiac injury were all reported in severe cases with ards being the most common 11 leukopenia and less commonly eosinopenia were the most typical laboratory findings while bilateral ground-glass or patchy opacities in the lungs were the most common radiologic abnormalities 10-12 c-reactive protein d-dimer and procalcitonin levels were elevated especially in cases of severe disease 12 
at the time of this writing no clear guidelines on treating sars-cov-2 infections have been published and most clinicians seem to be treating them in a manner similar to that of seasonal fluthe purpose of this article is to look at the impact the sars-cov-2 infection is having on hypertensive patients considering the extremely high prevalence of hypertension in society and the fact that hypertension is among the most frequent comorbidities of patients with severe cases of sars-cov-2 infections we believe it is important to look more deeply into the relationship between the two conditionsthe role of angiotensin converting enzymethe angiotensin converting enzyme ace enzyme is an essential component of human metabolism and its dysregulation is associated with a number of different clinical conditions including hypertension many studies were done to assess the potential role of ace in ards development multiple animal models have shown a protective effect of ace ii against ards development 13-15 sars-cov-2 similarly to sars-cov uses the ace ii receptor to invade the alveolar epithelium and can be considered a potential target for future anti-covid-19 therapies 13 16 cardiovascular pathology and ace inhibitorsangiotensin receptor ar blockers lead to increased ace ii levels potentially increasing the risk of sars-cov-2 infections as pointed out by hanff et al 17 there is also some evidence that sars-cov-2 can lead to the downregulation of ace ii and toxic accumulation of angiotensin ii 17 it should also be noted that ace ii is expressed in other organs and tissues as well the fact that ace is expressed in the gut heart and kidney and that sars-cov infections can be associated with gastrointestinal symptoms and the virus can often be isolated from the stool cardiac damage and aki speaks in favor of there being a strong correlation between ace expression and covid infection 18overall the exact role of ace enzyme and angiotensin in lung injury in general as well as in the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 covid 19 infections is not clear if the models are true and ace ii does have a protective role against ards and ards is the feared complication of covid 19 it would be reasonable to assume ace ii would have a protective effect against covid 19 as the ace ii receptor is used by the virus to infect the alveolar epithelium it raises the issue of whether the availability of the receptor is associated with the severity of clinical findings moreover a large percentage of the population is treated with ace inhibitors and arbs whether those treatments are associated with a change in outcomes of covid 19 infections is currently debated while we recognize the difficulties of performing basic science research especially on animal models in light of the current epidemic we agree with hanff et al and would strongly encourage scientists to keep researching the possible connection between ace receptor angiotensin and ardsace inhibitorsar blockersthe ace inhibitors and ar blockers are currently among the most frequently prescribed medications in the western world they are most commonly used in patients suffering from hypertension congestive heart failure and proteinuria most commonly due to diabetes mellitus they act by reducing the activity of the renin-angiotensin system ras if the ras plays a significant role in sars-cov-19 pathogenesis and ards development it would be reasonable to assume that patients treated with ace inhibitorsar blockers would be impacted the animal models suggest that the administration of ace inhibitors and ar blockers leads to an elevated number of ace ii receptors in the pulmonary circulation 19
marin reported that many patients from latin america and spain were intending to discontinue taking their ace inhibitorsar blockers due to fear of the infection 20 despite some animal models showing a potential association between ace inhibition and worsening lung injuries due to sars-cov there has been no clinical evidence to support such an association 21 the european society of cardiology recommends not discontinuing either of the drugs as the potential risks associated with uncontrolled hypertension seem to outweigh the risks of ace inhibition worsening the covid 19 infection 22 danser et al reached the same conclusion 23 french health minister claimed that the use of anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen could worsen covid 19 symptoms 24 although ace ii levels can be increased by the use of nsaids the evidence for an association with the severity of covid 19 symptoms is weak 25 fang et al do however recommend monitoring patients who are taking any of the controversial drugs and when possible choosing alternative treatments 25 despite that most health authorities including the nhs suggest using paracetamolacetaminophen instead as a precautionary measure 26the overall impact of ace inhibition on sars-cov-19 covid 19 pathogenesis is at this point of time difficult to establish the belief that an association between the two exists is mostly based on animal models while the clinical evidence for such association is lacking despite the lack of clinical evidence it appears to be the case that a number of patients plan on discontinuing their long-term therapies believing that this would decrease their risk of contracting andor dying from covid 19 the evidence for a relationship between nsaid use and more severe sars-cov-19 infections is also weak although a possible pathophysiologic link can be hypothesized in this case however many health authorities recommend against using nsaids until further evidence comes to light we believe that a lot more basic science research into the pathophysiology of both coronavirus infections and ards development in general is needed before clearer patterns emerge at this point it may be reasonable to avoid starting new patients on nsaids and ace inhibitorsarbs if it can be avoided when it comes to patients who require those treatments for other conditions discontinuation of them is unlikely to benefit patients as the evidence for exacerbations of their comorbidities is stronger than the evidence for the covid 19 disease severityhypertension and covid 19there have been news reports and expert opinions on patients with hypertension presenting with more severe cases of covid 19 moreover hypertension was among the most frequently reported comorbidities of those patients 10-12 it should be taken into account however that hypertension is among the most prevalent chronic conditions in the western world affecting millions of people fang et al point out that the association between diabetes and hypertension and covid 19 infections is likely due to their association with ace ii enzyme 25 li et al reported a significantly higher prevalence of hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities among covid 19 patients treated in the icu compared to those who did not require icu treatment 27 they also reported that over 8 of those infected by sars-cov-2 developed cardiac injury 27 chen et al have also reported a similar association 28 the elevated troponin levels seen in icu patients also pointed towards the development of myocardial injury 28 the odds ratio of developing a severe case compared to a nonsevere case for hypertensive patients was 236 with a 95 confidence interval between 146 and 383 29 none of the studies analyzed age as a potential confounder considering that the prevalence of hypertension rises with age and older patients are in general more likely to suffer serious complications of infectious diseases that was addressed by the international society of hypertension who point out that there is no evidence that patients with hypertension are overrepresented among those with severe sars-cov-2 infections when adjusted for age 30it is difficult to assess the impact hypertension has on the outcome of patients infected by sars-cov-2 multiple studies point to a significant association between hypertension and adverse outcomes however the number of potential confounders the main of which is age is vast the previously mentioned association between antihypertensives and severe covid 19 presentations also needs to be taken into account the number of studies that have been published so far is insufficient to properly address all those questions we hope that as more case reports and review articles become available in the literature a clearer pattern will emerge the outcomes of patients with uncontrolled hypertension should be compared to those of normotensive controls of similar baseline characteristics the outcomes of hypertensive patients managed with ace inhibitorsar blockers should be compared to those of hypertensive patients managed with calcium channel antagonistscoronary artery disease congestive heart failure and covid 19besides hypertension other cardiovascular comorbidities were also frequently reported in patients with severe cases of covid 19 considering the significant associations between hypertension and cardiac disease a correlation would be expected moreover there is a significant association between heart failure and pulmonary disease particularly pulmonary hypertension the possible consequences of even mild cardiac damage would be expected to be more significant among patients with pre-existing cardiac disease as li et al reported the cardio-cerebrovascular disease was among the most prevalent comorbidities among patients with severe cases of covid 19 second only to hypertension 171 and 164 respectively 27 zhou et al reported that coronary disease was the third most prevalent comorbidity after hypertension and diabetes 31 chen et al also found that previous history of coronary disease was an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes 28 the proposed mechanism of such findings is that pericytes with high ace ii expression might be the cells targeted by sars-cov-2 32 pericyte injury could then lead to endothelial dysfunction 32 patients with pre-existing heart failure are more likely to have elevated ace ii expression due to the pathophysiology of chf which could then increase the risk of infection 32 he et al found the mortality of critically ill patients infected by sars-cov-2 who develop cardiac injury to be as high as 60 33 they also found an elevation in n-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide levels usually a biomarker for congestive heart failure associated with the myocardial injury caused by covid 19considered together these studies point to an association between pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities and adverse outcomes following sars-cov-2 infections the most likely contributing factor to such finding is the observed myocardial damage in a subset of covid 19 patients which patients with pre-existing heart disease are less likely to recover from moreover the increased expression of ace ii with congestive heart failure could explain the increased susceptibility to the virus the ability to address myocardial damage in the icu may prove to be the most important prognostic factor for those patients considering the lack of currently approved treatments aimed at the virus itself it is especially important to ensure that people with such comorbidities are not exposed to it in the first place more research is needed into the exact impact of sars-cov-2 on the cardiovascular system in order to develop both protective and potentially curative strategiescovid 19 caused by sars-cov-19 has been the most talked-about disease of the first half of 2020 the elderly and those suffering from chronic conditions are most at risk for adverse outcomes hypertension was the most frequently reported comorbidity among patients with severe infections followed by diabetes and other cardiovascular diseases possibly related to their expression of ace ii facilitating viral entry into cells the relationship between ace inhibitorar blocker use and the incidence of severe covid-19 has been conflicting and at present where most authorities do not recommend discontinuing long-term ace inhibitorar blocker treatments a concern remains that some patients may be inclined to stop taking the prescribed medicines out of fear another point of contention has been the use of nsaids and a number of public health authorities have released statements claiming no evidence of such association existed nevertheless most recommended choosing alternative drugs if possible pending further investigation into nsaids finally the available evidence clearly points to a correlation between pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities and adverse outcomes with sars-cov-2 infections as severe cases are associated with myocardial damage considering the very high prevalence of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases it is important to continue researching the association between these conditions and covid-19the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 previously known as novel coronavirus-2019 ncov-19 causes coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 at the time of publication april 30 2020 the covid-19 pandemic has led to 3090445 cases and 217769 deaths across 209 countries according to world health organization data1 older patients with covid-19 those with underlying pulmonary disease and those with hypertension diabetes or established cardiovascular disease have a worse prognosis than their counterparts without these comorbidities28sars-cov-2 infects host cells by binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ace2911 a membrane-bound enzyme expressed in the lungs heart and kidneys among many other organs1213 within the heart pericytes express the greatest levels of ace2 although cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells also express ace214 ace2 catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin-i and angiotensin-ii to angiotensin-1-9 and angiotensin-1-7 respectively15 angiotensin-ii promotes increased sympathetic tone sodium and water retention fibrosis and inflammation through the angiotensin type 1 receptor whereas angiotensin 1-7 counteracts these effects by binding to the mas receptor fig 115it has been proposed that reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas inhibitors predispose to sars-cov-19 infection and worsen outcomes after covid-19 by upregulating ace2 expression16 angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ace inhibitors angiotensin receptor type 1 blockers arbs and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists increase heart vascular and kidney ace2 expression and activity in animals1721 chronic treatment with an ace inhibitor for 6 months was associated with increased plasma angiotensin-1-7 level and angiotensin-ii to angiotensin-1-7 ratio whereas no such association was observed in the immediate period after acute ace inhibitor treatment2223 spironolactone treatment increased ace2 activity and mrna in human monocyte-derived macrophages from patients with heart failure21yet others support the hypothesis that raas inhibitors and ace2 counteract angiotensin-ii-mediated pulmonary injury in respiratory viral illness2425 these beneficial effects could be attributable to angiotensin-1-7 binding to the mas receptor which promotes anti-inflammatory signaling15 in one study of acid aspiration and sepsis lung injury ace2 knockout mice and mice pretreated with recombinant human ace2 had attenuated lung damage26 in the same models treatment of ace2 knockout mice with an angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker also protected against lung injury26 administration of recombinant human ace2 beginning one day before respiratory syncytial virus infection decreased pulmonary immune cell infiltration and attenuated histologic lung injury in mice27 recombinant human ace2 increased angiotensin-1-7 and decreased angiotensin-ii concentrations in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome but was stopped early for futility with no significant difference in the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio28 these data suggest that ace2 modulation may protect against lung damage from acute respiratory distress syndrome but do not address whether ace2 modulation may salvage lung function after the initial lung insult moreover it is unclear whether the hypothetical benefits of ace2-mediated lung protection outweigh the theorized ace2-mediated increase in sars-cov-2 entryseveral questions about the relationship between sars-cov-2 ace2 and raas inhibitors must be answered before drawing conclusions about raas inhibitors and covid-19 and to inform the design of future studies first there are no data to support an increase in ace2 expression on alveolar epithelial cells during raas inhibition in animal models plasma ace2 activity may not represent enzymatic activity at the tissue level because angiotensin-ii infusion into mice decreases myocardial ace2 protein level and activity but increases plasma ace2 activity29 furthermore increased plasma ace2 levels are associated with an adverse cardiovascular prognosis30there may be relevant differences between ace inhibitors and arbs and differences within each class with respect to their effects on circulating and tissue ace2 in a cross-sectional analysis of adults taking various antihypertensive agents on-treatment urinary ace2 concentrations were increased in patients taking olmesartan but not ace inhibitors or other arbs31 conversely 2 studies demonstrated higher on-treatment circulating levels of angiotensin 1-7 in patients receiving an ace inhibitor than an arb3233 in spontaneously hypertensive rats sacubitril-valsartan restored cardiac ace2 mrna expression whereas valsartan did not34 circulating angiotensin-1-7 may not reflect ace2 activity in patients receiving sacubitril-valsartan because neprilysin converts angiotensin-1-9 and angiotensin-i to angiotensin-1-7ace2-independent factors also influence sars-cov-2 infection and covid-19 severity for example sars-cov-2 entry seems to require tmprss2 a serine protease expressed on ace2-expressing cells11 host genetics and comorbidities likely play a role in susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection and outcome as suggested by the high prevalence of advanced age and cardiac and pulmonary comorbidities among patients with covid-19randomized clinical trials provide the only opportunity to answer to questions in a rigorous manner two ongoing trials will compare losartan an arb against placebo or an active comparator in hospitalized patients and outpatients with covid-19 clinicaltrialsgov nct04311177 nct04312009 and nct04328012 another clinical trial will compare continuing ace inhibitor or arb therapy and switching to an alternative agent in patients with hypertension but without covid-19 nct04329195 epidemiologic studies should be performed to estimate the association of raas inhibitor use to risk of covid-19 in patients with hypertension heart failure or chronic kidney diseasewithdrawal of raas inhibition increases the risk of decompensation in patients with heart failure and adverse physiological changes occur shortly after raas inhibitor withdrawal plasma angiotensin ii aldosterone cortisol and norepinephrine levels increase to pretreatment levels within 4-days of ace inhibitor cessation in patients with heart failure and new york heart association functional class iii or iv symptoms35 after a mean 15 days without ace inhibitor therapy left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes return to pretreatment values in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction36 worsening symptoms and decreased exercise tolerance occurs within 46 weeks of ace inhibitor withdrawal37 even among patients with recovery of left ventricular function and reversal of left ventricular remodeling withdrawal of neurohormonal blockade increases the risk of clinical relapse or subclinical adverse left ventricular remodeling38 discontinuing ace inhibitor or arb therapy in patients with progression of chronic kidney disease was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease over a 5-year period39in march 2020 the american college of cardiology american heart association heart failure society of america and european society of cardiology issued recommendations against discontinuing raas inhibitors during the covid-19 pandemic4041 clinicians should consider the risk of covid-19 exposure when caring for patients with hypertension heart failure acute myocardial infarction and diabetic nephropathy clinicians should reinforce preventative measures for those patients who must leave their homes to provide blood samples for electrolyte and renal function monitoring with raas inhibitors42in summary we have limited preclinical and clinical evidence of the effects of raas inhibitors on covid-19 clinicians should continue to use raas inhibitors during the covid-19 pandemic according to current standards of care scientists must focus on addressing several knowledge gaps to inform clinical management of covid-19 particularly among those patients with underlying pulmonary and cardiovascular diseasethe renin-angiotensin system ras is known to play an important role in regulating blood pressure and electrolyte and water balancethe ras pathway consists of a cascade of proteases producing some bioactive molecules 1 angiotensinogen is mainly released by the liver and then cleaved by renin which is secreted by the juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney thus generating the decapeptide angiotensin i ang i 23 ang i is converted to angiotensin ii ang ii by angiotensin-converting enzymes ace expressed by the endothelial cells of several organs such as lung heart kidney and brain 45 ang ii is the most relevant molecule of the ras pathway and performs its function by activating the following g-protein-coupled receptors angiotensin ii receptor type 1 at1r and angiotensin ii receptor type 2 at2r 6 figure 1the effects exerted by these two membrane receptors are opposite in particular at1r induces detrimental effects such as inflammation fibrosis and altered redox balance in addition to vasoconstrictive properties whereas at2r is involved in protective and regenerating actions anti-inflammatory anti-fibrotic neurodegenerative metabolic and in the release of vasodilatory molecules 789 therefore the equilibrium point of the ras is represented by ang ii which can also be converted into heptapeptide ang-1-7 thanks to the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 ang-1-7 which can also be generated by the cleavage of ang i by endopeptidases and binds mas receptors counteracting most of the deleterious actions of the aceang iiat1 axis especially in pathological conditions 1011due to the regulatory effects of ace and ace2 on the levels of ang ii these peptidases are the main players in the regulation of blood pressure in the cardiovascular system 1213endothelial ace2 overexpression functions as a negative regulator of the ras thus reducing blood pressure 14 in an animal model ace2 cardiomyocyte overexpression seems to decrease the detrimental effects of hypertension and ang ii infusion 15 the ace2 pathway has been shown to exert different effects on cardiomyocytes in the heart 121617 ang-1-7 infusion can ameliorate myocardial performance cardiac remodeling and survival in an animal model of heart failure exerting beneficial effects 18 other data have correlated ace2 overexpression with cardiac fibrosis and arrhythmia 1920several sources of evidence suggest that the ras represents an important target for the treatment of lung pathologies 221 indeed the aceang iiat1r axis plays a relevant role in promoting acute lung injury while the ace2ang-1-7mas pathway can antagonize and reduce pathological processes including pulmonary hypertension and fibrosis 62223242526some data have demonstrated a connection between ras and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 427282930in experimental settings of acute lung injury ace2 deficient animals develop histological and functional ards 6 in particular ang ii is involved in a number of processes that take place in the lung including the genesis of pulmonary edema due to regulation of pulmonary vasoconstriction and vascular permeability in response to hypoxia stimulation of the lung production of inflammatory cytokines induction of alveolar epithelial cells apoptosis and fibroproliferation 27in 2003 during the sars-related coronavirus sars-cov infection outbreak a possible relation emerged between ras and viral infections this virus was characterized by a high mortality rate due to clinical respiratory failure linked to ards 31 intriguingly ace2 was shown to be a receptor for the sars-cov 3233 the sars virus can enter the host cells through an endocytosis process mediated by the binding of its spike protein trimers with a hydrophobic pocket of the extracellular catalytic domain of ace2 34 after virus entry ace2 levels decrease thus enhancing ang ii release that may favor ards development 633 in animal models sars-cov infection in ace2 knock-out mice reduces the development of lung injury 33 only sars-cov and human coronavirus nl63 were shown to bind ace2 to invade host cells 35 moreover overexpressing ace2 in cell lines promoted efficient replication of sars-cov while when ace2 is neutralized by antibodies viral replication is inhibited 33 in clinical studies serum ang ii levels have been shown to be significantly elevated in patients with acute lung injury 36 and high serum ang ii levels have been associated with the severity and mortality of the infection 37 while at2r has the opposite effect of at1r at2r agonists can reduce lung damage 63839 ang-1-7 and mas receptor agonists alleviate acute lung injury in mouse models 394041some researchers also believe that blocking at1r may reduce the response of inflammatory mediators and reduce acute lung injury compared to blocking ace 40 in particular in animal models of lung injury the ace inhibitor captopril significantly reduced lipopolysaccharide lps and induced detrimental changes in the lung by decreasing secretion of tumor necrosis factor  and interleukin 6 along with a reduction in ang iiang-1-7 ratio and by reversing the increased ratio of ace to ace2 41 those data are in agreement with recent evidence suggesting beneficial effects of anti-il-6 receptor human antibody tocilizumab for the treatment of sars-cov-2-induced ards 42 moreover a recent study has shown that coronavirus disease covid-19 patients with hypertension treated with ace inhibitors and at1r blockers had different values of viral load and an attenuation of the inflammatory response likely through the inhibition of il-6 levels 43sars-cov-2 responsible for coronavirus disease covid-19 shares the same ace2 viral receptor as sars-cov 44 ace2 is highly expressed in human lung tissue but also in the nasal cavity and oral mucosa 1045currently the majority of patients with covid-19 clinical infection exhibit mild symptoms such as fever myalgia or fatigue nasal congestion sore throat and cough 4647 a minority of patients rapidly develop complications such as severe pneumonia septic shock and even clotting dysfunctionat present there is no effective treatment for covid-19 the activation of the signaling pathway ace2ang-1-7mas or the inhibition of the pathway aceang iiat1r may be interesting from a therapeutic standpointace inhibitors inhibit the formation of angiotensin ii and consequently the effects triggered by its interaction with the receptors at1r vasoconstriction sodium and water retention sympathetic activation cell growth and at2r receptors 47previous studies have shown that sars-cov significantly reduces ace2 in the lungs of infected mice 3133the binding of covid-19 and ace2 seems to result in the exhaustion of ace2 thus inhibiting the ace2ang-1-7mas receptor pathway and altering the balance of the ras and this would lead to the exacerbation of acute severe pneumonia 48 although these and other authors believe in a detrimental effect of ace inhibitors in covid-19 patients this assumption is still controversial with other authors concluding that ace inhibitors and at1r inhibitors may reduce the lung inflammatory response and mortality and may be used in patients with covid-19 pneumonia 48moreover the scientific community has recently focused its attention on at1r inhibitors and their possible benefit for patients infected by covid-19 who experience pneumonia 49 but even in this regard there are still some doubts about the at1r antagonists effects indeed at1r antagonists may intuitively increase the ace2 expression 5051 yielding harmful consequences for covid-19 patients since ace2 has been identified as the functional receptor for sars-cov2as mentioned above after virus entry ace2 levels decrease the reduction in ace2 levels on the one hand would cause lower production of ang- 1-7 from ang ii on the other hand it would cause an increase in unconverted ang ii which finding at1r blocked by the drug would act on at2r triggering a series of protective events on the lung such as a reduction in vascular permeability and edema reduction in pulmonary fibrosis processes furthermore despite its reduction a small amount of ace2 remains able to convert ang ii to ang-1-7 allowing the conservation of the pulmonary protective mechanisms mediated by mas receptors 633 for these reasons at1r blockers may paradoxically represent a protective mechanism against pulmonary lesions from the viruswith regard to ace inhibitors their action on ace inhibits the formation of ang ii thus preventing both the negative effects mediated by at1r and the positive ones deriving from the ang ii binding with at2r and from its transformation into ang-1-7 ang-1-7 however can be produced by the degradation of ang i by endopeptidase and ace2 with the intermediate formation of ace-1-9 figure 1 although ace inhibition blocks the degradation of ang-1-9 to ang-1-7 ang-1-7 can still be produced directly from ang i in addition ace inhibitors prevent the degradation of ang-1-7 to ang-1-5 1 increasing its levels therefore as described for at1r inhibitors in this case it would also seem that the protective effects on the lung could be preservedace2 is regulated by a gene that is located on the x chromosome 52 thus suggesting that some differences may exist in the expression of ace2 between men and womenmoreover there is evidence that ace2 tissue levels are regulated by estrogengupte thatcher et al 53 demonstrated that high-fat-fed female mice exhibited elevated adipose ace2 activity and consequently increased plasma ang-17 levels without affecting systolic blood pressure moreover ovariectomy of hf-fed female mice by reducing adipose ace2 activity promoted obesity and hypertension on the contrary hf-fed males had elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were abolished by losartan 53 we also know that estrogen in atrial myocardium modifies the local ras homeostasis by increasing the ace2-mrna levels 54the deprivation of estrogen in post-menopause causes a loss of cardiovascular protection in women due to the possible shift from the ace2ras axis to the aceras pathways 55 shoemaker et al showed that adipocyte-derived ace2 contributes to sex differences in obesity-hypertension through the regulation of the balance between ang-1-7 and ang ii a benefit that is lost with estrogen deprivation in post-menopause 56if we consider that the susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection should increase with increasing ace2 levels women should be more prone to the infection than men in contrast the epidemiological data available to date show gender-based clinical differences in the manifestations of sars-cov-2 with women getting slightly less ill than men 57 and a greater number of male patients 53 in particular elderly subjects being affected by serious covid-19 infections if compared with female patients this information is in contrast with studies that show that the level of ace2 decreases with age 57 and therefore appears to be higher in young people who generally develop a less severe form of covid-2019 given this apparent inconsistency we can speculate that there are probably other factors that contribute to the severity of the diseaseinformation about the ethnicity of the patients affected by covid-19 will also be important to understand if african and afro-american patients who usually have low plasma renin levels will be really less affected than other populations this concept seems to be reinforced by data on covid-19 available from world health organization at the moment and from our hundreds of cases of covid-19 patients in the abruzzo region italy unpublished observations although such observation may be biased by several temporal and season disease development-related issuesother evidence suggests that sars-cov-2 can cause myocardial injury with the elevation of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin i levels 58 and also the mechanism underlying myocardial injury can be linked to the relationship between sars-cov-2 and ace2 59it should also be considered that the mortality rate is higher in patients with a history of high blood pressure diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease 60 ace inhibitors and at1r inhibitors withdrawal would not only prevent the antihypertensive effect but also the cardioprotective properties of these drugsalthough the relationship between the ras pathway and covid-19 is not yet completely clear ongoing mechanistic and observational studies are needed to clarify better the pathophysiology as well as the efficacy and safety of therapeutic strategies targeting the ras pathway in the treatment andor prevention of the covid-19 pandemiauntil now no evidence exists in support of the use of drugs that act on ras in patients affected by covid-19 as a matter of fact the segment of the population affected by the most severe forms of covid-19 is usually affected by arterial hypertension and has a history of heart disease 61 but we still have no information about their previous therapies and other relevant clinical aspectsmoreover a recent study has highlighted how sars-cov-2 cell entry depends on ace2 and tmprss2 a serine protease the interesting finding is that tmprss2 is blocked by a clinically approved protease inhibitor and this opens up new scenarios from a therapeutic perspective 44there are many other research ideas that will allow us to conduct further studies in the next months with the aim of better clarifying any therapeutic strategies to defeat sars-cov-2 definitely and the ras will probably play a role as protagonist in this important challenge for medical scientistsprohibitin-1 phb1 formerly known as bap32 and its homolog phb2 formerly bap37 rea or prohibitone are

 one of the best-documented examples is akt phosphorylation of phb1 at thr258 which blocks its interaction with shp12 and facilitates akt signaling ande and mishra 2009 shp12 is a phosphatase that facilitates akt signaling and enhances insulin signaling additionally the phosphorylation of phb1 at thr258 is necessary for the activation of c-raf raf-1 by ras chiu et al 2013 rajalingam et al 2005 established that the activation of c-raf by ras requires the heterodimerization of phospho-phb1thr258 with c-raf the phosphorylation of phb1 at thr258 in the plasma membrane of cancer cells activates pi3kakt and c-raferk pathways which promote proliferation and metastasis chiu et al 2012 by contrast insulin-receptor-induced phosphorylation of phb1 at tyr114 promotes its heterodimerization with the phosphatase shp1 and blocks akt signaling ande et al 2009ait has been suggested that the regulation of phb1 by transforming growth factor  tgf- is responsible for the dual effect of this cytokine in prostate cancer zhu et al 2010 in the early stage of tumorigenesis tgf- acts as a tumor suppressor but subsequently it promotes metastatic spread during cancer progression the binding of tgf- to its receptor triggers the c-rafmekerk pathway and also activates smad 23 or smad 15 thereby causing opposite effects figure 2 erk activates protein kinase c  pkc- which leads to the phosphorylation of phb1 and consequently to cell survival and invasion however smad signaling also upregulates 14-3-3 protein which inhibits pkc- leading to a hypophosphorylation of phb1 that promotes apoptosisthe activity of phb2 is regulated by serine and threonine phosphorylation in particular at ser91 and tyr248 ross et al 2008 sun et al 2011 calciumcalmodulin-dependent protein kinase iv camkiv phosphorylates phb2 at ser91 impeding its ability to repress the transcriptional activity of myocyte enhancer factor 2 mef2 sun et al 2011 the consequence of this phosphorylation of phb2 on the activity of other transcription factors has not been reported phb2 also inhibits circadian transcription by interacting with casein kinase 1  ck1 kategaya et al 2012phbs have been detected at the surface of platelets microglial cells wintachai et al 2012 endothelial cells in adipose tissue kolonin et al 2004 paclitaxel-resistant cancer cells patel et al 2010 intestinal epithelial cells sharma and qadri 2004 and activated t cells yurugi et al 2012 in platelets phb1 and phb2 interact directly with protease-activated receptor 1 par1 to promote platelet aggregation zhang et al 2012 the physiological role of phb1 at the surface of microglial cells and endothelial cells of adipose tissue remains elusive but it has been demonstrated that phb1 at the surface of cancer cells is involved in resistance to paclitaxel patel et al 2010 a virulence antigen of salmonella typhi the causative agent of typhoid interacts with phb1 and phb2 at the surface of intestinal epithelial cells resulting in downregulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk cascade and inhibition of early inflammatory responses patel et al 2010 similarly considerable proportions of total phb1 and phb2 are located on the surface of activated t cells where they contribute to the activation of erk induced by t cell activation yurugi et al 2012phb1 is also present in human serum embedded in lipid droplets where it interacts with the complement protein c3 to promote innate immunity mishra et al 2007 interestingly serum phb1 and phb2 concentrations were found to be significantly elevated in patients with colorectal cancer suggesting that they may serve as a biomarker for this type of cancer mengwasser et al 2004a brief presentation of the interactions between phbs and other proteins is provided in table 1
for a list of other putative partners of phb1 see table s1both phb1 and phb2 are involved in growth resistance to chemotherapy and metastasis through several mechanisms including activation of the ras-c-raf-mek-erk pathway modulation of tgf- signaling and transcriptional regulation indeed phb1 interacts with the transcription factor p53 in the nucleus of cancer cells to increase its transcriptional activity fusaro et al 2003 p53 is a tumor suppressor that controls the cell cycle apoptosis genomic stability and angiogenesis chander et al 2010 2011 fusaro et al 2003 joshi et al 2007 a component of ubiquitin ligase complexes skp2b which is overexpressed in many breast cancers interacts with both phb1 and phb2 to promote their degradation chander et al 2010 2011 umanskaya et al 2007 because phb1 acts as an activator fusaro et al 2003 and chaperone chander et al 2011 for p53 this depletion in phb1 leads to an attenuated activity of p53 in cancer cells overexpressing skp2b and consequently promotes their survivalphb1 is also an important regulator of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein rb and its family members p107 and p130 wang et al 1999b these proteins bind and inhibit e2f transcription factors leading to cell-cycle arrest phb1 represses the activity of e2f transcription factors by interacting with several proteins including rb histone deacetylases hdacs and the nucleosome-remodeling proteins brg-1 and brm wang et al 1999a 1999b 2002a growing body of evidence indicates that the cellular localization of phbs is a determinant of their function especially in cancer cells patel et al 2010 found that phb1 is overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells that are resistant to taxoids doxorubicin and etoposide they also demonstrated that the redirection of phb1 from the cytoplasm to the cell surface is critical for drug resistance and their work suggests that cell-surface phb1 may serve as a biomarker of chemoresistance in cancer patientsin normal epithelial breast cells phb1 is located primarily in the mitochondria but in invasive and noninvasive breast cancer cells it is mainly confined to the nucleus suggesting that phb1 localization is associated with tumorigenesis chen et al 2011 confocal microscopy experiments demonstrated that phbs colocalize with the proto-oncogenes c-myc c-fos p53 and rb in neuroblastoma sk-n-sh cells li et al 2011treatment with the anticancer drug camptothecin leads to phb1 and p53 being exported from the nucleus to the mitochondria of breast cancer cell lines fusaro et al 2003 this camptothecin-induced translocation of phb1 which is dependent on the protein transporter crm-1 occurs preferentially in transformed cell lines and not in untransformed or primary cells a peptide corresponding to the nuclear export signal of phb1 prevented the export of phb1 resulting in the protection of cells from apoptosis indicating that the translocation of phb1 from the nucleus to the mitochondria contributes to its tumor-suppressive effects rastogi et al 2006b one mechanism by which the intracellular location of phbs is controlled involves the signaling protein big3wdr5 which traps phb2 in the cytoplasm and consequently stimulates the estrogen-signaling pathway in the hormone-related growth of breast cancer cells kim et al 2009beyond these activities of phbs as proteins the 3-utr of phb1 messenger rna mrna was found to suppress both the proliferation of human breast cancer cells in vitro and the growth of breast tumors in xenografted mice in vivo manjeshwar et al 2003 this was the first demonstration that an rna molecule can function as a tumor suppressor in human breast cancerthe tumor-suppressor activity of phb1 and its mrna 3-utr is further supported by the discovery that the oncogenic microrna-27a mir-27a which is upregulated in many cancers chhabra et al 2010 targets the 3-utr of phb1 and downregulates phb1 in human gastric adenocarcinoma liu et al 2009a fletcher et al 2012 demonstrated that mir-27a is upregulated by androgen receptor in prostate cancer resulting in reduced phb1 mrna and protein levels and increased cancer cell growth interestingly adding phb1 to cells overexpressing mir-27a blocked mir-27a-induced growth demonstrating that the oncogenic activity of mir-27a strongly involves phb1 signaling in prostate canceran important question that needs to be examined is why phbs display both anti- and protumorigenic roles in cancers summarized in table 2
 this dichotomy may reflect the heterogeneity of cancer cell types which are manifested by an alteration of different signaling pathways consequently the regulation of transcription translation and posttranslational modification of phbs probably depends on the cancerous cell type involved these posttranslational events eg phosphorylation sumoylation o-glcnac modification palmitoylation and transamidation modulate both the subcellular localization of phbs and their downstream effects on proliferation and survival of cells on the cell surface phb1 promotes chemoresistance but on the inner face of the plasma membrane it can contribute to the oncogenic activation of c-raf however it is tempting to speculate that in the nucleus phb1 displays antitumorigenic activity due to its action on p53 rb p107 p130 and components of the mammalian replication machinery additional studies are required to decipher the roles played by signaling and intracellular localization of phbs in oncogenesismany studies have indicated that phbs protect cells from oxidative stress which is due to an excessive production or an impaired elimination of ros jones 2008 it is closely associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and is an important component of the etiology of cancers inflammatory cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and diabetes mellitus in view of the central role of phbs in maintaining the normal structure and function of mitochondria it is unsurprising that phbs can alleviate the deleterious effect of oxidative stressmany stresses in particular oxidative stress upregulate phb1 and phb2 to promote cell survival indeed phb1 expression is enhanced in neurons by various stresses including electrical stimulation hypoxia-ischemia oxygen-glucose deprivation zhou et al 2012 exercise-induced neuroplasticity ding et al 2006 injection of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine park et al 2010 and schizophrenia-induced oligodendrocyte dysfunction bernstein et al 2012 phb1 is also upregulated in the liver of steatohepatitis patients tsutsumi et al 2009 in fetal rabbit lung after exposure to hyperoxic conditions henschke et al 2006 in pancreatic -cells after ethanol intoxication lee et al 2010b and in cardiac cells after ischemic-hypoxic preconditioning kim et al 2006 muraguchi et al 2010 or chronic restraint stress liu et al 2004 this cytoprotectant response involves the translocation of phb1 from the nucleus and the cytoplasm to mitochondria in pancreatic -cells lee et al 2010b in the retina and retinal epithelium lee et al 2010a and in ovarian granulosa cells chowdhury et al 2007 figure s2 sripathi et al 2011 suggested that the localization and trafficking of phbs are determined by the modulation of their binding to specific lipids indeed strong binding of phb1 to cardiolipin was shown to correlate with the localization of phb1 within mitochondria in transformed epithelial cells after an oxidative stress by contrast under normal conditions in these cells phb1 binds strongly to pip3 but not to cardiolipinoverexpression of phb1 protects pancreatic -cells ovarian granulosa cells and cardiomyocytes from apoptosis induced by ethanol ceramide staurosporine serum withdrawal and oxidative stress-induced injury consistent with phb1 having a cytoprotective role chowdhury et al 2007 2011 lee et al 2010b liu et al 2009b
merkwirth et al 2012 recently described a critical role of phb2 in the survival of neurons neuron-specific deletion of phb2 in the mouse forebrain impaired mitochondrial architecture leading to tau hyperphosphorylation and filament formation this phenotype was accompanied by severe behavioral and cognitive dysfunctions that were reminiscent of alzheimers diseasethe details of the mechanisms of this cytoprotection remain poorly documented the only other actors that have been identified as being involved are s1p and stat3 s1p protects the heart from ischemia-reperfusion damage by directly activating phb2 thereby regulating respiration and cytochrome oxidase subunit iv assembly and decreasing the hearts susceptibility to opening of the permeability transition pore ptp gomez et al 2011interleukin-6 il-6 increases phb1 levels through phosphorylation of the transcription factor stat3 to promote the survival of intestinal cells and cardiomyocytes gratia et al 2012 theiss et al 2007b in intestinal epithelial cells in vivo phb1 interacts with stat3 to modulate stat3-mediated apoptosis kathiria et al 2012b in cardiomyocytes il-6-induced upregulation of phb1 is central to the cardioprotective effects of il-6 against oxidative stress gratia et al 2012 importantly phosphorylated stat3 protects cardiomyocytes against oxidative stress by stimulating respiration and inhibiting the ptp within mitochondria and not through a transcriptional effect boengler et al 2010 it would be interesting to determine whether phb1 modulates this mitochondrial action of stat3inflammatory bowel diseases ibds are characterized by strong oxidative stresses associated with downregulated antioxidant enzymes in the intestinal mucosa lih-brody et al 1996 several studies in vitro and in vivo have indicated that phb1 alleviates intestinal inflammation and promotes the survival of cells exposed to oxidative stress in intestinal epithelial cells phb1 binds to a salmonella typhi antigen to inhibit the inflammatory response to s typhi infection sharma and qadri 2004 phb1 expression is abnormally low during ulcerative colitis and crohns disease the two most common forms of ibd hsieh et al 2006 theiss et al 2007a yeo et al 2006 due to an overstimulation of tumor necrosis factor  tnf- signaling in the inflamed colon theiss et al 2009a this downregulation of phb1 increases ros signaling and tnf--induced autophagy promoting inflammation in patients with ibd kathiria et al 2012a interestingly transgenic mice overexpressing phb1 in intestinal epithelial cells exhibit reduced proinflammatory nuclear factor b nf-b signaling in the colonic mucosa after treatment with tnf- demonstrating that phb1 plays a critical role in inflammation a detailed examination of this mechanism of action revealed that phb1 inhibits tnf--induced translocation of nf-b by downregulating the expression of importin 3 a protein involved in nf-b nuclear import theiss et al 2009a in an in vivo model of ibd phb1 transgenic mice exhibited lower oxidative stress and colitis than wild-type mice theiss et al 2009b this cytoprotective effect is due to the upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 nrf2 a transcriptional activator of antioxidant responses further evidence that phb1 is a putative therapeutic target for treating ibd comes from the observations that adenovirus-directed administration by enema and nanoparticle-based colonic delivery of phb1 effectively enhanced the levels of phb1 at the surface of colonic epithelial cells and alleviated colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate theiss et al 2011
picard et al 2013 recently demonstrated that phb1 accumulates in the nucleus of osteoarthritic chondrocytes where it represses the expression of the transcription factor pitx1 suggesting an involvement of phb1 in the etiology of osteoarthritisin addition to phb1 phb2 is also involved in inflammation indeed heterozygous phb2 were shown to be more sensitive to liver insults and inflammatory aggressions than wild-type animals confirming a cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory role of phb2 in liver snchez-quiles et al 2012
lucas et al 2013 recently discovered how phb1 and phb2 induce an immune response in b cells the interaction of cd86 with phbs was shown to induce the phosphorylation of ib phospholipase c2 and protein kinase cii leading to the nuclear translocation of nf-b p65 into the nucleus and the subsequent transcription of oct-2 and igg1
ande and mishra 2009 and ande et al 2009a established that phb1 is a key regulator of insulin signaling and adipocyte differentiation indeed phb1 is directly phosphorylated by the insulin receptor to promote insulin signaling and block akt signaling whereas phosphorylation of phb1 by akt has the opposite effectinterestingly phb1 is not only phosphorylated but is also conjugated to o-linked -n-acetylglucosamine in myoblast cells in response to insulin and high glucose this glucose-induced o-glcnac modification and phosphorylation of phb1 may be associated with insulin resistance modification and tyrosine phosphorylation of phb ande et al 2009b gu et al 2011phb1 inhibits pyruvate carboxylase and decreases insulin-stimulated oxidation of glucose and fatty acid in adipocytes implying that it has a role in promoting lipid accumulation vessal et al 2006 crosslinking experiments showed that phb1 associates with pyruvate carboxylase and eps 15 homology domain protein 2 ehd2 suggesting that phb1 shuttles between the extracellular space and the mitochondria by a mechanism involving lipid rafts and ehd2recently ande et al 2012 demonstrated that treatment of preadipocytes with insulin or a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  ppar agonist upregulates phb1 thereby promoting preadipocyte differentiation into adipocytes remarkably overexpression of phb1 was sufficient to induce adipogenesis phb1 on the cell surface is also a marker of adipose vasculature and may be a possible therapeutic target for obesity see belowseveral recent studies demonstrated that the internalization of some viruses involves phbs for instance phb1 interacts with chikungunya virus wintachai et al 2012 phb2 interacts with dengue virus kuadkitkan et al 2010 and both phb1 and phb2 interact with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov cornillez-ty et al 2009 phb1 and phb2 also interact with the hiv-1 glycoprotein to promote replicative spread in nonpermissive cells emerson et al 2010 interestingly recombinant capsid protein vp1 rvp1 of foot-and-mouth disease virus dephosphorylates akt and phospho-phb ttr258 in lipid rafts to downregulate c-raferk signaling and inhibit metastasis of cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo chiu et al 2012 moreover using high-throughput mass spectrometry jang et al 2012 discovered that lipoteichoic acid a major virulence factor of gram-positive bacteria binds to phb2 implicating phb2 in host immune responses to infectionsflavaglines have a unique cyclopentabbenzofuran skeleton ebada et al 2011 ribeiro et al 2012b rocaglamide the first of these compounds to be described was isolated more than 30 years ago by king et al 1982 from medicinal plants of the genus aglaia meliaceae in southeast asia since then 100 other flavaglines including rocaglaol and silvestrol have been identified figure 3
a figure s3although flavaglines display a myriad of pharmacological effects due to their anticancer anti-inflammatory neuroprotective and cardioprotective properties it is the anticancer properties that have attracted the most attention from scientists ebada et al 2011 ribeiro et al 2012b at concentrations in the low-nanomolar range flavaglines inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells are not toxic to normal cells hausott et al 2004 ribeiro et al 2012a su et al 2006 thuaud et al 2009 2011 zhu et al 2007 and show no sign of toxicity in mice bernard et al 2011 cencic et al 2009 lee et al 1998 thuaud et al 2009 zhu et al 2009 king et al 1982 were the first to demonstrate the antileukemic activity of rocaglamide in a mouse model subsequently ohse et al 1996 established that flavaglines strongly inhibit protein synthesis and lee et al 1998 demonstrated that these compounds delay the growth of human breast cancer cells in athymic mice however because the tumors were not eradicated these investigations were interrupted since then with the development of targeted therapies approaches to the development of cytostatic compounds have changed radically gutierrez et al 2009 as a consequence there is now a renewed interest in flavaglines as potential anticancer agentsalthough flavaglines have shown significant anticancer effects in mouse models of cancer alinari et al 2012 cencic et al 2009 hwang et al 2004 king et al 1982 lee et al 1998 lucas et al 2009 meurer-grimes et al 2002 thuaud et al 2011 their most promising potential is associated with their ability to enhance the in vivo efficacy of other anticancer drugs and in particular to relieve the resistance of tumors to chemotherapies indeed flavaglines were shown to enhance doxorubicin chemosensitivity in several mouse lymphoma models bordeleau et al 2008 cencic et al 2009 zhu et al 2009 importantly flavaglines did not display any overt sign of toxicity in mice in these studies consistent with previous observationsvery recently using affinity chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry polier et al 2012 identified phb1 and phb2 as the direct targets of flavaglines the binding of flavaglines to phbs inhibits ras-c-raf-mek-erk signaling and such signaling is essential for the survival of cancer cells figure 3b c-raf needs to interact with phbs to be phosphorylated by ras and thus participate in signaling rajalingam et al 2005 the binding of flavaglines to phbs prevents this interaction both in vitro and in vivo knockdown of either phb1 or phb2 with small interfering rna sirna mimicked the effects of flavaglines through inhibition of cap-dependent translation and an arrest of cell-cycle progression via a depletion of cyclin d3 cdk4 cdk6 and cdc25a moreover rocaglamide strongly depleted phb1 and phosphorylated c-raf at the plasma membrane suggesting that the relocation of phbs to the membrane is involved in the mode of action of flavaglines these various observations support the idea that flavaglines exert their anticancer effects through their action on phbsthese findings are of particular interest because we now have evidence that ras-c-raf-erk constitutes an overactivated pathway in many human cancers and that this pathway is a promising target for treatments in oncology matallanas et al 2011 maurer et al 2011 bleumink et al 2011 showed that this inhibition of c-raf-erk signaling blocks cap-dependent protein synthesis indeed erk activates mnk1 which phosphorylates eif4e allowing cap-dependent synthesis to occur few proteins require phosphorylated eif4e for their synthesis and most of them are involved in oncogenesis angiogenesis and chemoresistance thus the in vivo anticancer effects of flavaglines seems to be a consequence of the inhibition of the synthesis of cyclins d1 and d3 cdk4 cdk6 cdc25a c-myc bcl-2 survivin mcl-1 the pim12 kinases vascular endothelial growth factor vegf and matrix metallopeptidase 9 mmp9 bordeleau et al 2008 cencic et al 2009 nasr et al 2013 polier et al 2012 schatz et al 2011although inhibition of the ras-c-raf-erk signaling pathway may be involved in the flavagline-induced suppression of cap-dependent synthesis in cells bleumink et al 2011 it is more difficult to explain the observed inhibition of protein synthesis in vitro where c-raf mek and erk are absent this observation suggests either that another molecular target is involved in the inhibition of translation by flavaglines or that phbs interact with the translational machinery to control its activityflavaglines induce apoptosis in cancer cells through a myriad of mechanisms ribeiro et al 2012b involving cytochrome c mi et al 2006b zhu et al 2007 apoptosis-inducing factor thuaud et al 2009 caspase 12 thuaud et al 2009 and the mapks jnk and p38 zhu et al 2007 2009 whether these mechanisms involve phb1 and phb2 or another target remains to be determined the effect of flavaglines on phbs-interacting proteins other than c-raf is also an issue that needs to be examinedsilvestrol is the flavagline that has been the most studied in vivo for its anticancer properties alinari et al 2012 bordeleau et al 2008 cencic et al 2009 hwang et al 2004 kim et al 2007 mi et al 2006a robert et al 2009 schatz et al 2011 however the development of this compound is severely limited by its sensitivity to p-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance and its suboptimal absorption distribution metabolism and excretion adme characteristics gupta et al 2011 liu et al 2012 fortunately structure-activity relationship sar studies have established that the deletion of the methyl ester or the amide in position 2 results in compounds that escape this multidrug resistance without any loss of cytotoxicity figure s3 ribeiro et al 2012a thuaud et al 2009 2011in addition to their anticancer effects flavaglines also display potent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities indeed flavaglines at nanomolar concentrations act as immunosuppressors by inhibiting the production of interferon- tnf- il-2 and il-4 by t lymphocytes proksch et al 2005 this immunosuppression is mediated by activation of the mapks jnk and p38 which selectively inactivate nuclear factor of activated t cells nfat figure 3c it is still not known how flavaglines activate jnk and p38 at higher concentrations flavaglines also inhibit nf-b another transcription factor that is involved in inflammation baumann et al 2002 interestingly the synthetic flavagline imd-019064 inhibits nf-b signaling and displays potent in vitro anti-inflammatory effects that manifest as an inhibition of proinflammatory mediator release from astrocytes microglia and endothelial cells fahrig et al 2005 figure 3d more importantly imd-019064 protects dopaminergic neurons both in vitro and in vivo in models of parkinsons disease mpp-induced neurotoxicity and traumatic brain injury recent sar studies led to the identification of fl40 which provides greater neuroprotection in vitro than imd-019064 ribeiro et al 2012a the neuroprotective activity of flavaglines is currently being actively explored by the pharmaceutical company intermed discovery which has been developing imd-026259 figure 3a for the treatment of parkinsons diseasethese studies have prompted evaluations of the cytoprotective potential of flavaglines in other tissues the synthetic flavagline fl3 figure 3a which displays a potent cytotoxicity in cancer cells thuaud et al 2009 was shown to protect cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo against various stresses including anthracycline cardiotoxicity bernard et al 2011 the heart is extremely sensitive to the toxicity of anthracyclines such as doxorubicin these medicines are among the most effective anticancer drugs available and have antitumor activity against both hematopoietic and solid tumors unfortunately their clinical utility is markedly hampered by their cardiotoxicity which can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure minotti et al 2004fl3 protects cardiomyocytes from the apoptosis induced by both doxorubicin and serum starvation bernard et al 2011 interestingly these stresses are of different natures doxorubicin causes an oxidative stress whereas serum starvation blocks the growth factor signaling that is necessary for cell survival mimicking an important component of myocardial ischemia treatment with fl3 significantly reduces mortality and attenuates both apoptosis and fibrosis in the hearts of doxorubicin-treated mice thus flavaglines may both enhance the anticancer efficacy of anthracyclines and alleviate their main adverse effect cardiotoxicity anthracyclines are central to cancer chemotherapies so the discovery of a new class of cardioprotective agents would be extremely valuable clinically and further studies to examine this therapeutic application are therefore warrantedthe cardioprotective effects of flavaglines are mediated through the phosphorylation of the small heat shock protein hsp27 figure 3e hsp27 is critical for protecting cells against many types of damage including the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin and exerts its effects in several ways including chaperone activity control of redox homeostasis and inhibition of apoptosis kostenko and moens 2009 whether phbs or another target is involved in this cardioprotective effect of flavaglines has not been examinedalthough the cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of flavaglines have not yet been demonstrated to be mediated through a binding to phbs it is unlikely that another target is involved indeed both their pharmacological effects and cytotoxicity in cancer cells occur at the same range of concentrations as far as we know no other natural product that possesses such a complex three-dimensional structure has been shown to bind to different classes of proteins with a comparably high affinityit would be useful to further evaluate this therapeutic application of flavaglines and elucidate the mechanisms involved it may seem odd than an anticancer drug can also display various cardio- or neuroprotective effects however there are precedents for example rapamycin derivatives erlich et al 2007 khan et al 2006 malagelada et al 2010 and hdac inhibitors are both cardio- and neuroprotectants in addition to having anticancer effects bush and mckinsey 2009 mai et al 2009 a first clue to understanding this paradox may be that phb1 is localized mainly in the mitochondria of normal cells and in the nucleus in cancer cells chen et al 2011 the translocation of phb1 from the nucleus and cytosol to mitochondria promotes survival in normal cells but apoptosis in cancer cells fusaro et al 2003 it is therefore tempting to suggest that the opposite behaviors of flavaglines in cancer and normal cells are the consequences of different intracellular localizations of phbsalthough many academic studies have demonstrated a therapeutic potential of flavaglines in preclinical models of cancers and inflammatory and cardiac diseases these compounds have not yet been examined in a clinical trial to our knowledge only two pharmaceutical companies intermed discovery and infinity pharmaceutical are currently developing flavaglines for the treatment of parkinsons disease and cancers respectivelyisolated from the japanese sea hare dolabella auricularia suenaga et al 2004 suenaga et al 1996 aurilide is a cyclic depsipeptide that displays a strong cytotoxicity at nanomolar and subnanomolar concentrations on a panel of cancer cell lines figure 4
a figure s4 work involving affinity chromatography identified phb1 as the molecular target of aurilide sato et al 2011 the binding of this toxin activates the proteolytic processing of the dynamin-like gtpase optic atrophy 1 opa1 which in turn triggers remodeling of the mitochondrial cristae leading to apoptosis this devastating effect on mitochondria probably explains the extreme toxicity of this compound which impedes its study in animal models and precludes its further development as a medicamentin a quest to identify compounds that modulate skin pigmentation snyder et al 2005 screened a tagged-triazine library on unpigmented melanocytes figure 4b figure s5 they identified melanogenin as an inducer of pigmentation with an ec50 of 25 m this compound upregulates tyrosinase the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of melanin
snyder et al 2005 conjugated melanogenin to an agarose support which enabled them to identify phb1 as the molecular target by affinity chromatography further biological investigations confirmed that phb1 is responsible for the induction of pigmentation immunofluorescence microscopy studies showed that phb1 was localized only in mitochondria which led these authors to suggest that the binding of melanogenin to phb1 may disrupt the interaction between phb1 and a transcriptional factor thereby causing its translocation to the nucleus and induction of the expression of tyrosinase the rate-limiting enzyme in melanogenesisthis study was the first to demonstrate and unravel the involvement of phb1 in the regulation of mammalian pigmentation although these discoveries may provide a basis for the development of novel cosmetics and drugs for the treatment of pigment disorders no further investigation in this direction has been reportedrecently wu and wu 2012 demonstrated that phb1 is enriched in lipid rafts in hacat keratinocytes after uvb irradiation and that this protects the cells against uvb-induced apoptosis these findings are consistent with the notion that phb1 contributes to protection of the skin against uvb
kolonin et al 2004 and staquicini et al 2011 used phage display techniques to identify a peptide homologous to a region of annexin a2 that targets phb1 at the surface of the vascular endothelial cells of white adipose tissue figure 4c by fusion with a proapoptotic sequence they obtained adipotide ckggrakdc-gg-dklaklak2 a chimeric peptide that damages the vasculature of the adipose tissue and consequently disrupts the blood supply to adipocytes in obese mice adipotide induced a substantial loss of weight and normalized metabolism leading to a reversal of obesity without any adverse sign of

rhesus monkeys 4 weeks of adipotide treatment led to a 28 reduction in body fat and also reduced food intake and improved the animals metabolic status ie reduced insulin resistance these findings have implications for the development of treatment for type 2 diabetes barnhart et al 2011 adipotide is currently being developed by the biotech company arrowhead research corporation and entered a phase i trial involving obese patients with prostate cancer in july 2012 because adipotide has a negative endocrine effect on tumor growth it is expected to slow tumor growth in these patientscapsaicin is a component of hot chili peppers that inhibits the proliferation of many cancer cell lines using affinity chromatography fletcher et al 2012 demonstrated that capsaicin 011 mm binds to phb2 and that this binding induces a series of proapoptotic events in human myeloid leukemia cells including 1 the translocation of phb2 from mitochondria to the nucleus 2 the dissociation of phb2 from adenine nucleotide translocator 2 ant2 leading to a noncompetitive inhibition of ant activity and 3 the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol figure 4d the latter two effects could be caused by the depletion of phb2 in mitochondria which would compromise mitochondrial integrity and promote apoptosiscapsaicin was used in these experiments at concentrations that are much too high to be

metabolism and inflammation makes these proteins promising therapeutic targets for novel treatments for cancer and neurodegenerative metabolic and inflammatory diseases their intracellular localization and their translocation in response to proapoptotic signals differ substantially between normal and cancer cells this divergence of behavior which is not fully understood may be exploited to develop therapeutic agents the phase i trial of adipotide for the treatment of obese patients with prostate cancer may be the first step on the road to developing phb ligands of clinical value the recent discovery that flavaglines target phbs warrants further studies of this class of anticancer and cytoprotective agent in addition to the ongoing exploration of the roles of phbs in physiology and physiopathology we anticipate that this field will stimulate research addressing other classes of phb ligands with original pharmacological propertiesover the last few years phbs have been found to interact with more than 60 other proteins to regulate a myriad of cellular events there is no doubt that in the coming years new partners and new cellular regulations will be uncovered an important issue will be to determine when the alterations of phb expression subcellular localization and signaling are involved in the etiology of not only cancers but also cardiac neurological inflammatory and metabolic diseases translating this knowledge into clinical applications may lead to the development of new medicines and biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosissars coronavirus main protease sars-cov mpro is essential for the replication of the virus and regarded as a major antiviral drug target anand et al 2003 yang et al 2003 tan et al 2005 steuber and hilgenfeld 2010 peptide aldehyde inhibitors are widely used as research tools to characterize the substrate specificity of serine and cysteine proteases in complex with the crystalline target enzyme they provide a wealth of information on the specificity-defining subsites of the substrate-binding site for this purpose we have previously described peptide aldehydes as inhibitors of the sars-coronavirus main protease sars-cov mpro al-gharabli et al 2006 a major advantage of aldehydes over other peptide electrophiles is their reversible binding to the active-site sulfhydryl of cysteine proteases we have previously used this property to screen a small library of non-peptide nucleophiles mostly amines for molecules that would efficiently enhance the inhibition of the aldehyde by formation of a stronger binding aldehyde-nucleophile ligation product in a second step of this process that we named dynamic ligation screening schmidt et al 2008 the most efficient compound in this process had its amino group replaced by an aldehyde moiety and was reacted with the target enzyme and the resulting covalent adduct was subsequently used to screen the same library of nucleophiles for those that would react with the aldehyde this way starting from a substrate-like peptide aldehyde we obtained a low-m non-peptidic reversible inhibitor from two fragments which by themselves had no or only very low inhibitory activity schmidt et al 2008interestingly it turned out that some peptide aldehydes with an amino-acid sequence deviating from the consensus sequence embracing the cleavage sites of polyprotein substrates were surprisingly efficient as inhibitors in particular peptide aldehydes with p2  asp or ser inhibited the main protease with a relatively low ic50 al-gharabli et al 2006 although it is generally agreed that the s2 specificity subsite of the enzyme has a strong preference for large hydrophobic side-chains such as leu phe or met fan et al 2004 fan et al 2005 lai et al 2006 we therefore assumed that the hydrophilic p2 side-chain of these inhibitors would be oriented towards the solvent rather than occupy the s2 pocket and that the hydrophobic p3 residue would be binding to that pocket al-gharabli et al 2006 schmidt et al 2008 this model was based on a crystal structure of a peptidyl chloromethyl ketone bound to the sars-cov main protease in which this arrangement had been observed yang et al 2003 here we show by x-ray crystallography of a number of peptide aldehyde complexes with the protein that this is not the case instead the hydrophilic ser or asp residues in the p2 position bind to the hydrophobic s2 subsite in order to understand these binding modes the atomic interactions were analyzed in detail also we report the inhibition kinetics of these compounds and re-evaluate the cleavage specificity of the enzyme as far as the p2 position is concerned in addition we determined a crystal structure of sars-cov mpro in complex with the aldehyde cm-ff-h cinnamoyl-phe-phe-h which has a phenylalanine residue in the p1 position and exhibits high inhibitory activity against sars-cov mpro with ki

 in all complexes continuous electron density between the aldehyde carbonyl c-atom of the inhibitor and cys145-s of sars-cov mpro fig 1 indicates the formation of a thiohemiacetal as a result of the nucleophilic attack of the catalytic cysteine onto the c-terminal aldehyde of the inhibitor the main-chain conformations of sars-cov mpro in the five complexes are basically identical with overall root mean-square deviations rmsd of 016  036  for c atoms in addition to the crystal soaking experiments we also tried to cocrystallize sars-cov mpro with the aldehydes the crystals obtained were predominantly of space group p21 with the exception of the complex with ac-nsfsq-h which still displayed space group c2 however in most of the p21 crystals no electron density for the aldehyde could be observed thus while the presence of the inhibitors induced a change of space group in most cases the compounds themselves were not detected in the crystals an exception was ac-estlq-h the crystals of its complex with the mpro diffracted to 189  but in both enzyme monomers in the asymmetric unit electron density could only be seen for residues p1 gln and p2 leu of the inhibitor fig 1e and f crystallographic data and refinement statistics for all six crystal structures are summarized in table 1in the sars-cov mpro complex with aldehyde inhibitor ac-nsfsq-h the thiohemiacetal adopts alternative configurations fig 2
a and b this is likely the result of nucleophilic attack by cys145 onto the planar carbonyl from either side in the r-isomer the thiohemiacetal oxygen forms a hydrogen bond with the imidazole of his41 330  of the catalytic dyad fig 2c whereas in the s-isomer the oxygen atom points away from his41 and into the oxyanion hole forming h-bonds with the main-chain amides of gly143 271  and cys 145 315  fig 2d previous x-ray and nmr studies of aldehyde binding to various cysteine and serine proteases demonstrated that one or both configurations were present in the structures of the complexes delbaere and brayer 1985 webber et al 1998 robin et al 2009the s2 subsite is a large pocket lined by residues his41 met49 cys145 his164 met165 asp187 arg188mc mc contribution from main-chain atoms only and gln 189 fig 1 at the cleavage sites of the sars-cov mpro in the viral polyproteins the p2 position is mostly found to be occupied by leu or phe accordingly almost all inhibitors designed for the enzyme carry a large hydrophobic group in the p2 position we were therefore very surprised to find the ser or asp side chains in the p2 position of the aldehydes bound to this hydrophobic site fig 1 in the sars-cov mpro complexes with ac-nstsq-h or ac-nsfsq-h there is no hydrogen-bonding interaction between the side chain of p2-ser and residues of the s2 subsite as the ser side chain is small there is no steric barrier for ser binding in the large s2 pocket the serine does not quite reach the bottom of the s2 pocket but the distance between its o atom and the carbonyl oxygen of residue gln192 is 40  leaving no space for a water molecule to locate in between accordingly we did not find any electron density suggesting the presence of a well-ordered water in the s2 pocket although disordered water is probably present in the pocket on both sides of the serine side-chain where free spaces with a total volume of 70 3 are present between the substrate and the protein it should be noted that the side-chain of gln189 which contributes to one wall of the s2 pocket is quite flexible and adopts different conformations in the various inhibitor complexes allowing or preventing the access of water to the pocketin case of the sars-cov mpro complex with ac-dsfdq-h the p2 asp side-chain is situated between the side chains of met49 and met165 which form opposite walls of the s2 pocket most interestingly its carboxylate oxygens undergo close interactions with the sulfur atoms of the two methionines the distances rso between the s atoms of met49 and met165 on the one hand and the o2 and o1 atoms respectively of p2-asp on the other are 336 and 345  fig 3

 our study confirmed that the most favored residues in the p2 position of the substrate after leu are the hydrophobic amino acids phe met val and ile substrates with polar amino acids in p2 are poorly cleaved the cleavage efficiency for the substrate with p2  ser was 160-times lower than for the best substrate p2  leu furthermore the peptide with p2  asp was not cleaved at all after incubation with sars-cov mpro for 16 hthe s1 subsite is lined by residues phe140 asn142 gly143 ser144 cys145 his163 glu166 and his172 from the substrate specificity results fan et al 2004 fan et al 2005 lai et al 2006 p1 has to be gln moreover in all sars-cov mpro complex structures described so far lee et al 2005 xue et al 2007 yang et al 2005 yang et al 2003 yin et al 2007 the s1 subsite is occupied by a polar group ie the side chain of gln or a five-membered lactam used as a glutamine surrogate shie et al synthesized a series of -unsaturated esters containing both p1 and p2 phenylalanine residues which showed modest inhibitory activity against the sars-cov mpro ic50

 leading to an opening of the s1 subsite towards the solvent a similar movement of asn142 has been observed in the crystal structure of sars-cov mpro in complex with an inhibitor called n1 pdb id 1wof where both the regular conformation of this residue and the one observed in our structure were found yang et al 2005 the p1-benzyl group of cm-ff-h binds to the s1 subsite by making hydrophobic interactions with phe140 leu141 asn142 and the p3 cinnamoyl group of cm-ff-h as the s1 subsite specificity does not seem to be as stringent as previously thought it may well be possible that other chemical groups can be accommodated here thereby expanding the opportunities for designing and synthesizing efficient inhibitors of the sars-cov mproatomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the rcsb protein data bank under id codes 3sn8 3sna 3snb 3snc 3snd and 3sne see table 1in 2003 li et al4 demonstrated that ace2 is the receptor responsible for sars coronavirus entry binding to the ace2 receptor requires the surface unit of a viral spike protein s1 figure56 subsequent cell entry relies on priming by the serine protease tmprss2 transmembrane protease serine 25 two recent reports confirmed that sars-cov-2 also enters the cell via this route78 importantly sars-cov-2 entry into the cell could be blocked both by s-protein neutralizing antibodies and tmprss2 inhibitors camostat mesylate7 in the lung ace2 expression occurs in type 2 pneumocytes and macrophages generally however pulmonary ace2 expression is low when compared with other organs like the intestine testis heart and kidney911ace2 displays considerable homology with ace angiotensin-converting enzyme 40 identity and 61 similarity and on this basis received its name in 200012 as a mono-carboxypeptidase it hydrolyzes multiple peptides including apelin opioids kinins and angiotensins much of the work on ace2 has centered on the biologic effects related to the formation of angiotensin-17 from angiotensin ii1314 unlike ace ace2 does not convert angiotensin i to angiotensin ii nor do ace inhibitors block its activity this is not surprising because the homology does not concern the active site ace2 is the most potent of the 3 enzymes known to convert the vasoconstrictor angiotensin ii to angiotensin-17915 angiotensin-17 is increasingly recognized to have organ-protective properties that oppose and counterbalance those of angiotensin ii within the ras the other known target peptide for ace2 cleavage is angiotensin i with the subsequent formation of angiotensin-19 figureace2 is a membrane-bound enzyme and its soluble levels in blood are very low915 cleavage of its membrane-anchor shedding by adam17 a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 figure underlies its occurrence in body fluids angiotensin ii via its at1 angiotensin ii type 1 receptor upregulates adam17 thus increasing soluble ace2 levels16 in urine soluble ace2 levels can be significant and likely originate from shedding from the proximal tubular membrane in pathological states shedding of ace2 is often increased resulting in elevated soluble ace2 levels in blood urine and other body fluids1718 indeed a doubling of soluble ace2 has been reported in cerebrospinal fluid of hypertensive patients16 however given that by far the majority of ace2 is membrane-bound even a doubling is unlikely to significantly alter the amount of membrane-bound ace2 for instance if 2 of ace2 occurs in a soluble form doubling would increase this to 4 while still 96 of ace2 is membrane-bound theoretically ras blockade might partly reverse this thus returning the percent of membrane-bound ace2 to 9798 this is unlikely to seriously affect sars-cov-2 entry which depends on membrane-bound full-length ace2this is really at the crux of the question and the prevailing confusion and panic that we are witnessing in the medical community after the word came out that ace2 is the receptor for sars-cov-2 part of the confusion in social media and the public in general stands because at times ace inhibitors are confused with ace2 inhibitors those are 2 different enzymes with 2 different active sites and any effect of ace inhibitors on ace2 activity must therefore be an indirect one via their respective substrates this is unlikely to have any relationship with sars-cov-2 binding there are however limited reports that ace inhibitors affect the expression of ace2 in the heart and the kidney19 at1 receptor blockers arbs alter ace2 expression more consistently in several studies both at the mrna and protein level1921 upregulation has been best documented in cardiac tissue and in the renal vasculature yet even here results are diverse required high doses and often differed per arb and per organ given the relationship with adam17 a clear distinction should be made between membrane-bound and soluble ace2 because an increase in soluble ace2 if anything might imply a decrease in membrane-bound ace2 because measuring membrane-bound ace2 in vivo is technically challenging most publications from humans have reported levels of ace2 activity in blood that reflect the soluble ace2 protein circulating at very low levels22 if arbs as a drug class would truly upregulate membrane-bound ace2 it is reasonable to first assume that this is because of at1 receptor blockade in agreement with this assumption angiotensin ii acutely induced ace2 internalization via its at1 receptor in ace2-transfected neuroblastoma cells23 ace inhibitors should then have the same directional effect as arbs although for these drugs there is very limited data showing upregulation of ace2 esler and esler24 suggested that the difference is due to the increased levels of angiotensin ii occurring after arb treatment but not ace inhibition high angiotensin ii levels would impose an increased substrate load on the enzyme thus requiring its upregulation here it should be stressed that the carboxypeptidase ace2 has multiple substrates and that an alteration in the level of one of these substrates angiotensin ii occurring at fmolml levels ie many orders of magnitude below the actual ace2 concentration cannot possibly make a meaningful difference in its substrate loadtaken together there is evidence from animal studies that arbs may upregulate membrane-bound ace2 whereas ace inhibitors may not the current data however are often conflicting and vary between arbs and tissue eg heart versus kidney even if the reported upregulation of tissue ace2 by arbs in animal studies and generally with high doses could be extrapolated to humans this would not establish that it is sufficient to facilitate sars-cov-2 entrywe like to point out that a potentially beneficial pulmonary effect of arbs needs to be considered as well during acute lung injury alveolar ace2 appears to be downregulated2526 this would decrease angiotensin ii metabolism thus resulting in higher local levels of this peptide which increases alveolar permeability and fosters lung injury in this context one can speculate that having increased ace2 expression by preexisting arbs treatment may actually be protective in the course of sars-cov-2 infectionit is not clear how hypertension was coded in the recent sars-cov-2 report1we can only speculate that it might be based on the use of hypertension medication rather than actual blood pressure measurement to truly address whether patients with hypertension are more likely to get serious and fatal sars-cov-2 infections a prospective cohort study with incidence rates of sars-cov-2 infection in a cohort of patients with hypertension and patients without hypertension is required with similar exposure history instead what has been reported is history of hypertension versus not in sars-cov-2 patients without any adjustment eg for age the use of ras blockers as a causal link is an assumption that lacks evidence as discussed here we therefore strongly recommend that patients who are taking ace inhibitors or arbs for high blood pressure heart failure or other medical indications should not withdraw their current treatment regimens unless they are specifically advised to do so by their physician or healthcare provider there is an additional caveat any resulting destabilizing of blood pressure control in hypertension which might possibly occur with medication changes would carry unacceptable risks of precipitating strokes and heart attacks risks which clearly are not just hypothetical simply discontinuing antihypertensive agents is strongly discouraged and should not be an option considering the widespread use of ras blockers throughout the world in particular asian people seem to be more prone to cough and therefore arbs may be preferable27the available clinical database from the pandemic to date is insufficient to provide sufficient detail on the variables of interest hypertension diagnosis and the antihypertensive drugs prescribed to test the hypotheses proposed and provide certitude hence such information is desperately neededalthough no therapy is currently established for sars-cov-2 patients the field is moving rapidly with potential approaches being considered those include broad spectrum antivirals such as favipiravir and remdesivir28 tmprss2 inhibition with camostat mesylate7 and adam17 upregulation a more specific approach might be using soluble recombinant ace2 protein to intercept the virus from binding to the full-length ace2 anchored in the cell plasma membrane6 these approaches make the most sense for the treatment of patients with high risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome for preventive purposes the goal of course is the development of a sars-cov-2 vaccinein closing we see no reason to abandon or discontinue temporarily the use of ras blockers preventatively in sars-cov-2 patients29 there are some concerns that these agents particularly arbs can affect the expression of ace2 based on animal models that however have not been challenged with coronavirus infection to evaluate the impact of ras blocker therapy since this information is lacking we see no rationale to panic and to alter the prescription of this critically important class of antihypertensives their therapeutic benefit in our opinion outweighs any potential risk of them predisposing to corona infection moreover it is unknown whether alternative antihypertensives do not carry the same risk another question is what to do in infected individuals with risk to progress to end-stage renal disease here the decision should be based on clinical judgment and considering the pros and cons of ras blockade in the acutely ill such as the presence or absence of hypotension and kidney functionwe thank estrellita uijl for preparing the figuredr batlle is funded by national institute of diabetes and digestive kidney diseases grant r01dk104785d batlle is a co-inventor of the patent active low molecular weight variants of ace2 and has also submitted a patent on the potential use of novel ace2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 proteins for coronavirus infection d batlle is founder of angiotensin therapeutics the other authors report no conflictsin these unprecedented times the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic has had a severe impact globally most countries have implemented strict lockdown and social distancing and isolation of the elderly and vulnerable are advised at the time of writing this review just over three million individuals have been affected globally with more than 200000 deaths1 the global infection curve has not flattened with new infections continuing to rise although the pandemic originated in china the epicentre shifted to europe and presently the most affected country is the united states of america usathe first cases of atypical pneumonia linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market in wuhan china were described in late december 2019 china announced an outbreak on 31 december 2019 and closed the market once it became apparent that this was the place of origin in early january 2020 investigations by chinese authorities continued contacts were traced and managed and the world health organization who was notified on 7 january 2020 a novel coronavirus was announced as the cause of the outbreak2 and on 10 january 2020 china shared the viral gene sequence to allow the development of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr diagnostic kits3 the first case outside china was confirmed in thailand and strict screening measures travel restrictions and the lockdown of wuhan were implemented4 the first case in the usa was announced on 20 january 20205 and the first cases in europe were reported in france on 24 january 2020 in individuals with a travel history to the hubei province china subsequent human-to-human transmission followed and cases with no travel history were reported6 africa reported its first case on 14 february 2020 in egypt since then the number of cases has risen dramatically figure 1this is the third coronavirus outbreak in as many decades7 the previous two were severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers in 2012 which had mortality rates of 10 and 37 respectively8 the mortality rate of sars-cov-2  although lower compared to sars and mers seems to have a more devastating effect globallythe sars-cov-2 has a single-stranded rna genome enveloped in a lipid membrane embedded with glycoprotein spikes giving the impression of a crown  hence the name coronavirus cov rna viruses use an error-prone rna polymerase for replication and therefore have high mutation rates and can easily mutate during epidemics adapting to local environment to facilitate transmission9 however these mutations are part of the virus life cycle and should not impact outbreaks10zhu et al extracted viral rna from respiratory samples of three patients admitted in wuhan2 and on 7 january 2020 the chinese centre for disease control and prevention identified a novel betacoronavirus from one of the samples they described 85 sequence homology with bat sars-like cov which caused the sars outbreak in 200323 the virus was originally named 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov and later changed to sars-cov-2 this is the seventh member of the coronavirus family of the six previously described covs four cause no more than minimal common cold symptoms in humans the other two members are sars-cov and mers-covall covs have zoonotic origins with bats considered the natural reservoir hosts3 in sars-cov-2 the sequence identity of pangolin origin covs and sars-cov-2 is 99 and this raised the question whether the virus is of pangolin origin11 the natural hosts namely bats have a limited inflammatory response as seen by lower interleukin il-1 concentrations and adequate type i interferons giving rise to a generalized anti-inflammatory milieu and an ability to limit excessive inflammatory response12 interestingly this may also explain bats relatively long lifespan of 3040 years12 type i interferon is known to assist with antiviral control cov cannot infect humans unless the virus undergoes mutation and recombination in animal hostssars-cov-2 is a highly virulent virus the original infection distribution in mainland china was found to be 7145 in patients 3065 years of age and only 035 in patients less than 10 years old13 it is easily transmissible with initial studies finding that each infected person is capable of infecting another 22 individuals4 the virus is stable on plastic and stainless-steel surfaces for up to 72 h14 further enhancing its ability to spread the relatively long incubation period worsens the situation as individuals may be asymptomatic carriers for up to two weeks thereby releasing the virus in their surroundings in a process called viral sheddingthe most common symptoms of covid-19 are respiratory transmission is via droplets directly and on surfaces and direct contact sars-cov-2 has also been detected in stool which may point to a possible faeco-oral route of transmission513although covid-19 may present mildly as a flu-like disease or even be asymptomatic some patients develop significant cardiovascular and other adverse effects according to present data 81 of infected individuals have only mild flu-like symptoms and recover within two weeks 14 have severe symptoms requiring hospitalization and 5 become critically ill15 these differences in presentation are thought to be due to viral load age and the presence of comorbidities12 as many carriers may be asymptomatic and an underestimated source of transmission13 effective screening and contact tracing are important to identify high-risk individuals advise self-isolation where transmission risk is high and trace possible cases to limit community spread children may also be possible carriers of asymptomatic infection lu et al described that children under 10 years old may be asymptomatic in 158 of cases16the elderly are considered high risk this may be due to an aging immune system with concomitant lymphopaenia and decreased cd4-count and t-cell regulation12 elderly people have a propensity to excessive autoimmune and inflammatory responses which may be exacerbated by covid-19 infection12 male patients and those with associated comorbidities are also at increased riskrisk factors for complicated infection were identified in early studies most of these corroborated the increased risk associated with age male sex and certain comorbidities the studies also described several laboratory and clinical markers that can be used to determine prognosisthe first study reported 41 cases admitted early in january 2020 in wuhan china the median age of 49 years there were no adolescents or children 73 were male and 66 had exposure to the huanan seafood wholesale market of this cohort 13 32 were admitted to an intensive care unit icu lymphopaenia increased d-dimer levels increased partial thromboplastin time ptt increased aspartate aminotransferase ast increased high-sensitivity troponin-i hs-tni and increased inflammatory cytokines indicated poor prognosis and outcome8another early study described 99 hospitalized cases in wuhan the average age was 55 years most were male and 49 had a history of exposure to the huanan seafood market age obesity and comorbid illness were associated with increased mortality and concern was expressed about individuals with compromised immune function such as human immunodeficiency virus hiv increased age diabetics or those on immunosuppressive therapy17a subsequent study of six family members in shenzhen china who had returned from a visit to wuhan described the first person-to-person transmission of the virus18yang et al described the clinical course and outcomes in 710 patients with covid-19 pneumonia including 52 who were critically ill in the critically ill the mean age was 597 years 67 were male 40 had comorbidities and 615 had died at 28 days median time seven days non-survival risk was associated with advance age and comorbidities19li et al collected demographic information exposure history and illness timelines on 425 of the initial confirmed cases in wuhan the median age was 59 years and 56 were male as 55 of cases were linked to the original huanan seafood wholesale market this was evident of human-to-human transmission they described a doubling of cases every 74 days and suggested a 14-day observation or quarantine period for exposed persons they described that each infected person spread the virus to an average of 22 people they come in contact with as none of their cases were children they postulated that children may be less likely to be infected or have milder symptoms4ruan et al examined factors associated with increased mortality in 150 patients from wuhan they collected demographic clinical and laboratory data and found that age the presence of comorbidities or secondary infections and increased cardiac tn c-reactive protein crp and il-6 concentrations were predictors of fatal outcome20the cytokine storm occurs in a subgroup of patients with severe covid-19 this is defined as a hyperinflammatory state characterized by a fulminant and fatal increase in inflammatory cytokines with subsequent multiorgan failure ferritin concentrations are raised cytopaenia occurs and approximately half of the patients develop significant pulmonary involvement such as acute respiratory distress syndrome ards21 these findings suggest that in the study by ruan et al the mortality in the severely ill patients was probably caused by a cytokine storma study of 195 covid-19 patients from two hospitals in china of which one was in wuhan found that 54 276 died in hospital increased risk of in-hospital death was associated with older age organ failure and raised d-dimer levels and the authors postulated that these could possibly be used on admission to identify patients with a worse prognosis3wang et al examined the epidemiological demographic clinical laboratory radiological and treatment data on 138 patients hospitalized with covid-19 they found that 26 of patients needed icu admission and 43 died the median patient age was 56 years and 543 were male older age comorbidities and abnormal laboratory tests including lymphopaenia increased d-dimer increased lactate dehydrogenase ldh and prolonged ptt were associated with a worse prognosis22liu et al performed a small study on only 12 patients in shenzhen china of which eight were males and seven were older than 60 years they found that laboratory parameters associated with worse prognosis were decreased albumin concentrations lymphopaenia and elevated crp and ldh concentrations they measured angiotensin ii concentrations by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa and found them to be increased this increased angiotensin ii was associated with a high viral load and lung injury suggesting an imbalanced renin angiotensin system ras the authors therefore questioned the possible utility of angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker arb as possible treatment modalities23the first case diagnosed in usa on 20 january 2020 was a young male patient who had travelled to wuhan china he never visited the wuhan market or any healthcare facility and also had no contact with ill people while in the city the usas patient zero initially presented with mild symptoms but progressed to pneumonia on day nine his laboratory results showed leucopaenia mild thrombocytopaenia elevated creatinine and liver enzymes alkaline phosphatase alp alanine transferase alt aspartate transferase ast5arentz studied 21 critically ill covid-19-infected patients in washington state with a mean age of 70 years of which 52 were male seventeen 81 were admitted to icu 33 developed cardiomyopathy and the mortality rate was 67 again most were elderly patients and had comorbidities24the ras is an important regulator of blood pressure homeostasis renin is a protease secreted by the kidney which cleaves angiotensinogen a serpin family protein produced by the liver to inactive angiotensin i this is then cleaved to the active angiotensin ii by ace which is secreted by the kidneys and lungs and expressed ubiquitously in the vasculature angiotensin ii binds angiotensin type 1 at1 receptors and causes vasoconstriction and the secretion of aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone with subsequent renal sodium and water reabsorption and raised blood pressure25when angiotensin ii binds at1 receptor it leads to an increase in blood pressure as well as inflammation fibrosis oxidative stress and vasoconstriction26 this is important for the regulation of cardiovascular haemodynamic neurological and endothelial functions27receptors of the ras2728 figure 2when angiotensin ii binds to the at1 receptor vasoconstriction inflammation fibrosis and proliferation follow leading to hypertension cardiac fibrosis thrombosis and ards binding of angiotensin 17 to mas receptor leads to vasodilatation anti-apoptotic anti-fibrotic and anti-proliferation activity and a reduction in blood pressure decreased cardiac fibrosis decreased thrombosis and decreased ards37when at2 is bound no is released which is an anti-inflammatory vasodilator reduces platelet aggregation and may facilitate the insulin action29 therefore angiotensin ii binding of at1 is an inflammatory mediator via reactive oxygen species ros and nuclear factor kappa  nfk and provides a mitogenic stimulus for smooth muscles leading to oxidative stress this is a common feature of atherosclerosis diabetes mellitus hypertension and hyperlipidaemia stimulation of at1 also leads to upregulation of adhesion molecules and interferes with insulin signalling leading to insulin resistance ace inhibitors and arb therapy were found to decrease circulating crp and this is thought to be due to decreased angiotensin ii stimulation of at1disruption of ace2 in mice leads to severe cardiac contractility defects increased angiotensin ii concentrations and the expression of hypoxia-induced cardiac genes when ace was also decreased this cardiac phenotype was rescued however loss of ace2 did not affect blood pressure or kidney development in these mice and it was postulated that ace could potentially compensate for loss of ace2 yet even when these mice were treated with ace inhibitor there was a similar reduction in blood pressure as in wild type therefore ace2 has no apparent direct effect on blood pressure25a strong association between ras and cardiovascular disease neurodegenerative disorders and acute lung injury was demonstrated in mice with acid aspiration lung injury in severe acute lung failure a significant downregulation of ace2 was noted the expression of ace was unchanged leading to a marked increase in angiotensin ii as its formation is upregulated by ace therefore ace promotes disease through increased angiotensin ii and ace-deficient mice were partly protected against acid-induced lung injury recombinant ace2 and at2 receptor expression protected mice from severe lung disease in this scenario38 the inactivation of ace on an ace2 knockout background rescued the mice from severe lung failure therefore it was postulated that ace promotes acute lung injury and ace2 alleviates it38patel and verma found that high pulmonary ace2 concentrations protect against lung injury39 the loss of ace2 expression in acute lung injury led to leaky pulmonary blood vessels through at1 receptor stimulation however hydrostatic oedema could not be excluded as a causative factor emphasizing the need for further studies on the local effects of angiotensin ii in lungs38pathology of the ras is associated with pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis40 angiotensin ii upregulates the expression of profibrotic cytokines leading to pulmonary fibrosis and severe inflammation with increased vascular permeability treatment with ace inhibitors and arb may attenuate this40 animal models of ards found reduced ace2 concentrations and treatment with exogenous ace2 alleviated the symptoms37further studies found that the loss of ace2 rendered subjects susceptible to heart failure and postulated that increasing ace2 concentrations were cardioprotective loss of ace2 also led to age-dependant cardiomyopathy pulmonary cardiac and renal injuries33diabetes mellitus a major comorbid risk factor in covid-19 is associated with increased ace2 expression this may explain why patients suffering from diabetes have greater susceptibility to sars infection33ace2 is involved in the possible protective arm of the ras the ace2angiotensin 17mas axis counterbalances the aceangiotensin iiat1 axis which is associated with vasoconstriction inflammation cell proliferation hypertrophy fibrosis and tissue modelling therefore ace2 protects against ras-induced injuries by decreasing angiotensin ii and generating angiotensin 17 which increases substrate availability of the protective axis41 ace2 knockout mice and those on ace2 inhibitors had increased susceptibility to myocardial infarction hypertension angiotensin ii-induced myocardial hypertrophy microvascular complication inflammation fibrosis diastolic and systolic dysfunction and oxidative stressace inhibitors block ace and arb block the action of angiotensin ii on ati receptors both lead to an increased ace2 activity42 the drugs may alleviate inflammation decrease endothelial dysfunction and increase insulin sensitivity29 the arbs have more potential to block the ras than acei as about 40 of angiotensin ii is formed via non-ace pathways in humans29 arbs are known to have less side-effects than ace inhibitorsanother area of interest is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ppar- insulin resistance is strongly associated with hypertension ace2 expression is increased with the use of ppar- agonists26 ppar- agonists thiazolidinediones attenuate the development of hypertension and improve endothelial dysfunction in angiotensin ii-infused rats43 these rats had decreased at1 expression therefore the effects were most likely mediated through at2 receptor activation44 however ppar- agonists were shown to increase the risk of congestive heart failure and possibly myocardial infarctionother medications that have an effect on ace2 concentrations include mineralocorticoid antagonists such as the aldosterone receptor antagonist spironolactone which possibly increases ace2 concentrations in macrophages this was not the case in the heart tissue of patients suffering from chronic heart failure45 statins possibly augment ace expression in heart and kidney tissue and may also bring about epigenetic changes in ace2 gene but more work is needed to determine the exact mechanism of these findings26presently there is still a paucity of evidence on how ace inhibitors or arb may impact the ace2angiotensin 17 pathway in the lung heart and brain and ongoing research in this field is neededhuman ace2 is a functional receptor essential for cellular entry of covs and is the same receptor used by sars-cov to gain access to cells32 kuba et al provided the first genetic proof that ace2 was a crucial receptor for sars-cov in vivo46 when ace2 knockout and wildtype mice were infected with sars-cov the knockout mice had very low levels of viral replication in their lungs in the wildtype mice sars-cov infection was associated with lung failure which was attenuated by treatment blocking the ras they postulated that sars-cov infection downregulated ace2 concentrations possibly explaining the decline in lung function observed with viral infection46the spike s proteins of covs facilitate viral entry into the target cells by attaching to ace2 as an entry receptor3247 sars-cov-2 like sars-cov has a viral envelope studded with spikes consisting of glycoproteins made up by two subunits namely s1 and s2 subunit s1 binds the cell surface bound ace2 and subunit s2 fuses with the cell membrane42 the cellular serine protease tmprss2 is essential for s-protein priming and facilitates viral cell entry47 tmprss is expressed on sars-cov target cells48 after subunit s1 of the spike binds to membrane bound ace2 tmprss2 activates the spike and cleaves the ace2 receptor tmprss2 also acts on the s2 subunit causing an irreversible conformational change facilitating fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane and endocytosis1347 therefore both ace2 and tmprss2 are essential for cellular entry sars-cov-2 binds human ace2 with 1020-fold higher affinity than sars-cov13 this may be due to a more compact virus structure enabling better receptor affinity and enhanced ability to be internalized figure 3 shows the cellular entry of the sars-cov2the binding of sars-cov-2 may decrease ace2 concentrations and increase the angiotensin ii to angiotensin 17 ratio which may exacerbate pulmonary injury and tissue fibrosis26 angiotensin 17 may provide resilience from the development of pulmonary failure in covid-19 further supporting this finding49oudit et al33 determined that sars-cov infection has a detrimental effect on cardiac function and led to cardiac dysfunction arrhythmias and death they measured ace2 concentrations in mice infected with human strain sars-cov and in hearts obtained from autopsy of patients who died from sars infection they found that sars-cov infection led to a decrease in ace2 expression in the myocardium of mice with subsequent myocardial dysfunction sars-cov mrna expression was found in 35 of the autopsy heart samples which was associated with decreased ace2 protein expression therefore they postulated that sars-cov leads to cardiac dysfunction by downregulating myocardial ace2 possibly due to a cytokine-mediated downregulation of ace2 mrna33the gastrointestinal system is also not spared from the effects of sars-cov-2 infection xiao et al found that ace2 was abundant in the glandular cells of gastric duodenal and rectal epithelia50 hamming et al described ace2 in the small intestine further underlining the importance of sars-cov-2 involvement in the gastrointestinal system34an interesting observation is the difference in infection rate and adverse outcomes in adults and children although there have been reports of less covid-19 infection in children there is a lack of evidence that ace2 changes with age37 a possible hypothesis is that children are less susceptible to covid-19 infection due to cross-protective antibodies from multiple upper respiratory tract infections and that their lower respiratory tracts have less ace249 limited studies and data in children are available and conclusive evidence to support postulations that children are less likely to be adversely affected by sars-cov-2 infection is lackingit is clear from statistical data that older people especially men are more affected by covid-19 increased ace2 have been described in older individuals and in males52 which could possibly be linked to the worse outcome in this population groupas yet there is no evidence of causal relationship between ace2 activity and sars-cov-2 mortality also ace2 concentrations do not correlate with the degree of disease severity53 activation of the ras is associated with endothelial dysfunction and multiple organ injuries therefore theoretically treatment focusing on manipulation and control of this system may be beneficial37covid-19-infected patients have a worse prognosis when they suffer from comorbidities especially cardiovascular ras inhibitors have been shown to have a protective effect on the kidney and myocardium and it may therefore be dangerous to withdraw treatment in these patients a higher risk of relapse in patients with cardiovascular or renal disease has also been demonstrated54angiotensin ii concentrations were found to be increased in covid-19 infection and positively correlated with viral load and lung injury23 increased ace2 concentrations may possibly lead to a greater susceptibility for covid-19 infection but may also be cardioprotective this led to a crossroad in clinical decision-making ras blocking treatment may increase ace2 and facilitate virus entry but the beneficial effects it has in patients suffering from comorbid conditions cannot be ignoreda lot can be learned from studies involving other respiratory viruses where the use of ace2-lowering treatment was investigated a study on patients with novel influenza a h7n9 a virus of avian origin from eastern china in 2013 found that more than 70 developed ards and had a high mortality patients with markedly elevated angiotensin ii concentrations had poorer disease outcome with a predictive value higher than crp the authors speculated that recombinant ace2 and angiotensin ii-lowering treatment such as ace inhibitors and arb could be beneficial51avian influenza a h5n1 primarily infects poultry and birds but since 2003 has also been infecting humans increased angiotensin ii and downregulation of ace2 was linked to infection severity and mortality when mice infected with h5n1 were given recombinant ace2 the virus-induced lung injury was ameliorated55the use of intravenous ace inhibitors and arb in experimental animals increases ace2 expression in the cardiopulmonary circulation systems causing a possible increased risk for sars-cov-2 infection56 severe covid-19 outcomes were described in patients with existing hypertension coronary artery disease diabetes and chronic kidney disease57 the question was asked whether their current treatment regimens were increasing their risk for infectiontheoretically if ace2 activity in cell membranes decreased it should reduce the ability of sars-cov-2 to enter cells but this also decreases the protective effects of ace2 in various organ systems where ace2 is expressed angiotensin ii may contribute to organ damage in covid-1958 and concentrations were found to correlate with viral load and lung injury23 downregulation of ace2 in the lung tissue may facilitate neutrophil infiltration leading to angiotensin ii accumulation and ras activation54when covid-19 binds ace2 and enters the cell the expression of ace2 is downregulated this downregulation essentially removes the brakes from angiotensin ii and possibly induces local activation of immune cells in lungs decreased ace2 in alveolar type ii cells leads to surfactant deficit and the development of lung injury59 although an increase of ace2 may lead to higher cell infection rates and proliferation of the virus it may be beneficial in patients with lung injury and withdrawal may be harmful especially in high-risk patients54in a study on acid-induced lung injury in mice ace2 downregulation by sars-cov worsened lung injury the induced lung injury improved with the use of arbs and the findings are suggestive that sars-cov exacerbates lung injury by decreasing ace2 and that it is also reversible by arbs46an increase in ace2 in heart tissue may be cardioprotective therefore sars-cov-2 could possibly influence the fine balance between angiotensin ii and angiotensin 17 whereas treatment could block ras and protect the heart and other organs37cardiac tissue function may be compromised by the increase in angiotensin ii to angiotensin 17 ratio loss of ace2 in the central nervous system specifically the brain stem cardiovascular centre may cause an increased sympathetic drive changes in baroreflex and worsening of hypertension26 loss of ace2 in the vasculature can contribute to endothelial dysfunction and inflammation and exacerbate existing atherosclerosis and diabetesthere have been concerns that increased ace2 expression in heart brain and urine after treatment with arb may increase an individuals risk of infection but very little evidence is available showing significant changes in serum of pulmonary ace2 concentrations however the significance of ace2 expression and its effect on covid-19 pathogenesis and mortality are uncertain39therefore do the benefits outweigh the risks a joint statement issued on 17 march 2020 found that no experimental or clinical evidence demonstrating beneficial or adverse outcomes in covid-19 patients using ace inhibitors or arb was available and that urgent additional research is needed it stated that treatment should not be discontinued if patients become infected with sars-cov-260downregulation of ace2 was proposed as a possible treatment to reduce susceptibility to covid-19 infection however the ensuing relatively unopposed action of angiotensin ii could lead to worsening hypertension inflammation thrombosis and adverse lung and cardiac outcome41 a study by kuba et al determined that infection with sars-cov downregulates the expression of ace2 these low ace2 concentrations were associated with lung oedema and acute lung injury which contributed to the severe lung pathology in patients already on ace inhibitors at the time of sars-cov infection they concluded that modulating ras may therefore be useful in treating infection46some studies also questioned the use of anti-ace2 antibodies to inhibit viral replication of sars-cov these could possibly inhibit virus-induced cytopathicity in a dose-dependent manner32trials are underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of recombinant human ace2 and the arb losartan in covid-19-infected patients infusion of recombinant human ace2 may act as a decoy to interfere with viral replication soluble ace2 could potentially bind sars-cov and thereby prevent the binding of the viral spike protein to full length membrane-bound ace236 reducing viral infection of cells36 recombinant ace2 was shown to reverse lung injury in sars-cov-infected patients55 wang et al found that ace inhibitors and arb offer partial cardiovascular protection by increasing ace2 and that iv recombinant ace2 may be beneficial in preventing pulmonary arterial hypertension and acute lung injury41however circulating ace2 concentrations are usually very low to undetectable and do not accurately represent the amount of membrane-bound ace2 and would not be sufficient to sequester sars-cov-2 in the circulation26 a proposed clinical trial with recombinant ace2 was withdrawn due to the unknown effects and the possibility of the drug inducing significant hypotension26ace2 interaction with sars-cov is important in the development of sars-associated cardiomyopathy as viral rna was found in the myocardium on postmortem examination the associated cardiac injury due to reduced expression of ace2 possibly played a major role in the morbidity and mortality of patients infected with sars-cov recombinant ace2 was found to normalize angiotensin ii concentrations suggesting that it may be beneficial to prevent organ damage caused by sars-cov the question thus arose if it is possible and beneficial to balance ras control to reduce infection and prevent organ damage in covid-19-infected patients33protease inhibitors against tmprss2 block viral entry in vitro by inhibiting the entry of sars-cov-2 into cells47 camostat mesylate a serine protease inhibitor used in japan to treat chronic pancreatitis inhibits tmprss2 and can block entry of sars-cov-2 into bronchial epithelial cells in vitro4748many patients with severe covid-19 infection admitted to icu are in septic shock as most angiotensin i to angiotensin ii conversion by ace occurs in the lungs significant lung injury may decrease this decreased ace function was found to be a predictor of mortality angiotensin ii a novel vasopressor agent may be beneficial in this patient populationstrategies to decrease ace2 may possibly attenuate sars-cov-2 infectivity this may happen in a number of ways firstly endogenous angiotensin ii theoretically prevents infection by binding the ace2 during its degradation and therefore may compete with sars-cov-2 to bind to the receptor secondly binding of angiotensin ii to at1 causes internalization and downregulation of ace2 and lastly angiotensin ii causes at1-dependent destruction of ace2 further decreasing the virus ability to enter cells angiotensin ii is not yet available for use commercially but due to the number of critically ill patients and the promising outcome of the drug it has been made available for compassionate use in italy germany and uk61another focus area is the use of angiotensin 17 as a novel treatment for covid-1926 experimental studies found that angiotensin 17 reduced the acute inflammatory response and subsequent fibrosis in acid-induced ards in mice62 angiotensin 17 protected the lung against inflammation and fibrosis inhibited alveolar cell apoptosis attenuated endothelial cell activation loss of barrier function and oedema and decreased synthesis of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines the authors therefore recommended that the concentrations of angiotensin 17 should be increased to protect covid-19-infected patients62the effects of ace2 on covid-19 infections need to be further evaluated and randomized control trials are necessary to obtain the highest level of evidence although ace2 has beneficial effects by regulating the protective arm of ras some authors postulate that high levels make patients more susceptible to covid-19 infection the ras has numerous attractive therapy targets for covid19 infection trials are needed to evaluate the use of ace inhibitors and arbs in covid-19 patientsthe coronaviridae family comprises viruses with genetic heterogeneity that allow differentiation in four genera -coronavirus -coronavirus -coronavirus and -coronavirus sars-cov-2 a novel virus belonging to the coronavirus family is causing the ongoing global pandemic the coronavirus rna genome ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases in length is the widest among all rna viruses with a degree of variabilityalthough several coronaviruses are potentially pathogenic for humans most produce minimally symptomatic disease 1 however in 2002 and 2012 the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers respectively resulted in relevant morbidity and mortality due to acute respiratory failure arf 23an epidemic of respiratory disease caused by sars coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 began in china and has spread to other countries the novel coronavirus was originally named 2019-ncov and subsequently sars-cov-2 by world health organization who the virus is a -coronavirus belonging to the subgenus botulinum of coronaviridae and it is responsible for a zoonotic disease coronavirus disease 2019 or covid-19 which target airways and may severely involve lung airspaces 4 when lung parenchyma is affected in addition to fever symptoms include dry cough dyspnoea and in more serious cases potentially fatal arf 5 mechanisms by which older age and underlying medical conditions negatively impact acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and concurrent cytokine storm require to be understoodthe sars-cov-2 is a single-strand positive-sense rna genome identified by high-throughput sequencing and released through virologicalorg the virus was originally discovered in humans the animal reservoir remains unclear although growing data support that sars-cov-2 was a chimeric virus with high grade of affinity for genetic information of a bat coronavirus and elevated similarity in codon usage bias with snake 6 also the intermediate hosts of sars-cov-2 remain undeterminedthe interaction between viruses and host cells at entry site is crucial for disease onset and progression in influenza a h1n1 based on evidence in swine model receptor binding domain on the host cells may also be used by intracellular bacteria both favouring the infection and enhancing the burden of symptoms 7 for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 the virus tropism for the respiratory system is sustained by the attachment to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 ace2 is a membrane-anchored carboxypeptidase highly expressed by airway epithelial and type i and ii alveolar epithelial cells found to be the virus cell entry receptor previously during sars-cov outbreak 8focus of this review is to dissect the knowledge on ace2 receptor on airway and lung epithelium and attempt to understand whether underlying diseases or therapies are able to modulate expression affecting sars-cov-2 cell entry and infectivitya large spike s protein that forms homotrimers protruding from the viral surface mediates coronaviruses attachment and adhesion to human target cells in most avian and mammalian coronaviruses s protein is cleaved into two smaller proteins although this has not been reported in sars-cov however two different functional regions have been described s1 and s2 9the s1 subunit consists of four core domains s1a to s1d the distal s1 domain mediates receptor association and stabilization whereas the s2 domain promotes structural rearrangements and finally membrane fusion coronaviruses use different regions of s1 domain to interact with specific binding receptorsacetylated sialoside attachment receptors expressed by glycoproteins and glycolipids on the host cell are the target of endemic human coronaviruses oc43 and hku1 while non-acetylated sialoside attachment receptors bind the a domain sa of mers-cov for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 a small fragment of the s1 region receptor binding domain rbd is necessary for binding to the peptidase domain of ace2 this represents the critical site for virushost cell interaction 10sars-cov-2 has low homology to s-protein of sars-cov with patches of sequences in the rbd domain walls et al reported that sars-cov-2 s-protein has a boundary between the s1 and s2 subunits site presumably due to furin cleavage in the golgi compartment 11in particular sars-cov and sars-cov-2 present more conserved s2 fusion machinery than the s1 subunit with the highest divergence found within sa and sb 12 these changes in sars-cov-2 result in a functional advantage as the ectodomain s attaches to ace2 with 15 nm affinity which is approximately 10- to 20-fold higher than that of sars-cov 13 these findings have been proposed as the rationale for elucidating the efficient transmission of sars-cov-2 in humansace2 expression is widely represented in type ii lung alveolar cells oesophageal epithelial cells enterocytes cholangiocytes myocardial cells kidney proximal tubule cells and bladder urothelial cells 14single-nucleotide ace2 polymorphisms are not associated with sars susceptibility or outcomes 15 furthermore in experimental models the binding of the s protein to ace2 is not altered by the addition of a specific ace2 inhibitor confirming the inability of this inhibitor to block sars infection 16 conversely sars-cov2 s-mediated entry into target was enabled in mice immunized with a stabilized sars-cov s-proteinthese data support a role for sars-cov neutralizing antibodies in preventing receptor engagement 12 while ace2 has been extensively discussed as receptor for entry into the host alveolar cell in a murine ards model ace2 protected lungs from severe acute injury 1718 impaired tissue repair mechanisms increased vascular permeability fluid accumulation in extra-alveolar spaces and oxidantantioxidant imbalance have been described in relation to ace2 deficiency 19 20 21 after attachment and virion membrane fusion ace2 expression is downregulated resulting in excessive production of angiotensin ang enhancing oxidative stress mechanisms 22 in contrast to what happens during other viral infectionssars-cov-2 internalization is promoted through hemagglutinin cleavage operated by the transmembrane serine protease 2 tmprss2 a cell-surface protein expressed by epithelial cells within the airway and alveolar spaces 823 viral priming mechanisms tmprss2 dependent were demonstrated during previous coronaviruses and influenza a h1n1 outbreaks 82425 fig 1
 tmprss2 involvement in sars-cov-2 is currently under investigation based on in vitro data of camostat mesylate an inhibitor of the protease activity of tmprss2 demonstrating sars-cov-2 entry cell inhibition 8 a phase iii study with camostat mesylate nct04321096 and a phase iiiii study with nafamostat an extremely potent tmprss2 inhibitor nct04352400 are ongoing 2627 preliminary results are expected by 2021ace is a type 1 transmembrane monomeric glycoprotein expressed in lungs intestine kidneys brain aorta and adrenal medulla it cleaves two amino acids from ang i to produce ang ii ace2 conversely cleaves single amino acid from ang ii to generate ang-17 28in human lungs elevated ang iiang-17 ratio favours vascular permeability and extra-alveolar fluid accumulation conversely elevated levels of ang-17 though mas receptor mas1 activation which is widely present on endothelial cells exert vasodilatory anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects 29 most importantly ace2 differs from ace for not being inhibited by ace inhibitors ace-i 30in a rat model ace2 mrna expression is significantly reduced in copd rat lung compared to wild type animals 31 likewise ace2 overexpression through intratracheal injection of ad-ace2 significantly attenuated the lung function deteriorations and pathological manifestations of copd supporting a pathogenetic aceace2 imbalance in copd 32 similarly an increment in aceace2 ratio has been reported in the murine model of asthma however administration of ace2 activator counteracts the cytokine storm il-1 il-4 nf-b bcl2 p-akt p-p38 in asthmatic rat model 33to an uncertain extent smoking may play a role in ace2 modulation lungs from rats chronically exposed to cigarette smoke exhibited significant reduction in ace2 expression as well as an increase of ace based on data independently reported by guan et al 34 and zhang et al 35 incidence of sars-cov-2 appears to be lower in patient with smoking history by contrast smoking seems to be associated with adverse outcome these mechanisms need to be fully exploredprevious data highlighted that viral infections might amplify local inflammation in chronic respiratory conditions in atopic subjects hrv and allergen exposure singularly increased icam-1 expression resulting in migration of immune effector cells into the airways 36 conversely in sars-cov2 infection the presence of comorbid chronic respiratory disorders is not associated with enhanced risk for developing infection compared to other common clinical conditions however covid could evolve in more severe clinical outcomes in copd subjects 34however it is recognised that a down regulation of ace2 following infection does promote lung injury 19 in lung reduced ace2 levels prompt reduce ang-17 levels which promotes protective tissues regeneration and reduces reactive oxygen species ros 2832 covid outbreak makes ace2 regulation in lung epithelial cells a crucial area of research interestcovid-19 exhibits more severe clinical course in patients with hypertension cardiovascular disease and diabetes 3537 renin-angiotensin system ras inhibitors are the cornerstone of therapy of many cardiovascular and renal diseases these drugs are widely used for reducing blood pressure in hypertensive patients experimental and clinical models show different responses from administration of agents interfering with this regulatory axis angiotensin-receptor blockers arb and mineralocorticoid-receptor blockers seem to increase the levels of ace2 gene expression and cardiac ace2 activity 3839 whereas ace-i are associated with elevated cardiac ace2 activity but not cardiac ace2 mrna 40 an early study documented increased cardiac ace2 expression after myocardial infarction in rats treated with agents blocking the ang ii receptors when compared to placebo 41 similarly higher urinary ace2 levels were observed in hypertensive patients treated with olmesartan an ang ii type 1 at1 receptor antagonist 42 furthermore administration of losartan another at1 receptor antagonist counterbalanced smoke-induced decrease of ace2 and restored to some extent the aceace2 ratio in the lung 43in a small cohort study levels of ang ii were found markedly increased in covid-19 plasma samples 44 these results are in accordance with previous studies which reported high ang ii levels in mice infected with sars 17 and with experiments in h7n9 viruses showing that ang ii levels were related to worse clinical outcomes 45ras may represent a double-edged sword its positive impact in upregulating ace2 has been demonstrated 41 suggesting a potential role against lung damage in sars-cov-2 infected patients 22 however risk of increase susceptibility to infection linked to ace2 upregulation due to ras inhibitors remains uncertain and needs to be clarified fang et al based on higher prevalence of hypertension diabetes mellitus and chronic cardiovascular diseases among patients who died from covid-19 postulated that ace-i or arbs might favour severe disease progression 46 however more recently in a multicentre retrospective study including 1128 covid-19 inpatients with hypertension the use of ace-iarbs was associated with lower all-cause mortality adjusted hr 042 95 ci 019092 p  003 and septic shock adjusted hr 036 95 ci 016084 p  001 compared with ace-iarb non-use unfortunately the study was not designed to detect differences between ace-i and arbs and overall the patient number in ace-iarb group was limited 1881128 166 47 these data support the statements of european society of cardiology 48 american heart association the heart failure society of america and the american college of cardiology 49 international society of hypertension 50 italian society of pharmacology 51 and european society of hypertension 52 that recommend against ace-i or sartans discontinuation in light of the current evidenceshowever a recent comment by phadke et al 53 based on unpublished observational data supports the use of losartan or telmisartan which block at1 receptor more avidly than valsartan to potentially prevent the virus spreadfinally data about non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs nsaids are still far from being clarified earlier evidences in rat models suggest that ibuprofen and thiazolidinediones may upregulate ace2 expression 54 55 56 it has yet to be established whether these observations may objectively influence the clinical scenario in patients with sars-cov-2 infectionthere is sufficient evidence to support the concept that one of the main battles in the war on covid will be played at the level of ace2 the receptor for viral cell entry in healthy individuals ace2 promotes lung homeostasis through the production of ang-17 in chronic respiratory conditions ace2 down-regulation may prevent sars-cov-2 host cell interaction however patients with pre-existing copd who are infected with sars-cov-2 may experience poor clinical outcomes most likely due to reduced respiratory reservedata on ace2 modulation from ras inhibitors is inconclusive whilst subjects chronically exposed to these agents appear to have hypothetically higher availability of cell receptors within lung it remains uncertain whether this may influence the susceptibility to developing sars-cov-2 infection however ace2 upregulation may also result in enhanced host defence mechanisms that counteract ace2 virus-induced downregulationdissecting the pathways of the major cell receptor for sars-cov-2 will let us understand both the mechanisms of viral induced direct lung injury and the effects of perturbation of ace2 on their function manipulation of ace2 receptor expression and its implication on viral cell entry has the potential to be a major target for therapythe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paperthe high prevalence of diabetes globally makes it a frequent comorbidity in patients with coronavirus-associated disease 2019 covid-19 though diabetes increases the risk of infection in general most studies have reported prevalence of diabetes almost similar to that in general population in patients with covid-19 a meta-analysis of eight trials in china showed that diabetes was present in 8 of 46248 patients with covid-19 1 understandably prevalence of diabetes in patients with covid-19 varies by region age and ethnicity it is not known whether patients with diabetes with well-controlled blood glucose levels have an increased risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov-2patients with diabetes who develop covid-19 have been seen to have a worse prognosis and increased mortality in most studies in 201 chinese patients with diabetes a hazard ratio of 234 95 ci 135405 p  0002 for acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 2 has been reported further meta-analysis of nine studies from china n  1936 showed a significant correlation between severity of covid-19 and diabetes or 267 95 ci 191374 p  001 3 similarly case fatality rate was 73 in patients with diabetes as opposed to 23 in those without diabetes in a report of 44672 patients of covid-19 by chinese centre for disease control 4 a recent study in 1122 patients with covid-19 in 88 centres across the usa found diabetes to be associated with more than fourfold increase in mortality 5how diabetes increases severity of covid-19 is unclear though several factors may be responsible table 1 poor glycaemic control impairs several aspects of the innate and adaptive immune response to viral infections and to the potential secondary bacterial infection in the lungs 6 7 defects in immunity namely inappropriate t-cell action impaired natural killer cell activity and defects in complement action could reduce viral clearance 8 interestingly ards in patients with covid-19 is driven by severe hypoxaemia despite relatively well-preserved lung mechanics pre-existing proinflammatory state could accentuate the cytokine storm which is believed to be responsible for ards as well as multi-organ dysfunction in covid-19 9 in this context it is important to note that there is strong association between type 2 diabetes obesity and abnormal secretion of adipokines and cytokines like tnf-alfa and interferon which may further impair immunity and predispose to severe infection 10 further diabetes is associated with increased plasminogen levels which has been postulated to increase the virulence of sars cov-2 11 presence of these inflammation and prothrombotic factors has been shown in a study in 174 patients hospitalised with covid-19 in wuhan china significantly higher serum levels of interleukein 6 erythrocyte sedimentation rate creactive protein ferritin fibrinogen and ddimer were reported in patients with diabetes compared with those without diabetes 12 increased viral replication in diabetes may also due to an increase in furin which is a type1 membranebound protease involved in the entry of coronaviruses into the cell 13 in addition pre-existing comorbidities associated with diabetes like hypertension coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease further worsen the prognosis lastly hypoglycaemia which could occur during treatment of diabetes may additionally worsen the clinical outcomesin this respect role of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor in pathogenesis of covid-19 in patients with diabetes is intriguing sars cov-2 enters the cell by binding to ace2 a process which involves many steps and several enzymes and proteins 14 there is experimental evidence for downregulation of ace2 in diabetes 15 which may predispose to more severe lung injury on the other hand ace2 is a receptor for sars cov-2 and this downregulation might reduce the entry of virus into cells these issues are further discussed below in context of use of anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hypertensive drugsthe precise effect of treatment with various oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents on the severity of covid-19 is not known though there are some theoretical considerations metformin has shown modest benefits in lower respiratory tract infections and pulmonary tuberculosis 16 though gastrointestinal tolerability in sick patients is of concern thiazolidinediones have been shown to increase ace2 levels 17 however propensity of thiazolidinediones to cause fluid retention and the risk of congestive heart failure in covid-19 would make these agents unfavourable for treatment glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists have has been shown to increase ace2 and increase surfactant in experimental animals 18 practical significance of changes in ace2 levels with use of thiazolidinediones and glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists is not known sulfonylureas are effective but the risk of hypoglycaemia especially in the setting of irregular meals might preclude their use nevertheless sulfonylureas can be considered whenever blood glucose monitoring is possiblethere is some data regarding use of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 inhibitors from previous viral epidemics dpp4 is the prime receptor for middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus responsible for its entry into cell 19 hence the possibility of dpp4 facilitating the entry of sars cov-2 into the cell cannot be ruled out in that context it is an interesting postulation that widespread use of dpp4 inhibitors in india and many other countries might be protecting individuals with diabetes from this infection on the other hand dpp4 inhibitors can potentially interfere with immune response which may be harmful but clinical data from dpp4 inhibitors has shown that this is generally not the case 20there is increasing use of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 sglt-2 inhibitors worldwide and in india interestingly sglt-2 inhibitors could also activate ace2 indirectly especially if used along with ace inhibitors 21 there is a hypothetical possibility of sglt-2 inhibitors reducing lactate production because of reduction in oxygen demand of tissues which could reduce viral entry by raising cytosolic ph 22 further caution about dehydration and the possibility of euglycaemic ketoacidosis need to be observed when using sglt-2 inhibitors in sick patients with covid-19 insulin has also been shown to increase ace2 expression by attenuating the effect of a disintegrin and metalloprotease adam-17 23 practical relevance of these findings is not known at present in any case insulin remains the agent of choice to control sugars in hospitalised patients with covid-19 this however necessitates frequent monitoring of blood glucose and poses some practical concerns in terms of increasing the exposure of healthcare provider to the covid-19 patient strategies like single dose of basal insulin and self-monitoring of glucose by patients are worth considering in that context further technologies like remote continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pump could be usefulthus it appears safe to continue the usual anti-hyperglycemic medications in most patients who have mild infection good general condition and normal oral intake however sglt-2 inhibitors might need discontinuation due to the risk of dehydration and euglycaemic ketoacidosis metformin may also need to be stopped if there is vomiting or poor oral intake doses of other anti-hyperglyacemic drugs like sulfonylureas and insulin may have to be altered depending upon the blood glucose levels hospitalised patients especially those requiring intensive care would need insulin for glycaemic controlthese are commonly used drugs in patients with diabetes especially in those with hypertension and kidney dysfunction there have been a lot of literature and debate whether these drugs could benefit or harm patients having covid-19 infection this issue is discussed belowthere has been a lot of interest in ace inhibitors and arbs following the identification of ace2 as the receptor for sars cov-2 ace inhibitors and arbs increase the levels of ace2 by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin 1 to angiotensin 2 increased ace2 expression could theoretically increase viral binding and entry into cell though there is no clinical evidence to support this otherwise attractive hypothesis reduced angiotensin 2 as a result of ace inhibition and increased angiotensin 17 as a result of increased activity of ace2 could reduce the cytosolic ph which could result in more favourable environment for viral endocytosis 24 also angiotensin 17 has been shown to increase sympathetic activity by acting on mas receptors in the brainstem which could contribute to cardiovascular morbidity observed in these patients 25 however most of these concerns are hypothetical with minimal evidenceincreased ace2 might not result in increased viral entry because of the limited availability of the serine protease tmprss2 which is required for viral binding 20 increased ace2 and consequently angiotensin 17 have vasodilatory and antifibrotic effects and have been shown to be protective against lung injury in animals 26 treatment with arbs was reported to reduce mortality in ebola virus infection 27 previously a small study in ten patients with ards showed that recombinant ace2 was well tolerated and led to an increase in angiotensin 17 levels 28
there are no controlled studies on the use of ace inhibitors and arbs in patients with covid-19the clinical evidence is inconclusive while one study in china did not find any association of ace inhibitor use with severity of disease there was an increased mortality in patients with covid-19 receiving ace inhibitors and arbs in another study 29 30 one study in the usa did not find any significant difference in mortality in patients who received ace inhibitors and arbs and those who did not 31 a recently published study in 1128 patients hospitalised with covid-19 in nine hospitals in hubei china showed significantly reduced all-cause mortality with the use of ace inhibitors or arbs compared with other anti-hypertensive drugs 32many patients with covid-19 have shown hypokalemia indicating activation of ras 33 and ace inhibitors and arbs may have a role 34
in this subject situation is far from clear and there are too many unknown factors which might be operative in the interaction between ace2 diabetes ace inhibitorsarbs and lung injury the lack of evidence for either benefit or harm has prompted european society of cardiology council on hypertension european society of hypertension and american heart association to advise continuing with ace inhibitors and arbs in case a patient develops covid-19 35 a clinical trial is underway to study the arb losartan and recombinant human ace2 in patients with covid-19there have been several commentaries on the relationship between diabetes and covid-19 36 however several unanswered questions remain about which the knowledge and information is limited clearly further research could lead to important insights table 2 some of these are discussed belowwhat is the natural history of covid-19 in patients with diabetes the natural course of the disease after infection of patients with diabetes with sars cov-2 has not been documented well for example we dont know if the incubation period is different in people with diabetes it is also possible those patients of diabetes who are young have short duration of diabetes and well controlled may have less severe covid-19 infection there is a possibility of reduced viral clearance in diabetes as has been reported in patients who are on corticosteroids 37 this could have public health implications as the patients with diabetes could remain infectious for a longer period than those without diabetesuse of drugs in treatment of covid-19 which could have effect on glycaemia chloroquine has also been licensed for use in india for patients with type 2 diabetes although the efficacy of chloroquine is not proven it has been used in patients with covid-19 38 chloroquine has a weak anti-hyperglycaemic effect and there is a theoretical risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with other anti-hyperglycaemic drugscorticosteroids though neither effective nor recommended are frequently used in ards and sepsis and would worsen glycemic levelscovid-19 and pancreatic beta cells there is significant expression of ace2 receptors in pancreatic islets and hyperglycaemia lasting up to 3 years has been reported in patients with sars 39 direct injury to beta cells is a possibility and patients recovering from covid-19 might need major changes in anti-hyperglycaemic regimen recently new-onset diabetes has been reported in patients with covid-19 11suboptimal lifestyle measures and other issues during lockdownthere are restrictions on movement of people and lockdowns in several parts of the world in order to contain the pandemic this poses some challenges in the evaluation and treatment of patients with diabetes there are limited opportunities for exercise as regular walks and visits to gyms or swimming pools are not possible dietary irregularity could occur because of staying at homethere is considerable mental stress because of the unpredictability of the disease as well as social immobility as brought out in an excellent study in healthy people in china at the time when there was a huge burden of covid-19 there 40patients may find it difficult to procure healthy foods medicines insulin needles and glucose strips etc because of partial or complete lockdowns the problem becomes more pronounced with elderly poor and disadvantaged sections of societythere could be underreporting of symptoms because of the perceived need to avoid visiting hospitalsall these factors could cause glucose dysregulation and could predispose patients to complications like infections hyperosmolar coma ketoacidosis and even acute cardiac events a prediction model of the effect of lockdown in india on blood glucose showed a 36 increase in hba1c at the end of 45 days of lockdown and future increase in diabetes-related complications 41use of remote education and advice telemedicine also emails texts can be very helpful in these times to impart education and has been shown to improve glycaemia telemedicine guidelines for physicians in india have been published 42 patients need to be educated about the need to visit the hospital urgently in emergency situations like vomiting drowsiness shortness of breath chest pain weakness of limbs altered sensorium etc 43covid-19 testing for all patients with diabetes given the increased severity of covid-19 in patients with diabetes a case could be made for testing of all people with diabetes for the presence of disease that would be a humongous task considering the high prevalence of diabetes high-risk groups like those with high hba1c those with comorbidities long duration of diabetes or elderly could be chosen for testing however utility of this approach remains to be proven there are frequent false negative tests and repeated testing may be required in asymptomatic individuals since there is no treatment currently recommended for asymptomatic people therefore apart from isolating them detecting these patients might not prove meaningful clinicallyethnic variations in severity of covi19 in patients with diabetes in the united states the disease has caused disproportionately more fatalities in blacks and asians compared with whites 44 south asia africa and korea have seen much lower mortality than rest of the world whether it is because of the different approaches topublic health measures innate immunity or due to some ethnicity-specific variability in response to viral infection or availability of good medical resources remains to be studied interactions between ethnicity diabetes and severity of covid-19 will be of interest considering the racial disparities in the prevalence of diabetes according to a recent report prevalence of covid-19 and mortality due to the disease correlated significantly with frequency of d allele in ace gene 45 such polymorphisms in ace gene as well as several other genes involved in the pathophysiology of covid-19 might be responsible for individual and ethnic variations in disease coursebenefits of lockdown there could be some positive effects of the social restrictionspatients have more time for self-care and could pay more attention to diet and exercise if motivatedsome people have stopped or reduced alcohol and smoking because of non-availabilitythere has been significant fall in air pollution as a result of reduced industrial and vehicular emissions 46 increase in blood glucose has been reported with short-term rise in pm10 particulate matter 10 microns in diameter and glycaemic improvement could occur with the fall in pollution 47in view of the issues highlighted above it is important to recognise the importance of diabetes as a vital comorbidity in patients with covid-19 there are several contentious issues and the ongoing research will hopefully shed more light on the behaviour of covid-19 in patients with diabetessupplemental oxygen which is frequently used in the treatment of pulmonary insufficiency in premature infants has been implicated in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia bpd bpd remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality during the first year of life and some of these infants have significant respiratory problems throughout childhood including increased airway reactivity and the development of restrictive airway disease 1 hyperoxia induces lung injury and may contribute to bpd a comprehensive review of the literature reveals a strong association between exposure to hyperoxia and subsequent expression of comorbidities hyperoxia can directly cause lung injury by generation of reactive oxygen radicals prolonged exposure of neonatal mice to hyperoxia results in impaired alveolarization and capillary development and in increased lung fibrosis that is similar to human bpd 2among the mechanisms believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis ace-2 is of great importance since the reninangiotensin system ras is expressed by and is functional in human lung myofibroblasts the cells believed to be most important in synthesizing the collagens that accumulate in fibrotic lungs 3 in studies of tissue fibrogenesis the tissue ras is believed to play a key role in initiation and progression of fibrous tissue accumulation in a variety of organs both ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists have been shown to prevent fibrogenesis of the heart 4 liver 5 kidney 6 and lungs 78 ang ii produced by ace is the main effector molecule in the ras ang ii is a potential pulmonary profibrotic mediator which activates ang ii type i receptor and stimulates collagen synthesis studies done in vivo showed that the angiotensin system was upregulated in oxygen-exposed fetal lung fibroblasts 9 the main function of ace-2 is to convert the octapeptide angiotensin ii to a heptapeptide ang 17 this limits the accumulation of ang ii and protects against experimental lung fibrosisimai et al 10 demonstrated in three different models of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards which all used ace 2 knock-out mice that these mice showed very severe disease compared with wild-type mice previous work from this laboratory demonstrated that ace-2 protects against fibrosis but is downregulated in both human and experimental lung fibrosis models 11 and that inhibition of ace-2 is associated with increased lung tissue injuryfibrosis earlier uhal et al 3 demonstrated the existence of an angiotensintgf-1 autocrine loop in human lung myofibroblasts more important in the context of the neonatal lung jiang et al 12 showed the activation of the angiotensin system in hyperoxia-induced lung fibrosis in neonatal rats chou et al 13 showed that blocking ang ii activity through the at1r angiotensin type i receptor blocker losartan prevented lung fibrosis in response to hyperoxia the role of ace-2 in these models however has not yet been evaluatedthe function of ace-2 as the cellular receptor for sars-coronavirus was demonstrated by li et al 14 haga et al 15 demonstrated the role of tnf--converting enzyme tace which can cleave the ectodomain of ace-2 in viral entry into the lungs these authors also showed that tace-dependent shedding of ace-2 ectodomain is completely dependent on the binding of sars-s protein to ace-2 and that tace was required for viral entry 16 further the shedding was blocked by tace antagonists tapi-0 and tapi-2 15 tace also known as adam17 originally identified as a metalloprotease required for processing the membrane form of tnf- and its release as a soluble factor 17 is now known to be involved in the cleavage and release of the ace-2 ectodomain in several tissues 18given the known involvement of other ras components in lung fibroblast function 3 and the profibrotic action of hyperoxic gas we hypothesized that ace-2 might be expressed by fetal lung fibroblasts and further might be downregulated by hyperoxia we further theorized that the downregulation of ace-2 by hyperoxia might be prevented by inhibiting its shedding by an inhibitor of tace the enzyme that causes shedding we report here the findings that ace-2 protein and enzyme activity are severely decreased by hyperoxia in human fetal lung fibroblast cultures we also report that tapi-2 prevents this decreasetable 1 shows the number of cells with disrupted plasma membrane integrity as measured by trypan blue and expressed as a percentage of total cells cell cultures exposed to hyperoxia showed a modest less than 1 but statistically significant increase in dead cells compared to cells exposed to room air if the exposure was followed by a 24-h period of recovery p  001 figure 1 shows western blotting for caspase 9 as a marker of apoptosis which when normalized to -actin showed no significant changes by densitometry together these data suggest a very slight decrease in the viability of hyperoxia-treated cells following a recovery period but only in a very minor fraction 1 of the cellsfigure 2 shows the effect of hyperoxia on ace-2 immunoreactive protein on western blotting both ace-2 immunoreactivity and enzyme activity were significantly decreased in cells treated with hyperoxia when compared with cells treated with normoxia this reduction 746 p  001 by densitometry only occurred when cells were allowed to recover by incubating in normoxic serum free media for 24 hin figure 3 the enzymatic activity measured by the ace-2 synthetic substrate was completely inhibited by the synthetic peptide dx600 p  001 a competitive inhibitor of ace-2 11 figure 3b showed no significant reduction of ace-2 mrna by hyperoxia suggesting that reduction of ace-2 is not occurring at the rna level but at the protein levelfigure 4 shows that the addition of tapi-2 during exposure to hyperoxia prevented the reduction of immunoreactive ace-2 that otherwise would occur in hyperoxia-treated cells p  005next ace-2 immunoreactivity was analyzed in the culture media collected from hyperoxia-exposed cells figure 5 shows that treatment of fetal lung fibroblasts with hyperoxia increased the release of soluble ace-2 into the culture supernatant p  001 and that tapi-2 prevented the increase p  001figure 6 shows that the treatment of hyperoxia followed by normoxic recovery significantly increased adam17tace immunoreactive protein by threefold in the imr90 cells p  005 the hyperoxic gas alone without recovery did not increase adam17tace data not shown as expected the inclusion of the tace inhibitor tapi-2 an active site blocker had no ability to reduce the increase in tace protein induced by hyperoxia with normoxic recovery data not shown figure 6 panel c shows that hyperoxia with normoxic recovery also caused a significant increase in adam17tace mrna 22-fold p  005figure 7 depicts a working hypothesis for the functional role of ace-2 in hyperoxia-induced lung fibrogenesis see figure legend for detailsmethods of preventing andor reducing the effect of oxygen injury remain elusive identification of molecular mechanisms of oxygen injury and endogenous protective factors might provide much needed targets for future design of interventions lang et al 9 recently showed that angiotensin ii angii mediates the profibrotic effect of hyperoxia on cultured human lung fibroblasts but these authors did not study the potential contributions of ace-2 which degrades angii to the angiotensin-induced increase in collagen production stimulated by hyperoxia moreover previous work showed that ace-2 which protects against lung fibrosis in animal models by degrading angii is downregulated in the lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis through mechanisms yet to be fully identified 11together these issues led to our hypotheses that i hyperoxia might downregulate ace-2 and ii modulation of ace-2 might be useful in the management and prevention of hyperoxia-induced lung injury for example maintaining high levels of tissue ace-2 by prevention of its shedding andor replacement of the protein through administration of biologically active enzyme may hold potential as therapeutic strategies for treating hyperoxic lung injury in support of this theory a pharmaceutical preparation of recombinant human ace-2 rhace-2 is currently in clinical trials for acute lung injury glaxosmithkline pipeline drug gsk2586881 ace-2 a carboxypeptidase which degrades angiotensin ii was shown to be protective but downregulated in human interstitial pulmonary fibrosis and in experimentally-induced lung fibrosis by li et al 11 a clear role for ace-2 in modulating acute lung injury was shown by the demonstrations of imai et al 10 who showed that the absence of ace-2 in ace-2 knockout mice exacerbates experimental acute lung injury to date the potential role of ace-2 in hyperoxic lung injury has not been exploredin recent years clinicians are seeing less of the classical old bpd which is characterized by pulmonary fibrosis alternating with cystic emphysema on chest x-ray with evidence of collagen deposition and fibrosis 19 more recently the milder form termed new bpd has been described characterized by abnormalities in alveolar septation pulmonary edema and less overt fibrosis 1920 in adult animal models of acute lung injury 1021 ace-2 was shown to inhibit lung edema formation and inflammation as well as fibrogenesis thus although little is known about the role of ace-2 in alveolar septation ace-2 might be expected to protect against the new bpd as well as the more fibrotic old form regardless a small percentage of children with bpd today present with classic findings of the old bpd and it may be that a continuum exists between the milder forms and the more severe presentations therefore the study of ace-2 and other components of the ras in hyperoxic lung injury and the possibility of ameliorating the most severe and possibly the milder forms of bpd associated with hyperoxic injury remains criticalace-2 has also been shown to be involved in virus-induced lung disease ace-2 is the cellular receptor the sars-coronavirus is required for coronaviral entry and inhibition of its shedding by the tace inhibitor is related to the severity of the sars-cov infection 141516 liu et al 22 showed that ace2 protein levels were significantly downregulated after infection with h1n1 viruses but was dispensable for viral replication they also found that ace-2 cleavage could be regulated by influenza neuraminidase zou et al 23 showed that in experimental mouse models infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza a h5n1 virus results in downregulation of ace-2 expression in the lung and increased serum ang ii levels genetic inactivation of ace-2 causes severe lung injury in h5n1-challenged mice confirming a protective role of ace-2 in h5n1-induced lung pathologies the same authors also demonstrated that the administration of recombinant human ace-2 ameliorates avian influenza h5n1 virus-induced lung injury in mice thus the potential influence of ace-2 downregulation by hyperoxic gas on viral infection will be an interesting topic for future investigationgrowing evidence in the study of the roles of ace-2 in normal pulmonary physiology or pulmonary pathophysiology has demonstrated that alveolar epithelial cells are the primary site of ace-2 expression in mice 24 but relatively less attention has been directed toward understanding the role of fibroblasts in the ace-2 mediated pulmonary physiology or pulmonary pathophysiology to our knowledge the present study is the first to demonstrate that ace-2 is expressed by human lung fibroblasts and is downregulated by hyperoxia it is also the first to document that this downregulation could be prevented by tace antagonist in hyperoxia-treated cells given the known function of ace-2 in preventing lung collagen deposition in experimental lung fibrosis 11 its expression by the fibroblastic cells most responsible for collagen synthesis is not surprising indeed other authors have shown that lung collagen accumulation in neonatal rats exposed to hyperoxic gas could be prevented by blockers of angiotensin receptor at1 25the well-studied pulmonary toxicity of hyperoxic gas is known to involve apoptotic cell death of alveolar epithelial cells 26 but exposure of the cell line imr90 to a high oxygen concentration that is often administered to premature neonates 95 o2 did not increase a marker of apoptotic cell death in these fetal human lung fibroblasts caspase 9 figure 1 although the 95 oxygen did cause a very minor increase in necrotic cells 1 see table 1 it seems unlikely that this small but statistically significant effect would have physiologic significance the hyperoxic gas did however cause a significant decrease in ace-2 figure 2 whether or not subphysiologic oxygen concentrations reduce ace-2 will be an interesting topic for further research in the light of all published evidence the downregulation of ace-2 would be expected to lead to accumulation of ang ii and its downstream profibrotic pathways see figure 7 indeed hyperoxic gas was previously shown to increase angii-mediated collagen synthesis by human lung fibroblasts 9 and either inhibition or gene knockdown of ace-2 increased autocrine angii generation by human lung cells in culture 11 furthermore the heptapeptide ang1-7 the product of ace-2 was shown to be antifibrotic in lung tissue 2127 and inhibition of ace-2 reduces its production see figure 7 accordingly the reduction of cellular ace-2 induced by hyperoxia would be expected to promote fibrogenesis through both increasing angii and simultaneously decreasing ang1-7the mechanism by which hyperoxia decreases ace-2 appears to be at the protein level as no significant change in the mrna occurred and the decrease was prevented by tapi-2 an inhibitor of the adam17tace enzyme that cleaves the ace-2 ectodomain in response to sars coronavirus 16 as was demonstrated by haga et al 15 the present study also showed that the effect of hyperoxia on ace-2 appears to involve the upregulation of adam17tace mrna and protein see figure 6 which in turn mediates enzymatic shedding of the ace-2 ectodomain and its release into the extracellular space determination of the signaling mechanisms by which hyperoxia upregulates adam17tace will be an interesting and compelling topic for future investigationsit is notable that the decrease in ace-2 occurred only if the period of hyperoxic exposure was followed by normoxic recovery for 24 h figures 2 3 4 5 and 6 this sequence of redox poise variation is reminiscent of ischemiareperfusion injury in which many key signaling pathways are induced not during the ischemic period but during the return to normoxia 28 although unknown at present the mechanisms induced by hyperoxicnormoxic cycling may be speculated to involve mitochondrial or other redox sensing mechanisms known to be influenced by reactive oxygen or nitrogen species 29 the elucidation of these pathways will also be a very interesting topic for future inquiryin summary this study showed that ace-2 is expressed not only by lung epithelial cells 24 but also by fetal human lung fibroblasts ace-2 protein and enzyme activity but not mrna were decreased by hyperoxia in cultured fetal lung fibroblasts but ace-2 protein was increased in the cell culture supernatants inhibition of these effects by tapi-2 suggests a mechanism mediated by adam-17tace-induced shedding of ace-2 from the cell surface since it is known that lung injury and fibrosis can be abrogated by ace-2 the demonstration of a direct effect of hyperoxia on ace-2 in human lung cells has significant implications for the pathogenesis of hyperoxic lung injury fibrogenesis and viral infection of the lungsthe peptide dx600 a competitive inhibitor of ace-2 was

cioto the editorthe journal of allergy and clinical immunology in practice published a contingency planning article by shaker et al1 to guide the allergistsimmunologists through the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic they provided suggestions for a logical approach to quickly adjust our services to mitigate risk to both medical staff and patients during the pandemic while social distancing is being encouraged in this context there is an ongoing worldwide debate regarding the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inhibitors and ibuprofen in patients with covid-19 the concern is that these drugs could worsen the prognosis of patients with the infection2
the 2 coronaviruses of the severe acute respiratory syndrome china 20022003 and of the middle east respiratory syndrome middle eastern countries 2012 use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 respectively as their receptors to infect human cells3 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the coronavirus involved in covid-19 also depends on ace2 for cell entry4
drugs that inhibit ace paradoxically upregulate ace2 expression on the cell surface and could theoretically facilitate coronavirus infection and progression5 there is no definitive evidence that this effect is clinically relevant but some retrospective observational studies suggest an association between the use of these drugs and a worse outcome of covid-196 a cause-effect association cannot be confirmed and ace inhibitors could be confounding factors that indicate comorbidities such as cardiopathy hypertension and diabetes besides advancing age which are well-recognized risk factors for worse outcome of covid-19 myocardial injury indicated by increased serum levels of troponin t and cardiovascular disease had a significant association with fatal outcomes of covid-196 moreover withdrawal of ace inhibitors could aggravate an underlying disease and make patients more unstable to overcome a coronavirus infectioncoincidentally or not the receptors of coronavirus ace2 and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 are enzymes that break down bradykinin in addition to their main functions after sars-cov-2 binding to ace2 the viral complex undergo endocytosis and surface ace2 is downregulated figure 1
 ace also degrades bradykinin and drugs that inhibit this enzyme lead to an increase in tissue bradykinin and may even trigger cough and angioedema in hypersensitive individuals we speculate whether the excess of bradykinin in patients taking ace inhibitors could complicate coronavirus infection because of its effects of vasodilation increase in vascular permeability and cough reflex exacerbation7 however no study has been done investigating this hypothesis and current data do not justify the discontinuation of ace inhibitors in patients at risk or with covid-19some experts opinions and unpublished french cases suggested an association between the use of ibuprofen and a worse outcome of covid-198 but there are no studies supporting this hypothesis a recent publication stated that ibuprofen also increases ace2 expression but the authors did not provide the reference that supports this statement2 ibuprofen use could be a marker of disease severity and not necessarily the cause of a worse prognosis patients more toxemic and symptomatic having fever asthenia and myalgia are more prone to use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs nsaids if ibuprofen is indeed associated with worse covid-19 outcomes whether or not a possible association would relate to the specific agent ibuprofen or the larger group of nsaids would require further investigation the european medicines agency concluded that there is currently no scientific evidence establishing a link between ibuprofen or nsaids and worsening of covid-198
knowledge of sars-cov-2 infection increases daily and further studies are needed to better understand the influence if any of ace inhibitors and nsaids in covid-19 severity at present there is no evidence to generate even a weak recommendation to discontinue these medications during the pandemic patients care must be personalized and ace inhibitors andor nsaids may be used if indicated after weighing the benefits and risksangiotensin-converting enzyme ace has its homologue ace2 discovered in 2000 as a ace related caroxypeptidase not inhibited by captopril 12 ace2 was firstly shown to be expressed in the kidneys of both the normotensive and the spontaneously hypertensive rat strains 3 subsequent studies demonstrated down-regulation of renal ace2 in three different models of hypertension 4 moreover circulating and cardiac levels of angiotensin ii at-ii were shown to increase in the ace2-null mice ace2 is the principal pathway for ang- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 formation from at-ii ang-1-8 protecting against excessive activation of at1 receptor in the heart tissues however newer findings suggested that ace2 can be an important element in the reninangiotensin aldosterone system 5 following these studies ace and ace2 focused the attention of researchers for their contribution in diverse human disorders recently the new coronavirus 2019-ncov or sars-cov-2 outbreak which has affected people all over the world has further highlighted the role of ace2 this virus has about 80 sequence identity with the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-related coronaviruses sars-covs and 96 sequence identity to a bat coronavirus most remarkably sars-cov-2 was shown to utilize the similar cell entry receptor ace2 as sars-cov 67 a recent study has shown that the ace2-binding pocket for sars-cov-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain rbd is almost identical to this one of sars-cov rbd structural protein modeling led to identification of amino acid residues in sars-cov-2 rbd that critical in ace2 binding notably most of these residues are either highly conserved or have comparable side chain chemical properties with the sars-cov rbd this similarity of the structure and amino acid sequence stimulated intensive debate on the convergent evolution of these viruses rbds under a pressure of enhanced binding to ace2 8 ace2 has been shown to be expressed as a membrane bound protein in several human tissues such as lung intestine heart and kidney the surface expression of this protein on was demonstrated on ciliated bronchial cells and on the lung alveolar epithelial cells but also in endothelial cells which was stated a noticeable discovery 9 moreover a recent in silico analysis of rna-seq profiles verified expression of ace2 in the mucosa of oral cavity 10

shows the molecular mechanisms initiated after sars-covs entry into the cells and the significance of ace and ace2 in these processesin the current review we discuss the expression pattern and function of the both ace proteins in relation with the underlying disorders administration of certain medications and the existence of common genomic variants within ace genes to explain the differences in the response of affected individuals to sars-cov-2in agreement with the role of ace2 on virus uptake by cells up-regulation of human ace2 has increased disease severity in mice infected with sars-cov 15 moreover injecting sars-cov spike into mice has led to down-regulation of ace2 thus aggravating the lung injury 1617 consequently ace2 functions as the cellular receptor for sars-cov entrance but also confers a protective mechanism against lung injury 18 based on these investigations level of expression of ace2 is an important factor in the sars-cov infection thus comorbid conditions that influence expression of this protein might affect severity of disease table 1

ali-induced apoptosis of pulmonary endothelial cells pecsin the current study we reviewed the available literature about the expression pattern of ace peptidases and the influence of various disorders and medications on the levels of these proteins expression level of ace2 has importance in severity of infection with sars-cov-2 and the extent of lung injury 18 most recently human recombinant soluble ace2 hrsace2 has been shown to inhibit growth of sars-cov-2 and interrupt early stages of infections with this virus 91based on the abundance of genetic modifying factors in determination of ace2 levels it is advisable to create a risk predictive panel to determine propensity for severe infection of individual whole genome sequencing of the patients samples is the best method for identification of genetic variants that determine severity of the disorder if a few genes were recognized that have a significant impact on the variability of covid-19 course a genetic test for coronavirus susceptibility could be simple to make cheap and accurate however much more genes could be involved in this process perhaps a complex regulatory pattern of genetic expression which is involved in the physiology of the lung and upper respiratory tract shape in addition to ace2 might contribute in this disorderassessment of association between ace proteins expression and human disorders has implications in health consequences after recovery from the primary sars-cov-2 infection this would be a next important issue after extinguishing of the pandemiahypertension is reported to be the most common comorbidity in sars-cov-2 infection 92 and the ace protein is a target for ace-inhibitors which are used in the treatment of hypertension to ultimately decrease the amount of ang ii some polymorphisms in ace gene are reported to influence the efficacy of these inhibitors among them is the homozygous ace haplotypes which lead to faster response to ramipril 61 the expression and function of the ace itself are affected by its polymorphisms which are associated with susceptibility to different diseases such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus 93 notably polymorphisms in both ace and ace2 are important in the regulation of the ace2 expression 9495on the other hand a meta-analysis has reported association between the administration of ace inhibitors and reduction in risk of pneumonia notably ace inhibitors may be more efficient in reducing the risk of pneumonia in asian patients also treatment with ace inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in risk of pneumonia-related mortality compared with controls 96 this may be also related to the dual effect of ace2 in viral infection and protection against acute respiratory distress syndromealthough the aceace2 regulation is complicated it seems that in the absence of ace the accumulation of angiotensin i may lead to the upregulation of ace2 whether this could facilitate the viral infection is plausible because ace2 is considered as a specific target for coronavirus treatment 95 it means that the population-based differences in the ace2 expression may affect the efficacy of a future antiviral treatmentin brief we summarize that coronaviruses such as sars-cov and sars-cov-2 utilize ace2 receptor for cell entry and infection we know that the most severe consequence of the sars-cov-2 is pneumonia which developes mostly in eldery males and subjects with comorbidities like diabetes kidney disease hypertension 97 besides ace2 has a protective role against acute respiratory distress syndrome thus it can be concluded that decreased ace2 level contributes to severe consequences of sars-cov-2 infection while ace2 is essential for the virus-cell fusion one explanation for this controversy is a viral-induced transitional overexpression of ace2 at the first stage of the infection 98 however a recent in silico analysis of sex bias severity of sars-cov-2 infection did not support the association between ace2 genetic variants and disease severitysex bias in the italian population yet tmprss2 levels and genetic variants were suggested as potential candidate modulators of the disease course 99accordingly among the top 38 eqtls in ace2 the strongest expression positive eqtl is more prevalent in east asian females 100 we also suggest epigenetic regulation by the potential mirnas targeting on ace2 transcripts the results of the targetscan database wwwtargetscanorg list mir-200c-3p and mir-429 among the most prominent mirnas that target ace2 up-regulation of mir-200c-3p is induced by a viral infection which leads to the downregulation of ace2 13 also mir-421 is proved to downregulate ace2 translation 14 interestingly we have analyzed the well-studied id in ace in iranian patients with multiple sclerosis and reported association between this polymorphism and response to interferon- treatment 71 thus ace ace2 polymorphisms not only can predispose individuals to diverse diseases but also they can modulate response of patients to therapeutic options both activities have implications on the susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection and the disease course another research era might be the identification of the difference between aceace2 expression levels and their regulating factors such as the mentioned eqtl and mirnas between patients with severe and mild symptoms in different ethnic groups to find the possible effect of ethnicity gender and the period of the disease on the aceace2 expressionin addition to the routine models for investigation of the pathological events during infections tissue engineering methods particularly advanced biomaterials or functionalized scaffolds 101 would provide study models to investigate the potential of such approaches in the treatment of the disorder as an advance in the field of functional studies the obtained results from safe in-vitro models which work without any additive can be applied in human models 102taken together the data presented above show the diversity of factors that modulate ace ace2 expression both in physiological conditions and in the course of sars-cov-2 infection different levels of expression and function of the ace proteins underlying disorders such as diabetes and hypertension administration of certain medications especially ace inhibitors and calcitriol and the existence of certain genomic variants within ace genes that modulate function or expression of the encoded proteins are possible explanations for the observed difference in the response of individuals to the sars-cov-2 infection exploration of the role of these factors can lead to design of appropriate therapeutic modalities based on the personalized risks such personalized approach is expected to be more effective exploitation of the next generation sequencing methods at both genomic and transcriptomic levels would be a practical strategy in this regardin conclusion the observed differences in the course of sars-cov-2 infection can be attributed to several genetic factors comorbidities and administration of medical regimens that modulate expression of ace proteinssince the beginning of the twenty-first century epidemic outbreaks of deadly pneumonia have been caused by three coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus sars-cov middle-east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and sars-cov-2 in december 2019 an outbreak of the third epidemic caused by sars-cov-2 started in wuhan hubei china 1 and the disease named coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by the world health organization who has become a worldwide pandemic and has posed global threats to health and economic stability hypertension diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease as comorbidities increase susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection particularly in elderly individuals 14 these comorbidities have been suggested to be risks for the development of severe outcomes in covid-19 36 among the comorbidities the prevalence of hypertension in patients with covid-19 was reported to be relatively high 26 most of the covid-19 patients with hypertension had probably been treated with antihypertensive drugs including commonly used renin-angiotensin system ras inhibitors however the causal relationship between the treatment of hypertension and mortality in covid-19 is unclearthe ras plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure electrolyte balance and fluid homeostasis 7 angiotensin-converting enzyme ace cleaves angiotensin i ang i to angiotensin ii ang ii and ang ii signals through angiotensin ii type 1 receptor at1r and angiotensin ii type 2 receptor at2r 7 fig 1 ang ii signaling through at1r mediates the effects of vasoconstriction inflammation and fibrosis whereas at2r activation has opposing effects through vasodilation the antiinflammatory response and antifibrosis effects 7 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 a homolog of ace has distinct enzyme active sites and is a key counterregulatory enzyme that degrades ang ii to ang-17 thereby attenuating its effects on vasoconstriction sodium retention inflammation and fibrosis through the mas receptor 7 ace2 also cleaves angiotensin i to angiotensin-19 7 the effects of ace2 are not suppressed by ace inhibitors aceis 7 under normal physiological conditions activities of the aceang iiat1r axis aceang iiat2r axis and ace2ang-17mas receptor axis are in a dynamic equilibrium state maintaining the normal function of the corresponding system 7 aceis and at1r blockers arbs not only inhibit the aceang iiat1r pathway but also modulate the aceang iiat2r pathway and ace2ang-17mas receptor pathway 7previous studies have revealed a cell-specific expression pattern of ace2 in multiple organs and ace2 is broadly expressed in the heart kidneys and intestine as well as in alveolar epithelial cells of the lungs which are the principal target of and the main site of injury caused by sars-cov-2 8 under normal conditions ace2 expression in the lungs is lower than that in other organs including the heart kidneys and intestine 8 the degree of expression and the biological relevance of ace2 may vary depending on the tissue and clinical state the functional role of ace2 in the lungs appears to be relatively minimal under normal conditions 9 but ace2 may be upregulated in certain clinical states probably for organ protection it has been shown in experimental models that ace2 is upregulated by relatively high doses of aceis and arbs in the heart kidneys and arteries leading to organ protection 10 however the evidence was not always consistent among the diverse ras inhibitors or distinct organs 10 in the tanno-sobetsu study a japanese population-based cohort we previously showed that the urinary level of ace2 which is derived mainly from the kidneys was significantly higher in hypertensive patients who had been treated with olmesartan an arb for more than 1 year than in untreated control subjects and patients who had been treated with calcium channel blockers including amlodipine and long-acting nifedipine the acei enalapril or other arbs including losartan candesartan valsartan and telmisartan 11 this finding suggests that olmesartan uniquely increases renal expression and urinary excretion of ace2 potentially leading to additional renal protection via pleiotropic effects however data showing the effects of ras inhibitors including aceis and arbs on the expression of ace2 in the lungs are lacking in experimental animal models and in humanssimilar to the entry receptor of sars-cov in sars sars-cov-2 in covid-19 invades the host through ace2 as the host cellular receptor for the viral spike protein 12 fig 1 therefore the expression and distribution of ace2 are key determinants for coronavirus entry into cells two distinct mechanisms for sars-cov-2 infection have been reported endocytosis by ace2-binding sars-cov-2 entry 13 14 and transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2-mediated cleavage of sars-cov-2 accompanied by ace2 12 14 fig 1 given that ace2 is the receptor that allows coronavirus entry into cells pretreatment with ras inhibitors such as aceis and arbs might modulate sars-cov-2 infection and the development of lung injury and other organ damage caused by the virusit has been reported that sars-cov infection in sars reduces ace2 expression resulting in lung injury via an imbalance between the aceang iiat1r axis and the ace2ang-17mas receptor axis 15 in addition exposure to the sars-cov spike protein in a mouse model induced acute lung injury which was rescued by losartan an arb 15 indicating that activation of the aceang iiat1r pathway is involved in lung injury it has also been shown that dysregulation of ace2 mediates acute lung injury in mouse models of infection by other viruses such as influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus 16 furthermore continued viral infection and replication contribute to reduced membrane ace2 expression in cultured cells 16 after the initial engagement of the sars-cov-2 spike protein there is a subsequent downregulation of ace2 abundance on cell surfaces as seen in sars-cov 15 under such conditions ace2 which converts ang ii to ang-17 is unable to exert protective effects in organs it has been reported that ang ii levels were higher in patients with covid-19 n  12 than in healthy controls n  8 and that elevated plasma ang ii levels were correlated with the total viral load and degree of lung injury 17 data regarding the effects of ras inhibitors on lung-specific expression of ace2 are lacking however even if ras inhibitors modify the expression of ace2 in the lungs there is a possibility of facilitation of greater engagement and entry of the sars-cov-2 spike protein during sars-cov-2 infection conversely a possible increase in ace2 expression induced by ras inhibitors would protect against lung injury and other organ damage in covid-19 by inhibiting downregulation of ace2-induced activation of the aceang iiat1r pathway fig 1 clinical trials are currently underway to test the safety and efficacy of several arbs including losartan clinicaltrialsgov number nct04312009 nct04311177 and nct04335123 valsartan nct04335786 and telmisartan nct04355936 in patients with covid-19on the other hand ace2 a membrane-bound enzyme is distinctly shed from the membrane by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 adam17 and a soluble form of ace2 exists in body fluids 18 fig 1 in pathological states shedding of ace2 is increased resulting in elevated soluble ace2 levels in blood urine and other body fluids 19 it has been suggested that a soluble recombinant ace2 protein intercepts the virus from binding to membrane-anchored ace2 in the cell plasma membrane 20 restoration of ace2 through administration of recombinant ace2 was reported to reverse lung injury in mouse models of other viral infections 21 furthermore treatment with recombinant human ace2 safely reduced ang ii levels in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome 22 clinical trials to test whether administration of recombinant ace2 protein may be beneficial in restoring balance to the ras network and potentially preventing organ injury have also been arranged in patients with covid-19 nct04287686 and nct04335136 possible induction of ace2 in lungs by ras inhibitors would result in increased soluble ace2 and may have a beneficial effect of protection from membrane-anchored ace2-mediated infection with sars-cov-2 fig 1because of a lack of evidence there are still concerns about an increased risk of sars-cov-2 infection and worsening lung injury in covid-19 patients receiving ras inhibitors however withdrawal of ras inhibitors or switching from ras inhibitor therapy to another antihypertensive therapy may require careful follow-up to avoid unstable control of blood pressure clinical trials are currently underway to evaluate the effects of continuation nct04357535 switching nct04330300 and discontinuation nct04353596 and nct04329195 of aceis and arbs in covid-19 patients based on the currently available evidence multiple societies of the specialty announced that administration of ras inhibitors should be continued in stable hypertensive patients who are at risk for are being evaluated for or have covid-19 23 interestingly it has been reported that covid-19 patients with hypertension who were receiving a ras inhibitor an acei or an arb n  17 had a significantly lower peak viral load of sars-cov-2 in cells than did covid-19 patients who were not receiving a ras inhibitor n  25 24 in a retrospective multicenter study in hubei china the unadjusted mortality rate was significantly lower in covid-19 patients with hypertension taking an acei or arb n  188 37 than in those not taking an acei or arb n  940 98 25 furthermore a mixed-effect cox model after adjustment for age sex comorbidities and in-hospital medications showed that the risk for all-cause mortality was lower in a group of patients treated with an acei or arb than in a group of patients not treated with an acei or arb 25 on the other hand according to a report in the new york city area mortality rates for patients with hypertension who were not taking an acei or arb n  953 those who were taking an acei n  168 and those who were taking an arb n  245 were 267 327 and 306 respectively though the results were unadjusted for known confounders including age sex race ethnicity socioeconomic status and comorbidities 2 further detailed investigations using a large number of patients regarding ras inhibitors and covid-19 need to be addresseddear siras of todays reports the global number of confirmed cases of covid-19 has surpassed 150000 the number of known cases is increasing by several thousand every day on march 11 2020 who publicly characterized covid-19 as a pandemic the issue is of serious concern and deserves momentous attentioncoronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses most of them cause illness in animals but seven known types of coronaviruses cause illness in humans the coronavirus sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 is one of those viruses  it causes the illness currently known as coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19though we are still learning what exactly puts someone at greater risk of developing a severe illness with covid-19 early information indicates older patients and those with chronic medical conditions such as hypertension diabetes and cardio-cerebrovascular diseases may be at higher risk 1 2 3 infection caused by covid-19 is likely to disturb metabolic regulation diabetic patients with covid-19 may face an altered immune response on the background of an already compromised health status owing to the diabetes-related complications andor agingthe most important findings in patients with hyperglycemia and a viral infection were significant worsening of symptoms which implies greater morbidity in these patients when compared to those without diabetes 3 however the pathophysiology of this association remains uncertain it is not known whether hyperglycemia changes the virulence of the infection or if the virus modifies the glycemic metabolism what we know is that diabetic patients are more susceptible to infection and this can impact on glucose metabolism 4 dm is not just a disorder of glucose metabolism but a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by multiple changes in lipid carbohydrate and protein profiles 5 such inflammatory processes are due to hyperglycemia which leads to increased synthesis of glycosylation end products ages activates macrophages and other cells of the immune system increase oxidative stress and promote the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines besides stimulating the synthesis of adhesion molecules that facilitate inflammation in the tissues 5 the inflammatory process and its complications might provide a higher propensity to infections or a greater severity of these conditions another important issue is how this inflammatory and immune response occur in diabetic patients who acquire a viral infection as well as whether the virus itself interferes with insulin secretion or the glycemic controlat this stage the biological mechanism of the relationship between covid-19 and diabetes is not known but the association for the severity of cases and death is pronounced we need to develop a hypothesis to explain the causal path underlying the more severe clinical presentation of covid-19 infection and subsequent death in diabetic patients biochemical tests are also essential to clarify the molecular pathophysiology involvedthe association of covid-19 and dm is of substantial public health importance and deserves proper attention since a large and diverse population is being affected globally nowadays this comorbidity poses a relevant threat to human health and prospective well-designed studies to elucidate the biological mechanism and the best clinical management of this association are urgently neededhomephilipphiliphomenewcastleacuktranslational and clinical research institute newcastle university the medical school framlington place newcastle upon tyne ne20 9hu ukdear sirit was very useful to see the review published in the journal on diabetes and covid 19 infection 6 in it you highlight that people with diabetes have a death rate perhaps around four times that of the background population and i note that it has been suggested over 2040 of deaths in chinawuhan were in people with diabetes 78 clearly it is important to understand whythere will be some confounders here in the form of associations with other risk factors for dying with a covid-19 infection notably age and cardiovascular disease but these cannot explain all the excess we need to understand this better to mitigate the riskit is reported that most of the deaths are occurring in the context of pneumonitis 78 and in particularly onset of adult respiratory distress syndrome ards a condition in which excess fluid in the alveoli blocks gas exchange between air and bloodpeople with diabetes and many with cardiovascular disease cvd without diabetes have a very permeable vasculature identified since the 1980s as albumin lead through the kidneys micro- and macro-albuminuria but even prior to that as a late blush over the retina with intravenous fluorescence marker injection 9 this leaky vasculature is associated with vascular inflammation metabolic syndrome and steatohepatitis as well as cvd per seit would seem not too far a stretch in the absence of further research as yet to assume that prior enhancement of vascular permeability could account for the increased rate of ards and death in people with diabetes particularly type 2 diabetes and also some with cvdaside from further research i would suggest that those already with albuminuria a routine yearly test for people with diabetes those with higher liver enzyme markers alt and perhaps those with diabetes associated dyslipidaemia low hdl cholesterol should take particular steps to self-isolateit is unclear to me how fast vascular inflammation can be ameliorated by improved blood glucose control nearly all glucose-lowering medications reduce microalbuminuria in time but tight glucose control in infected persons with insulin would meanwhile seem sensible very poor glucose control is further known to interfere with leukocytelymphocyte function 10references6guptarghoshasinghakmisraaclinical considerations for patients with diabetes in times of covid-19diabetes metabol syndr clin res

guptariteshfortis cdoc hospital chirag enclave indiarenin angiotensin system blockade and covid-19 diseasedear editorwe recently published an article highlighting the special concerns while managing patients with diabetes in the times of covid-19 pandemic 11 there have been some concerns about the use of angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs which were not clarified in our publication 12 we are summarising the current evidence in this regard and will try to arrive at a reasonable conclusionin the absence of a vaccine and an antiviral drug for the covid-19 infection several therapeutic approaches are being studied one such approach is the use of inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system namely ace inhibitors and arbs on the other hand some concern has been raised about the fact that patients on these agents might be at an increased risk of infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars cov-2angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ace-2 is the receptor for sars cov-2 as well as other coronaviruses and is expressed in type 2 alveolar epithelial cells and endothelium the s-glycoprotein on the surface of coronavirus binds to ace2 this leads to a conformational change in the s-glycoprotein and allows proteolytic digestion by host cell proteases tmprss2 ultimately leading to internalization of the virion 13 viral s-glycoprotein tmprss2 and ace-2 inhibition are potential targets of therapy and possibly vaccine developmentas ace-2 is essential to coronavirus infection its blockade is thought to be beneficial in preventingtreating this infection a retrospective analysis found reduced rates of death and endotracheal intubation in patients with viral pneumonia who were continued on ace inhibitors 14 mice with coronavirus induced lung injury showed improvement when treated with losartan 15 as far as cvid-19 infection is concerned the data on ras activation or the effect of its blockade is limited at present hypokalaemia could be a marker of ras activation and high incidence of hypokalaemia has been reported in patients with covid-19 infection 16despite these small studies suggesting the benefit of drugs acting on ras there is some data albeit scarce from animal models and human studies that treatment with ace inhibitors and arb could cause up regulation of ace2 17 ibuprofen and thiazolidinediones have also been shown to do the same 1819 increased expression of ace2 could theoretically increase the risk of infection with sars cov-2 this could be a concern in people with diabetes who are at already elevated risk of infections because of many other factors however currently there is no evidence to support this hypothesis in view of lack of robust evidence for either benefit or harm it is reasonable for patients to continue using ace inhibitors and arb as recommended by european society of cardiology council on hypertension and european society of hypertension 2021

humanity is trying to understand coronavirus disease-19 covid-19 at the same time severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection overcomes frontiers and spreads out through the world four human infecting species of coronavirus hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 and hcqv-hku1 were already known as causative agent of cold and pneumonia this viral family was responsible for the sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov outbreaks the consequences from the species that emerged from wuhan china are far more catastrophicsars-cov-2 infection depends on viral polyprotein processing an event catalysed by the main proteinase mpro also known as 3clpro since mpro is unique in the virus and not found in the host cells this protein is a prominent target for the development of antivirals against coronavirus infections
1
 recently the solution of the sars-cov-2 mpro tridimensional structure allowed the investigation of potential inhibitors of viral replication mpro is composed of three domains i- chymotrypsin ii- picornavirus 3c protease-like and iii-globular cluster involved in protein dimerisation and crystallography structures indicate the region between domains i and ii for protein activity inhibition that region contains the catalytic cysteine 145the crystal structure of sars-cov-2 mpro was published by zhang et al
2
 we selected a list of existing antivirals drugs 64 compounds and protease inhibitors 80 compounds from the drugbank database
3
 as ligands the drugbank database was used for a larger screening evaluating 4190 compounds randomly selected the crystal protein structure pdb 6y2e was energy-minimised using mmtk package on chimera version 114
4

in silico molecular docking of ligand selection was performed using pyrx-virtual screening tool consisting of autodock
5
 and autodockvina
6

the pyrx-virtual screening tool was used for docking with the protocol i the sars-cov-2 mpro protein structure pdb 6y2e was checked for missing atoms bonds and contacts removal of water molecules and energy minimisation was done with following parameters force field amber ff14sb steepest descent steps 100 steepest descent step size 002  conjugate gradient steps 10 conjugate gradient step size 002  using molecular modelling toolkit mmtk package on chimera version 114

 this minimised structure was used as the receptor for docking analysis ii the minimised structure was saved as a pdb file and imported into pyrx software iii ligands are imported in pdb format as well autodock tools module was used to generate pdbqt input files iv autodock vina algorithm was used to perform docking with the selected ligands in autodock vina the grid box was set to cover the active site of mpro with the following dimensions in  centre x y z  -1646 -2670 158 dimensions x y z  2334 1909 1098 the docking simulation was then run at an exhaustiveness of eight the docking results were evaluated using the lowest binding affinity score kcalmol predicted by the build in scoring function of autodock vina modulethe results showed 1321 molecules with scores above 65 as mpro partners supplementary data table due to the urgency in providing therapeutics to patients we focus on the analysis of commercially approved drugs argatroban blood clotting linagliptin diabetes saquinavir antiviral edoxaban blood clotting apixaban blood clotting cilazapril ace inhibitor betrixaban blood clotting alogliptin dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors sitagliptin dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors ramipril ace inhibitor lopinavir antiviral saxagliptin diabetes indinavir antiviral zofenopril ace inhibitor nelfinavir antiviral quinapril ace inhibitor dihydroergotamine antimigraine agents risperidone atypical antipsychotics astemizole antihistamine presented the higher scores fig 1 the list includes antiviral components as expected and drugs classified as coagulation modifiers 4 and ace inhibitors 4

 propose a pathogenic mechanism for the disease based on clinical evidence and studies of other coronavirus strains they divide the clinical phase in the viraemia phase acute phase and the recovery the specific effects of covid-19 on the cardiovascular system remain unclear though there have been reports of acute cardiac injury arrhythmias hypotension tachycardia and a high proportion of concomitant cardiovascular disease in infected individuals particularly those who require more intensive care
8
 also there are signs of coagulopathy in many patients usually associated with death
9
 among coagulation modifiers argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor
10
 for prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia the three other compounds edoxaban apixaban betrixaban bind to factor xa
11
 edoxaban is used to prevent stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation
12
 apixaban is indicated for the control of recurrence of thromboembolic events such as stroke in patients with non-valve atrial fibrillation betrixaban inhibits free and prothrombinase bound factor xa in a concentration-dependent manner
13



14
 betrixaban was more potent at inhibiting thrombin-antithrombin complex
15



superposing of sars-cov-2 mpro with factor xa and thrombin structures presents a rmsd value of 257 and 249 respectively these low values are an indication of fold similarity fig 2a-b thrombin the known target of argabotran is a serine protease
16
 as mpro is a protease itself with leu-glnseralagly as a recognition sequence
2
 this similarity may indicate a direct perturbation in pro-clotting coagulation by covid-19 through mpro protein in fact changes in pro-clotting factors in covid-19 patients were already detected showing significant decreased antithrombin at values and increased d-dimer fibrinfibrinogen degradation products fdp and fibrinogen fib
17
 additionally the gradual progression of disease severity was mirrored by increasing values of d-dimer and fdp this pattern might indicate the activation of a coagulation system due to thrombosis or disseminated intravascular coagulation dic
18
 heparin as an anticoagulant therapy was associated with a better prognosis in some patients
9
 also the risk of developing dic due to sars-cov-2 infection which has an obvious negative impact on the prognosis
19



20
 was previously speculated
21
 moreover excessive activation of fibrinolysis may be observed during cardiopulmonary bypass also leading to dic and haemorrhage
22

the feasibility and robustness of our interactions are strengthened by comparing the docking results of thrombin interaction with argatroban and the corresponding crystallographic structure deposited under the code 4hfp both structures present a rmsd of 049 indicating both docking and experimental structures are almost identical fig 2c in addition the comparison of docking results of factor xa interaction with apixaban and the corresponding crystallographic structure deposited under the code 2p16 present a rmsd of 011 which also corroborates with the assertiveness of our approach fig 2d finally it is important to highlight that the score of thrombin interaction with argatroban is 96 kcalmol against 83 kcalmol with sars-cov-2 mpro otherwise apixaban interaction with factor xa presents a score of 51 kcalmol against 70 kcalmol with sars-cov-2 supplementary data table all these are preliminary evidence that argatroban has more affinity to thrombin but apixaban tends to have more affinity to sars-cov-2 mprowe also performed fold similarity investigation for the ace inhibitors aceis with mpro the high rmsd values 603  and 557  for the ace receptors structures deposited under the codes 2x92 and 2ewb respectively indicate the low structural conservation among those proteins also the use of ace inhibitors contributes for the up-regulation of ace2 expression
23



24
 even as a potential target for the treatment of coronavirus infection some groups suggest that the use of these inhibitors could lead to higher viral loads because the ace2 augmented expression
25
 this could be a drawback for the use of aceis as covid19 treatmentin conclusion we show the potential applicability of some coagulation compounds for the first time to our knowledge to treat covid-19 infection we highlight the fold similarity among sars-cov-2 mpro and coagulation factors thrombin and factor xa the effects of this similarity should urgently be investigated by in vitro approachesresidents in lombardy 40 years of age or older who were beneficiaries of the regional health service formed the target population just over 6 million people approximately 17 of the entire italian population in that age group italian citizens have equal access to essential health care services provided by the national health service in lombardy that association has been paired with an automated system of databases that collect a variety of information including codes in the international classification of diseases 9th revision clinical modification for inpatient diagnoses and services supplied from public or private hospitals as well as anatomical therapeutic chemical codes of outpatient dispensation of drugs reimbursed to the pharmacies after filing doctors prescriptions these various types of data can be interconnected since a single individual identification code is used by all databases for each citizen enrolled to preserve privacy each identification code was automatically deidentified the inverse process being allowed only to the regional health authority on request from judicial authoritiesall the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the study to the protocol available with the full text of this article at nejmorg deidentified data were extracted and processed from the regional repository using statistical programs developed by the authors according to a protocol previously discussed with and approved by the regional health authority further details of the databases of health care use in lombardy have been reported in previous studies24-26since february 21 2020 patients with a diagnosis of covid-19 have been revealed to the regional health authority from several sources public and private hospitals persons seen in the first aid service for an acute respiratory infection and infected inpatients including those who received assisted ventilation general practitioners symptomatic outpatients receiving only home care municipal registries deaths due to covid-19 and laboratories accredited by the regional health authority diagnosis was based on the protocol released by the world health organization27  that is positive nasopharyngeal swab specimens tested with at least two real-time reverse-transcriptasepolymerase-chain-reaction assays targeting different genes e rdrp and m of sars-cov-2 up to february 25 diagnostic tests were carried out in all patients with suspected cases whereas only symptomatic patients were tested from february 26 onwardthe date of covid-19 diagnosis was considered as the index date and patient data were extracted from the registry until march 11 2020 we excluded patients who were not beneficiaries of the regional health service 361 patients who became beneficiaries of the regional health service after january 1 2019 8 patients or who were younger than 40 years of age at the index date 619 patients the remaining 6292 patients were included in the study as case patients among them the 617 patients who received assisted ventilation or died were classified as having a critical or fatal infection the remaining patients were regarded as having relatively mild-to-moderate clinical manifestations of the infection approximately half the patients with mild-to-moderate cases received home care and the remaining patients were hospitalized but did not received intensive carefor each case patient up to five controls were randomly selected from the target population to be matched for sex age at index date and municipality of residence before matching persons who became beneficiaries of the regional health service after january 1 2019 were excluded from the target population patients who had received a diagnosis of covid-19 had been eligible as potential controls until they became case patients and all matches had to be at risk for covid-19previous hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease cancer respiratory disease and kidney disease in case patients and controls were traced in the regional databases for a 5-year period before the index date in addition case patients and controls were categorized according to the chronic related score cresc a new index of patients clinical profiles derived from inpatient and outpatient services provided by the regional health service and validated for outcome prediction28 a detailed description of the cresc which scores the presence or absence of 31 diseases or conditions in each patient is provided in the supplementary appendix available at nejmorg cresc values range from 0 to 4 with higher values indicating a worse clinical statusmajor classes of antihypertensive agents ace inhibitors arbs calcium-channel blockers diuretics including subtypes and beta-blockers that were dispensed to case patients and controls during 2019 were traced from the databases of health care use in addition to ace inhibitors and arbs other drugs that were dispensed and are known to act through the raas were noted  renin inhibitors and sacubitrilvalsartan the latter used only in heart failure we also noted antihypertensive drugs dispensed as monotherapy and as combination therapies typically an raas blocker with another agent other drugs that were dispensed during 2019 included lipid-lowering agents mainly statins oral hypoglycemic agents noted together and as the more commonly dispensed individual classes insulin antiplatelet agents antiarrhythmic agents anticoagulant agents digitalis nitrates inhaled glucocorticoids nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs immunosuppressive agents ie glucocorticoids calcineurin inhibitors antiproliferative agents and monoclonal antibodies short-acting -agonists long-acting -agonists and other agents used for chronic respiratory diseases diagnostic therapeutic and procedural codes that were used for the current study are shown in table s1 in the supplementary appendixthe between-group relative difference in clinical features and drug exposures was used for comparing case patients and controls conditional logistic-regression models were fitted for estimating the odds ratio and corresponding 95 confidence interval for the risk of covid-19 associated with exposures of interest models separately included clinical features and drug exposures listed above unadjusted models as well as all aforementioned baseline covariates together adjusted model crude and adjusted estimates were obtained for the effect of antihypertensive therapy dispensed always as monotherapy or as a combination of two or more agents both compared with the absence of any antihypertensive drug therapy dispensed during 2019 to test the hypothesis that exposure may affect the severity of clinical manifestations of covid-19 analyses were restricted to the stratum of patients who had a critical or fatal infection stratifications for sex and age categories 60 years vs 60 years were performed as secondary analysesto verify the robustness of our findings we performed two further analyses first because records of exposure to antihypertensive drugs were not available after december 2019 data were analyzed according to three criteria  any prescriptions during 2019 at least three consecutive prescriptions during 2019 and at least one prescription in the last quarter of 2019 under the assumption that the two latter criteria might identify more reliably treatment that did not change second because the strategy that was used for testing for coronavirus changed during the data collection analyses were stratified according to the date of covid-19 diagnosis up to february 25 2020 vs february 26 2020 and afteramong the 6292 case patients a control of the same sex age and municipality of residence could not be found for 20 persons the remaining 6272 case patients 997 who were included in the analysis were matched to 30759 controls the 15 matching was fully successful for 6015 included case patients whereas fewer than 5 controls were available for the remaining 257 case patients 41 at the index date the mean sd age of case patients and controls was 6813 years and nearly 37 were women matching variablestable 1 shows that arbs and ace inhibitors were both more frequently prescribed in case patients than in controls the percentage of patients who received arbs was 222 among case patients and 192 among controls relative difference 133 the percentage of patients who received ace inhibitors was 239 and 214 respectively relative difference 105 other antihypertensive drugs were also used more in case patients than in controls the difference usually being larger than for ace inhibitors and arbs particularly for loop diuretics 139 vs 78 relative difference 436 and mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists 38 vs 24 relative difference 371 use of renin inhibitors 1 case patient and sacubitrilvalsartan 28 case patients was uncommon and no further analysis of these treatments was carried out case patients also used a combination of antihypertensive drugs more frequently than controls had a more frequent history of hospitalization for cardiovascular and noncardiovascular diseases and according to the cresc index had an overall substantially worse clinical profiletable 2 shows unadjusted estimates of the risk of covid-19 according to the drugs shown in table 1 which suggested a possible effect however after multivariable adjustment neither arbs nor ace inhibitors had a significant association with the risk of covid-19 this was also the case for calcium-channel blockers beta-blockers and diuretics an association with covid-19 after multivariable adjustment was maintained by loop diuretics and some other non-antihypertensive drugs insulin antiplatelet agents anticoagulants immunosuppressant drugs and drugs used for respiratory disease as compared with patients who did not use antihypertensive drugs during 2019 those to whom antihypertensive agents were dispensed as monotherapy or as a combination of two or more agents appeared to have a greater risk of covid-19 in the unadjusted crude analysis but after multivariable adjustment neither monotherapy nor combination therapy showed a significant association with the risk of covid-19 table 3 the multivariable adjusted risk of covid-19 was increased in patients with previous hospitalizations for cardiovascular or noncardiovascular diseases it also became progressively greater as the cresc increased table 2data on the risk of covid-19 infection associated with the use of raas blockers and other drugs were similar in men and in women table 4 and tables s2 and s3 there was no statistical evidence that the findings obtained for the entire cohort were modified by age or the severity of the clinical manifestations and course of covid-19 table 4 and tables s3 through s5 as shown in figure s1 the data on covid-19 and antihypertensive drugs were consistent regardless of whether drug use was assessed through loose or more strict criteria furthermore the findings did not change substantially when case patients were stratified according to the date of covid-19 diagnosis table s6in the present study the use of arbs and ace inhibitors was more frequent among patients who were infected with sars-cov-2 than among the large number of controls who were matched for age sex and place of residence however all other major antihypertensive drugs such as calcium-channel blockers beta-blockers and diuretics were also used more frequently in patients with covid-19 with differences from controls that were larger than those shown by arbs and ace inhibitors furthermore in a multivariable analysis in which data were adjusted for a number of treatment-related covariates and markers of patient clinical status the use of arbs or ace inhibitors was not significantly associated with the risk of covid-19 finally there was no statistical evidence of an independent association between the use of a combination of antihypertensive drugs in which an ace inhibitor or an arb is by far the most common component and the risk of covid-19 thus our results do not provide evidence of an independent relationship between raas blockers and the susceptibility to covid-19 in humanswe found that patients with covid-19 had a higher baseline prevalence of cardiovascular conditions and diseases hypertension coronary heart disease heart failure and chronic kidney disease for which treatment with the medications studied here is often used such observations confirm previous observations by chinese investigators that patients with covid-19 generally have poorer health than the general population11-15 a conclusion that in the present study is strongly supported by the evidence that patients with covid-19 were more frequently treated with drugs for many noncardiovascular diseases had a higher incidence of previous hospitalizations for a variety of causes and had higher scores for chronic coexisting conditions than controls62930the present study provides several additional findings first the conclusion that raas blockers do not modify susceptibility to covid-19 applies to both sexes as well as to younger and older persons second our data provide no evidence that rather than modifying the susceptibility to covid-19 raas blockers alter the evolution of the disease thereby mainly affecting its severity in our study neither ace inhibitors nor arbs showed an independent association with covid-19 in patients with mild-to-moderate disease or in those with severe disease third patients with covid-19 had much more frequent use of loop diuretics and mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists than controls and treatment with loop diuretics was associated with an increased risk of covid-19 in the multivariable analysis rather than suggesting an association for which there is no mechanistic support this finding is likely to mean that use of loop diuretics reflects the existence of clinical conditions such as heart failure or advanced renal damage the severity of which was not appropriately quantified by the available clinical data and scores these observations from our study may account for the independent relationship that was found between covid-19 and some noncardiovascular drugs although more direct investigations with appropriate experimental designs would be required to clarify this issueone strength of the study is the large number of case patients as well as the inclusion of a large and well-matched control group without which interpretation of the collected data would have been difficult it is also a strength that the lombardy database included previous hospitalizations and allowed the drugs prescribed to outpatients to be accurately observed because pharmacists must file outpatient prescriptions to claim reimbursement and incorrect reports carry legal consequenceslimitations of the study include the fact that information on drug use is limited to prescriptions and actual drug consumption by the case patients and controls could not be assessed drugs that were purchased by the patients because doctors prescribed them privately and no records were in the national health service system as well as those dispensed after december 31 2019 were not captured by our analysis however the availability of free antihypertensive agents makes out-of-pocket purchase of these drugs rare and an exploratory analysis involving patients in whom antihypertensive treatment had been taken regularly or closer to the time of infection did not modify the results our results reflect the doses of raas blockers used in italian medical practice but did not allow us to investigate other doses because this information was not included in the database it is likely that the control group included some persons with covid-19 since the general population in italy was not tested unmeasured confounders may have been responsible for our findings for example given the hypothesis that raas blockers increase the risk of severe clinical manifestations of covid-19 there may have been preferential dispensation of raas blockers to patients with better clinical profiles and a lower perceived likelihood of the development of severe covid-19 however there was no evidence that patients who received arbs or ace inhibitors had a better clinical profile than those who received other antihypertensive medications finally our results apply to a largely white population and cannot be generalized to other racesthe present study does not provide evidence that the use of ace inhibitors or arbs is independently associated with the risk of covid-19we thank mourad and levy for their constructive correspondence interaction between raas inhibitors and ace2 in the context of covid-19 nat rev cardiol 101038s41569-020-0368-x 20201 on our comment article covid-19 and the cardiovascular system nat rev cardiol 101038s41569-020-0360-5 20202 we agree with their comments and acknowledge that different reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas inhibitors have different effects on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 levels ferrario and colleagues3 reported that administration of either ace inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers arbs increased the levels of ace2 mrna in lewis rats compared with rats receiving placebo in particular cardiac levels of ace2 mrna increased by 47-fold or 28-fold in rats given either lisinopril an ace inhibitor or losartan an arb respectively furthermore the researchers found that losartan treatment but not lisinopril treatment increased ace2 activity compared with placebo however the researchers did not shed light on the mechanisms that might account for these differences nevertheless li and colleagues4 found that treatment with captopril an ace inhibitor can significantly increase ace2 protein expression in rats with acute lung injury furthermore wsten-van asperen and colleagues5 reported that in a rat model of acute respiratory distress syndrome ace activity and angiotensin ii expression are increased whereas ace2 activity and angiotensin-17 levels are reducedthe protective effects of the ace2angiotensin-17mas receptor axis are primarily mediated by reductions in angiotensin ii level6 both ace inhibitors and arbs can reduce angiotensin ii levels7 the former inhibit the substrate of angiotensin ii generation and the latter directly inhibit the conversion of angiotensin i to angiotensin ii therefore raas inhibitors including ace inhibitors and arbs can activate the ace2angiotensin-17mas receptor axis however as mentioned in our comment article2 whether patients with coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 and hypertension who are taking an ace inhibitor or arb should switch to another antihypertensive drug remains controversial in one study the use of ace inhibitors or arbs did not increase mortality in 112 patients with covid-19 and cardiovascular disease8 further evidence is required to clarify the effects of ace inhibitors and arbs in patients with covid-19 on 12 march 2020 the european society of hypertension published a statement on the topic of hypertension raas blockers and covid-19 concluding that the available data do not support the differential use of raas blockers ace inhibitors or arbs in patients with covid-19 ref9 however the authors cautioned that the statement reflected the current evidence at the time of release and might need updating according to new evidenceindeed ace2 might be equivalent to a natural arb or ace inhibitor10 decreasing the levels of ace2 will shift the balance of the raas to promote the aceangiotensin iiangiotensin ii receptor type 1 axis leading to lung injury and the progression of inflammatory storms increasing the levels of ace2 will transfer the balance towards the angiotensin-17mas receptor axis which has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that are cardiopulmonary protectivein their correspondence article mourad and levy also suggest that aliskiren treatment could be an interesting option in the context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection given that aliskiren can reduce the expression of ace2 although ace2 has been identified as the functional receptor for sars-cov-2 the role of ace2 in the progression of covid-19 after sars-cov-2 infection is still controversial so the benefits of aliskiren use in patients with covid-19 needs further investigationthe cell surface particularly of some cell types is endowed with proteolytic activity able to modulate the activity of membrane proteins or circulating regulatory peptides these proteases or peptidases mostly metalloenzymes using zinc as cofactor are structurally organised as ectoenzymes with their catalytic sites facing into the extracellular space examples include neutral endopeptidase neprilysin nep aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidases of various specificities and the subjects of this article the angiotensin-converting enzymes ace and ace2 these ectopeptidases mainly exist as single membrane-spanning proteins of type i c-terminus intracellular type ii n-terminus intracellular topology or glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-linked proteins undoubtedly the best studied of these ectopeptidases by far is ace largely because of its physiological and pathological roles for almost 50 years ace was a unique mammalian enzyme distinct from other growing peptidase families the discovery of a human homologue of ace aceh or ace2 has led to the resurgence of studies on ace biology coupled with detailed structural information on the enzyme itself the pace of knowledge concerning ace2 has been breathtaking in comparison to the relatively leisurely developments in understanding ace structure and function over several decades 1 in a period of 4 years ace2 has been cloned purified knocked-out knocked-in inhibitors have been developed its 3d structure determined and new functions have emerged ace2 is implicated in cardiovascular and renal biology diabetes and obesity and most remarkably ace2 may serve as a receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars viruscardiovascular diseases continue to be one of the leading causes of death in developed countries most commonly resulting from hypertension and congestive heart failure a major revolution in the treatment of hypertension came with the development of inhibitors of ace ace inhibitors eg captopril and lisinopril have proved to be highly effective and safe drugs which are used clinically to treat not only hypertension but also congestive heart failure and renal disorders inhibition of ace imposes its effects primarily via the ras the ras mediates numerous effects in the cardiovascular system including blood pressure homeostasis and maintenance of fluid and salt balance 2 ace is a crucial regulator of the ras converting the inactive decapeptide angiotensin i to the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin ii 3 whilst also metabolising the hypotensive peptide bradykinin 4in 2000 a novel mammalian homologue of ace originally termed aceh and subsequently ace2 was identified by two distinct molecular strategies 5 6 the ace2 gene maps to the human x chromosome and encodes an 805-amino-acid type i membrane-bound glycoprotein with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 120 kda the amino-terminal domain of ace2 shares around 40 sequence identity with the corresponding domain of somatic ace and contains a single hexxh zinc-binding motif 5 intriguingly the carboxy-terminal domain displays 48 sequence homology with collectrin an enzymically inactive glycoprotein of unknown function expressed exclusively in the kidney 7 ace2 initially appeared to be more limited in its tissue distribution than ace with significant levels only detected in the heart kidneys testes and gastrointestinal tract 5 8 a recent study however detected significant levels of ace2 expression in a wide variety of tissues 9on first inspection owing to the high degree of sequence similarity that exists between ace2 and ace it could be assumed that ace2 might function like ace as a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase indeed the only previously characterised ace-like proteins the drosophila ace orthologues ance and acer do display such an activity 10 surprisingly however ace2 functions as a carboxypeptidase cleaving only a single c-terminal residue from its peptide substrate table 1
 indeed ace2 is unable to cleave the archetypal ace substrates bradykinin and hip-his-leu and is insensitive to the potent ace inhibitors lisinopril and captopril 5 further characterisation using a panel of biologically active peptides has provided a consensus sequence of pro-x-pro-hydrophobicbasic for the protease specificity of ace2 11 this consensus sequence is supported by the ace2 active site model proposed by guy et al 11 it has also been ascertained that the chain length of hydrolysed peptides is not limiting although the cleavage of dipeptides is very slow the catalytic activity of ace2 like ace is ph- and anion-dependent 11 12 13the structures of tace 14 and the drosophila homologue ance 15 have recently been elucidated the minimum glycosylation requirement for expression and processing of enzymically active tace was investigated by progressive deglycosylation 16 a truncated soluble form of tace lacking the first 36 residues at the n-terminus expressed in cho cells in the presence of the glycosidase-i inhibitor n-butyldeoxynojirimycin retained the activity of the native enzyme and yielded crystals that diffracted to 20- resolution natesh et al 14 described the structure of tace alone and in complex with the inhibitor lisinopril and thereby provided a detailed picture of the active site the tace molecule has an overall ellipsoid shape with a central groove that extends approximately 30  into the protein dividing it into two subdomains with the active site located towards the bottom of this groove simultaneously the crystal structure of drosophila ance was determined 15 it is not clear from the information presented if a minimally glycosylated form of ance was expressed and purified for the crystallisation studies however a previous report by a separate group has shown that ance does not require glycosylation for secretion or activity 17 data from the ance crystals revealed that like ace a large internal channel encompasses the entire protein molecule and the active site is located at the bottleneck connecting two chambers of unequal size within this cavitymost recently the crystal structures of the extracellular domain lacking the transmembrane and cytosolic regions of native and inhibitor-bound ace2 have been determined to 22- and 30- resolution respectively 18 these data confirm the integrity of the active site model of ace2 proposed by guy et al 11 this model based on the crystal structure of tace indicated that the catalytic mechanism of ace2 resembles that of ace the predicted structural differences between the active site of ace dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase and ace2 carboxypeptidase responsible for the differences in specificity were also verified by the ace2 structure in essence the main differences occur in the ligand-binding pockets particularly at the s2 subsite of ace and in the binding of the peptide carboxy-terminus the cavity in tace is larger than that of ace2 allowing an extra amino acid to bind in the specificity pocket most importantly the r273 to q substitution between ace2 and ace appears to be largely responsible for the elimination of the s2 pocket in ace2 these structural differences offer an explanation as to why the classical ace inhibitor lisinopril is unable to bind to ace2the ace2 crystals grown in the presence of mln-4760 19 revealed an unanticipated inverse binding orientation of the inhibitor in the active site fig 1
 this can be rationalised by the y510 to v substitution between ace2 and ace whereby the size of the s1 pocket in ace2 is considerably reduced and can no longer accommodate the bulky dichlorobenzyl group moreover this explains why substrates like bradykinin angiotensin-19 and leu-enkephalin are poor substrates for ace2 but good substrates for ace another surprising observation is the absence of a bound chloride in ace2 in an identical position to the second binding site cl2 of tace 14 as an occupied cl2 site is largely responsible for the chloride activation of ace 20 ace2 is clearly different from ace and displays unique enzyme function despite the sequence similarity that exists between the two proteins and the common features of their activity profilesthe first class of selective inhibitors for ace2 includes a series of non-peptide compounds whose design was based upon the substrate specificity of ace2 and the requirement of a centrally located carboxylate to coordinate the inhibitor 19 the lead compound possesses sub-nanomolar affinity ic50 044 nm for ace2 and 220 000- and 22 000-fold less affinity for human tace and bovine carboxypeptidase-a cp-a respectively using an alternative strategy potent ace2 peptide inhibitors have been identified through screening of constrained peptide libraries 13 a stable peptide inhibitor of ace2 dx600 displays a k
i of 28 nm with angiotensin i as substrate dx600 is a 26-amino-acid n-terminal acetylated and c-terminal amidated peptide in addition the dipeptide prophe has been identified as an inhibitor of ace2 activity 11 this finding would allow for a peptide-based approach to inhibitor design by comparison of the inhibitory effect of prophe and proleu not a substrate for ace2 and a weaker inhibitor than prophe with other dipeptides these ace2 inhibitor compounds are fundamental tools for exploring ace2 biology and enzymologyin comparison with ace2 the way in which the very first inhibitors of ace were discovered was quite different teprotide is a nonapeptide that owes its potency and selectivity to natural selection being a component of the venom of a brazilian pit-viper captopril on the other hand owes its potency and selectivity to chemical design and this was guided not only by the hypothetical active site model but also by data on the substrate specificity of ace and comparison with cp-a for example the study carried out by cheung et al 21 was a major contributing factor in the design of second-generation inhibitors of ace here the active site binding and other properties of substrates and competitive inhibitors of ace were investigated using a series of simple tri- and dipeptides it was determined that the binding of a substrate or inhibitor to ace is wholly dependent upon the c-terminal residues and their subsite interactions in this vein the importance of an exhaustive study to determine structureactivity correlations for ace2 is critical for the systematic development of inhibitor compounds although ace inhibitors were designed in part on the basis of similarities between the enzymic properties of ace and those of cp-a no significant segmental homology was found with carboxypeptidases m14 family upon solution of the crystal structure of tace 14in contrast to the growing availability of data on the enzyme kinetics and possible physiological roles of ace2 comparatively little is known about ace2 at the cellular level in keeping with predictions made from its peptide sequence and its interactions as a viral receptor recombinant ace2 expressed in cho and hek293 cells is localised predominantly in the plasma membrane analysis of media taken from cells expressing ace2 has revealed the presence of a soluble form of ace2 most likely a product of a proteolytic cleavage event indeed proteolytic release of ace2 has been observed from cardiomyocytes in which ace2 is overexpressed 22 and a soluble form of ace2 has been detected in urine dw lambert gi rice nm hooper and aj turner unpublished data preliminary evidence indicates that the secretase responsible for the shedding of ace2 is distinct from that of ace dw lambert nm hooper and aj turner unpublished data in light of the ability of soluble ace2 to prevent sars cov infection 23 further study of ace2 secretion is of prime significanceanalysis of the ace2 sequence reveals the presence of seven potential n-glycosylation sequons 5 the recently resolved crystal structure of ace2 provided evidence that six of these sites n53 n90 n103 n322 n432 and n546 are glycosylated it is not clear from this data whether the most c-terminal site is also occupied 18 this study reported that soluble ace2 expressed in insect cells has a molecular weight of 90 kda compared to the predicted 835 kda a difference accounted for by the presence of the carbohydrate groups this molecular weight of 90 kda has also been reported for ace2 in rat and mouse tissue 22 24 it should be noted however that other studies have reported a molecular weight of 120130 kda in the same species 25 26 indeed ace2 overexpressed in mammalian cells has an apparent molecular weight of 120 kda which is reduced to approximately 85 kda following enzymic deglycosylation 5 whilst the difference between the reported molecular weights of ace2 in insect and mammalian cells can be assigned to species differences in posttranslational modification the reasons for the remaining discrepancies are unclear disruption of normal glycosylation of ace2 expressed in cho cells by treatment with the glycosidase inhibitor tunicamycin prevented correct cellular sorting of full-length ace2 and abolished secretion of a truncated mutant lacking the transmembrane and cytosolic domains dw lambert k pogson and aj turner unpublished observations the resulting unglycosylated protein was also catalytically inactive indicating a requirement for glycosylation for membrane targeting and activityin vivo ace2 expression is confined to endothelial cells and renal tubular epithelium it has also been identified in vascular smooth muscle cells and the leydig and sertoli cells of the testes 6 25 the very low expression level of ace2 in a wide variety of cell lines fj warner dw lambert nm hooper and aj turner unpublished data has impeded further studies of the intracellular processing of ace2 furthermore identification of a suitable in vitro model is vital in order to gain insight into events regulating the expression of ace2 and to elucidate further its roles in vivo
the first direct evidence concerning the physiological role of ace2 was provided by studies on transgenic ace2 knockout mice ace2
 carried out by crackower et al 27 these mice show no gross abnormalities are fertile and have normal blood pressure and renal function despite moderately elevated angiotensin ii levels closer examination however revealed the mice suffered from severe cardiac dysfunction manifest in a profound decrease in cardiac contractility resulting from the thinning of the left ventricle wall and an increase in ventricle chamber dimensions this disruption of heart function was associated with an up-regulation of genes induced by hypoxia and bore a remarkable resemblance to a condition resulting from cardiac surgery referred to as cardiac stunning significantly ablation of the ace gene against an ace2 knockout background rescues the cardiac phenotype suggesting that ace2 serves as a regulator of the effects of ace in the ras in a separate study targeted disruption of the ace2 gene resulted in viable fertile progeny lacking gross anatomicalstructural abnormalities 28 and displaying only moderately elevated systolic blood pressure after chronic infusion of angiotensin ii at a level that does not induce hypertension increased blood pressure and decreased heart rate were evident in ace2 null mice compared with wild-type littermates thus it appears that in the absence of ace2 the mice are more susceptible to angiotensin ii-induced hypertensiontransgenic mice in which ace2 was overexpressed exclusively in cardiac myocytes exhibited complete atrioventricular block from 3 weeks of age 22 the transgenic mice appeared healthy with a grossly normal heart structure and only slightly lowered blood pressure however the mice suffered from an increased susceptibility to sudden cardiac death which directly correlated with the transgene dose detailed electrophysiological analysis revealed severe progressive conduction and rhythm disturbances along with sustained ventricular tachycardia and terminal ventricular fibrillation in light of the observation that the gap junction proteins connexin40 and connexin43 were down-regulated in the hearts of these transgenic mice it was suggested that the electrical remodelling was a result of gap junction dysregulation in surviving older mice the expression of human ace2 in cardiac myocytes was progressively down-regulated the down-regulation of proteins under the control of the heart-specific mhc promoter is a phenomenon reported for other models this coincided with the reciprocal up-regulation of connexin43 resulting in partial restoration of the cardiac phenotype however it is important to note that ace2 is not normally expressed in cardiac myocytes but rather in cardiac endotheliumthe ability of ace2 to cleave vasoactive peptides such as angiotensin ii indicates a possible role in blood pressure regulation this theory was given increased credence by the observation that the ace2 gene maps to a candidate quantitative trait locus qtl in a salt-sensitive rat model of hypertension furthermore these rats display reduced ace2 mrna and protein expression compared to healthy littermates 29 overlapping qtls have also been identified in other rat models of hypertension in addition two single nucleotide polymorphisms snps were identified in the ace2 locus which have been associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease in a caucasian population 30chronic administration of omapatrilat a dual inhibitor of the vasopeptidases ace and neprilysin nep in spontaneous hypertensive rats shrs results in a significant reduction in blood pressure marked diuresis and augmented renal excretion of the vasodilatory peptide angiotensin-17 31 ace2 is capable of producing angiotensin-17 from angiotensin ii in vitro and is abundantly expressed in the kidney 5 upon treatment of shrs with omapatrilat increased staining of both angiotensin-17 and ace2 is observed in the renal proximal tubules with a simultaneous increase of ace2 mrna expression in the cortex the authors suggest that omapatrilat exerts this effect by inducing ace2 expression resulting in a concomitant increase in angiotensin-17 production from angiotensin ii and an associated decrease in blood pressure rather than via the inhibition of ace and nep both of which are known to cleave angiotensin-17 it has been demonstrated that the concentrations of angiotensin-17 in kidney and urine are increased during normal pregnancy in rats 32 in light of the evidence of renal ace2 expression brosnihan et al 33 investigated the possibility that changes in ace2 expression may be associated with the previous finding that the levels of angiotensin-17 increase during pregnancy it was found that the renal distribution of angiotensin-17 and ace2 is similar and does not change during gestation however the intensity of staining for both was elevated 56 and 117 respectively in pregnant rats these findings suggest that ace2 is the primary candidate for the local production and increased angiotensin-17 generation during pregnancyfurther evidence of the role ace2 may play in the ras came from a study by zisman et al 34 in which they report up-regulation of ace2 expression in failing human heart ventricles in a parallel paper the same group presented evidence of the involvement of a novel angiotensin-17 activity in the intact failing heart 35 the later study demonstrated that formation of angiotensin-17 was correlated with the level of ace2 expression and could be completely abolished by administration of an ace2-specific inhibitor these data indicated that in failing hearts the major route for the increased production of angiotensin-17 is from angiotensin ii via ace2 rather than from angiotensin i via neprilysin as had previously been suggesteda separate study has implicated renal ace2 in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy 26 in this study it was shown that ace2 mrna and protein expression levels were significantly reduced in the kidneys of 24-week-old streptozocin-induced diabetic rats the reduction in ace2 mrna expression was not influenced by ace inhibitor treatment however the decrease in ace2 protein expression was prevented under the same conditions thereby suggesting that ace2 protein expression is associated with ace activity in contrast renal ace2 protein was found to be higher with the absence of a concomitant increase in ace2 mrna levels in young diabetic mice dbdb before the onset of diabetic nephropathy 36 the balance between ace and ace2 low versus high protein levels respectively may be renoprotective in the early stages of diabetes with this balance being lost upon progression to renal damage hence it is postulated that ace2 is involved in the aetiology of diabetes via the ras a role for which has been previously characterised in this disease state for a review see ref 37collectively these studies in vivo provide strong evidence of a role for ace2 in the ras through localised production of angiotensin-17 from angiotensin ii perhaps serving as a negative regulator of the vasoconstrictive effects of ace to maintain blood pressure homeostasis and maintain cardiac and renal function fig 2
a surprising discovery is that ace2 is a functional receptor for the sars coronavirus the causative agent of sars in a series of elegant experiments li et al 23 co-immunoprecipitated the virus attachment glycoprotein s1 with lysates from an african green monkey kidney cell line vero e6 and subjected the precipitated proteins to mass spectrometry among the sequences a number were obtained corresponding to ace2 subsequently it was demonstrated that recombinant soluble ace2 but not ace was able to block the association between vero e6 cells and the sars cov s protein expression of recombinant ace2 and of s1 protein resulted in cell fusion and the formation of syncytia in 293t cells a cell line normally resistant to sars cov infection furthermore 293t cells expressing ace2 permitted efficient replication of the coronavirus with viral genome copies increased 100 000-fold over a 48-h period compared to 10-fold in untransfected cells an ace2-specific antibody inhibited the cytopathicity of sars-cov in a dose-dependent mannerthe expression profiling of mrna performed by harmer et al 8 demonstrates the expression of low levels of ace2 in the bronchus and lung parenchyma this taken together with evidence that the primary sites of murine ace2 expression are in the lung and the kidney 38 led li et al 23 to suggest that the tissue distribution of ace2 is consistent with the pathology of sars-cov furthermore hamming et al 9 recently provided evidence that ace2 is abundantly expressed in the epithelia of the lung and the small intestine possible entry sites for the sars viruswhilst research determining the receptor binding properties of the sars cov s protein has progressed at a rapid rate little is known about the residues of ace2 involved in binding preliminary experiments performed by li et al 23 indicate that disrupting the active site of ace2 has no effect on s1 binding further studies are required to understand the nature of the proteinprotein interactionsuntil recently it was widely assumed that the intricacies of the ras had largely been elucidated recent studies examining the properties of ace2 however have provided evidence that this crucial pathway may be significantly more complicated than previously thought whilst as yet the precise physiological role of ace2 remains to be determined it is becoming increasingly apparent that ace2 may act as a counterbalance to the effects of ace in the ras given the significance of ace inhibitors in the treatment of a number of pathophysiological disorders the contribution of ace2 to the regulation of the ras cannot be ignored indeed modulation of ace2 activity may provide a significant new therapeutic opportunity in the treatment of cardiovascular disease either in isolation or in conjunction with existing ace inhibitors this exciting possibility highlights the need for continuing efforts to elucidate the in vivo roles and biochemical properties of this emerging player in the rassars-cov-2 the coronavirus that causes covid-19 enters human cells by binding of its viral spike protein to the membrane-bound form of the monocarboxypeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace21 from the viewpoint of human physiology ace2 plays an important regulatory role in the reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas metabolizing angiotensin ii a potent vasoconstrictor to generate angiotensin-17 a vasodilator2 studies in animals have suggested that angiotensin-convertingenzyme ace inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers arbs may up-regulate ace2 expression3 thus increasing the availability of target molecules for sars-cov-2these considerations have led to speculation that ace inhibitors and arbs might be harmful in patients with covid-1945 although this is only a hypothesis the argument has aroused potential concerns case series have indicated that hypertension diabetes and coronary artery disease  conditions for which clinicians often prescribe raas inhibitors  are more common in patients with severe covid-19 than in those with milder illness6 coverage of the hypothesis by the press and some websites has emphasized the theoretical risk with statements such as people with high blood pressure and diabetes could be at higher risk of severe or fatal coronavirus symptoms because of how their medicines work scientists say7 and reports suggest that you are four times as likely to die from covid-19 if you are taking one of these drugs prior to contracting the virus8in this rapidly evolving setting clinicians are weighing the alleged harm of continuing these medications in patients for whom ace inhibitors and arbs have known benefit against the harm to their cardiovascular and kidney health associated with discontinuing them three articles now published in the journal provide data about whether ace inhibitors and arbs are indeed harmful in the context of the covid-19 epidemic all are observational studies with the looming possibility of confounding but each has unique strengths and their message is consistent  none of the three studies showed evidence of harm with continued use of ace inhibitors and arbsmehra et al9 conducted a database study involving patients who had been hospitalized in 11 countries on three continents the study included 8910 patients who had received a diagnosis of covid-19 who had been admitted to the hospital between december 20 2019 and march 15 2020 and who had either died in the hospital or survived to hospital discharge in multivariate logistic-regression analysis an age greater than 65 years coronary artery disease congestive heart failure history of cardiac arrhythmia chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and current smoking were associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death female sex was associated with a decreased risk neither ace inhibitors nor arbs were associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death a secondary analysis that was restricted to patients with hypertension those for whom an ace inhibitor or arb would be indicated also did not show harmmancia et al10 conducted a casecontrol study involving patients with confirmed covid-19 in the lombardy region of italy which has been severely affected by the pandemic in this analysis 6272 people with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection that had been diagnosed between february 21 and march 11 2020 were compared with 30759 controls who were matched according to age sex and municipality of residence in a conditional logistic-regression multivariate analysis neither ace inhibitors nor arbs were associated with the likelihood of sars-cov-2 infection an additional analysis comparing patients with severe or fatal infections with matched controls also did not show an association between these drugs and severe covid-19reynolds et al11 conducted a study based on data from the electronic health records of 12594 patients in the new york university nyu langone health system who were tested for covid-19 between march 1 and april 15 2020 a total of 5894 patients had a positive test among whom 1002 had severe illness defined as admission to the intensive care unit mechanical ventilation or death propensity-score matching was performed among all tested patients and among patients with hypertension to assess whether the likelihood of a positive test result was associated with each of several antihypertensive drug classes as well as among covid-19positive patients and all such patients with hypertension to assess whether the likelihood of severe illness among those with a positive test was associated with the same drug classes the investigators bayesian analysis showed no positive association for any of the analyzed drug classes including ace inhibitors and arbs for either a positive test result or severe illnesstaken together these three studies do not provide evidence to support the hypothesis that ace inhibitor or arb use is associated with the risk of sars-cov-2 infection the risk of severe covid-19 among those infected or the risk of in-hospital death among those with a positive test each of these studies has weaknesses inherent in observational data but we find it reassuring that three studies in different populations and with different designs arrive at the consistent message that the continued use of ace inhibitors and arbs is unlikely to be harmful in patients with covid-19 several other smaller studies from china and the united kingdom have come to the same conclusion12-15we note that mehra et al found that use of either ace inhibitors or statins may be associated with a lower risk of in-hospital death than nonuse but neither of the other two studies estimated a lower risk of covid-19 or the likelihood of a positive test among patients treated with these agents the unexpected result in the study by mehra et al may be due to unmeasured confounding and in the absence of a randomized trial should not be regarded as evidence to prescribe these drugs in patients with covid-19professional scientific societies and experts have spoken with one voice in advising that patients should not discontinue ace inhibitor or arb therapy out of a concern that they are at increased risk for infection severe illness or death during the covid-19 pandemic16-18 the data from these three studies support those recommendations ultimately one or more randomized trials will be needed to answer definitively the question of whether ace inhibitors or arbs pose a harm to patients with covid-19dear siras of todays reports the global number of confirmed cases of covid-19 has surpassed 150000 the number of known cases is increasing by several thousand every day on march 11 2020 who publicly characterized covid-19 as a pandemic the issue is of serious concern and deserves momentous attentioncoronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses most of them cause illness in animals but seven known types of coronaviruses cause illness in humans the coronavirus sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 is one of those viruses  it causes the illness currently known as coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19though we are still learning what exactly puts someone at greater risk of developing a severe illness with covid-19 early information indicates older patients and those with chronic medical conditions such as hypertension diabetes and cardio-cerebrovascular diseases may be at higher risk 1 2 3 infection caused by covid-19 is likely to disturb metabolic regulation diabetic patients with covid-19 may face an altered immune response on the background of an already compromised health status owing to the diabetes-related complications andor agingthe most important findings in patients with hyperglycemia and a viral infection were significant worsening of symptoms which implies greater morbidity in these patients when compared to those without diabetes 3 however the pathophysiology of this association remains uncertain it is not known whether hyperglycemia changes the virulence of the infection or if the virus modifies the glycemic metabolism what we know is that diabetic patients are more susceptible to infection and this can impact on glucose metabolism 4 dm is not just a disorder of glucose metabolism but a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by multiple changes in lipid carbohydrate and protein profiles 5 such inflammatory processes are due to hyperglycemia which leads to increased synthesis of glycosylation end products ages activates macrophages and other cells of the immune system increase oxidative stress and promote the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines besides stimulating the synthesis of adhesion molecules that facilitate inflammation in the tissues 5 the inflammatory process and its complications might provide a higher propensity to infections or a greater severity of these conditions another important issue is how this inflammatory and immune response occur in diabetic patients who acquire a viral infection as well as whether the virus itself interferes with insulin secretion or the glycemic controlat this stage the biological mechanism of the relationship between covid-19 and diabetes is not known but the association for the severity of cases and death is pronounced we need to develop a hypothesis to explain the causal path underlying the more severe clinical presentation of covid-19 infection and subsequent death in diabetic patients biochemical tests are also essential to clarify the molecular pathophysiology involvedthe association of covid-19 and dm is of substantial public health importance and deserves proper attention since a large and diverse population is being affected globally nowadays this comorbidity poses a relevant threat to human health and prospective well-designed studies to elucidate the biological mechanism and the best clinical management of this association are urgently neededhomephilipphiliphomenewcastleacuktranslational and clinical research institute the medical school framlington place newcastle upon tyne ne20 9hu ukdear sirit was very useful to see the review published in the journal on diabetes and covid 19 infection 6 in it you highlight that people with diabetes have a death rate perhaps around four times that of the background population and i note that it has been suggested over 20-40  of deaths in chinawuhan were in people with diabetes 78 clearly it is important to understand whythere will be some confounders here in the form of associations with other risk factors for dying with a covid-19 infection notably age and cardiovascular disease but these cannot explain all the excess we need to understand this better to mitigate the riskit is reported that most of the deaths are occurring in the context of pneumonitis 78 and in particularly onset of adult respiratory distress syndrome ards a condition in which excess fluid in the alveoli blocks gas exchange between air and bloodpeople with diabetes and many with cardiovascular disease cvd without diabetes have a very permeable vasculature identified since the 1980s as albumin lead through the kidneys micro- and macro-albuminuria but even prior to that as a late blush over the retina with intravenous fluorescence marker injection 9 this leaky vasculature is associated with vascular inflammation metabolic syndrome and steatohepatitis as well as cvd per seit would seem not too far a stretch in the absence of further research as yet to assume that prior enhancement of vascular permeability could account for the increased rate of ards and death in people with diabetes particularly type 2 diabetes and also some with cvdaside from further research i would suggest that those already with albuminuria a routine yearly test for people with diabetes those with higher liver enzyme markers alt and perhaps those with diabetes associated dyslipidaemia low hdl cholesterol should take particular steps to self-isolateit is unclear to me how fast vascular inflammation can be ameliorated by improved blood glucose control nearly all glucose-lowering medications reduce microalbuminuria in time but tight glucose control in infected persons with insulin would meanwhile seem sensible very poor glucose control is further known to interfere with

guptariteshfortis cdoc hospital chirag enclaverenin angiotensin system blockade and covid-19 diseasedear editorwe recently published an article highlighting the special concerns while managing patients with diabetes in the times of covid-19 pandemic11 there have been some concerns about the use of angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs which were not clarified in our publication12 we are summarising the current evidence in this regard and will try to arrive at a reasonable conclusionin the absence of a vaccine and an antiviral drug for the covid-19 infection several therapeutic approaches are being studied one such approach is the use of inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system namely ace inhibitors and arbs on the other hand some concern has been raised about the fact that patients on these agents might be at an increased risk of infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars cov-2angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ace-2 is the receptor for sars cov-2 as well as other coronaviruses and is expressed in type 2 alveolar epithelial cells and endothelium the s-glycoprotein on the surface of coronavirus binds to ace2 this leads to a conformational change in the s-glycoprotein and allows proteolytic digestion by host cell proteases tmprss2 ultimately leading to internalization of the virion13 viral s-glycoprotein tmprss2 and ace-2 inhibition are potential targets of therapy and possibly vaccine developmentas ace-2 is essential to coronavirus infection its blockade is thought to be beneficial in preventingtreating this infection a retrospective analysis found reduced rates of death and endotracheal intubation in patients with viral pneumonia who were continued on ace inhibitors14 mice with coronavirus induced lung injury showed improvement when treated with losartan15 as far as cvid-19 infection is concerned the data on ras activation or the effect of its blockade is limited at present hypokalaemia could be a marker of ras activation and high incidence of hypokalaemia has been reported in patients with covid-19 infection16despite these small studies suggesting the benefit of drugs acting on ras there is some data albeit scarce from animal models and human studies that treatment with ace inhibitors and arb could cause up regulation of ace217 ibuprofen and thiazolidinediones have also been shown to do the same18

19 increased expression of ace2 could theoretically increase the risk of infection with sars cov-2 this could be a concern in people with diabetes who are at already elevated risk of infections because of many other factors however currently there is no evidence to support this hypothesis in view of lack of robust evidence for either benefit or harm it is reasonable for patients to continue using ace inhibitors and arb as recommended by european society of cardiology council on hypertension and european society of hypertension20

novel coronavirus disease covid-19 is spreading worldwide and has caused over 250000 deaths so far 1 the mortality rate varies widely by age and across individuals ranging from 02 among healthy young-adults to 10 among older persons with pre-existing conditions 1although the pharmacological treatment was not assessed the first observational studies on patients with severe disease reported a high prevalence of comorbidities that are often treated with angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors such as cerebrovascular diseases coronary heart disease hypertension and diabetes 24 observing that human pathogenic coronaviruses bind their target cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 58 and that a few studies reported an increase in ace2 expression mediated by angiotensin ii type-i receptor blockers arbs and ace inhibitors more consistently on animals than in humans 916 some hypothesized that the increased expression of ace2 would facilitate infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 thus the hypertension treatment with ace2-stimulating drugs as well as ace2 polymorphisms might increase the risk of developing severe covid-19 1719 consequently this would lead to a serious conflict regarding treatment because ace2 reduces inflammation and has been suggested as a potential new therapy for inflammatory lung diseases cancer diabetes and hypertension 17 2023 in the wake of two preliminary cohort studies reporting a lower 24 or similar 25 covid-19 mortality among inpatients hypertensive subjects treated with arbs and ace inhibitors the potential predictors of covid-19 and of disease severity including anti-hypertensive medications were recently analyzed by a few observational studies 2628 with one exception 27 no increased risk emerged from the use of arbs or ace inhibitors however the role of other potentially linked predictors including age and cardiovascular comorbidities 17 29 30 differed across the population analyzed and still requires confirmation we have performed a case-control study on all sars-cov-2 infected subjects diagnosed in two italian provinces retrieving admission and pharmacological data up to two years before infection in order to confirm the potential independent predictors of severelethal covid-19 including treatment with ace inhibitors andor arbsour sample of 129 hypertensive subjects with severelethal covid-19 and 414 hypertensive subjects with mild disease or asymptomatic infection had 80 statistical power to detect a difference of 20 or higher corresponding to a relative risk 120 in the risk of severelethal disease between users of arbs or ace inhibitors exposed group and non users controlsthe sample consisted of 1603 subjects mean age 580y 473 males 454 283 had severe symptoms 192 120 very severe or lethal disease table 1 the sample of infected subjects compared with the available estimates of the general population of the two provinces 34 showed higher prevalence of diabetes 121 in the sample versus 5 in the general population hypertension 339 versus 17 copd 60 versus 3 and cvd 161 versus 3 154 subjects deceased mean age 793 years 546 males of them 708 were hypertensive 422 were diagnosed a cvd 279 diabetics twenty subjects with very severe disease were younger than 60 years the youngest being a male aged 33 years of those deceased eight were younger than 60 years and the youngest was a female aged 44 yearsat univariate analysis as compared to the subjects with mild disease those with severe or very severelethal disease were significantly more likely to be older diabetics hypertensive diagnosed with copd cvd and renal disease and treated with arbs andor ace inhibitors all p005 among hypertensive subjects n  543 however the proportion of those treated with arbs or ace inhibitors whose medication was not discontinued during the follow-up were higher among those with asymptomaticmild disease 884 versus 787 and 806 among patients with severe and very severelethal disease respectivelytable 1in multivariable analyses restricted to hypertensive subjects models a and b table 2 the treatment with arbs andor ace inhibitors never increased the likelihood of severe or very severelethal disease all p0405the significant predictors of severe disease were male gender adjusted odds ratioaor 176 95 confidence

main findings of this retrospective observational study are the following first it is confirmed that among hypertensive subjects the use of ace inhibitors or arbs up to two years preceding sars-cov-2 infection did not affect the severity of covid-19 second older age male gender diabetes and the presence of copd or cvd were independent predictors of severe disease with a sharp increase of risk among subjects older than 70 years third only older age male gender and diabetes were associated with a higher likelihood of very severelethal diseaseseveral hypotheses have been made on the association between covid-19 progression and treatment with ace inhibitors and arbs 2022 35 36 on one side some asked whether the therapy should be discontinued during sars-cov-2 pandemic 17 37 because covid-19 was strongly associated with hypertension which is frequently treated with arbs and ace inhibitors 24 it was indeed hypothesized that a ace2 up-regulation mediated by arbs and to a lesser extent by ace inhibitors might increase patients susceptibility to sars-cov-2 entry into host cells and further viral propagation 18 19 b virus binding to ace2 might reduce its activity thus leading to increased levels of angiotensin ii and consequent pulmonary vasoconstriction inflammation and oxidative organ damage and increased risk of acute lung injury 20 on the opposite side other scientists suggested that other than being harmful arbs and ace inhibitors use in patients with cardiovascular risk factors and known or suspected covid-19 may even exert a beneficial effect as ace2 up-regulation could increase the conversion of angiotensin ii to angiotensin-17 a peptide with potentially protective anti-inflammatory properties 35 36recently a few large observational studies based upon in- and outpatient electronic health records 2628 examined the association between antihypertensive medications and the risk of covid-19 andor a severelethal disease our results are in line with most of the previous findings on an absence of risk with ace inhibitors andor arbs use in brief the studies by mancia et al 26 and reynolds et al 28 reported no difference in covid-19 severity or death between treated and untreated subjects for both arbs and ace inhibitors instead the results by mehta et al 27 were partially discordant the study found no association between treatment with arbs and death but those treated with ace inhibitors showed a significantly higher risk of icu admission in our sample in order to further investigate the potential beneficial effects of ace inhibitors the impact of which might be larger in patients with diabetes copd or cardiovascular diseases we performed additional analyses stratified by comorbidities we found however no significant differences in the risk of severelethal covid-19 among treated and untreated patients with either cvd or diabetes and copd data not shownbesides sample size and provenance there were few differences between this and previous studies all studies included all infected subjects hospitalized or not evaluated disease progression beyond mortality and retrieved medications and admissions from electronic health records with the exception of mehta et al who assessed the medications exclusively at the time of testing for sars-cov-2 27overall the present and previous findings confirm those from preliminary chinese cohorts 24 31 and although confirmation from randomized studies is required 38 they strongly support the statements of several experts 39 40 and scientific societies including the european medicines agency 41 the european society of cardiology 42 and the american heart association 43 who recommend continuation of arbs or ace inhibitors medication for all patients unless otherwise advised by their physicianswith regard to the role of the other risk factors that have been suggested for severe covid-19 including age male gender hypertension diabetes copd and major cardiovascular diseases it has been correctly argued that so far available data were unadjusted thus the relative importance of underlying health conditions was unclear 21 29 in this study we found support for a potential role of gender diabetes copd and cvd beyond age in covid-19 progression to a severe disease whereas only gender and diabetes significantly increased the risk of a lethal or very severe outcome thus the present study confirms prior findings on the independent relationship of older age and male gender with death 44 and of copd with progression towards severe disease 26 instead at least two issues may have influenced the conflicting results on the role of cvd and copd in predicting very severelethal disease an association showed in some prior populations 44but lacking in the present as well as in other recent findings 26 first the relatively small sample of the present study second a marked difference in the population here enrolled as compared to previous studies which included randomly selected sars-cov2 negative subjects as controls 26 given the present scenario further population-based cohort studies with longer follow-up are clearly needed 29 to clarify these findingsin addition to a relatively small sample a limitation of the present study is the lack of tobacco smoking and body mass index among the variables that have been recorded because we could not extract such information for half of the deceased subjects as well as for many of those that were not hospitalized other limitations are the lack of an evaluation of the severity of the underlying cardiovascular diseases and the absence of data on other antihypertensive medications however their potential role in altering the relationship between arbs or ace inhibitors and risk of severelethal covid-19 remains unclear none of the previous studies on the topic assessed cardiovascular diseases severity 2628 and the two studies that included the use of other antihypertensive drugs into multivariable analyses did not find substantial differences between the adjusted and unadjusted relative risks of death 26 28in conclusions the present study did not find any association between covid-19 severity and treatment with arbs ace inhibitors or both and confirms previous findings in supporting the recommendation of several scientific societies to continue arbs or ace inhibitors medication for all patients unless otherwise advised by their physicians who should thus be reassured the adjusted analyses substantially confirm prior reports indicating that the risk of severe or lethal covid-19 largely and significantly increases among the elderly males diabetics and those with copd or major cardiovascular diseases
the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace-2 a single pass type 1 membrane
monocarboxypeptidase discovered 2 decades ago
11
consists of an n-terminal peptidase domain and c-terminal
collectrin like domain
9
 it is the
peptidase domain that is responsible for the main functions of the renin
angiotensin system ras
9
 the ace-2
shares 40 homology with the n-terminal catalytic domain of ace and a
hydrophobic region near the c-terminus likely to serve as a membrane anchor
9
11
 the ace-2 protein is encoded by the
ace-2
gene located on chromosome xp22 these ace-2 proteins are more
abundantly expressed on the apical surface of the well-differentiated and mostly
ciliated airway epithelium of the lungs alveolar type-2 cells and enterocytes
of the small intestine
12
 furthermore
ace-2 protein is expressed in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial
smooth muscle cells in the heart kidneys adrenal glands pancreas skeletal
muscle and adipose tissues
11


the coronavirus sars-cov-2 a single stranded rna virus has been seen to infect
humans through their envelope spike glycoprotein s-protein which is
responsible for cov cell entry and host-to-host transmission during viral
infection this s-protein cleaves into s1 and s2
9
 the furin cleavage site in the
sars-cov-2s protein may provide a priming mechanism
13
 the ectodomain s1 binds to the
peptidase domain of the ace-2 enzyme while the s2 is cleaved further by the
host cell serine protease tmprss2
14
resulting in membrane fusion both these steps are essential for the viral entry
into the cells

an in vivo study shows that the infection of human airway epithelia by sars
coronavirus correlated with the state of cell differentiation and ace-2
expression and localization
15
 the
infection tends to occur more readily through well differentiated ciliated cells
with higher ace-2 expression
15
 it has
been observed that ace-2 membrane expression and plasma levels are reduced after
infection with sars coronavirus
16

further sars cov spike protein has been found to reduce ace-2 expression and to
augment pulmonary injury
16
 however
treatment with blockers of the renin-angiotensin system reduced the pulmonary
injury by activating the ace-2-ang-1-7-mas axis

in the classical endocrine model of the ras renin cleaves its substrate
angiotensinogen agt to produce the inactive peptide angiotensin i ang i
which is then converted to angiotensin ii ang ii by endothelial
angiotensin-converting enzyme ace the catalytic activity of ace to activate
ang ii occurs most extensively in the lung ang ii mediates vasoconstriction as
well as aldosterone release from the adrenal gland resulting in sodium
retention and an increase in blood pressure through the angiotensin 1 receptor
at
1
r

however recent evidence suggests that ras also includes local systems with
autocrine cell-to-same cell and paracrine cell-to-different cell effects in
addition to the classical circulating ras with its well-known classical
endocrine effects in particular ang ii generation at the tissue level by the
tissue specific ras appears to have physiologic effects that are as important as
circulatingsystemic ang ii and under some circumstances more
important than circulating ang ii therefore the ras system is not only
involved in controlling blood volume and blood pressure but with the tissue
specific local systems it directs tissue remodeling endothelial dysfunction
and fibrosis
17
18
19
20


simplistically it can be seen as a dual function system which acts through two
apparently opposite arms the one responsible for the main actions of this
system is constituted by the ace ang ii-at
1
receptor axis and the
other a counterregulatory arm is formed by the ace-2-ang-17-mas
axis the catalytic activity of ace results in increased ang ii levels and
increased catabolism of ang-17 whereas the catalytic activity of
ace-2 is predominantly on ang i and ang ii and leads to formation of
ang-17 ang-17 acts on the g-protein coupled receptor mas
and is known to have counterregulatory actions on ang ii resulting in
vasoconstriction and growth inhibitory effects
17
18
19
20
see
fig 1


a common mechanism by which diabetes hypertension and other metabolic disorders
cause vascular complications is endothelial dysfunction inflammation and
atherosclerosis in these disorders the ace-ang ii-at
1
receptor axis
is activated with a downregulation of ace-2-ang-17-mas axis
19
20
21
 which leads to increased local and
circulatory ang ii with a decrease in ang-17 and subsequent increased
oxidative stress activation of the endothelium smooth muscle cell migration
growth proliferation and thrombosis
19
20
21
 deficiency in ace-2 leads to
increased formation of atherosclerotic plaques and blocking of ace-2 results in
prevention of atherosclerosis
20

fig 1
 ace-2 is present in multiple
organs and has various functions in the heart ace-2 prevents progressive
cardiac fibrosis associated with aging andor cardiac pressure overload
and is beneficial in heart failure
19
20
 in most forms of chronic kidney
disease including diabetic and hypertensive nephropathy expression of ace-2 has
been reported to be reduced in kidney tubules with an increased expression in
the glomerula
20
 this imbalance has
been postulated as a potential cause of diabetic nephropathy

in the adrenal glands the local secretory ras stimulates aldosterone production
and serves as an amplification system for circulating ang ii importantly the
regulation of the secretory adrenal ras is independent of the circulatory ras
and the activity of the adrenal ras correlates with aldosterone production and
regulation of potassium serum concentrations
22
 severe diabetes has been associated with hyporeninaemic
hyperactivity of the adrenal gland
23


in the pancreas the ace-2-ang-17-mas axis has been described to
protect the function of insulin-producing beta cells by improving the function
of islet microvascular endothelial cells further activation of endothelial
nitric oxide synthase and no signaling pathways via the
ace-2-ang-17-mas axis may have anti-inflammatory beneficial effects
in pancreatitis
23
24
 in the skeletal muscle the
ace-2-ang-17-mas axis has been described to decrease insulin
resistance
25
 ace-2 may exert potential
anti-obesity effects via stimulating brown adipose tissue formation and
induction of browning in white adipose tissue
26


a study done in the survivors of the sars infections the organ involvement
correlated with the organ expression of ace-2 with significantly higher
immunostaining in the lung kidney heart and islets of pancreas
27
 in this series 20 of the 39 patients
had diabetes during hospitalization which resolved subsequently suggestive of
acute islet cell damage and diabetes probably due to the use of the ace-2
receptor domain for viral entry
27


the respiratory system is a major site of ace-activity and source of systemic ang
ii synthesis locally produced ang ii may trigger increasing vascular
permeability facilitating pulmonary edema the ace-2-ang-17-mas axis
that is highly expressed in the lungs may potentially induce pulmonary
vasoconstriction in response to hypoxia which is an important process in
preventing shunting in patients with pneumonia or lung injury
19
 in acute respiratory distress syndrome
ards mouse models ace-2 knockout mice displayed more severe ards symptoms
compared with wildtype mice while overexpression of ace-2 appeared to be
protective
19
 thus stimulation of the
ace-2-ang-17-mas axis may have anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic
effects in the pulmonary system and these actions could potentially be
favorable in the recovery of patients with pulmonary inflammation it is
possible that an aceace-2 imbalance is one of the potential mechanisms
explaining why patients with cardio-metabolic problems are at higher risk for
respiratory failure
20


in an animal model study it has been reported that infusion of sars cov spike
protein reduced ace-2 expression and augmented pulmonary injury however
treatment with blockers of the renin-angiotensin system reduced the pulmonary
injury by activating the ace-2-ang-1-7-mas axis
16
 therefore it may be assumed that the
inherent downregulation of the ace-2-ang-17-mas axis as seen in
metabolic conditions is exacerbated in the covid-19 state because i the virus
uses the peptidase domain of the enzyme for entry into the cells and ii there
is a decrease in ace-2 with an increase in ace
9


in covid-19 infections chest radiography typically shows patchy or diffuse
asymmetric airspace opacities bilaterally more in the peripheral zones and in
later stages ground glass opacities ct scan typically shows bilateral
involvement which is different from sars and mers which starts unilaterally
moreover it shows bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities with a peripheral
lung involvement in milder cases with more widespread consolidation in patients
who go to the intensive care unit pleural effusion cavitation pulmonary
nodules and lymphadenopathy have not been reported in patients with covid-19
an important clinical observation of covid-19 infection in china was that some
individuals with early infection exhibited no symptoms interestingly they even
had negative swab results due to absence of infection in the upper respiratory
tract and normal chest x-rays however showed significant changes in the ct
scan of the lungs
28


histopathological examination of early covid-19 infected lungs which were
serendipitously detected in specimens operated for lung cancer revealed
exudative and proliferative phases of acute lung injury edema and congestion of
alveolar septa with inflammatory infiltrates macrophages type ii pneumocytes
hyperplasia with viral inclusions organization of inflammatory exudates and
interstitial fibrosis
29
 these
pathological findings corroborated with the ct findings of patchy ground glass
opacities intriguingly these pathological findings of inflammatory and
fibrotic changes are known to be exacerbated in animal models of ace-2 knockout
mice
19


histopathological examination from autopsies of individuals who have succumbed
from covid-19 infections showed degenerated and necrotized cells in the
myocardium and blood vessels with interstitial inflammatory infiltrates and
focal necrosis in the kidneys proteinaceous exudates in the bowmans
capsule surrounding the glomerulus degeneration and shedding of the renal
tubular epithelial cells and hyaline casts microthrombi and fibrotic foci have
been reported
30
31
 some of these changes of myocardial
fibrosis and renal changes are already seen in the chronic phase of metabolic
disorders due to ace-2 downregulation and these may get exacerbated
19
20


the vast majority of covid-19 patients have mild symptoms however a significant
percentage is critically ill with admission to an intensive care unit icu
approx 10 with 4 case fatality rate globally john hopkins
coronavirus resource center
httpscoronavirusjhuedu mortality is higher in
patients with underlying hypertension type-2 diabetes mellitus or
cardiovascular disease
1
2
3
 to address this further we performed
a cumulative analysis of published data from china and south korea which showed
that a disproportionately higher percentage of patients with a higher morbidity
requiring icu care ards had hypertension 28 type-2 diabetes
17 cvd 8 as an underlying disease moreover patients
admitted to the icu had a higher systolic bp when compared to asymptomatic cases
4
5
6
7
and in a recent series reported none
of the nonsurvivors had hypotension
3

table 1
 a limitation of the data
summarized in
table 1
is the posibility
that some cases were reported twice in different series interestingly however
in a recent case report on a mild case extensively followed in australia a low
level of the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mcp-1 a key biomarker of
type-2 diabetes related vascular complications was found to be associated with
minor disease pathology
32
 in a recent
preprint study hypokalemia due to renal potassium wasting has been reported
with 93 of the critically ill patients having hypokalemia independent
of gastrointestinal symptoms
33


the presence of higher expression of ace-2 receptors or its upregulation although
initially thought to be a risk factor for infection is unlikely the case in a
recent preprint study wherein they integrated public genomics epigenomics and
transcriptomics data they found that the expression of ace-2 is relatively high
in asian females and young people while it is lower in males and further
decreases with age and with the progression of type-2 diabetes
34
 this contradicts the hypothesis that
higher expression is directly related to increased susceptibility as we know
that sars-cov-2 infections are more common in males and in elderly patients with
metabolic disorders
taken together these observations suggest that patients with underlying type-2
diabetes hypertension andor cardiovascular diseases are at higher risk
for requiring critical care and ventilation there is evidence that although
they are critically ill they tend to demonstrate normotension to hypertension
and hypokalemia which are classical features of an activated ace related ras
with a downregulation of the ace-2 pathway as per current data it does not
appear that higher ace-2 expression is associated with an immediate predilection
as individuals at risk will tend to have lower ace-2 expression
since ace-2 is the entry receptor for cellular infection by sars-cov-2 blocking
entry using ace-2-related therapy could be feasible to prevent the spreading of
infection in the lungs and the whole body convalescent sera containing
neutralizing antibodies against sars-s protein offer protection against
sars-cov-2 infection
35
 therefore it
was suggested to use recombinant human ace-2 protein to saturate the viral
s-protein and thus prevent cellular entry of sars-cov-2
10
 this is especially of interest since
ace-2 has already been developed as an experimental drug apn01 gsk2586881 for
adult respiratory distress syndrome ards and is therefore available for
clinical trials it was shown that ace-2 could successfully prevent lung injury
by the original sars-cov-2
16
 for ards
it had favorable effects in mice and piglets but the results from a recent
study in humans has been disappointing
35
36
37

another crucial step in cellular infection involves the serine protease tmprss2
that cleaves the viral s-protein the tmprss2 inhibitor camostat mesylate has
been approved in japan for pancreatic inflammation and has been shown to prevent
cellular infection by sars-cov-2
14

consequently it could prove being useful in covid-19

both ace inhibitors and at
1
receptor blockers have been used in
diabetes and cardiovascular disorders to modulate this system in preference for
vasodilation and maintenance of endothelial integrity furthermore in the
diabetic kidney reduced ace-2 protein expression could be prevented by ace
inhibitor therapy suggestive of an upregulation with ace inhibitor
19
 it is worthwhile mentioning that ace-2
receptor upregulation due to angiotensin receptor blockers that are commonly
used in hypertension could be considered to be risk factor for increased
transmission of sars-cov-2  however it has been seen that the at
1
receptors tends to associate with ace-2 in these cases which prevent the
internalization of the ace-2 receptor and hence may not be amenable to viral
entry
40
 moreover as mentioned
earlier higher expression of ace-2 was not associated with higher
susceptibility to infection with sars-cov

according to the scientific data detailed above it is tempting to speculate that
blocking the ace-ang ii-at
1
receptor axis with at
1
blockers commonly used as antihypertensives may tilt the balance in favor of the
ace-2-ang-17-mas axis which may help to accelerate respiratory
recovery in patients suffering from covid-19
41
 however it is intriguing that the patients most likely to be
treated with ace-i or at
1
blockers are the ones with the poorest
prognosis in covid-19

7
 moreover ace-2 upregulation
concomitant with ras inhibitions may ease viral infection consequently it is
also possible that ras blockade may have a detrimental effect in covid-19
currently there is no clinical data to support one or the other direction
thus the heart failure society of america the american college of cardiology
and the american heart association have all issued statement to suggest that
there is no definitive evidence of harm or benefit with the use of
ace-inhibitors or at
1
receptor blockers and that patients should
continue to take their medications as usual
42
 it is of the utmost priority to evaluate the growing stock of
clinical data from china and worldwide to determine if ras inhibitors are
beneficial or deleterious in covid-19 only then we can know how to counsel our
patients taking ras inhibitors  in fact some researchers are planning a
clinical trial to study losartan in covid-19 patients
43


individuals with underlying hypertension type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease
are at higher risk for respiratory failure and mortality in covid-19 one of
possible mechanisms for this predilection may be the imbalance in the ace pathways
and therapeutics targeting viral entry through the ace-2 receptor or the ace-ang
ii-at
1
receptor axis as well as stimulating the
ace-2-ang-17-mas axis may be beneficial in these individuals further
evidence needs to be gathered on whether modulation of the renin angiotensin system
would be advantageous due to upregulation of mas activation or harmful due to the
concomitant ace-2 receptor upregulation in the acute management of covid-19
coronaviruses cov belong to the family coronaviridae and are considered to be the largest rna viruses with genomes ranging from 27 to 32 kb 1 they have been known to exist across the timeframe of history and cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections 2 these viruses are considered to be enzootic limited to their natural animal host but somehow have managed to breach the animalhuman species barrier manifesting themselves as virulent human viruses 34emerging viruses from this family have posed serious threats to mankind including severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers both of which had pandemic effects resulting into 8096 and 2229 confirmed cases with a mortality rate of 96 and 355 respectively 5 in the same context the recent outbreak of sars-cov 2 the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 in december 2019 has inflicted 204 nations with a total of 896450 confirmed cases and 45526 deaths up to 2 april 2020the sequence analysis of sars-cov 2 receptor-binding domain rbd that makes contact with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2ace-2 6 revealed that most amino acids essential for sars-s sars spike protein binding are conserved in sars-2-s and have been validated to use similar host cell receptors 7 from a structural perspective the genome of coronaviruses encodes four structural proteins e envelope protein the smallest in size expressed in abundance inside infected cells during the replication cycle but only partially incorporated into the virion envelope 8 m matrix glycoprotein responsible for the assembly of virions 19 and interacting with s proteins promoting their retention in the endoplasmic reticulum ergolgi intermediate for their incorporation into new virions 10 n nucleocapsid protein the only protein capable of binding to the virus rna genome synthesizing nucleocapsid 11 s spike protein mediating the attachment of the virus to host cell receptors 121314 the s proteins aforementioned are composed of two subunits s1 the n-terminus of which functions as a receptor binding region and s2 which serves to promote fusion activity via its c-terminus 15 unraveling s protein activation is therefore key to understanding human cov hcov tropism ecology and pathogenesis like other class i viral fusion proteins the human coronavirus spikes require proteolytic priming to be activated 16 notably the majority of pathogenic hcovs exit the producer cells with unprimed s proteins 1718 and thus rely on target-cell proteases for activation therefore hcov cell entry factors on target cells include virus-binding agents cell receptors and virus protein-cleaving agents cell proteasessars-covs bind naturally to the ectopeptidase receptor ace-2 with very high affinity 19 but it has been noted that the binding of s protein takes place distant from the ace-2 enzyme pocket 6 indicating that ace-2 is not a direct s-activating protease several proteases are available to serve as cofactors for viral entrance such as cathepsin l thermolysins plasmins and trypsin 202122 but these proteases are mostly soluble and cannot be retained in the vicinity of ace-2 receptors hence the question regarding location of the activating protease and timing of s protein binding to it is relevant because endoproteolytic cleavage only takes place after ace-2 engagement indeed if occurring prior to engagement binding with such proteases might cleave and inactivate the viral spikes 2122 taking into account the sequence of s protein binding to ace-2 and subsequent proteolytic cleavage it would be relevant to state that the protease might be anchored in the cell membrane near ace-2 receptors among the candidates for the membrane-anchored virus activating protease are the type ii transmembrane serine proteases ttsps expressed in the epithelial cell lining of the nose trachea and distal airways 23according to a study 7 s protein priming by cellular proteases which entails s protein cleavage at the s1s2 and s2 sites same in sars-s and sars-2-s allowing the fusion of viral and cellular membranes is a process driven by the s2 subunit engaging ace-2 as the entry receptor and employing the cellular serine protease rss2 242526 it has also been mentioned that though the coronavirus strain may use cathepsin lb or tmprss2 for proteolytic priming only tmprss2 is essential for viral spread and pathogenicity whereas cathepsin bl activity is dispensable 262728considering the vital role played by tmprss2 in the priming of viral spike proteins this protease can be used as a potential target to inhibit virus entry into host cells this protein also binds the hemagglutinin protein of influenza and therefore is a potential drug target also the flu virus besides coronavirus 29 it is also expressed in prostate cancer and tumor metastasis 30 tmprss2 expression and variants served as covid-19 modulators in italian patients 31 being part of the host cells these proteases are also not prone to progressive mutations which mostly occur in viral protein targets in this study we have identified potential natural product candidates which can inhibit these proteases efficientlyin the current study we used computational biology to screen and dock a library of natural compounds to inhibit human tmprss2 which facilitates the entry of sars-cov-19 onto host cells the three-dimensional structure of tmprss2 was built using the online server swiss-model as shown in figure 1a we validated the results of the model obtained with swiss-model and cross-checked in rampage observing 319 927 residues in the favored region 23 67 residues in the allowed region and 2 06 residues in the outlier region which indicated the correct geometry and three-dimensional arrangement of the model as shown in figure 1b alignment of the template pdb id 5ce1 and the target protein is shown in figure 1c the validated structure of human serine protease 2 was prepared for molecular docking analysis using the molecular operating environment moe software the protein was 3d protonated and energy was minimized by using energy minimization in the compute option in the moe software after energy minimization the binding pocket of the protein was predicted by using the moe site finder option to select the active site residues in the binding pocket in the three-dimensional atomic coordinates of the protein the predicted active site residues of tmprss2 are asn146 arg147 cys148 val149 arg150 leu151 asp187 met188 tyr190 ile221 tyr222 lys223 asn368 pro369 gly370 met371 lys449

bacteria 67 fungi 79 metazoan 94 and viridiplantae 678 from 6814 genera in silico screening of large databases is a cost-effective and time-saving approach towards drug discovery in the present study we used two approaches for compound screening ie a pharmacophore-based approach and a molecular docking score-based approach for the first compound screening approach we selected 10 pharmacophoric features of the known inhibitor of serine protease 2 camostat mesylate which includes anionic and cationic atoms an h-bond donor and acceptor an aromatic center a pi ring center and a hydrophobic centroid based on these features of the known inhibitor we got 2140 compounds out 30927 in the result file in the second compound screening approach these 2140 compounds were docked against tmprss2 for the evaluation of potent inhibitors the molecular docking analysis revealed 85 compounds with a docking score comparable or lower than that of the standard inhibitor camostat mesylate an fda-approved drug compounds with the lowest docking score are considered to be the most potent inhibitors it is interesting to mention that camostat is approved by the japanese fda for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis and postoperative and reflux esophagitis it could be considered for off-label treatment of sars-cov-2-infected patients the standard inhibitor of tmprss2 ie camostat interacted with four key residues of the protease active site by forming seven hydrogen bonds as shown in figure 2 asparagine 146 forms an arene cation and backbone acceptor h-bonds while cys148 forms an arene-h bond with the benzene ring of the ligand asparagine 450 forms two hydrogen bonds with the anhydrous carbonyl oxygen with sidechain acceptor and backbone acceptor aspartic acid 187 forms an acidic hydrogen bond with the primary amine and a sidechain donor hydrogen bond with the secondary amine of the ligand we selected the top-ranked drug-like compounds 12 compounds figure 3 shown in table 1 with a docking score equal to 13 or lower in the attempt to identify active natural compounds for drug development among these drug-like compounds compounds 1 npc306344 showed the highest docking score of 1469 all the selected drug-like compounds showed interaction with tmprss2 with a docking score 13 better than the docking score 1106 of the standard inhibitor compound 1 forms 10 hydrogen bonds with the active site residues of the receptor protein as shown in figure 4 among these h-bonds six residues asn146 arg147 arg150 lys449 and asn450 are sidechain acceptor and two residues asn146 and arg147 are both backbone acceptor and donor this compound has the iupac name methyl 1s4as7as-7-hydroxymethyl-1-345-trihydroxy-6-hydroxymethyloxan-2-yloxy-14a57a-tetrahydrocyclopentacpyran-4-carboxylate and the common name geniposide and is one of the major iridoid glycosides of gardenia fruit it was previously shown to inhibit 5-lipoxygenase 33 and the tumor-promoting factor p-glycoprotein 34 and have anti-angiogenic activity 35 and potential antiasthma properties 36 additionally geniposide was shown recently to protect against sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction by activating ampk to suppress myocardial reactive oxygen species ros accumulation 37 it is present

gastrointestinal absorption capability nor can it cross the bloodbrain barrier regarding its metabolic role it was found to be a substrate of cyp450 3a4 enzyme and an inhibitor of oatp1b1 it possesses estrogen and androgen receptor as well as aromatase binding properties eye irritation ames toxicity and carcinogenicity were null but toxicity for honey bee and fish was high acute oral toxicity was

pyriformis was 02 gl and the plc50 predicted toxicity values for fish was 109 mgl it was predicted to be localized in mitochondria and its biodegradability was negligible or lowasselta et al 31 suggested that polymorphisms are responsible for enhanced expression of tmprss2 in the italian population and hence increased mortality a substitution mutation at position 160 ie v160m was probed from a docking perspective to see if the drug would bind differently in individuals carrying this mutation the binding energy values of the top 12 ligands were studied for both native and mutant proteins the values for binding to the mutant protein were different from those of binding to the native protein with energy s value difference of 12 a root-mean-square fluctuation of the main-chain atom coordinates from alpha carbon traces of the native tmprss2 its v160m mutant and the ligand-bound native tmprss2 and mutant tmprss2 structures was also observed figure 5 the binding site residues were also altered significantly in the mutant other top-ranked drug-like compounds potential inhibitor of tmprss2 32 were the marine natural product excavatolide m compound 2 a briarane-type diterpene the

green tea polyphenol --epicatechin 3-o-3-o-methyl gallate egcg3me compound 11 and the aromatase inhibitor isogemichalcone b compound 12 mainly from artocarpus and broussonetia genera among the remaining 73 compounds with a docking score comparable to that of the standard drug inhibitor it is worth mentioning the active principles of popular herbs used in ayurvedic traditional medicine and components of multi-ingredient food supplements formulations ie fuscaxanthone a from garcinia spp 29 docking score 1235 orthosiphonone d 44 docking score 1200 from java tea orthosiphon stamineus 7-hydroxy-14-deoxywithanolide u 77 docking score 1112 from withania somnifera commonly known as ashwagandha a plant of immense medicinal properties belonging to the family solanaceae 41 and 6s9r-roseoside 78 docking score 1112 from ocimum basilicum and ocimum sanctum 42the current study aimed to identify potential candidate molecules with the ability to inhibit sars-cov 2 by acting on the tmprss2 enzyme responsible for the priming of the s proteins found on the surface of the virus 2743 these spike proteins of coronaviruses facilitate viral entry into the target cells the s glycoprotein is composed of s1 and s2 subunits the s1 subunit contains a signal peptide followed by an n-terminal domain ntd and an rbd while the s2 subunit contains a conserved fusion peptide heptad repeats 1 and 2 a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain 14it has been observed in previous studies that most human and animal cell lines including vero and mdckii are equally susceptible to virus entry driven by sars-s and sars-2-s suggesting similarity in the choice of receptors by the two coronaviruses 7 similarly it has also been evident from sequence analysis that sars-2-s rbm responsible for making contact with ace2 tends to harbor the same kind of amino acids present in sars-s indicating the use of ace-2 for cellular entry 44studies have also proven that ace-2 is not a direct s-activating protease as it binds through a region distant from the ace-2 enzyme pocket 14 hence the protease responsible for s protein activation should be available in the vicinity of ace-2 and be anchored in the membrane 25 tmprss2 a serine protease family is known for its longer potentially palmitoylated 84-residue cytoplasmic tail which may position it into lipid rafts of the plasma membrane 45 in this context endosomal cathepsin l a cysteine protease is known as an s-activating enzyme capable of cleaving the s protein to promote viralcellular membrane fusion 1528 however only tmprss2 activity is essential for viral spread and pathogenesis in the infected host whereas cathepsin bl is dispensable 1924262728 several serine protease inhibitors have been designed and are available in the market including camostat mesylate used as a standard inhibitor in this study nafamostat mesylate bromohexine hydrochloride and the protein inhibitors pai-1 or hai-2 29 in this study we focused on the inhibition of tmprss2 a host serine protease which is less prone to mutations over time compared to viral proteins using natural products for this purpose we adapted computational analysis to screen and dock a library of natural compounds considered as potential inhibitors of tmprss2 camostat mesylate a japanese approved drug trade name fiopin was taken as a standard drug to compare docking scores and physicochemical parameters the standard drug is known to inhibit syncytium formation 2746 an online swiss-modell homology structure of tmprss2 was generated and tested by using the rampage tool showing 927 residues in the favored region and 67 in the allowed ones thus indicating correct geometry and 3d arrangement the active site was deduced using the moe software npass a freely accessible database containing 30927 compounds was used to mine the potent inhibitors as a result 2140 compounds were identified as potent candidates after the first phase of physicochemical analysis the compounds obtained were docked against tmprss2 in the second phase of the analysis the second phase identified 85 compounds with binding energies comparable to or lower than that of the standard inhibitor camostat mesylate 1106 among these compounds we focused on the compounds with the lowest docking scores also following the lipinski rule of five shown in table 1 the amino acid sequence of human transmembrane protease serine 2 uniprot accession no o15393 isoform-2 is 492 amino acids long and was chosen for analysis it was retrieved in fasta format and uploaded to the online server swiss-model httpsswissmodelexpasyorg to build a homology model of the target protein the three-dimensional modelled structure was validated by uploading on the rampage server httpmordredbioccamacukrapperrampagephpwe screened the natural product activity and species source database npass available at httpbidd2nusedusgnpass which contains 30927 compounds 32 pharmacophore- and molecular docking-based screening were performed using the moe software in pharmacophore-based screening we selected the pharmacophoric features of the standard serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate a trypsin-like protease inhibitor for compound mining the pharmacophore-based screened library of compounds was further docked with the target protein to identify lead compounds with the best docking scores for molecular docking analysis the three-dimensional structure of human tmprss2 in pdb format was opened in moe software chemical computing group montreal quebec canada then 3d protonation and energy minimization were done with compute option till a gradient of 005 was reached polar hydrogens were added and site finder was used to predict the active site residues in the binding pockets of the protein for molecular docking we selected the mdb file of the library and used the following parameters placement triangle matcher refinement rigid receptor poses 1 and rescoring 1 and 2 london dg the docked compounds were ranked based on their docking scores 29 the compounds with the best docking scores were further evaluated according to the lipinskis rule of five for ligand properties in moe software admet property analysis was done using admetsar20 httplmmdecusteducnadmetsar2 based on a report that tmprss2 mutation makes some individuals more susceptible to covid-19 a reported mutation v160m suggestive of changed disease susceptibility 31 was studied with respect to its docking conformation in the presence of the top compound the protein residue was modified in pymol using the mutagenesis function the mutated protein was docked and structural binding of the apo- and holo-forms of native and mutated tmprss2 proteins was studied visualization was done in pymol and moeproteinligand interaction is a potent approach to mine drugs human judgment regarding these interactions has been facilitated by computational approaches this study made use of a computational approach to sift out interactions that are beneficial for and exclusive to tmprss2 binding and hence curb sars-cov-2 priming compounds showing interactions with low scores or unfavorable parameters were excluded while those able to establish favorable interactions were retained the docking score of compound 1 was found to be 1469 indicating this compound as the best drug candidate among those with promising features for drug development its binding site and energy value were altered when it was docked with the tmprss2 v160m mutant this information adds an important and flexible dimension to natural-drug mining against covid-19 and has led to some concrete predictions which would hopefully be confirmed experimentally urther in vitro and in vivo testing of the compounds identified in this study is necessary prior to their input in the clinical trial pipelineseveral types of experiment in animals give credence to the idea that the level of human ace2 expression may perhaps be important in covid-19 infection knockout mice genetically modified to have no ace2 are totally resistant to coronavirus infections 6 there is a converse to this in two studies transgenic mice were bred to overexpress human ace2 78 these hace2 transgenic mice demonstrated markedly increased infectivity and lethality when exposed to sars coronavirus despite this type of evidence it is commonly said that with arb and ace-inhibitor dosing in humans the induction of ace2 would be insufficient to matter and anyway may not be in the lungs but this criticism can be discounted applying a body of relevant evidence both experimental and clinical described in more detail below deriving from studies in which arb and ace-inhibitor dosing has been used to replenish ace2 in the lungs in lung failure syndromes resulting from influenza virus acid inhalation and other noxious influences 6911 pulmonary ace2 expression is demonstrably increased by renin-angiotensin block in this context with strong evidence that it improves survival 6911 in short the drugs in question for our hypothesis do induce increased pulmonary ace2 expression which has biological benefit in noncoronavirus arsd with coronavirus exposure it is plausible to ask as we do whether the biological effect of drug-induced pulmonary ace2 expression may be deleterious promoting infectivity and lethalitycre and cumhur cre 2 importantly extend the spectre of possible pharmaceutical hazard in covid-19 by providing evidence that statins specifically rosuvastatin 12 and some antidiabetic drugs possibly sodium-glucose transporter protein 2 sglt2 inhibitors 13 and certainly glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor glp-1 agonists 14 increase membrane ace2 expression in our hypothesis 1 we were circumscribed and specific focusing on arbs and hypertension cre and cumhur cre demonstrate that there may be a need to think more broadly on this matter he has extended the issue to prescribing of statins and antidiabetics how these drugs increase ace2 expression is unclear for other drugs that influence ace2 expression their action on body sodium balance appears to be a common link with sodium depletion elevating ace2 arbs and less consistently ace-inhibitors increase ace2 expression and decrease body sodium content 1 aldosterone reduces ace2 expression 15 mineralocorticoid block with spironolactone increases expression 16 we suggested 1 that elevated plasma angiotensin a substrate of ace2 which is elevated by arbs and accompanies sodium depletion in general may regulate the expression of the linked enzyme ace2 things turn out not to be as simple as that which may partly explain why ace-inhibition which reduces body sodium but through a direct action lowers plasma angiotensin elevates ace2 less consistently than arbs much as for aldosterone dosing dietary sodium loading reduces ace2 expression 17 this effect of sodium ingestion is relevant to the use of proximal small intestine tissue accessed by endoscopic biopsy used in direct studies of human ace2 18 direct exposure of the duodenum to sodium in a meal could be a confounderthree of the correspondents verdecchio et al 3 fernandez-fernandez 4 and liu and colleagues 5 develop the case which was first presented in relation to the sars epidemic 6 which in severe lung injury pulmonary ace2 is depleted a special form of this pulmonary ace2 depletion is seen with coronavirus infections wherein after the virus binds to the ace2 protein both are internalized depleting membrane ace2 6 depletion of ace2 is accompanied by accumulation of angiotensin its substrate in the lung with adverse effects the plasma concentration of angiotensin does rise substantially in severe covid-19 infections 19 there is a body of experimental and clinical evidence mentioned above that renin-angiotensin block by repleting ace2 is beneficial in noncoronavirus ards caused by influenza viruses acid inhalation and other noxious influences 6911 could this benefit extend to covid-19 infection a trial of the arb losartan in severe covid-19 infections based on this line of thinking has commenced clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04312009such a trial may carry risks of worsening the infection benefit from renin-angiotensin system block in acute severe lung disease has not been shown experimentally in coronavirus infections augmenting pulmonary ace2 expression might increase coronavirus uptake and viral load the classic study of kuba et al6 is often misquoted as providing evidence of arbs and ace-inhibitors benefiting coronavirus pneumonia kuba et al6 actually administered coronavirus fragments spike protein not replicable entire virus the spike fragments depleted pulmonary ace2 after binding aggravating the existing experimental pneumonia which was improved by pharmacological renin-angiotensin system block neither this study or any others to our knowledge have demonstrated benefit of renin-angiotensin block in coronavirus infection the transgenic experimental animals overexpressing hace2 mentioned above previously were demonstrated to have increased infectivity and lethality with sar coronavirus 78 augmentation of virus uptake and replication presumably overwhelmed any specific pulmonary benefitshypotheses are made for testing and for the hypothesis that some common drugs induce ace2 overexpression and may be adverse in the covid-19 pandemic this testing is urgently required the most immediate and direct clinical testing should come from interrogating the pandemic databases of china and lombardy from these populations presence of covid-19 illness illness severity and death could be matched against age preexisting medical diagnoses and drugs prescribed at the onset of covid-19 illness the multivariate analyses will not be straightforward there will be a need to differentiate between any effects of ageing effects of diseases with increased prevalence accompanying ageing including hypertension heart failure and diabetes and the possible effects of drugs given to treat these diseaseswhy not test the hypothesis of drug-induced covid-19 risk in experimental animals pretreat the animals with arbs and ace-inhibitors to induced overexpressed ace2 then in a blinded experiment expose the animals to the sars-cov-2 virus but that would not work most mammals do not have sufficient structural similarity in their ace2 protein to human ace2 to be infected by this virus which is now cursing the human mammalit may be difficult to test this hypothesis do we as clinicians just live with it leaving prescribing unchanged in hypertension where there are easier alternative prescribing choices perhaps we can substitute calcium channel blockers and beta-adrenergic blockers for arbs and perhaps ace-inhibitors if a decision to change antihypertensive medication is made for chronic renal disease and heart failure where arbs and ace-inhibitors are specifically protective changes really cannot be recommended on the basis of a hypothesis and simply discontinuing medication is strongly discouraged and is not an option 1some hypotheses in medicine just fade away they are a product of their time have no real importance and no enduring legacy with this hypothesis for many there is plausibility and for all such believers urgency what can be the way forward to prove this hypothesis or refute itthere are no conflicts of interestaccording to five new studies therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers arbs is not associated with an increased risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 or with an increased risk of severe disease or in-hospital death among patients with covid-19 these observations are reassuring after concerns had been raised about the possibility that blockers of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas could predispose individuals to severe covid-19 although the findings from these studies which were published in nejm lancet and jama cardiology should be considered exploratory given that all were observational the findings were consistent across the different patient populations and the different study designsmehra and colleagues used an observational database from 169 hospitals in asia europe and north america to evaluate the association between cardiovascular disease drug therapy and in-hospital death in 8910 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of covid-19 logistic-regression multivariate analyses showed that age 65 years coronary artery disease congestive heart failure cardiac arrhythmia chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and current smoking were independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death conversely use of ace inhibitors or 033 95 ci 020054 or arbs or 123 95 ci 087174 was not associated with a higher risk of in-hospital deathmancia and colleagues conducted a population-based casecontrol study in lombardy italy with 6272 patients with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection and 30759 matched control individuals use of ace inhibitors and arbs was more frequent among patients with covid-19 than among control individuals but conditional logistic-regression multivariate analyses showed no association between these drug classes and the likelihood of sars-cov-2 infection or the severity of covid-19reynolds and colleagues carried out an observational study including data from 12594 patients who had been tested for sars-cov-2 infection in a health network in new york city ny usa bayesian analyses and propensity-score models showed that previous treatment with antihypertensive drugs including ace inhibitors and arbs was not associated with either a higher likelihood of a positive test for sars-cov-2 infection or a higher risk of severe covid-19similar findings were obtained by mehta and colleagues in a cohort of 18472 patients who had been tested for sars-cov-2 infection in the cleveland clinic health system in ohio and florida usa overlap propensity score weighting showed no association between the use of ace inhibitors or arbs and the likelihood of a positive test or 097 95 ci 081115finally de abajo and colleagues conducted a casepopulation study in seven hospitals in madrid spain including 1139 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of covid-19 requiring hospital admission and 11390 matched controls conditional logistic regression analyses showed that the use of raas inhibitors was not associated with a higher risk of covid-19 requiring hospital admission compared with the use of other antihypertensive drugs adjusted or 094 95 ci 077115 of note patients with diabetes mellitus who were taking raas inhibitors had a lower risk of covid-19 requiring hospital admissioninterestingly some findings suggest that ace inhibitors and arbs have different effects in patients with covid-19 although the findings are contradictory mehra and colleagues found that ace inhibitor use as well as statin use was associated with better survival by contrast a secondary exploratory analysis by mehta and colleagues showed a higher risk of hospitalization among patients with sars-cov-2 infection who were taking ace inhibitors or 184 or arbs or 161 however the investigators and the authors of accompanying editorials caution that these associations should be considered with extreme caution because of potential unmeasured confounding given the observational design of the studies and the small number of patients in the secondary exploratory analysisuse of ace inhibitors and arbs is not associated with increased susceptibility to covid-19 and does not have harmful effects in patients with covid-19taken together these studies suggest that the use of ace inhibitors and arbs is not associated with increased susceptibility to covid-19 and does not have harmful effects in patients with covid-19understanding the pathophysiology of the covid-19 pandemic is key to develop strategies for both prevention and treatment to improve clinical outcomes it is known from the previous outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov that cell invasion is accomplished by binding of a viral spike protein to ace21 recent reports show that this is the same for sars-cov-22 3 this binding leads to ace2 downregulation which may contribute to lung injury since less ace2 is available for potential protective effects as shown in acute respiratory distress syndrome ards4
aces are regulatory proteins in both blood pressure and inflammation ace1 the key enzyme in the reninangiotensin aldosterone system raas converts angiotensin i to angiotensin ii which by binding to the angiotensin ii receptor type 1 leads to vasoconstriction resulting in a rise of blood pressure fibrotic and proliferativeinflammatory effects ace1 is targeted for reducing blood pressure by ace inhibitors angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs lead to similar effects by blocking the effects of angiotensin iiace2 degrades angiotensin i to angiotensin-1-9 and angiotensin ii to angiotensin-1-74 this pathway involving the mas receptor is thought to be counteracting the effects of angiotensin ii and is associated with protective effects for heart lungs and kidneys5 however studies targeting this pathway have not led to beneficial effects in cardiovascular and renal diseases including hypertension6 7 in addition to its role in raas modulation ace2 is also involved in degrading several other substrates such as apelin bradykinin and opioids recently involvement in degrading bradykinin has also been suggested as playing a causal role in the development of severe ards since downregulation of ace2 as a consequence of virus binding may enhance the proinflammatory bradykinin receptor leading to local vascular leakage8
the fact that patients with previous cardiovascular disease cvd hypertension and diabetes have an increased mortality risk due to sars-cov-2-induced infection could be explained by the common factor of use of ace inhibitors or arbs9 10 this was suggested by several authors and also reached the mainstream media including cnn11 12 however well-designed studies on the effects of ace inhibitors arbs and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on ace2 expression are scarce show conflicting results and have not been conducted in humans6 1315 this has led to statements from several societies including the european society of cardiology and the european society of hypertension emphasising the lack of evidence and the importance of not withdrawing ace inhibitors and arbs considering their major role in blood pressure lowering nephroprotection and cardiac protection5 in reply to these first rumours other authors including versmissen et al argued that raas inhibition might even be beneficial once infected1618 other authors suggested that arbs might be beneficial while ace inhibitors might not19
based on these theoretical grounds intervention studies either starting or discontinuing ace inhibitors or arbs are currently recruiting patients with covid-19 clinicaltrialsgov however observational data in humans are urgently needed to address the real effect of medication and the clinical course of covid-19 before starting potentially harmful interventions based on only theoretical and conflicting evidence from animal studies therefore the comet study aims to evaluate the relationship between use of certain drugs starting with ace inhibitors and arbs on clinical outcomes of patients with covid-19 the main objective is to describe the correlation between use of ace inhibitors or arbs and clinical outcome defined by admission to the hospital duration of stay intensive care unit icu admission and survival in patients with confirmed covid-19 secondary aims are to address the effect of other drugs such as immunomodulatory agents including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroidsto allow urgent analysis data entry will be undertaken in two phases for quick data entry the number of collected parameters will be minimised and with a special focus on medication the following subject parameters will be collected for all patients year of birth sex international classification of primary careinternational classification of diseases 10th revision medical history

the use of ace inhibitorsarbs in the dutch patients with the general dutch population of similar age age group of 10 years stichting farmaceutische kengetallen foundation pharmaceutical key numbers in addition use of other blood pressure-lowering agents and other drug classes such as lipid-lowering drugs will be compared between patients with most severe outcomes and no hospital admission or a short stay 48 hoursthe medical ethical committee of erasmus mc and brabant concluded this research does not fall under the scope of the medical research involving human subjects act non-wmo because of its retrospective nature and full anonymisation investigators from each hospital will fill in anonymised data sex and birth year and all will sign a data transfer agreement each patient will be assigned a study number known only by the investigator who will keep a coding list in the own hospital each hospital can only see their own patients in the system data will be collected in a database digitalisnl on an external server and then stored using open clinica all data will be treated according to the privacy regulations applicable for europe and the erasmus mc privacy regulations collected data will be secured against unauthorised access and will be stored and secured by the department of hospital pharmacy no data that can identify a patient will be processed on this database to protect and respect the privacy of all patients the main research team including the principal investigator can see all anonymised data the main article will be submitted to a general medicine journal follow-up articles focusing more deeply on certain drug classes might be submitted to pharmacological journals or journals in the specific area of disease for instance cardiovascularcurrently clinical trials targeting ace2 raas and the bradykinin pathway are initiated while the evidence that this might be beneficial is still weak the results of this study may contribute to more rational choices for randomised controlled trials in addition when any negative effect of use of ace inhibitors or arbs is identified changing medication might be an easy intervention to reduce morbidity and mortality from covid-19 for instance ace inhibitors and arbs are used by over 10 of the dutch population gipdatabanknl almost half of these users are aged above 70 yearsthe most serious limitation of this study is the selection bias especially when ed registration of unhospitalised patients is incomplete however for comparing ace inhibitors and arbs the indications are similar preventing a bias by indication in addition other antihypertensive drugs and lipid-lowering drugs will be analysed due to the urgency of need of this data time to enter clinical data will be limited potentially leading to incomplete data especially the medical history however by using detailed medication data this can largely correct for incomplete medical history datawe read with great interest the original investigation by zhang et al1 and the accompanying editorial by shah et al2 the study question is urgent and important given the potential relationships among ace angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or arb angiotensin receptor blocker use ace2 expressionactivity and coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 severity35 we appreciate that the authors appropriately tempered their interpretation of the results based on several limitations noted in their publication and the accompanying editorial nonetheless we are concerned that many readers may still overinterpret the impressive hazard ratios notably exposure assignments were based only on antihypertensive medications administered at any point during hospitalization patients had to survive long enough or be clinically stable enough to achieve the exposure ie ace inhibitorsarb use this time-dependent bias or immortal time bias underestimates the hazard of the exposure group6 which may result in a false or exaggerated apparent protective effect of ace inhibitorsarbs also fewer patients were on ace inhibitorsarbs than expected 17 versus 3040 prevalent use78 suggesting substantial unmeasured confounding and nonsystematic exposure ascertainment sicker patients will almost invariably be less likely to receive ace inhibitorsarbs during hospitalization these limitations may explain contradictory results in observational us veteran data which did not show an association between baseline ace inhibitorsarb use and need for intensive care in patients with covid-19 unadjusted odds ratio 194 95 ci 130290 and adjusted odds ratio 166 95 ci 0942939based on several clinical and mechanistic considerations we believe that there is equipoise regarding potential benefit or harm from ace inhibitorsarb use in patients at risk for or who have covid-1934 the current study reinforces the urgent need for randomized controlled trial evidence to address this important issue2 we are currently conducting an international

microsoft fukuda-denshi and bristol myers squibb the other authors report no conflictscoronaviruses are single-stranded positive-sense rna viruses belonging to the nidovirales order and have been divided into four broad groups ie alpha beta gamma delta based initially on serology and later by phylogenetic clustering 1 to date seven human coronaviruses restricted to the alpha and beta subgroups have been identified with the first infection reported in 1967 and thought to be associated with mild self-limited respiratory illness 2 more recently coronaviruses have been involved in 1530 of upper respiratory tract infections annually with more severe clinical courses in neonates older individuals and immunosuppressed patients in 2002 an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in guangdong china was traced to sars-cov a new beta-coronavirus during this outbreak nearly 8100 patients were diagnosed with an overall mortality of 9 which increased to 50 in patients over 60 years of age 3 the disease was thought to have originated from infected bats and was easily contained as transmission appeared to require direct contact with infected individuals a distinct group 2c b-coronavirus genetically related to bat coronaviruses was responsible for another outbreak in saudi arabia in 2012 and the disease was termed middle east respiratory syndrome mers this virus was associated with an initial 50 mortality but did not spread appreciably outside the region 4 an outbreak of an unknown respiratory illness in wuhan china was reported in late december of 2019 and the causative agent was identified as sars coronavirus sars-cov-2 and the disease was called coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 5 the disease has rapidly become a global pandemic and a major priority has been placed on finding drugs that prevent or limit viral propagation and infectioncoronaviruses share a large genome around 30 kb express large replicase genes encoding non-structural proteins involving approximately 20 kb of the genome undergo early transcription of the replicase gene contain a viral envelope and utilize ribosomal frameshifting for non-structural gene expression 6 the viral genome is composed of a 5-cap structure with a leader sequence and untranslated region utr composed of multiple stem loop structures needed for rna replication 7 the 3-end contains an utr that has rna structures necessary for viral rna synthesis as well as a 3-polya tail that mimics mrna allowing translation of replicase-encoded non-structural proteins transcriptional regulatory sequences trss are found at the 5-end of most structural and accessory genes with most accessory genes being non-essential but modulating viral pathogenesis 8 there are four main structural proteins termed spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n the s protein is about 150 kd and is responsible for the spike on the viral surface and trimeric s protein is used for viral attachment to cell entry receptors 9the life cycle of human coronaviruses begins with viral attachment via the s protein to cell entry receptors typically peptidases the sars-cov virus uses the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 as the main cellular receptor with the membrane serine protease tmprss2 acting as an accessory protein to stabilize cell entry and cleavage of the s protein following viral fusion with the cell membrane 10 11 the virus enters and replicates within the cytoplasm starting with translation of the replicase gene and assembly of a viral replicase complex 12 the complex and non-structural genes act to inhibit host cell translation while promoting host mrna degradation and enhancing viral rna synthesis and replication 12 the process results in genomic and subgenomic rna generated via negative-strand intermediates and the s e and m structural proteins enter the endoplasmic reticulum er and move into the er-golgi intermediate compartment where viral genomic progeny are encapsidated by the n protein 13 after assembly virions are transported to the cell surface and released by exocytosis in some coronaviruses excess s protein can mediate cell fusion with neighboring cells a process that may allow rapid viral transmission without detection by the host humoral immune response 14to accelerate pharma rd across targets and disease areas immuneering developed disease cancelling technology dct to identify targets and drugs reversing disease gene expression and fluency a computational platform for large scale high throughput in silico screening dct quantifies similarity of genome-wide signatures of disease to signatures of drug induced gene expression changes using cosine similarity uniquely relative to other methods dct quantifies the per-gene contribution to overall disease amplification or cancellation and is not biased to any specific targets or pathways fluency predicts quantitative binding affinity purely from sequence unlike other methods fluency is a single universal quantitative structureactivity relationship qsar model able to accept any molecule and protein sequence as input when trained on the over 2 million ic50 values from chembl fluency achieves near experimental level binding prediction accuracy as well generating predictions on the binding site we applied these platforms to determine if repurposing of existing drugs may be helpful in covid-19 infection by 1 assessing established drugs for binding to ace2 and tmprss2 two proteins used by the virus to enter cells and 2 scanning fda approved compounds for transcriptomic disease cancellation of coronavirus associated gene expression changesgiven that the covid-19 virus uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 as the main cellular receptor to enter the cell we ran two fluency models with ace2 as the target input two different fluency models model a and model b were run to predict binding of ace2 to all chemicals in the selleckchem fda approved drug library initial ranking by performance in model a is shown in table 1 which included multiple known ace inhibitors scoring well enalaprilat ramipril lisinopril monopril captopril out of these drugs enalaprilat has the best binding score from model a given reports of the possibility of ace2 induction being driven by ace1 inhibition 15 and multiple subsequent reports hinting at benefit from ace inhibition 1619 we were interested to observe ace2 specificity in comparison to ace1 for top hits the binding of ace2 and ace1 was compared by calculating the difference in predicted binding ace2 binding minus ace1 binding using two fluency models table 1 according to model a brigatinib tirofiban hydrochloride and aleuritic acid are top ranked by pbind and brigatinib is also highest ranked by model a as specific for ace2 over ace1 glutathione was ranked in 7th place by model a for being more specific to ace2 over ace1 next a consensus ranking using the results of both models a and b was used to select top ace2 binders table 2 enalaprilat tirofiban hydrochloride and sotagliflozin showed balanced performance in both models in order to assess specificity fluency was run on top hits in reverse predicting binding of a small molecule to the human proteome by this metric ramipril piperacillin sodium and captopril had high ranking for ace2 table 2 the worst score by far of top hits considered was r-406to explore other potential covid-19 associated hits we ran both fluency models with tmprss2 as the target on the selleckchem fda approved drug library and ranked hits based on performance in model a ombitasvir elbasvir and capecitabine are the top predicted binding hits for tmprss2 and cefotiam hexetil hydrochloride and bictegravir are top 10 predicted hits by both models table 3 interestingly chloroquine diphosphate was predicted by model b to bind ace2 with a pbind of 78 ranked 290 out of the fda approved drugs for predicted binding and tmprss2 with a pbind of 75 ranked 210 while hydroxychloroquine sulfate was predicted by model b to bind ace2 with a pbind of 79 rank 261 and tmprss2 with a pbind of 722 rank 307 results not shownin order to confirm or deny findings from fluency we applied a disease cancelling technology approach searching for fda approved drugs which reverse coronavirus associated gene expression changes unlike fluency dct was applied in a target and pathway agnostic way capturing the full gene expression change in a data driven way publicly available gene expression data were downloaded from geo gse68820 healthy mice c57bl6nj were infected with ma15 mouse version of sars-cov 20 lung tissue was collected for gene expression analysis a robust differential expression signal was detected between infected and uninfected mice at day 2 fig 1a top differentially expressed genes included irf7 ifnb1 apod ifit3 lgals9 tor3a and usp18 multiple relevant pathways come up as significant adjpval  3e05 when performing gsea-pre-ranked analysis including influenza viral rna transcription and replication lymphocyte network interferon signaling jak stat signaling and graft vs host disease this disease signature was applied to immuneerings disease cancelling technology to identify drugs which could potentially cancel out ma15 associated gene expression out of the 26288 drugs tested glutamine ranked 6th with a dct cancellation score of  00556337 with an adjusted p value  1e05 table 4 genes changing in the opposite direction between ma15 infection and glutamine treatment are plotted in fig 1b interestingly glutamine is a precursor to glutathione which was ranked highly in fluency results table 1 thus two orthogonal approaches neural networks and cosine distance used on two different data types binding prediction and gene expression both arrived at the same potential hit glutamineglutathionefirst we utilized an unbiased ai-based systems algorithm to interrogate 2657 fda approved or repurposing drugs for binding to ace2 the main sars-cov-2 human cell entry receptor the rapid analysis of repurposing approved drugs for new indications allows for immediate access to potential agents that could be used for urgent emerging diseases such as covid-19 the ability to identify such drugs requires additional biologic validation through in vitro studies confirming receptor blockade and inhibition of sars-cov-2 cell entry and replication and in vivo ideally through randomized controlled clinical trials during a global pandemic however time may not allow for usual drug development processes and repurposing of commonly available drugs may be critical indeed anecdotal reports of hydroxychloroquine azithromycin and anti-il6 therapies have received attention 21 22 while hydroxychloroquine was predicted to bind to ace2 by model b supporting the anecdotal reports we did not detect azithromycin or anti-il-6 agents as these would not be anticipated to mediate therapeutic activity through ace2 modulation further validation will be needed to determine if unbiased ai-based systems approaches are superior to anecdotal observationsin the binding prediction analysis multiple known drugs were identified as potential ace2 inhibitors table 1 not surprisingly twelve were ace inhibitors this adds some confirmation that the unbiased selection accurately identified drugs with high likelihood of receptor binding ace inhibitors are agents commonly used for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure this family of drugs are based on various peptide compositions and were initially selected for binding to ace1 which catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin i to angiotensin ii thereby blocking the renin-angiotensin system ras lowering systemic blood pressure increasing sodium excretion and increased renal water output ace inhibitors are not known to bind to ace2 which lacks the carboxypeptidase activity of ace1 but does contain a zinc-binding domain exhibits metallopeptidase activity and shares approximately 40 homology with ace1 23 24 our model selected for preferential ace2 binding and agents with better predicted binding values were prioritized see table 1 early studies largely used angiotensin catalysis as the major readout for inhibition and whether current ace inhibitors may block sars-cov-2 binding remains speculative 25 in addition due to the counter regulatory nature of ace1 and ace2 expression it is possible that agents that downregulate ace1 receptors may increase ace2 receptor expression and could worsen coronavirus infection thus we scanned for binding of both ace1 and ace2 for top hits and ranked by predicted difference in binding by this metric captopril enalaprilat and monopril looked likely to inhibit both and potentially solicit this undesired feedback effect table 1 ramipril is a long-acting ace inhibitor prodrug that is converted to the active metabolite ramiprilat in the liver and may be associated with hepatic injury likewise monopril is a pro-drug that undergoes transformation in the liver to the active metabolite fosinoprilat in contrast lisinopril is an orally active ace inhibitor that does not undergo metabolic transformation and is excreted in the urine and does not bind to other serum proteins but may also be associated with hepatic toxicity and these drugs need to be used cautiously in patients with underlying liver disease captopril is a sulfhydryl-containing proline analog with potent and specific activity in blocking ace peptidyl-dipeptidase activity captopril may also have anti-tumor activity through inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and promotion of anti-tumor immunity 26the analysis also identified a drug involved in glucose homeostasis and used in patients with diabetes mellitus as anti-hyperglycemic agents nateglinide table 1 is a derivative of phenylalanine and acts on beta-islet pancreatic cells atp-sensitive potassium channels and stimulates insulin secretion 27 the drug has been used for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus sotaglifozin table 2 is an oral inhibitor of the sodium-glucose co-transporter subtype 1 sglt1 expressed in the gastrointestinal gi tract and sglt2 expressed in the kidneys 28 to our knowledge this agent have not been previously known to bind to ace or ace2 glutathione is another interesting agent that was predicted by both binding ai and gene expression disease cancellation it is an antioxidant demonstrating improved airway clearance and pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis 29 glutathione has also been evaluated as an adjunct in patients receiving certain chemotherapy agents following lung transplantation and for management of hiv and parkinsons disease with mixed results 30fostamatinib r-406 table 2 is an oral inhibitor of the spleen tyrosine kinase syk that is converted to the active metabolite tamatinib and has been approved for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura and is being evaluated in other autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis 31 r-406 may also mediate signal transduction downstream of classical immunoreceptors including the b-cell receptor explaining why it may be useful in treating autoimmune diseases and b cell hematologic malignancies 32 emricasan table 2 also called idn-6556 is a thiol protease that acts as a caspase-3 inhibitor that received orphan g status by the us fda for treatment of liver disease such as chronic hepatitis c where it functions to protect against excessive hepatic cell apoptosis emricasan has been shown to decrease hepatic aminotransferases in patients with hepatitis c and other viral-induced and non-viral liver diseases 33 the drug has also shown activity against zika virus-mediated caspase 3 induction and blocked viral infection of neural cells in vitro 34 the potential antiviral activity of emricasan was identified in a drug repurposing screen following the zika virus outbreak in 2016 34 fosamprenavir was identified table 2 and is a protease inhibitor prodrug of amprenavir an anti-retroviral drug approved for the treatment of hiv disease agents with known antiviral activity against rna viruses are especially interesting for evaluation against coronavirusesorlistat table 2 is a carboxyl ester and reversible inhibitor of gi lipases 35 orlistat was initially isolated from streptomyces toxytricini a gram-positive bacterium and blocks hydrolysis and absorption of dietary fats and was approved in the us and uk for the treatment of obesity two of the drugs identified have activity as anticoagulants tirofiban hydrochloride table 1 and argatroban table 2 tirofiban is a non-peptide tyrosine derivative and functions as an antagonist of the purinergic receptor platelet glycoprotein-iibiia 36 the drug inhibits platelet aggregation and has been used for treating acute coronary syndrome and is being studied for management of ischemic stroke 37 in contrast argatroban is a small molecule that directly inhibits thrombin and is used for management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia 38 piperacillin table 2 is a broad spectrum semi-synthetic beta-lactam ureidopenicillin antibiotic derived from ampicillin piperacillin is active against gram-negative bacteria and was initially used for treating pseudomonas aeruginosa infections and later as part of combination antibiotics for more complex infectious indications 39 in contrast to macrolide antibiotics such as azithromycin which inhibit bacterial protein synthesis piperacillin blocks bacterial wall synthesis since these are commonly used agents in the management of patients with pneumonia they both merit further studies to understand their role in ace2 modulation and potential role in management of covid-19 infectionto search for potential covid-19 therapeutic approaches in an orthogonal and unbiased way we applied our disease cancellation technology to gene expression data from an animal model of sars-cov and ranked compounds by their ability to induce gene expression signals that counteract disease-associated signals by this gene expression method glutamine was a top hit for reversing coronavirus associated changes in gene expression glutathione was highly ranked by fluency for ace2 binding and its precursor glutamine was highly ranked by gene expression dct suggesting both deserve further testing to explore potential benefits against sars-cov-2 both glutamine and glutathione have previously demonstrated antiviral activity against herpes virus hsv infections 40in summary we used a novel ai-based systems approach to identify potential drugs currently available that are predicted to bind to ace 2 these agents are readily available and could be rapidly assessed both in the laboratory and clinic for activity against sars-cov-2 infection and clinical course of covid-19 disease further studies of these agents may provide new clinical strategies for patients with coronavirus diseases under normal circumstances we would conduct experimental validation prior to submitting this report for publication given the current public health emergency we are publishing this work now in the event that others are set up to more quickly validate assess and build upon these findings although validation is still needed this report highlights how ai-based systems may be utilized to rapidly identify drugs for repurposing against new and emerging human

epidemiological criteria infection in more than 100000 people in 100 countries 1 as of march 27 2020 world has witnessed more than half a million cases of covid-19 with more than 24000 deaths 2 this suggests the magnitude of its spread across the world since it was first reported on december 31 2019 from wuhan hubei province in china emerging data suggests that older covid-19 patients with other comorbid conditions such as diabetes hypertension cardiac and pulmonary disease are in particular more susceptible compared to general populations and have higher mortality therefore it is necessary to re-look into these subgroups of covid-19 patients with associated co-morbiditiesin this review article we have collated all the available evidence that has emerged so far on outcomes and comorbidities in patients with covid-19 here we have focused on outcomes in patients of covid-19 with hypertension and analyzed the controversies surrounding the use of renin-angiotensin system blockers rasbwe have systematically searched the pubmed medical database up till march 27 2020 using mesh key words that include covid-19 coronavirus hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disease angiotensin receptor blockers angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors we have retrieved all the available literature published in english language on covid-19 that reported the outcomes in different co-morbiditiesthe association of hypertension and diabetes in patients with covid-19 is not unexpected given the rising prevalence of both of these chronic diseases globally interestingly in the pooled data from the ten chinese studies n  2209 that have reported the characteristics of comorbidities in patients with covid-19 associations of hypertension diabetes and presence of established

 established cvd was also present in nearly 43 in italian study of 355 patients with covid-19 table summarizes the prevalence of these comorbidities in all available studies to-date in patients with covid-19 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14while consistent association of hypertension in patients with covid-19 across all these studies is unique the concern which needs a serious attention is the increase in mortality two chinese studies have worked in this direction to-date in 191 patients with covid-19 zhou et al found hypertension to have an odds ratio or of 305 95 ci 157 to 592 p  0006 diabetes with or of 285 95 ci 135 to 605 p  0001 whereas presence of coronary artery disease had an or of 2140 95 ci 464 to 9876 p  00001 for in-hospital mortality in an univariate analysis 8 however the association between these disorders and covid-19 mortality were no longer significant after a multivariate regression analysis similarly in an analysis of 201 patients with covid-19 wu et al found hypertension to have a hazard ratio hr of 182 95 ci 113 to 295 p  001 for acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and 170 95 ci 092 to 314 p  009 for death the diabetic patients had a hr of 234 95 ci 135 to 405 p  0002 for ards and hr of 158 95 ci 080 to 313 p  019 for death in a bivariate cox regression analysis 11 it should be noted however that neither of these studies were adjusted for all confounding variables nevertheless a study of 187 patients with covid-19 guo et al reported nearly a twice increase in mortality in patients with established cvd and raised troponin t tnt compared to patients without cvd and raised tnt 694 vs 375 respectively 14the chinese center for disease control and prevention in a summary report of covid-19 reported a case fatality rate cfr of 23 1023 deaths among 44672 confirmed cases however cfr was elevated to 60 for hypertension 73 for diabetes and 105 for presence of cvd 15 unsurprisingly based on the above findings researchers have recently proposed that the course of treatment and prognosis of covid-19 should be stratified based on the absence or presence of co-morbidities in to type a b and c type a denotes covid-19 patients with pneumonia but without comorbidities type b denotes covid-19 pneumonia and comorbidities whereas type c denotes covid-19 patients with multi-organ dysfunction 16nonetheless it still remains unclear whether these increased association of hypertension with covid-19 and heightened risk of mortality is directly related to hypertension or other associated comorbidities or anti-hypertensive treatment there has been a growing concern that this association with hypertension and or cvd may be confounded by the treatment with certain antihypertensive medications such as rasb although a recent paper has proposed to stop rasb and suggested to replace it with the calcium channel blocker while treating hypertension in patients with covid-19 17 this hypothesis has been questioned by several other colleagues 18 19 20 21 22the entry of coronavirus into the cell is facilitated by the spike s protein before attachment to the receptor on host cell the s protein needs to be primed by a serine protease named tmprss2 the s proteins of different coronaviruses may utilise different receptors mers utilises cd26 while sars cov and sars cov2 utilise angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ace-2 23 the efficiency of the interaction between s-protein and ace-2 may be a key determinant of the transmissibility of the virus viral replication and the severity of disease in theory this efficiency could be influenced by changes or amino acid substitutions in either the viral s-protein or the ace-2 receptor on host cella
changes in s-protein molecular studies and the elucidation of the atomic and crystal structure of ace-2s protein interface of sars cov have provided important insights 24 the major outbreak of sars cov occurred in 20022003 with a minor localised outbreak with mild symptoms in 20032004 it was observed that the s-protein of sars cov in the 20022003 outbreak bound to ace-2 receptor much more efficiently than that of sars cov in the 20032004 outbreak consistent with the absence of human-to-human transmission during the latter outbreak several molecular changes in the s-protein influence the binding with human ace-2 for example the substitution of threonine by serine at position 487 in s protein reduces the binding 25 similarly asparagine at position 479 increased the binding affinity 26 methylation at position 487 has also been shown to influence binding recently s-protein of sars cov2 has been shown to be similar to that of sars cov barring a few gains of function mutations the most important of these is a glutamine at position 493 at the receptor binding domain which explains its increased transmissibility compared to sars cov 27b
changes in ace-2 receptor with regard to mers-cov which employs cd26 dpp-4 as its receptor for cellular entry there are naturally-occurring polymorphisms in dpp4 that impact cellular entry of mers-cov and might thus modulate mers development in infected patients 28 there is a possibility that similar variations or polymorphisms in ace-2 could affect the viral entry and disease course polymorphisms of ace-2 gene have been identified however there is no evidence that they affect susceptibility to or severity of sars cov2 infection 29 a recent study found differential ace-2 gene expression in human lung tissue with no racialgender differences but a higher gene expression in lungs of smokers compared to non-smokers which could explain the higher risk of infection in smokers 30
the role of ace-2 on vascular bed is opposite to that of angiotensin converting enzyme ace ace converts angiotensin i to angiotensin ii which is a vasoconstrictor ace-2 converts angiotensin ii to angiotensin 17 which causes vasodilatation after binding to the mas receptor in the vascular bed 31 downregulation of ace-2 was observed in animal models of lung injury induced by sars cov 32 recombinant ace-2 improved pulmonary blood flow and oxygenation in animals with lung injury indicating that ace-2 may be the main determinant of lung injury caused by sars cov 33 however there is lack of human data except a small study in 10 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome which showed that recombinant ace-2 was well tolerated and led to an increase in angiotensin 17 34there has been considerable interest regarding the role of ras blockers in covid-19 infection both benefit and harm have been postulated figure 1 illustrates the interactions between the effect of rasb and covid-19 fig 1
a
rationale and evidence for harm there is evidence that ace-2 expression increases with the use of ace inhibitors and arb especially in heart and kidney 3536 this has raised a theoretical concern that by increasing ace-2 expression aceis and arbs could facilitate the entry of virus into the host cell and increase the chances of infection or its severity 17 also there is increased ace-2 expression in elderly 37 to what extent this predisposes the elderly to infection with sarscov2 is not known in a study of 187 patients with covid-19 guo et al reported an increased trend in mortality with those receiving rasb compared to those not receiving mortality was 368 6 of 19 and 256 43 of 168 in patients with or without rasb respectively 14 indeed increased association and heightened mortality with covid-19 have been observed consistently across the studies in elderly hypertensive diabetics and known cvd however it is not exactly known whether it has any causal relation with the use of rasb or these subgroups are more on rasb due to these illness compared to the rest of population moreover there is no solid evidence to back this concern either in covid-19 or in infection by other coronavirusesb
rationale and evidence for benefit as discussed above increasing ace-2 levels in coronavirus infection could reduce lung injury in an experimental study with mice kuba et al found that losartan showed significantly diminished lung injury and pulmonary edema after acid aspiration-induced acute lung injury with addition of sars-cov spike protein compared to placebo 32 similarly severe lung injury and pulmonary edema were prevented by both recombinant human ace-2 infusions or losartan in ace2-knockout mice 38 mice with coronavirus induced lung injury showed improvement when treated with losartan 39 moreover a retrospective analysis found reduced rates of death and endotracheal intubation in patients with viral pneumonia who were continued on ace inhibitors 40 treatment with arbs was reported to reduce mortality in ebola virus infection 41 the exact mechanism of apparent benefit of these drugs in coronavirus infection is not yet clear however there could be several explanations 42iincreased ace-2 expression may not result in more viral entry into the cell because of the limited availability of the serine protease tmprss2 camostat mesylate which is a tmprss2 inhibitor has been shown to inhibit cellular entry of sars cov2 and could be a potential therapeutic option 43iiincreased ace-2 expression on the cell membrane may also lead to increased soluble ace-2 in blood which may actually bind to most of sars cov2 and prevent its interaction with the membrane bound receptoriiiras blockers increase angiotensin ii which is a substrate for ace-2 the interaction of ace-2 with angiotensin ii could induce a conformational change in the receptor binding domain of ace-2 limiting its ability to bind with sars cov2 44ivace-2 receptors are present at a much higher density in lung tissue of children and young adults compared to older individuals thus the upregulation of ace-2 receptors by the use of rasb over time in older people may emulate ace expression in young people it is also possible that having more ace-2 receptors and increased ace-2 functions will likely produce more angiotensin 17 that might provide resilience against target-mediated destruction and development of pulmonary failure in patients with covid-19 22 this postulated positive effects on lung can be also protective during overwhelming infection with covid-19vindiscriminate discontinuation of rasb in patients with heart failure may also lead to readmission to hospital and increase in mortality 45
collectively relationship between ras activity and use of rasb in sars cov2 infection is very scarce the only indirect evidence of ras activation in covid-19 is high incidence of hypokalaemia 46 with regards to the use of rasb a retrospective analysis of 112 covid-19 hospitalised patients with cardiovascular disease in wuhan there was no significant difference in the proportion of aceiarb medication between non-survivors and survivors 47 however a study of 187 patient reported by guo et al there was a trend of increase in mortality in patients with covid-19 receiving rasb 368 compared to those not receiving 256 14covid-19 is increasingly associated with comorbidities that include hypertension and diabetes special care is required in patients with covid-19 with associated comorbidities given the heightened risk of in-hospital deathin view of lack of robust evidence for either benefit or harm and with bulk of the experimental evidence in favour of benefit it is reasonable for patients to continue using ace inhibitors and arb as recommended by the european society of cardiology hypertension canada the canadian cardiovascular society uk renal association the international society of hypertension and european society of hypertension and american heart association 48 49 50 future studies reporting the outcome stratified on the basis of different anti-hypertensive agents in covid-19 may further enlighten us in this regardwe hereby declare that we have no conflict of interest related to this articlehypertension a long-term medical condition known as high blood pressure is a major risk factor for vision loss stroke heart failure and chronic kidney disease and more than a quarter of the worlds adult population in 2000 had hypertension 1 therapeutic approaches have focused on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas which regulates blood pressure and electrolyte balance in humans 2 in the raas renin stimulates the generation of angiotensin i angi which is converted to vasoconstrictor angiotensin ii angii by angiotensin i converting enzyme ace two isoforms somatic and testicular of ace are transcribed by ace gene in a tissue-specific manner the somatic form sace is a zinc dependent dicarboxypeptidase which includes two homologous domains n domain and c domain with 60 sequence identity and the same zinc motif hexxh x  any amino acid residue 34 for the past decades it has been reported that the c domain of human sace has the main angi converting site in controlling blood pressure and cardiovascular functions 5 ace hydrolyzes decapeptide asp-arg-val-tyr-ile-his-pro-phe-his-leu angi by cleaving a dipeptide from the c-terminus to produce octapeptide asp-arg-val-tyr-ile-his-pro-phe angii which causes blood vessels to narrow and stimulates the secretion of the hormone aldosterone resulting in increased blood pressure 67 ace also affects blood pressure by inactivating the vasodilators bradykinin and kallidin 8 therefore ace has long been a major target for the treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular ailments by the use of ace inhibitors 9common synthetic ace inhibitors such as captopril enalapril alacepril and lisinopril have been on the market for decades 10 however it has been reported for them to have diverse side effects including hyperkalemia and skin rashes 11 impairment of renal function 12 and development of angioedema 13 therefore peptides from natural sources were considered as alternative ace inhibitors and attracted researchers interest 1415161718 the structures of ace complexes with various ligands including synthetic inhibitors and peptides are available in the protein data bank pdbthe crystal structures of ace have been determined with high resolution which give us the overall insight of the structural molecular arrangement and their active sites 19202122 a crystal structure which is a time and ensemble averaged snapshot do not complete our understanding proteins are not rigid they are flexible and dynamic in solution fluctuating among many conformational sub-states 23 in addition to its structure knowledge of the dynamics of an enzyme and understanding the mechanisms of activation and inhibition is crucial for the design of better drugs 24 molecular dynamics md simulations are known as a powerful tool for molecular modeling and investigating dynamics of proteins and have been applied to various systems successfully 25 recently md simulations of ace with various ligands were reported for drug discovery and molecular modeling for interactions between the enzyme and potential inhibitors 1415161826in order to explore the ligand binding effects on the dynamics and the mechanisms of activation and inhibition all-atom md simulations of sace were carried out with and without ligands the simulations focus on the c domain in which the angi is mainly converted 5 in the ligand-free simulation apo we observed the mouth opening and closing motions of sace like the pac-man of an arcade game in 1980s 27 this large hinge bending motion implies the existence of pre-existing backbone conformations figure 1 shows the overall structure of the enzyme the secondary structure of the sace is predominantly alpha helical figure 1 the structure has an elliptical shape with dimensions approximately 73  59  52 3 and the cleft around the active site expands about 31  pdb id 4aph the cleft divides the sace into two subdomains and the active site is located on the both of their inner surfaces two subdomains of sace were defined as subdomain i including the n-terminus and the zinc ion residues asp40-leu122 pro297-gly437 asp551-gly583 and subdomain ii including the c-terminus residues glu123-ala296 gly438-cys550 gln584-ser625 two kinds of inhibitors bppb bradykinin potentiating peptide b glu-gly-leu-pro-pro-arg-pro-lys-ile-pro-pro 17 and spi spirulina derived heptapeptide thr-met-glu-pro-gly-lys-pro 18 as competitive and mixed non-competitive respectively were used to investigate the difference in the inhibition mechanisms mixed type non-competitive inhibition mode of spi was determined by lineweaverburk plot and a model of inhibition mechanism was studied by the previous study 18a simulation of ligand-free sace apo was initiated from the coordinates after removing the bound angii from the sace-angii complex pdb id 4aph 19 like all others the structure of the complex was also in the closed state defined by the distance between two lips figure 1 shorter than 15  1364  as simulation time went by the enzyme spontaneously opened its mouth and the mouth gradually reclosed from the open state before returning back to the semi-open and open states we defined the open state with a distance longer than 20  and the semi-open state with distances longer than 15  and shorter than 20  we observed multiple conversion between the open and closed states during 400 ns simulation figure 2 we believe that this is the first work that shows the spontaneous opening and closing motions of ace by md simulation video s1 in 2019 yu et al ran an md simulation with ligand-free ace only for 10 ns but they did not report the opening and closing motions 14in order to analyze the mouth opening and closing motion we defined two lips and calculated the distance between the centers of each lip c atoms throughout production stage of the simulations figure 2 two lips of the mouth were defined as lip i in the subdomain i composed of residues ile73-arg100 pro297-ala304 arg348-ala354 cys370-val379 and lip ii in the subdomain ii composed of residues pro128-thr150 gln160-arg173 ser284-phe293 angii bound sace was quite stable over the 400 ns simulation time and no large backbone conformational change was observed unlike the apo form in the absence of a ligand the enzyme mainly stayed in the closed and the semi-open states throughout the entire simulation figure s1in order to investigate the flexibility of the enzyme root-mean-square deviation rmsd of the apo form and the angii bound form were computed figure 3 as we expected the rmsds showed the strong correlation with the distances between two lips due to the mouth opening motions the conformation of the apo form deviated far away from the initial structure which is in the closed conformation reaching nearly 5  of the rmsd value however the rmsd values of angii bound form were fluctuated less than 3  as compared to the unbound form the ligand bound form was relatively stablec root-mean-square fluctuation rmsf of each form was calculated using the production stage of the md simulation trajectories figure 3 the analysis indicates that the subdomain i is more flexible than subdomain ii for both simulations interestingly the overall flexibility of the subdomain ii didnt change much regardless of the presence of angii the most significant difference between the two simulations was the large increment of flexibility on the subdomain i for the apo form notice that the subdomain closure movement in proteins is regarded as a common mechanism for the rearrangement of critical groups around substrates and inhibitors 28there is no structural report for the open conformation of human ace yet the angiotensin converting enzyme-related carboxypeptidase ace2 is a homologue of the human sace ace2 was also identified as the cellular receptor for the sars coronavirus and novel coronavirus in 2019 covid-19 2930 the catalytic domains of ace2 and sace share 42 sequence identity 31 the crystal structures of ace2 with and without its inhibitor were reported first in 2004 pdb id 1r4l 1r42 the open conformation was observed in the absence of the inhibitor while the inhibitor bound one showed the closed conformation based on the two structures the authors proposed a large hinge-bending motion is important for catalytic activity and inhibitor binding of ace too 32we superimposed the closed and the open conformations of ace and compared with those of ace2 and the comparison revealed tremendous similarity between two systems figure s2 in addition the distance between two lips was calculated for ace2 based on the sequence alignment of ace2 and sace two lips of ace2 were identified as lip i composed of the residues 5481 289296 340346 361370 of subdomain i and lip ii composed of the residues 109131 143156 267276 of subdomain ii the distances between lip i and lip ii were computed as 1332  and 2064  for the closed and open states respectively this result is consistent with the distance analysis of sace figure 2 in order to test robustness of definition of backbone conformational states we also calculated the mouth open angles and the results showed the similar pattern as distances figure s3 based on our calculations the maximal hinge-bending movement was 18 which is close to the value 16 measured in ace2 structures 32bppb is a competitive inhibitor isolated from snake venom 17 a crystal structure shows the active site of sace occupied by the octapeptide bppb and the closed conformational state of the complex pdb id 4apj 19 we set up another system with bppb bound sace and carried out a 400 ns md simulation angii is not only the product of catalytic function of ace but also considered as competitive inhibitor before leaving the active site another substrate angi cannot bind to the site for the next reactionthe bppb bound sace simulation showed the similar behavior with the angii bound one figure s1 we analyzed the distance between two lips of the mouth showing conformational changes from the closed to the semi-open states and back to the closed state again figure 4a bppb bound ace was more flexible and the angii bound one made the mouth closed more tightly the number of hydrogen bonds between the ligands and the enzyme was calculated over the simulation time figure s4 the average numbers were 652  215 and 605  164 for angii and bppb respectively table 1 this indicated that the opening and closing motions were affected by the interactions between the ligand with the enzymein addition to competitive inhibition non-competitive inhibition is also a common inhibition mechanism non-competitive inhibition includes pure and mixed noncompetitive inhibition surprisingly for us mechanism of mixed type non-competitive inhibition for ace has not been studied intensively so far in the previous study a heptapeptide thr-met-glu-pro-gly-lys-pro derived from a marine microalgae spirulina was identified as a mixed non-competitive inhibitor spi 18 we investigated the interactions and dynamics of ace bound with the mixed non-competitive inhibitor further md simulations were conducted for the spi bound to the apo form and the spi bound to the angii-sace complex formthe simulation of spi bound to sace was started with the structure after the removing angii from spi bound to angii-sace complex which is the result of the spi docking simulation of the previous study 18 the analysis of distance between two lips of the spi bound sace showed backbone conformational fluctuation between the closed and semi-open states but we were not able to see the open conformational state figure 4b in other words the spontaneous conformational changes were limited and only the closed and semi-open states were stabilized by spi video s2 the peptide spi formed 586  142 hydrogen bonds with sace averaged over the production stage of the whole simulation table 1in the simulation of spi bound to the angii-sace complex the peptide bound in the n-terminal side of the mouth and next to the angii figure 5 binding of spi was stabilized by hydrogen bond interactions not only with sace but also with angii 18 we investigated the presence of hydrogen bonds during the md simulations in average the spi formed 322  108 and 347  075 pairs of hydrogen bonds with sace and angii respectively and together 673  157 pairs table 1 spi formed hydrogen bonds most frequently with sace thr1-asp121 thr1-ser219 glu3-arg522 lys6-glu143 spi-sace residues in order and with angii glu3-arg2 pro7-arg2 pro2-val3 spi-angii residues in order figure 5 table s1 in addition to hydrogen bonds binding of the spi was stabilized by van der waals interactions too the sidechain of pro4 of the spi bound in the hydrophobic pocket formed by ile204 leu139 and trp220 of sace not shown in figure 5 for claritydistance analysis of spi bound sace-angii showed similar behavior to other ligand bound simulations figure 4b interestingly the spi bound sace-angii complex was stayed in the closed state most of the simulation time this is understandable since both spi and angii are acting as inhibitors and the number of hydrogen bonds between the ligand and the enzyme is largest among all complexes table 1 the closed state was stabilized not only by the interactions between angi and sace but also by the interactions between spi and sace in addition interactions between spi and angii stabilized the complex further in the closed state analysis of all five rmsfs indicated that the most stable system was spi bound to sace-angii complex figure s5 we recognized that the binding of spi to sace-angii complex slightly twisted the subdomain i figure s6the active sites and binding interactions have been well known for ace with various inhibitors while the conformational dynamics and its role in activation mechanism have not been studied intensively drug design might benefit from backbone conformations observed by md simulations which have never reached by the x-ray crystallography with ligand bound forms unlike the closed state the open state of sace has not been detected in both experiments and simulations so far surprisingly over more than a decade since the first proposal 32 no further study has been reported about the role of large hinge-bending motion for the activation of sacein contrast to the lock-and-key model many proteins can take a ligand only through the conformational changes the putative binding pathway of sace might be too narrow to accommodate the substrate angi in the closed state figure 6 thus the enzyme needs to change its backbone conformation to take the substrate for its catalytic function at least in the semi-open state rearrangement of sidechain may allow the substrate to enter the active site figure s7 two models of enzyme mechanisms induce-fit 33 and pre-existing equilibrium dynamics 34 represent the conformational changes and dynamics upon ligand binding in the former binding of a ligand induces conformational changes of a protein while in the latter a ligand binds to a certain pre-existing conformation already present and accessible by equilibrium dynamicsin the ligand-free apo md simulation we were able to observe spontaneous conformational changes between the open and closed states of sace implying that the open and closed backbone conformational states are already present and accessible regardless of the presence of a ligand in addition several times of conversions between the states for the 400-nanoseconds simulation indicate that the enzyme is very flexible and dynamic indeed all available ace structures are resolved in the closed conformation either in the presence ligands or with mutations introducing mutations ligands or chimera are common methods to enhance thermal stability and to crystalize a protein in addition the absence of the open conformation in a ligand-free ace imply the intrinsic flexibility of ace again only one available structure in the open conformation is resolved with ace2 32 in addition a previous study using normal mode analysis nma with testicular ace tace another isoform of ace and ace2 showed the intrinsic flexibility and open and closed conformational models of ace 35 the authors also proposed the hinge-bending mechanism for substrate entry into the active sitebased on the results of our md simulations and available x-ray structures we propose the following activation mechanism of sace figure 7 regardless of presence of a ligand sace could be in any of the open semi-open and closed states in terms of backbone conformation in the absence of a substrate or angi the open state might be more favored than the closed state figure 2 and the enzyme becomes ready to accept a substrate for its catalytic function this equilibrium however is changed in the presence of angi and the closed state becomes more stable than the open state due to the binding of the substrate then the c-terminal dipeptide his-leu of angi is hydrolyzed angii the product of the enzyme activity might be released when sace is in the semi-open state figure 2 and figure s7 after the release of angii from sace the equilibrium between conformational states goes back to the first stage again notice that the semi-open conformation can be accessed under any conditionsimilarly we can derive a mechanism for a competitive inhibitor now if the ligand is a competitive inhibitor then the bound complex becomes stable in the closed state qualitatively the equilibrium shift is the same way as the case of substrate binding after release of the inhibitor the equilibrium goes back to the first stage of the apo form since angii occupies the same active site until the release of angii sace cannot take any substrate this is true for the substrate too interestingly spi the mixed non-competitive inhibitor makes use of this the interactions of spi not only with sace but also with angii stabilized sace in the closed state further resulting in a dead-end complex by holding the product of enzyme angii in the active site 18 since spi does not share the binding site with the substrate it becomes non-competitive even though spi is non-competitive it binds next to the active site and interacts with the substrate becoming a mixed type inhibitor 18 the binding sites of various drugs and drug candidates were studied intensively and along the various ligands binding sites and their conformations are various too this indicates the binding of a specific ligand induce a specific conformation of its binding site therefore the overall large backbone open and closed conformational state pre-exist and the sidechain and minor backbone rearrangement may be induced upon ligand bindingin apo simulation we have removed the bound angii from the x-ray structure of sace-angii complex and started the md simulation this removal of angii is an additional perturbation to the sace structure we checked equilibration of the apo system by monitoring the thermodynamic parameters such as energy temperature volume and pressure figure s8 in addition we monitored evolution of secondary structure along the simulation time and recognized that the overall secondary structure was well conserved and stable except for loop and turn regions figure s9 even though we observe multiple opening and closing motions one can still consider the apo system is still under equilibration stage if apo structure was still under equilibration stage and goes to a certain open conformation then we would have an x-ray structure with open conformation like ace2 a calorimetric study showing that the drug binding is entropically driven also supports dynamics of ace 36 in conclusion using all-atom md simulations the conversion between open and closed states of sace was observed in the absence of a ligand supporting that hinge-bending motion is essential in enzyme activation the preferred states as well as the extent of flexibility were strongly dependent on the presence of a ligand the transformation from the semi-open to the closed state in the bound forms was directly influenced by the interaction between the residues of binding sites of the substrate and the inhibitors these interactions constrained the enzyme structure to remain in the semi-open and closed states however it would seem that the putative binding pathway is too narrow to accommodate the substrate and inhibitors therefore the semi-open conformation might be the state where the ligands can bind our md simulation results and the mechanistic model of sace activation and inhibition portends not only drug design for hypotension treatment but also wide applications in molecular biophysics and beyondpotential binding sites of spi on sace were searched by docking simulations using the flexpepdock protocol of the rosetta program 37 the crystal structure of human sace in complex with angii pdb id 4aph was used for the target since the spi peptide is a non-competitive inhibitor angii was kept during the docking simulations to avoid overlapping between the binding site of the peptide and the active site a structure with the lowest score of docking simulations was chosen for the molecular dynamics simulation in order to relax the structure further table s2 details of the docking simulations were described in the previous study 18total five molecular dynamics simulations were carried out bppb bound sace angii bound sace apo ligand-free spi bound sace-angii complex spi bound sace two crystal structures of the sace co-crystallized with ligands in the active site were used to build the simulation systems sace complex with the natural inhibitory peptide bppb pdb id 4apj and sace complex with angii pdb id 4aph in order to simulate the apo form angii was removed from the active site of the crystal structure 4aph the spi bound to the sace-angii complex with the lowest score from the docking simulations was chosen to run the fourth md simulation and the last spi bound sace model was generated by removing the angii from this docking simulation resultcharmm36 force field with explicit tip3p water molecules was used in all simulations 38 crystallographic water molecules chloride ions and zinc ion were retained as they were found in the x-ray crystal structures ligand chemical components in the original crystal structures including acetate ion beta-d-mannose n-acetyl-d-glucosamine were also retained and modeled with charmm general force field 39 all five simulation systems were solvated in the truncated octahedral box with 23251 23418 23565 23410 and 23374 tip3p water molecules respectively then these solvated systems were electrically neutralized by adding counter ions and the final salt concentration became 015 mall simulations were performed by namd under the periodic boundary condition 40 after solvation 1000 steps of energy minimization were performed to remove possible bad contacts then the md simulations were started by gradually heating the systems from 10 to 310 k for 60 ps under the constant volume condition in order to equilibrate the density of the systems the simulation was switched to constant pressure and temperature npt conditions and continued afterwards the average pressure and the temperature were maintained at 1 bar and 310 k respectively all heavy atoms during the energy minimization heating and the first 200 ps of npt simulation were restrained with harmonic potential with a force constant 1 kcalmola2 after that the harmonic position restraints were removed allowing all atoms in the systems to relax all bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained allowing an integration time step of 2 fs the non-bonded interactions were smoothly truncated from 10  to 12  cutoff and the particle-mesh ewald method was used to treat long-range electrostatic interactions 41 the equilibration stages of simulations were determined based on rmsd and system energy calculations total simulation and equilibration times for bppb-sace angii-sace apo spi-sace-angii and spi-sace were 400 3226 400 2826 400 2436 360 2095 and 360 1326 respectively in nanoseconds summary of all md simulations are provided in table s3 the production stage after discarding the initial equilibration stage was used for the post simulation analysis except for rmsd calculation all post analyses and visualization were carried out by visual molecular dynamics vmd program 42 formation of hydrogen bond was identified using 33  donor-acceptor distance and 30 degrees proton-donor-acceptor angle criteriaat the end of december 2019 chinese

analyzes have identified the main characteristic of the virus which could increase the efficiency and speed of virus transmission between human cells belouzard et al 2012 jaimes  whittaker 2018 also some groups are investigating a receptor on cell membranes that introduces the fusion of new cov into human hcs veljkovic et al 2020 zheng  perlman 2018 both the cellular and protein receptors of the virus provide potential targets for development of drugs against pathogen kaufmann et al 2018 papadopoulos et al 2017 however some well-developed experiments and promising data are required to ensure such a mechanism indeed exploring the transmission mechanism of the virus is important to prevent its future outbreaks the covid-19 spreads much more easily than the sars virus and infecting easily the people have been already infected with sars jiang et al 2020 lai et al 2020 liu et al 2020to infect a cell viruses use spike protein sp to bind the cell membrane a process activated by specific cellular enzymes such as trypsin furin and cathepsin l jaimes  whittaker 2018 li et al 2017 millet  whittaker 2015 genomic analysis of the new cov has shown that its sp differs from that of other viruses du et al 2017 li 2016 indicating that the protein has a site activated by a hc enzyme called furin millet  whittaker 2015 figure 1this enzyme normally cleaves and activates a wide range of substrates in different organisms figure 2a braun  sauter 2019 this enzyme is found in many human tissues including the lungs liver and small intestine which means that the virus has the potential to invade different organs belouzard et al 2012 heald-sargent  gallagher 2012 scamuffa et al 2006 the furin activation site fas makes the new cov much different in cell entry than sars and probably affects the stability of the virus and consequently the transmission process li et al 2015 millet  whittaker 2014 yamada  liu 2009 several other groups have also identified the site of activation to investigate how the virus spreads among humans basak et al 2007 kim et al 2016 kleine-weber et al 2018 porter et al 2014 they pointed out that other viruses including influenza family viruses contain these sites that are easily spread among people huang et al 2011 menachery et al 2014 tang et al 2020 vlasak et al 1988  but in these viruses the site of activation is found on a protein called haemagglutinin not on the sp bernstein et al 2020 koopman et al 2019 lai et al 2019 however some other researchers are more cautious about the significant role of the activation site in helping cov and facilitating its spread amer et al 2018 van doremalen et al 2013 other scientists are also skeptical of comparing the influenza viral activation sites with the new cov transmission channels heymann  shindo 2020 yang et al 2005 the haemagglutinin protein at the surface of influenza viruses is not the same as the sp in covs yin et al 2016 zmora et al 2018in other hand the influenza virus that has caused the deadliest recorded pandemic lacks even a fas coutard et al 2020 therefore some studies on cellular or animal models are required to assay the function of the activation site indeed covs are unpredictable and some experiments should be developed to assess how to modify the activation site some other experiments have done to explain why the new covs successfully infects human cells huang et al 2020 letko  munster 2020 their experiments have shown that the sp binds to the human cell receptor hulswit et al 2019 for example a drug that blocks the receptor may make cov entry into cells difficultfurin and furin-like proteases belong to the group of proprotein convertases scientist have pointed out that among several targets the sp as fusogenic envelope glycoprotein of sars cov is a promising site for treatment of infectious diseases li et al 2018 licitra et al 2013 sps mediate cov fusion and the entry of the cov genetic material into the human cell senathilake et al 2020 struck et al 2012 afterwards a sp-selective strategy when used at the initial phase of cov infection is probably considered as a potential approach to mitigate infection inside the body the furin induces the cleavage of sps at the rntr761ev site bergeron et al 2005 and results in the production of two segments s1 and s2 figure 2b each segment shows its own biological activity the s1 segment known as the globular section of sp mediates attachment of cov to the receptor ace-2 with dominance of -helix structures li et al 2003 a 193-resdiue fragment of sp has been determined as the protein-binding site wong et al 2004 s2 known as the biomembrane-anchored stalk domain and leads to covhuman cell fusion prabakaran et al 2004 some other experiments also exhibited that other biomembrane-anchored proprotein convertases prcos namely poco5b and poco7 cleave spsin this regard basak et al 2007 employing intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic iqf proteins relied on sars-cov sp claimed that poco5b and poco7 beside furin may result in the cleavage of sps kinetic studies showed that the cleavage of peptide occurred potentially by furin as well as recombinant poco5b but with a limited amount by poco7 furthermore they demonstrated that the cleavage activity could be inhibited by a poco-inhibitor 1-pdx circular dichroism intensities revealed that the content of -sheet conformation in poco increases after cleavage by furin figure 2c 1h nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy displayed that this peptide has a turn motif at its c-terminal part close to the cleavage sitecoutard et al 2020 revealed that the sp of the sars-cov-2 possesses a furin-like cleavage site absent in cov of the same clade the genome sequence revealed that sars-cov-2 is included in lineage b of -cov figure 3a chen et al 2020 presented that sars-cov-2 as a newly detected cov shows a high level of similarity to sars-cov the structural analysis of the receptor binding domain rbd of sp from the two viruses show 72 similarity in residue sequences figure 3b molecular modeling studies depicted that sars-cov-2 rbd provides a stronger attachment with ace-2 they found that a distinct phe residue plays a key role in the in the binding site due to its interaction with ace-2several kinds of cov from various genera have at their s1s2 binding site a furin cleavage site fcs belouzard et al 2012 an important phase in the life cycle of the cov is the human cell entry and fusion derived from proteolytic activity of the relative fusion protein fp by respective proteases jaimes  whittaker 2018 a conventional approach to explore the cov life cycle is to clone the fp gene into an appropriate vector transfect the cells incubate with the related protease purify the protein and carry out the protein assays cong et al 2019 li et al 2019 this approach shows a number of drawbacks the need of viral genome expensive synthesizing process availability of monoclonal antibodies and time-consuming process therefore jaimes et al 2019 reported the fluorogenic peptide cleavage analysis to assay the proteolytic activity of recombinant fp which can be applied in the case of cov sp in a less labor and time intensive wayin another study xi et al 2020 isolated one strain of sars-cov-2 zj01 in mild covid-19 patient and reported the presence of more than 30 specific gene mutation the theoretical analysis of fcs and the case alignment of cov family determined that fcs may be a crucial site of cov evolution zj01 showed mutations close to fcs f1-2 which led to alterations in the conformation and the charge distribution on the surface of the sp they employed adaptive poisson-boltzmann solver apbs analysis and exhibited that the binding site of furin was covered with a number of negative residues figure 4a the f1 site of sars-cov-2 namely zj01 wuhan-hu-1 and ratg13 were almost covered with positive moieties while sars was covered by both mixed negative and positive residues f1 site of zj01 showed more positive charge distribution in its head and more negative residues in its basal site in comparison with wuhan-hu-1 the f2 site of gz02 had negative charge distribution while f2 site of wuhan-hu-1 and ratg13 demonstrated a limited level of positive moieties zj01 displayed more positive charge distribution in f2 site than the other species most likely derived from gene deletion gz02 presented a number of negative charge distribution in f3 site while limited negative charge distribution was observed in sars-cov-2-associated virus figure 4a hence they deduced that the mutation close to fcs site lead to a significant change in the protein conformation and surface charges which further affected its interaction with the ligands xi et al 2020hoffmann et al 2020 depicted that sars-cov-2 cell entry relied on ace-2 and tmprss2 and is limited by a protease inhibitor indeed exploring the cellular factors employed by sars-cov-2 for entry might result in providing useful information about viral outbreak and a number of therapeutic approaches hoffmann et al 2020 exhibited that sars-cov-2 utilizes the sars-cov receptor ace-2 for specific cellular internalization and the tmprss2 as a serine protease for sp cleavage a tmprss2 inhibitor can be developed in clinical application to block the cellular internalization and might result in the advancement of a therapeutic approach in general they demonstrated crucial similarities between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov infection and reported a promising target for development of anti-viral platforms figure 4b hoffmann et al 2020the design of enzyme inhibitors as therapeutic platforms against cov require the control of multiple pharmacologic features beyond the interaction and ace-2- and furin-targeting drugs baron et al 2020 kong et al 2020 a number of these pharmacologic characteristics show their molecular underpinning in chemical pathways within the biological systems examples of this include drug transport pathways blood circulation of drug drug metabolism and side effects derived from the interactions of drug with a wide range of enzymes zumla et al 2016 thus some thermodynamic and kinetic data in the pharmacological development of drugs during preclinical studies are requiredas we overviewed so far reducing the levels of ace-2 might provide a great deal of interest in fighting the cov in a point of fact ace-2 can induce a protective impact against cov-stimulated lung damage by enhancing the formation of the vasodilator angiotensin imai et al 2005 indeed the attachment of the sp of the cov to the ace-2 triggers a reduction in the levels of ace-2 kuba et al 2005 most likely stimulating lung injury xu et al 2017 reported that vitamin d can be used as a potential candidate to mitigate lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung damage via control of the renin-angiotensin system therefore it could be suggested that vitamin d can control the outbreak of cov through inhibition of ace-2 gurwitz 2020 claimed that angiotensin receptor blockers can be used as promising sars-cov-2 therapeutics also it has been suggested that probable way of fighting the cov could be the injection of ace-2 which will result in the preventing the interaction of the cov to off-infected cells and replenishing ace-2 in infected cells zhang et al 2020 some other studies have indicated a close correlation between hypertension and heart disease and cov infection which may be associated with the prescription of ace-2 inhibitors fang et al 2020 indeed treatment of cov infection with ace-2 inhibitors leads to an upregulation of this receptor especially by epithelial cells of the lung followed by facilitation of infection with different kinds of sars-cov li et al 2017based on these reports some attention has been given to the development of furin inhibitors as potential therapeutics platform against sars-cov-2 infection although a great deal of research is required to exhibit experimentally this assertion the inhibition of furin or furin-like enzymes may display a promising anti-viral platform actually it has been recently demonstrated that hcs infected by several kinds of viruses stimulate an interferon-based activity to block the enzymatic activity of furin-like enzymes lodermeyer et al 2013 it was also revealed that virus infection triggers the upregulation of some receptors braun  sauter 2019 kim et al 2015 that inhibit the furin trafficking in post-golgi compartmentsalso based on the crystal structure of furin some potent inhibitors like 25-dideoxystreptamine-mediated inhibitor were developed to be used in clinical trials dahms et al 2017 because furin-like enzymes contributed in a several pathways one crucial point would be to limit the systemic inhibition that may lead to some adverse effects consequently it is most likely that such small molecule or other active agents as promising drugs probably administered by inhalation and presenting a strong interaction with furin to stimulate a prolonged inhibition deserve to be quickly analyzed to examine their anti-viral impact against sars-cov-2  in general these details disclosed that inhibitors of furin or furin-like enzymes may play a key role in blocking virus outbreakace-2 exhibited the same primary structures patterns in vertebrates lineages imai et al 2005 structural investigations indicated that ace-2 from these systems can efficiently interact with rbd of sars-cov-2 inducing them all to serve as promising hosts for the virus infection mathewson et al 2008 poon  peiris 2020 furthermore it can be deduced that small molecular and ligands inhibitors that can limit the interaction of ace-2 with rbd should be developed to combat the spreading cov epidemic chen et al 2020 senathilake et al 2020 isolating and cultivating cov in vitro may not usually be practical or demand particular facilities that are not accessible in every bioresearch laboratory therefore there is a necessity for developing some strategies to assay the human health response to spread of emerging cov that can be performed in normal laboratory systems apart from viruses targeting humans several animal viruses also have identical fps hence exhibiting the comparable features than their human sites purifying these kinds of viruses can display some inevitable biological challenges making the application of pioneering devices to examine them unavoidablecurrent drugs have limited efficacy in treating cov in different populations and species given the high incidence of cov resistance especially in immunocompromised patients the design of new drugs that target specific activities of the virus and stop one or more stages of its infection cycle is essential prajapat et al 2020 yang et al 2020 zhou  zhao 2020 in recent years most research has focused on blocking virus transmission to the hc rna polymerase activity of the virus and hc-virus interactions schaack  mehle 2019 genetic changes reappearance and emergence of antigenic variants and transmission of cov to humans require extensive measures to control globalization vaccination drug follow-up and immediate protection are important tools for dealing with viral infections ahmed et al 2020due to the possible genetic modification of cov producing a suitable vaccine against this disease is difficult kim et al 2016 any changes in the antigenic sites of surface proteins especially sp which is the most important surface antigen of the virus give rise to appearance of new strains du et al 2017 kleine-weber et al 2018  changes in these regions affect the antibodies produced against the former strains and therefore have no role in the immunity against this disease stebbing et al 2020the emergence of resistant strains under drug selective pressure and their limited availability in high-risk cases further exacerbates the need for new therapeutic strategies zu et al 2020 in recent years compounds affecting different stages of the viruss life cycle have been introduced and a wide range of anti-viral strategies have been proposed including inhibiting the entry and stopping of viral replication or targeting intracellular signal transduction pathways peeri et al 2020 in recent decades targeting viral proteins inducing humoral and cellular immune responses have received a great deal of attention in development of anti-viral compounds zumla et al 2016 the ability of biomolecular systems such as cytokines interleukins and bacterial derivatives to improve immunogenicity and xenografts is being evaluated as a novel strategy although immune system regulatory proteins have received more attentioncovs are rna viruses replicating in the cytoplasm of hcs to transfer their genetic materials into the human hcs they are dependent on the interaction of their envelope with the human hc biomembrane the sp mediates cov entry and conducts the interaction of cov with receptor ace-2 on the hcs as well as mediating the fusion of hc biomembrane and viral envelope also sars-cov-2 furin substrate site can facilitate the cleavage of the sp this review discussed an overview on the role of ace-2 and furin in the binding of cov with hc biomembrane mediated by sp also we surveyed the contribution of fcs on the cov outbreak moreover we considered the ability of small molecular inhibitors on the limiting the interaction of ace-2 and furin with sp to be used as promising antiviral drugs or vaccines this paper may provide promising information about the development of useful strategies to combat the spreading cov epidemicthe authors declare that they have no competing interestsall authors read and approved the final manuscriptace was discovered in the mid-1950s by the observation that dialysis of plasma and kidney extract with water and saline before incubation had produced two separate pressor substances ang i and ang ii respectively 1 it was discovered for a second time in 1966 during the characterization of bradykinin bk degrading enzyme from kidney and this enzyme was named kininase ii it later was found to be the same enzyme as ace ace2 was discovered in 2000 when two independent research groups cloned homologous ace that could convert ang i to ang19 and yet also is captopril-insensitive 2 3two isozymes of ace are present in mammals somatic ace and testis ace somatic ace possesses two catalytic domains n- and c-domains and a c-terminal transmembrane segment stalk figure 29d1
 somatic and testis aces in humans contain 1306 and 665 aa residues respectively testis ace only possesses one catalytic domain both catalytic domains are zinc-metallopeptidase with the active motif hemgh where the two histidine residues coordinate the zinc ion the stalk anchors the enzyme on the membrane and is susceptible to be cleaved by shedding enzymes resulting in plasma ace activity figure 29d1 ace2 is a chimaera protein with a single catalytic domain of ace and a c-terminal highly resembling collectrin which may act as a chaperone protein to deliver other proteins to the brush border membrane
ace and ace2 genes are located at chromosome 17q23 and xp22 in humans respectively testis ace is transcribed from the same gene with an alternative transcription starting site on the 13th intron of the ace gene resulting in only c-domain and stalk segment with a unique additional 67 aa n-terminal sequence in humans the two catalytic domains are the result of genedomain duplication and the duplication occurred multiple times in evolution as the cnidarians crustaceans insects and vertebrates possess ace-like enzymes with one or two catalytic domains no expression studies so far have been performed for non-mammalian ace and ace2somatic ace is expressed in various tissues including blood vessels kidney intestine adrenal gland liver and uterus and is especially abundant in highly vascular organs such as retina and lung testis ace is expressed by postmeiotic male germ cells and high-level expression is found in round and elongated spermatids ace2 is expressed in lung liver intestine brain testis heart and kidneylung possesses the highest amount of ace and contributes to 01 of total protein serum ace levels in humans ranged from 299349 gl dd to 4941883 gl ii with heterozygous individuals 3926668 gl 4 id see the section pathophysiological implications for the genotype definition several enzymatic assays have been developed for the measurement of ace activity in plasma and tissues and usually involve artificial substrates such as hippuryl-his-leu or n-3-2-furylacryloyll-phenylalanyl-glycyl-glycine fapgg in combination with captopril inhibition these methods were developed in mammals but were also extended to other vertebrates including birds amphibians and fishes 5 however these enzymatic methods may be erroneous because the enzyme specificity on the artificial substrates could be different lamprey ace activities in different tissues were measured but captopril failed to decrease the ace activities indicating a possible nonspecific enzyme measurement in amphibian high captopril-sensitive ace activities were found in gonad intestine kidney and lung moderate activities were presented in liver heart and skin and low or negligible activities were observed in plasma muscle and erythrocytes
expression of ace is affected by steroids and thyroid hormone but the details of the regulation are not clear ace is under promoter regulation by hypoxia-inducing factor 1 hif-1 which upregulates the ace expression under hypoxic conditions resulting in an increase in ang ii concentration under hypoxia ace2 will be downregulated but it was shown that it is indirectly controlled by ang ii but not hif-1 6 testis ace expression control is highly specific and regulated by a tissue-specific promoter located immediately 59 bp of the transcription start site which is frequently used in testis-specific overexpression studies hypoxia induced by high temperature decreased gill ace activity but had no effect on kidney in carp promoters of ace2 from mammals amphibians and teleosts drive specific expression in the heart cis-element search results discovered wgatar motifs in all putative ace2 promoters from different vertebrates suggesting a possible role of gata family transcriptional factors in ace2 expression regulationthe first ace inhibitor was a peptide antagonist called sq 20881 gwprpeipp discovered from snake venom but it was not orally active the snake venom peptides were further studied to produce the first orally active form captopril that lowers the blood pressure of essential hypertensive patients 7 the most common side effects of captopril are cough skin rash and loss of taste and therefore derivatives such as enalapril lisinopril and ramipril were developed with fewer side effects after the discovery of n- and c-domains of ace specific domain inhibitors were developed to increase specificity ang i is mainly hydrolyzed by the c-domain in vivo but bk is hydrolyzed by both domains by developing a c-domain selective inhibitor rxpa380 some degradation of bk by the n-domain would be permitted and this degradation could be enough to prevent accumulation of excess bk causing angioedema 8the well-known function of ace is the conversion of ang i to ang ii and degradation of bk which all play an important role in controlling blood pressure ace also acts on other natural substrates including encephalin neurotensin and substance p besides being involved in blood pressure control ace possesses widespread functions including renal development male fertility hematopoiesis erythropoiesis myelopoiesis and immune responses 1 ace2 can convert ang ii to ang17 thereby reducing the concentration of ang ii and increasing that of ang17 ace2 can also convert ang i to ang19 which is subsequently converted into ang17 by ace the high expression of ace2 favors the balance of ang17 over ang ii which accounts for the cardioprotective role of ace2 via the ang17mas signaling pathway 9ace-knockout mice display normal blood pressure under normal conditions but are sensitive to changes in blood pressure such as exercise ace-knockout also affects renal function renal development serum and urine electrolyte composition haematocrit and male reproductive capacity
10 deficiency in testis ace affects male fertility but its exact role is still not clear although mice with testis ace deficiency mate normally and their sperm quantity and motility are no different from those of wild-type mice the survival of sperm in the oviduct and fertilization rate are highly reduced 1 overexpression of ace2 in hypertensive models but not in normotensive animals reduced blood pressure ace2-knockout mice displayed progressive cardiac dysfunction resembling that of long-term hypoxia after coronary artery disease or bypass surgery in human which could be reversed by concurrent ace-knockout it was suggested that the cardioprotective function of ace2 is to counterbalance the effects of aceinclusion ii or deletion dd of 287 bp alu repeats in the 16th intron affects the human plasma ace levels and the dd genotype was more frequently found in patients with myocardial infarction but no convincing evidence was available on the association of the dd genotype with hypertension 4 ace2 was identified as the receptor for sars severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars virus binding downregulates the cellular expression of ace2 and the binding induces clathrin-dependent internalization of virusreceptor sarsace2 complex not only has ace2 facilitated the invasion of sars virus for rapid replication but also ace2 is depleted from the cell membrane and therefore the damaging effects of ang ii are enhanced resulting in acute deterioration of lung tissuesace has been the target of hypertension control since the 1970s ace inhibitors are prescribed as the sole or combinational treatment of high blood pressure for the dual effects of lowering ang ii and slowing down bk degradation in human hypertensive patients ace2 levels are lower in both kidney and heart compared to normotensive volunteersorganisms that evolve rapidly have the selective advantage of quickly adapting to their host or surroundings for example a few amino acid changes on the surface protein hemagglutinin of the influenza virus are sufficient to evade the hosts antibody detection within the time span of a single season 1 to effectively genotype and monitor the genome of a rapidly evolving and heterogeneous population it is important to have the capability to amplify the nucleic acid sequences from samples taken from that population as the genotype is shifting as the viral sequencing projects have increased at jcvi over the past few years a high-throughput mechanism to rapidly select pcr primers with a high probability of success was necessary in this paper we describe the modifications made to our high-throughput primer design pipeline previously developed for human re-sequencing 2 we describe the results for 8 out of the 15 viruses that have had pcr primers designed for measles virus mumps virus rubella virus human parainfluenza virus 1 and 3 human respiratory syncytial virus a and b and human metapneumovirus pcr primers for the remaining viruses were also successfully designed using the same degenerate primer design pipeline but were not included in the results and discussion because a few primers from the entire computationally designed set were modified to suit project specific laboratory pcr requirements thus the utilized primer pairs were not completely true to the algorithms recommendations the excluded viruses were human coronavirus feline coronavirus canine coronavirus sars coronavirus human adenovirus human norwalk virus and influenza viruses human influenza a and b and avian influenza athe use of degenerate primers to selectively amplify a set of closely related sequences is periodically found in literature previous work on computational tools have included codehop 3 which designs degenerate primers based on conserved amino acid sequences and hyden 4 which tries to maximize the coverage of a degenerate primer pair with a minimal amount of degeneracy for viral sequences an amino acid based methodology of codehop would introduce a larger set of degenerate bases than would be necessary to successfully amplify a set of isolates thus unnecessarily increasing the potential for non-specific priming and alternative products hydens objective focuses on a primer pair for a family of genes rather than the whole genome sequencing of a potentially heterogeneous sample of same species viruses in a high-throughput environmentthe goal of jcvis degenerate primer design pipeline is to maximize the success rate of selected primer pairs given a set of sequences that are assumed to represent the target population it is not only important to decide which bases to make degenerate but also how many and which combinations will lead to successful pcr the high throughput features of the jcvis degenerate primer design pipeline that have been inherited from the original non-degenerate version include dynamic tiling an overlapping non-fixed amplicon set across the entire target genome as well as the capability to predict primer pairs that have very high success rates under one of either of two amplification protocols standard or high gc dynamic tiling allows the selection of an amplicon set to be dependent on the landscape of features on the template by parameterizing the minimum maximum and optimal amplicon overlap and amplicon sizes the jcvi primer design pipeline crawls across a template based on the last amplicon selected thus minimizing the number of successful amplicons necessary to cover the genome while only selecting amplicons predicted to be successful this exhaustive search is not possible with fixed tilingthe necessity of designing highly successful primers for a high-throughput directed sequencing environment is a consequence of the prohibitively high labor costs required to manually reprocess failures by tuning pcr conditions the work we present here utilizes two laboratory protocols based on our previous publication to achieve a comparable level of successin this paper the results of the degenerate primer design the augmentation of the previously published high-throughput pcr primer design software 2 and the methodology used to construct the reference degenerate consensus sequence are describedthe degenerate primer design pipeline was used to design primers for multiple viral projects across 15 different dna and rna viruses including both segmented and non-segmented viruses the results for 8 different non-segmented viruses are presented here the size of these genomes varied from 9kb to 156kb with various degrees of sampled genomic sequence variation and gc content the summary statistics for the primers designed for the 8 different non-segmented viral genomes using the two different pcr protocols described as the standard and high gc protocols are presented in table 1 the standard and high gc protocols are described briefly in the materials and methods sectiontable 1 contains the actual sequencing success rates for each targeted viral consensus sequence and the relevant information regarding each consensus sequences construction the median amplicon coverage for all viruses is approximately 3x however in many cases the ends of the genomes had a lower minimum coverage ie1x or 2x due to the inability to select primer beyond the end of the available sequence dynamic tiling produced an even tiling of amplicon coverage across all genomesprimers designed using the standard protocol targeted organisms with less than 50 gc content these included the human parainfluenza virus hpiv-1 and hpiv-3 measles virus mev mumps virus muv human respiratory syncytial virus hrsv-a and hrsv-b and human metapneumovirus hmpv-a and hmpv-b for organisms with gc content exceeding 50 eg rubella virus rubv-1 and rubv-2 the high gc protocol was usedamplicons were designed to cover the entire genome for all viruses so only full length complete sequences available from ncbis viral genomes 5 were used to generate the consensus sequences the number of sequences used to generate the consensus sequence and the percent of degenerate bases across the constructed consensus sequences are described in table 1 the number of sequences collected to construct each consensus sequence ranged from 3 for hrsv-a and hrsv-b to 32 for muvfor each viral type a single consensus file was generated with a target of less than 10 degenerate bases with two exceptions the resultant percent ambiguity across the constructed consensus sequence ranged from 412 for hrsv-b to 928 for muv if a single consensus could not be generated with less than 10 ambiguity multiple consensus sequences were constructed based on sequence similarity-based clustering results the two exceptions were measles virus mev and rubella virus rubv-g2 which had percent ambiguities exceeding 10for measles virus the allele frequencies for multi-allelic positions were not filtered to remove the less dominant allele frequencies even when the percentage of degenerate bases across the constructed consensus sequence exceeded 10 even though the less dominant allele frequencies were below the expected threshold for sequencing error because the percent degeneracy across the consensus sequence was very close to 10 it was decided that stratifying the sequences and generating multiple consensus sequences may not be cost effective the total success rate was not expected to be significantly impactedfor the rubella virus the input sequences were stratified into two genotypes because the total percentage of degenerate bases in the initially constructed consensus sequence was 21 see figure 1 after computational stratification two sets of sequences were used as input to generate consensus sequences for genotype 1 g1 and genotype 2 g2 based on 11 and 5 sequences respectively this reduced the percent degeneracy across the consensus sequence to 607 and 1313 for g1 and g2 respectively g2 contained many multi-allelic positions that were not filtered at an allelic frequency of 20 1 out of 5 it was not clear whether these should be attributed to sequencing error within the input sequences so the variations were retained just to be conservative degenerate primers were computed independently for the g1 and g2 consensus sequences and then redundant primer pairs between the two computes were removedfor human respiratory syncytial virus hrsv separate sets of primers were designed for hrsv-a and hrsv-b since there was more than 20 sequence dissimilarity across the entire genome with 24 ambiguity see figure 2 splitting the sequences into two subsets ensured that the sequences in each subset were less than 10 dissimilar the sequences in the subset hrsv-a differed by 55 and those in hrsv-b differed by 45 with a percent ambiguity of 68 for hrsv-a and 41 for hrsv-bfor human metapneumovirus hmpv there appeared to be two distinct clades between which they were approximately 20 dissimilar these initial sequences were split into two clades of hmpv-a with 925 ambiguity and hmpv-b with 795 ambiguity separate primers pairs were then designed for the two clades independentlyfor all viral genomes amplicons were designed with an intended coverage depth of 2x or 3x with the exception of hmpv-a and hmpv-b which had a coverage depth of only 1x multiple depths of coverage increase the likelihood of successfully amplifying the targeted region at least once because when a second pair of candidate primers is selected the primer design pipeline ensures that the second primer pair will not overlap any of the previously selected primer pairs in a high-throughput sequencing environment all wells in a plate are processed so additional amplicon coverage was generated if any empty wells remained if the number of amplicons designed exceeded the number of wells on a plate amplicons were computationally reduced to a smaller subset so that every targeted region was covered by at least one amplicon projects also differed by their sequencing requirements thus resulting in varying amplicon numbers and coverage depth depending on each virus typedetermining the success of degenerate primer design is a more complicated process than that of standard non-degenerate primer design not only does the degenerate primer design algorithm need to accurately model and predict the outcome of pcr with a heterogeneous population of primer pairs but the constructed degenerate consensus sequence needs to sufficiently represent the targeted genomes population the latter can be detrimentally impacted by a lack of available sequence information or the potential for heavily biased sequencing favouring strains specifically studied by a single or few laboratoriesthe success rates provided in table 1 represent the average success rates for each virus type as a percentage of all sequencing reactions performed however since the effect of isolate is confounded inside of the average success rate to gain a deeper understanding of the success rate of primer pairs across isolates a graded approach was taken this was necessary because if a primer pair was successful at a low percentage across all samples then it was possible that the primers did not match the genotype of the isolate rather than a poorly selected primer pair based on the primer design algorithm alone for each primer pair and isolate sequencing was performed in both the forward and reverse directions if a sequence was recovered for an isolate and primer pair under standard expectations of high quality values length etc then that sequencing direction was considered a success success rates were tallied for forward reverse and then averaged between both sequencing directions these per primer pair success rates were then graded at cutoffs of greater than 25 50 75 85 and 90 percent of isolates see table 2 this cumulative and graded approach was necessary to distinguish between amplification failures that were either isolate or target region specific note that these are actual not predicted success rates calculated based on laboratory experiments not predicted success rates based on in silico computations furthermore because of the fairly uniform amplicon coverage across all genomes eg figure 3 the reported success rates should not be inflated by any redundant stacking of amplicons over easy-to-amplify loci table 2 contains the forward reverse and average success rates for each viral consensus sequence for each directional set of statistics the sequencing success rate was computed across all isolates for example for hrsv-a 94 of all primers designed had greater than 75 of the isolates successfully sequencedto separate pcr failure bias due to the gc content of the genome alone the overall success rates of primer pairs were calculated for high gc and standard protocols separately for the standard protocol the overall forward reverse and averaged sequencing success rates of primer pairs were 83 82 and 82 respectively for over 95 of the isolates however at greater than 75 of the isolates there was a consistent 95 primer pair success rate for mumps virus most of the primer failures were recorded in the vp protein region which has rna editing with the insertion of non-template g and in the variable region of the sh gene a consistent pattern in the plate location of the primer failures was also discovered which could be an issue related to laboratory conditions and not due to the design of the primersfor the high gc protocol the three sequencing success rates of primer pairs were lower than expected for greater than 75 of isolates success rates were 77 73 and 70 for the overall forward reverse and total sequencing success rate respectively there did not appear to be a relationship between the percentages of ambiguity in the consensus sequence and the success rates of the designed primers simple linear regression adjusted r2  0167 this lack of correlation could be a result of the few sequences represented by the degenerate consensus sequence poorly representing the isolates very accuratelydesigned primer pair sequences and success rates are available as additional file 1the high-throughput degenerate pcr primer design pipeline has been very successful in providing the basis for high-quality viral sequencing results and for minimizing costs associated with labor reprocessing and genome finishing the modular architecture of the primer design software has made it possible to readily integrate new features into the pipeline as a result the augmented primer design software when coupled with the rt-pcr modified production-verified prior pcr laboratory protocols serves as a powerful tool for high-throughput degenerate primer design thus enabling the quick and effective sequencing of diverse viral strains the importance of proper degenerate consensus sequence construction a key input into the process is described and the success rate of the designed primers supports the effectiveness of these combined methodologiesthe input into the degenerate primer design pipeline is a consensus reference sequence of the targeted genome this consensus sequence is used as a reference for detecting alternative products and as a template from which primer pair candidates are selected for segmented viruses or if only a subset of the entire genome is targeted a subset may be specified as the template but the entire genome sequence is still required as a reference for detecting potential alternative amplification productsthe generation of the consensus sequence with ambiguity codes may be established by first generating a multiple sequence alignment msa with a tool such as clustalw 6 or muscle 7 and then using a msa-to-consensus generator such as cons from emboss 8 or one of the applications from andes 9 if the sequence diversity of the targeted population or genomic region is significant then it is recommended to use a tool such as andes to determine if it is necessary to stratify the population and also filter positions of potential variance by various means this is described later in the material and methods subsection constructing the consensus sequence with andesthe output is a set of degenerate primer pairs and their theoretical amplicons based on the consensus reference sequence a variety of supplemental design information is also generated among them is a summary file of critique results including information such as primer and amplicon location on the reference their melting temperatures and primer dimer calculations along with the sequences of the primers an adobe portable document format pdf file which contains a visualization of the tiling layout of the amplicons across the targeted genome is also generated along with the summary file figure 3the core architecture for primer design has remained unmodified from its original form the coverage manager cm component determines a dynamic tiling path across the genome based on the results of the primer critiquor pc components examination of candidate primer pairs the pc component consists of a series of tests or critiques that determine whether a primer pair will be successful based on empirical evidence from previous sequencing experiments the cm component utilizes primer3 10 to generate a list of candidate primer pairs however because primer3 will return an error message if ambiguity codes are found on the user-specified template an extra step is performed to convert ambiguity codes into ns after primer3 has generated a list of primer pair candidates with embedded ns the cm remaps the ns back to their original ambiguity code and passes the degenerate primer pair candidates to the pc component for additional critiquingthe following critique modules utilized by the pc component were modified to assess the anticipated success of primer pair candidates with degenerate base positionsinstead of using blast 11 with a small word size to search for primer binding sites on the reference consensus genome dreg from emboss is utilized dreg uses regular expressions a highly flexible pattern recognition specification for sequence matching based on the conditions of the laboratory protocol utilized in the high-throughput sequencing laboratory it was determined that the binding of the 11 base pairs of the 3 end were sufficient for the polymerase to initiate synthesis of the copy strand for this reason only the 11 base pairs of the three prime end of the degenerate primer sequence are specified in the regular expression pattern detected primer binding sites are then analyzed to determine whether an alternative product will be formed based on detected primer binding site orientation and pair-wise distancesfor each degenerate sequence in a primer pair candidate a list of disambiguated sequences is generated by enumerating all possible non-degenerate primer sequences that can be represented by each degenerate sequence self and pair-wise primer dimer predictions are calculated within and between the disambiguated primer sequence lists respectively primer melting temperatures are computed by averaging the nearest neighbor thermodynamic calculations 12 of the melting temperatures of the disambiguated sequences derived from the degenerate sequencethe construction of the template andor reference consensus sequence with ambiguous bases is a critical step prior to executing the degenerate primer design pipeline unlike using standard ie non-degenerate primers where the analyst must assume that the primers are binding to conserved regions surrounding the target the necessity of degenerate primers presumes that the target population is sufficiently heterogeneous such that there are insufficient conserved regions to allow standard primers to successfully bind and amplify all samples from the population degenerate primer design allows for a mixed population of primer pairs to be simultaneously available during the pcr reaction thus increasing the likelihood of successfully targeting an unknown sample from a heterogeneous population a properly designed consensus sequence or set of consensus sequences will represent this heterogeneous population maximizing the likelihood of attaining pcr products for all samples while at the same time minimizing the potential for alternative products the number of alternative products may exhibit a quadratic relationship with the number of unique primer sequences involved in the pcr thus it is a goal to minimize the number of degenerate bases in each primer sequence while maximizing the proportion of the target population the primers specifically bind to the end effect is to limit the number of degenerate bases per primer to no more than 4 but preferably less than 3 basesandes tools provide the analyst with two key methodologies to support minimizing the number of degenerate bases utilized while maximizing the proportion of the population targeted abundance filtering and sample stratification ultimately the targeted percent of degenerate bases in the consensus sequence should be no more than 10 but ideally less than 8abundance filtering in andes can be performed using several techniques to reduce the number of degenerate bases introduced into the consensus sequence when filtering is applied the analyst assumes that not all point mutations represented in the set of sequences acquired from the population are equally important some polymorphisms may be due to sequencing error while others may only represent an insignificant subpopulation given a msa constructed from a set of sequences determined to be a reasonable representation of the population andes computes the distribution of nucleotides for each position a nominal filter or percentage filter can be applied to remove the presence of alleles that are not represented at or above a user-specified frequency or percentage threshold respectively for example the degenerate base w is required if both the alleles a and t exist in the population for a specific position however if 2 of the samples are as and 98 are ts applying a 4 percentage filter would change the w to the non-degenerate base t if the analyst believes that this polymorphism was actually due to sequencing error alternatively a statistical filter combining both frequency and percentage may be applied this utilizes the binomial distribution to determine whether an allele would be detected upon resampling to the same depth based on a user-specified confidence ie alpha lastly an optimization-based filter is also available in which the analyst specifies the maximum percentage of degenerate bases to be allowed in the consensus sequences and the algorithm iteratively removes alleles starting with the ones with the lowest proportion across the samples until the maximum percentage of degenerate bases have been achieved if these filtering techniques either remove alleles that need to be targeted or do not reduce the number of degenerate bases in the constructed consensus sequence sufficiently then sample stratification will be necessarythe goal of sample stratification is to reduce the total variation in a combined population by placing individuals into clusters which contain less intra-cluster variance than the entire population the more a difference between clusters can be used to separate the clusters the less variation will exist within each of the formed clusters with respect to the entire population this stratification ie clustering can be performed with andes given a msa andes can be used to compute a distance matrix and dendrogram based on sequence similarity which can then be used to generate clusters given a user-specified cutoff the maximum intra-cluster percent dissimilarity cutoff that works well is approximately 10 when the percent similarity within a cluster or undivided set of sequences falls below 90 the number of degenerate bases that must be introduced into the consensus sequence becomes too high for each cluster that is created to reduce the amount of intra-cluster dissimilarity a separate consensus sequence is subsequently generated to represent that subpopulationwhen determining an appropriate threshold for any of these methodologies it is important to keep in mind the number of sequences included since the confidence of real polymorphisms existing in the population can only be attained with sufficient sample size a general landscape of variation can be ascertained with a plot of normalized entropy versus location with sufficient conserved regions flanking highly variable regions and a sufficiently large amplicon size regions with localized high rates of variation do not generally introduce difficulty in primer pair selection due to the primer designers dynamic tiling capabilitiesthe jcvi primer design pipeline automatically detects sub-regions of the targeted genome sequence that may use the standard protocol or must use the high gc protocol once the sub-regions have been separated the proper primer design parameters are utilized for the design and selection of primer pairskey

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars cov-2 has been increasing continuously with more than a million confirmed patients and more than 45 thousand deaths globally 1 with a high prevalence of diabetes it is important to understand the special aspects of covid-19 infection in people with diabetes this becomes even more important as most parts of the world are seeing restrictions on mobility of patients in order to contain the pandemic recently our group has published an article highlighting special considerations in the management of diabetes in todays times with covid-19 pandemic 2 much more data from various parts of world has accumulated since then about the association between diabetes and covid-19 management of diabetes in those with covid-19 infection and innovative strategies for medical consultation in view of limited access to healthcare facilities for patients with chronic diseasesthis review aims to collate currently available data about diabetes and covid-19 infection it specifically looks at the relation between diabetes and covid-19 in terms of epidemiology pathophysiology and therapeutics the review is updated till the time of writing however the data is evolving and the conclusions made here might change laterwe searched pubmed database and google scholar using the key terms covid-19 sars-cov-2 diabetes antidiabetic therapy up to april 2 2020 full texts of the retrieved articles were accesseddiabetes and associated complications can increase the risk of morbidity and mortality during acute infections due to suppressed innate and humoral immune functions the levels of glycated hemoglobin hba1c  9 have been linked to a 60 increased risk of hospitalization and pneumonia-related severity during bacterial infection 3 past viral pandemics have witnessed the association of diabetes to increased morbidity and mortality diabetes was considered as independent risk factor for complications and death during 20022003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov-1 4 similarly the presence of diabetes tripled the risk of hospitalization and quadrupled the risk of intensive care unit icu admission during influenza a h1n1 infection outbreak in 2009 5 during the 2012 outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov diabetes was prevalent in nearly 50 of population and the odds ratio or for severe or critical mers-cov ranged from 72 to 157 in diabetic cohort 6 as compared to overall population mortality rate in patients with mers who had diabetes was 35 78emerging data suggests that covid-19 is common in patients with diabetes hypertension and cardiovascular disease cvd although the prevalence rate varied in different studies as well in country-wise data in the pooled data from the 10 chinese studies n  2209 on characteristics of comorbidities in patients with covid-19 singh et al 9 have reported a prevalence of hypertension diabetes and cvd in 21 11 and 7 patients respectively similarly in a meta-analysis of 8 trials that included 46248 covid-19 patients yang et al 10 reported a prevalence of 17 8 and 5 for hypertension diabetes and cvd respectively in patients with covid-19 epidemiology working group of chinese center for disease control and prevention that investigated 20 982 patients of covid-19 have shown that hypertension diabetes and cvd were associated in nearly 13 5 and 4 of patients respectively 11 in contrast an italian study by onder et al found diabetes in nearly 36 while cvd was associated in nearly 43 of 355 patients admitted with covid-19 12 similarly in a small study of 24 patients from united states bhatraju et al 13 reported diabetes to be associated with 580 patient with covid-19 while the study from the covid-19 surveillance group of italy n  481 has shown that 34 patients with covid-19 had diabetes who died the covid-19 response team from centers for disease control and prevention cdc usa reported a prevalence of 11 from the data of 7162 covid-19 patients 1415 table 1

summarizes the prevalence of survivors and non-survivors among patients with diabetes and covid-19 fig 2
depicts the graphical representation of these data in a univariate analysis of 191 patients with covid-19 zhou et al 21 found diabetes to have an or of 285 95 ci 135 to 605 p  0001 for in-hospital mortality however this association of diabetes and mortality was no longer significant after a multivariate regression analysis nevertheless in a bivariate cox regression analysis wu et al 24 demonstrated a hr of 158 95 ci 080 to 313 p  019 for death in patients with diabetes with covid-19in a summary report of 44672 patients of covid-19 the chinese center for disease control and prevention reported a case fatality rate cfr of 23 1023 deaths among 44672 confirmed cases however the cfr was as high as 105 in patients with cvd 73 in diabetes and 60 in hypertension 29 based on these findings and acknowledging the higher morbidities and mortality associated with comorbidities researchers have recently proposed that the course of treatment and prognosis of covid-19 should be stratified based on the absence or presence of co-morbidities in to type a b and c while type a represents covid-19 patients with pneumonia with no comorbidities type b denotes covid-19 pneumonia with comorbidities and type c denotes covid-19 pneumonia with multi-organ dysfunction 30ace-2 receptors are expressed in pancreatic islets and infection with sars cov-1 has been seen to cause hyperglycaemia in people without pre-existing diabetes hyperglycaemia was seen to persist for 3 years after recovery from sars indicating a transient damage to beta cells 40 though the similar effect has not been reported in covid-19 it may be important to monitor blood glucose levels in acute stage and during follow upthere is no data on the differential effects of oral antidiabetic drugs on the disease course in covid-19 metformin has antiproliferative and immunomodulatory effects by virtue of inhibition of amp activated protein kinase and has shown protective role in pneumonia in mouse models 41 in one study in patients with tuberculosis patients treated with metformin had better survival than those who did not receive metformin 42 in a median 62 years of follow up of 5266 patients with diabetes mendy et al 43 showed that metformin was significantly associated with a decreased risk of mortality in patients with chronic lower respiratory diseases hr 030 95 ci 010 to 093 even after the adjustment for multiple confounding factors in a study of 4321 patients with a follow up of 2-year period ho et al 44 showed metformin users had a significantly lower risk of death hr 046 95 ci 023 to 092 compared with non-metformin users in patients with coexistent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes thiazolidinediones tzd seen to increase the risk of pneumonia in a study when compared to sulfonylureas 45 experimental studies suggest that pioglitazone reduces steatohepatitis by increasing the ace-2 expression in liver tissues 46 this purported increase in ace-2 expression and its relation to covid-19 has led some researchers to propose avoiding tzd in patients with diabetes and covid-19 experimental studies also suggest that liraglutide a glp-1 receptor agonist increases the ace-2 expression in lungs in type 1 diabetic rat and improves right ventricular hypertrophy 47 implications of these findings in the current context of covid-19 and its relation to anti-diabetic drugs is not yet fully cleardipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp4 are tissue oligopeptides involved in multiple biological processes that include control of the activity of growth factors chemokines and bioactive peptides and t-cell activation beside regulating glucose metabolism 48 the relationship of coronavirus to this cellular type-ii transmembrane protein dpp4 cd26 has generated a great interest recently dpp4 serves as the receptor for mers-cov in the same way as ace-2 is the receptor for sars cov and sars cov2 4950 experimental studies have suggested that certain polymorphisms of dpp-4 are associated with reduced chance of mers-cov infection 51 this finding might explain the perplexing absence of mers-cov cases in africa despite the presence of virus in camels presumably because of frequent presence of protective polymorphisms of dpp-4 in africans 51 moreover this has generated an immense interest whether use of dpp4 inhibitors dpp4i can reduce the viral entry of mers-cov in one in vitro study sitagliptin vildagliptin and saxagliptin could not block the coronavirus viral entry into cells 52though ace-2 is recognized as the main receptor for sars cov-2 a recent modeling study did not rule out its interaction with cd26 or dpp4 53 moreover a possible interaction of dpp4 and renin-angiotensin system ras pathways seems to be plausible although not completely studied interestingly dipeptidyl aminopeptidase i-iii cleaves the angiotensin ii 18 to angiotensin iii 28 and iv 38 which has cascading favorable effect through angiotensin-4 at-4 receptors similarly various endo- and oligo-peptidase cleaves angiotensin i 1-10 directly to angiotensin 17 which has a very favorable cascading effect this suggest that a plausible interaction of non-specific dpp-4i with ace-2 is theoretically possible and therefore this area needs a future researchin this regard some of the studies found that co-administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ace-i with dpp4 inhibitors led to an increased sympathetic tone and a consequent adverse hemodynamic effect 54 55 56 there has been an interaction observed between ace-i and vildagliptin where a 4- to 5-folds increased risk of angioedema was noted possibly due to the diminished degradation of bradykinin or substance p 57 in contrast in the experimental study sitagliptin was shown to inhibit ace which could partially explain the purported beneficial cv effects 58dpp4 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of upper respiratory infections however these agents have not been shown to lead to increased risk of pneumonia 45 at present there is insufficient evidence either for or against the use of dpp-4i in patients with diabetes and covid-19 59glycemic control is important in any patient who has covid-19 though there is limited data about the association of blood glucose levels with disease course in covid-19 at present data from other infections like sars and influenza h1n1 has shown that patients with poor glycemic control have increased risk of complications and death 6061 most patients with mild infection and with normal oral intake can continue the usual antihyperglycemic medications however it is advisable to discontinue sglt-2 inhibitors because of the risk of dehydration and euglycemic ketosis metformin may also need to be stopped if there is vomiting or poor oral intake doses of other antihyperglycemic drugs like sulfonylureas and insulin may have to be altered depending upon the blood glucose levelsmost hospitalised patient with covid-19 especially those with respiratory distress would require insulin ideally patients with very poor oral intake or those on mechanical ventilation would require intravenous insulin infusion with frequent monitoring of blood glucose every hour or every 2 h see next section however the adjustment of infusion rates would necessitate visit to the patient and increase exposure to the medical personnel there is a need to explore alternate insulin administration strategies one of these is use of subcutaneous short acting insulin analogues an approach which has been used successfully in mild to moderate diabetic ketoacidosis however its safety in critically ill patients is less clear 6263 secondly single dose of basal insulin has been attempted in critically ill patients as in one study from thailand this could be an attractive option as it would reduce contact with the patient considerably 64 but needs more research especially in critically sick patients finally insulin pump or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion csii could be an option and some models have the advantage of altering the insulin rates remotely via bluetooth 65 fully automated closed-loop glucose control has been tried in critical illness and if feasible could be useful in treating patients with covid-19 66blood glucose monitoring poses a special challenge as it necessitates frequent visits to patients bedside especially if the patient is critically ill and receiving intravenous insulin however attempts could be made to minimize exposure if the patient is not critically ill heshe may be given a glucose testing device and self-monitoring may be taught blood glucose readings can then be communicated on phone and necessary action taken continuous glucose monitoring cgm could be of help especially the systems where the data can be remotely accessed without visiting the patient though there is some evidence of cgm interference with commonly prescribed medications like acetaminophen atenolol and lisinopril it has been shown to be useful and reliable in critically ill patients 6768treatment with ace inhibitors and arb has the potential to cause up regulation of ace-2 69 mice with coronavirus induced lung injury showed improvement when treated with an angiotensin receptor blocker losartan 70 a retrospective analysis showed reduced rates of death and endotracheal intubation in patients with viral pneumonia who were continued on ace inhibitors 71 however a contrary view is that increased expression of ace-2 could theoretically increase the risk of infection with sars cov-2 this could be a concern in people with diabetes who are at already elevated risk of infections because of many other factors however there is no evidence to support this hypothesis currently in a retrospective analysis of 112 covid-19 hospitalised patients with cardiovascular disease in wuhan there was no significant difference in the proportion of aceiarb medication between non-survivors and survivors 72 in view of lack of robust evidence for either benefit or harm it is reasonable for patients to continue using ace inhibitors and arb as recommended by european society of cardiology council on hypertension european society of hypertension and american heart association 73 74 75there are several studies about the protective effect of statins in pneumonia 76 statins are known to increase ace-2 levels and may protect against viral entry of sars cov-2 77 however this increase in ace-2 could be counterintuitive in the current context nevertheless statins are known to inhibit nuclear factor kappa b nfb activation and might help in blunting the cytokine storm 78calcium channel blockers ccb have been shown to reduce severity of disease and mortality in patients with pneumonia presumably by inhibiting calcium influx into the cell 79 the precise role of these agents in covid-19 has not been studied however it seems safe to continue these drugs for control of blood pressure in hypertensive patients since ccb has no effect on ace2 expression some researchers have proposed its preferable use in patients with covid-19 and hypertension 80though aspirin has anti-inflammatory properties it may not be advisable to continue it in patients with sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation however in patients with underlying coronary artery disease it needs to be continued as anticoagulant unless otherwise contraindicated

diabetes is associated with increased incidence and severity of covid-19 there is experimental evidence of the effect of diabetes on viral entry into cell and inflammatory response to the infection it is important to control blood glucose in patients who are infected with covid-19 treating diabetes at present with restrictions on movement is challenging however innovations like telemedicine can be useful in these trying timeswe hereby declare that we have no conflict of interest related to this articlethe coronavirus 2019 covid-19 pandemic has affected over 3 million people and caused more than 2 lac deaths in over 200 countries over a duration of four months there is no medicine or vaccine to date for treatment and symptomatic management is the present treatment plan severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers in the past and now covid-19 are recurring epidemic threats to humans this review has been undertaken to search probable modes that can be explored to find a drug treatment that can be used to treat covid-19 or any similar illness involving mainly the respiratory system the relatively benign coronavirus causing the common cold has taken a novel form utilizing newer pathways to enter the host and causing severe disease in some cases the coronaviruses contain a single-stranded 5 capped positive-stranded ribonucleic acid rna molecule that ranges from 26 to 32 kb the viral membrane contains the membrane m glycoprotein the spike s glycoprotein the envelop e glycoprotein and the nucleocapsid n protein a member of the renin-angiotensin system ras the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 protein has been reported to be the entry-point receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and novel sars-cov2 causing covid-19 the viral s protein interacts with the human ace2 which is present as a transmembrane protein to gain entry into the host 1-3the two enzymes of the renin-angiotensin system ras angiotensin-converting enzyme ace and ace2 serve contrasting functions ace converts angiotensin i agi into angiotensin ii agii and agii has vasoconstrictor and pro-inflammatory properties via its type1 receptor at1r ace inhibitors eg lisinopril and at1r inhibitors commonly known as angiotensin receptor blockers arb like losartan are very commonly used drugs for cardiovascular diseases like hypertension and cardiac failure the involvement of ras in the evolution and pathogenesis of lung diseases has received attention in recent years 4the histopathological reports of post-mortem studies of covid-19 deaths show diffuse alveolar damage hyaline membrane deposition fibrin exudates and consolidation by fibroblastic proliferation with the extracellular matrix and fibrin-forming clusters in air spaces 5-6 post-mortem findings of sars deaths showed features of diffuse alveolar damage dad with pronounced pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation in some areas there was interstitial thickening with mild to moderate fibrosis 7-8 the ace homolog ace2 which is the entry receptor for the virus is expressed abundantly in type ii alveolar cells and may have been a base for the rapid expansion of sars-cov and a vicious circle of local alveolar wall destruction resulting in rapidly progressive severe diffuse alveolar damage 9 considering the post-mortem findings of the lung the same may be true in covid-19 as opposed to ace soluble ace 2 has been shown to protect against lung injury the less spoken about angiotensin ii receptor type 2 at2r has anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in lung tissue and may be of significance in light of the lung pathology presentation in covid-19 it is imperative to assess the role of ace2 and at2r as the natural but forgotten protectors of the alveolar environment along with arbs in severe acute lung disease by the novel coronavirusangiotensin-converting enzyme ace and its homolog ace2angiotensin-converting enzyme ace is a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase expressed predominantly in the lung capillary endothelium and it converts the decapeptide angiotensin i agi to the octapeptide angiotensin ii agii agii has two main receptors at1r and at2r angiotensin ii via its at1r receptor causes vasoconstriction along with many other effects on the kidneys and brain to regulate the body fluid volume and blood pressure it also has pro-inflammatory properties a study suggested that the activation of the pulmonary ras influences the pathogenesis of acute lung injury acute respiratory distress syndrome and sars as they are attenuated by blocking the renin-angiotensin pathway 10 thus the inhibition of the aceagiiatr1 axis may be beneficial in the setting of its enhanced activity both ace inhibitors and arbs are used clinically to block the effects of agii but the arbs may have a much greater potential to block the renin-angiotensin system than ace inhibition because an estimated 40 of ag ii is formed via non-ace pathways eg chymase in humans 11-12in the year 2000 a new homolog of ace was identified separately by two groups and was named ace2 13-14 ace2 is a zinc metalloprotease with a 40 identity and a 61 similarity to ace 13 ace2 converts agi to ag 1-9 and agii to ag 1-7 by removing one amino acid from each ace2 is not inhibited by classical ace inhibitors like captopril enalapril and lisinopril 14 both the authors reported that ace2 is expressed mainly in the heart kidney and testis 13-14 later in a study using immunolocalization of the ace2 protein it was found that ace2 is expressed in many tissues including type i and type ii alveolar pneumocytes nasal oral and nasopharyngeal mucosa enterocytes of the small intestine endothelial cells and smooth muscles of blood vessels of all the tissues studied and weakly in bronchial epithelial cells 9role of ace2 in virus entry and lung protectionnumerous animal studies have been conducted to study ace2 after the discovery that sars-cov used it as a portal for entry these studies may be projected to covid-19 as its virus also gains entry through the same receptor the picture in severe cases in both sars and covid-19 is that of acute respiratory distress it was demonstrated in mice that ace2 was required for the effective replication of sars-cov in vivo as ace2 knockout mice showed a very low quantity of virus when they were infected with sars-cov 15 on one hand where ace2 was proved to be the entry receptor for novel cov on the other hand ace2 knockout mice showed very severe acute lung injury in aspiration endotoxin and peritoneal sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome ards models loss of ace2 expression in mutant mice resulted in enhanced vascular permeability increased lung edema neutrophil accumulation and worsened lung function 10 thus ace2 protects murine lungs from ards in ace2 knockout mice this protective effect of ace2 is probably by reducing agii by breaking it to ag 1-7 10 hence there is a protective effect of ace2 in acute lung injury with agii being the probable target in another study on mice downregulation of ace2 expression by sars-cov infections and its spike protein was reported a study also reported that treatment with exogenous recombinant ace2 protein improved symptoms of acute lung injury in wild type mice as well as ace2 knockout mice 16 thus ace2 has a dual role one to support virus entry into the host and two to protect against severe lung injuryin relation to ace2 the findings of studies comparing viruses nl63 and sars-cov are intriguing nl63 is another human coronavirus that uses the same ace2 for entry as does sars-cov but causes mild respiratory disease its interaction with ace2 is weaker than the sars-cov s protein interaction with ace2 nl63-cov and sars-cov have no structural homology in the receptor-binding domain rbd yet the two viruses recognize common ace2 regions 17 whether it is lower-affinity interaction with ace-2 or the difference in ace-2 signaling following sars-cov and nl63 s protein binding or it is the s protein itself that accounts for the differential pathogenicity of human coronavirus nl63 and sars-cov remains to be determined 17-18 recently it has been demonstrated that the covid-19 cov binds with ace2 as avidly as sars-cov 19 in a study comparing the two viruses it was reported that the sars-cov binds more efficiently to ace2 than nl63 and correlates with ace2 shedding 20 but working ahead on these findings with a revised experimental setup another study found that the ace2 shedding with nl63 was robust and depended on the fold increase in viral replication and occurred during the early phase of replication 21 with these observations it appears that the severity of the disease depends on the efficiency of the binding of the spike protein with ace2 as both sars-cov and cov2 have greater affinity than nl63 secondly the shedding and downregulation of ace2 expression does not seem to determine the potential severity of lung disease but is associated with higher viral replication a study in 2004 found that the soluble ace2 ectodomain specifically blocked infection by sars-cov s-bearing pseudotypes and this finding may be a breakthrough for covid-19 also 22 thus recombinant ace2 may be beneficial in blocking virus entry and in reducing lung injury in covid-19 via some missing link thus the double-edged sword ace2 must be explored to be used appropriately for conquering covid-19 by strategic administration through its considered inclusion in the predefined and agreed-on treatment protocol of covid-19angiotensin ii receptor subtype at2ragii the major effector peptide of the ras promotes vasoconstriction proliferation inflammation and fibrosis within the pulmonary vasculature and lung parenchyma via stimulation of at1 receptors the use of losartan to block the at1 receptor improved lung injury in this mouse model the aforementioned detrimental effects of agii may be counterbalanced by the activation of at2 receptors 23at2r has not been given much attention after its discovery as most of the functions of agii were operated via at1r and the significance of at1r in cardiovascular and renal pathologies became well-known the expression of at2r in healthy adults is often low and is mainly identified in the renal cardiovascular adrenal medulla brain tissues myometrium and ovaries 24-25 in contrast in fetal tissues at2r is the dominant receptor subtype 26 in the adult at2rs are re-expressed or upregulated under certain pathophysiological conditions such as mechanical injury or ischemia like myocardial infarction vascular injury brain ischemia and renal failure 2427 at2r exerts vasodilator anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects in a variety of disease models as well as natriuretic and antihypertensive effects in renal disease 28 the at2r-specific agonist may effectively dampen the pro-inflammatory and aggressive behavior in rheumatoid synovitis 29 thus at2r has proven anti-inflammatory effects in a variety of tissues the activation of at2r is thought to counter-regulate the pathophysiological effects of angiotensin ii agii induced by at1r 24at2r research gained momentum when the first nonpeptide at2r agonist compound 21 c-21 was introduced in 2004 24 a study investigated the effect of the at2r agonist c-21 in the bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis and reported the beneficial effects of c-21 which were associated with decreased infiltration of macrophages in the lungs reduced lung inflammation and diminished pulmonary collagen accumulation 30 in the monocrotaline mct-induced pulmonary hypertension rat model c-21 treatment reversed both interstitial and perivascular fibrosis furthermore a decrease in ace2 messenger rna mrna levels was observed in mct-induced pulmonary hypertension animals which was reversed by c-21 therapy with a two-fold increase in ace2 levels and a concomitant decrease in ace expression 23 the protective effect of ace2 has already been emphasized furthermore c-21 treatment normalized the at1at2 receptor ratio to restore the lung ras balance c-21 treatment prevented as well as attenuated the progression of lung fibrosis and the accompanying pulmonary hypertension thus in view of the above inferences the acute inflammatory lung pathology being observed in covid-19 may be ameliorated by the at2r agonistthree classes of drugs affecting ras may be candidates to ameliorate the acute lung pathology in covid-19 with the possibility of agii overexpression as the trigger in covid-19 lung pathology its inhibition may be of benefit here arbs like losartan may be more beneficial than ace inhibitors for the fact that sufficient agii is formed by ace non-dependent mechanisms cov2 uses ace2 to gain entry into the host and after gaining entry it causes the shedding and downregulation of ace2 to sabotage its anti-inflammatory and protective effect this along with the observation that the soluble ace2 ectodomain specifically blocked infection by sars-cov s-bearing pseudotypes shows that the use of soluble recombinant ace2 may be helpful in reducing lung injury in covid-19 our speculation is that at2r may be re-expressed in covid-related lung injury and hence the use of at2r agonists may also be explored to elicit their anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects bacterial communicable diseases were a menace and created havoc prior to the antibiotic era however during the last few decades public health focus has largely been on non-communicable diseases and related lifestyle interventions the sudden spurt of covid-19 and its global spread demands innovative approaches using forgotten enzymatic pathways as suggested in this study for magnanimous improvements in the clinical outcome among the covid-19 cases the herein suggested interventions with ace2 and at2 receptors agonist along with arbs may be beneficial in improving the clinical outcome of covid-19after entering the hostusually through aerosolized viral particles or contact with contaminated surfacesthe virus needs to undergo its biological cycle spike proteinsthat are coded by the s gene in one of the open reading frames of the viral genomeneed to interact with viral receptors on the surface of host cells sars-cov-2 spike proteins bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ace-2 which is expressed in the epithelial cells of the lungs 89 this is the main reason why coronaviruses often cause respiratory disease notably ace-2 may also be highly expressed in intestinal tissues 9 leading to diarrhea as observed in 60 of the patients during the sars-cov epidemic in 2002 only a few patients with sars-cov-2 infection had diarrhea although viral particles may be detected in the stool 10 after attaching to the ace-2 through the receptor-binding domain rbd of the s1 and s2 domains of the spike protein the viral envelope fuses with the host cell membrane and is further internalized genetic material a positive rna strand of approximately 20-32 kb is released into the cytoplasm for replication 1 thus the importance of ace-2 expression dynamics for viral infectivity tropism and pathogenicity is evidentace-2 or ace-related carboxypeptidase is an 805 amino acid transmembrane protein which is an important member of the renin-angiotensin system that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of blood pressure 11 ace converts angiotensin i ang i into angiotensin ii ang ii whereas ace-2 converts ang ii into angiotensin 1-7 ang 1-7 or angiotensin 1-9 ang 1-9 12 ang ii and ang 1-7 have antagonizing effects as ang ii binds to angiotensin 1 receptor at1r inducing vasoconstriction and increase in blood pressure whereas ang 1-7 binds to at2r leading to vasodilatation and decrease in blood pressure 1112as the renin-angiotensin system affects blood pressure and kidney function ace inhibitors and at1r blockers are widely used in hypertensive and cardiac patients 13 in this context the chronic use of ace inhibitors or at1r antagonists may be of particular relevance for patients infected with sars-cov-2 as they may alter the dynamics of ace-2 expression and thus increase susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infectionit has already been demonstrated by using hypertensive rat models that at1r blockade elevates ace-2 expression treatment with losartan and lisinopril either alone or in combination significantly increases ace-2 mrna in cardiomyocytes of rats this is associated with higher ang 1-7 plasma concentrations 14 this was corroborated by analyzing the heart tissue from rats with myocardial infarction that were treated with losartan 15 concordantly olmesartan a more effective at1r antagonist significantly increased both cardiac and renal expression of ace-2 in wistarkyoto rats 16 this is in agreement with the use of perindopril an ace inhibitor in rats 17another interesting feature of the dynamics of ace-2 expression in tissues is its ability to be cleaved from the cell surface by a metalloproteinase called adam17 tace 18 the ace-2 ectodomain gets cleaved releasing soluble ace-2 sace-2 whose role has not been fully elucidated however it has been shown that a higher concentration of sace-2 in the plasma correlates with a poorer prognosis after heart failure 19 notably sace-2 may also be detected at higher concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid in hypertensive patients this has been corroborated in nefhcrex at1arfloxflox mice indicating that ace-2 and sace-2 levels in the brain are associated with the etiology of neurogenic hypertension 20further it was demonstrated that ace-2 may be cleaved by other mechanisms for instance the sars spike protein may modulate adam17 expression which in turn cleaves ace-2 into its soluble form this was found to be dependent on the cytoplasmic domain of ace-2 as sirna against adam17 or ace-2 lacking intracellular domains abrogated this phenomenon 21 interestingly increased shedding of ace-2 correlates with worsening of the disease probably because of an increase in ang ii instead of ang 1-7 this leads to increased vascular permeability and local inflammation interestingly ace-2 cleavage from the cell surface may also occur in lung epithelial cells 22 thus cleavage of ace-2 into sace-2 would compromise the effect of ang 1-7 on at2r thereby reducing pulmonary hypertension and inflammationaltogether as depicted in figure 1 these data show that modulating the renin-angiotensin axis alters ace-2 expression in several tissues especially in the lung and heart tissues the use of ace inhibitors and at1r antagonists seems to upregulate ace-2 expression facilitating viral attachment and entry the further presence of the virus itself or some cytokines including tnf- leads to ace-2 release from the cell membrane abrogating its function to counteract ang iialtogether ace-2 overexpression may facilitate viral replication in lung tissue and promote lung vascular permeability a common feature of severe sars-cov-2 infection in summary this may greatly impact the outcome of sars-cov-2 infection in elderly and hypertensive patients as ace-2 is the putative attachment and invasion receptor for coronaviruses 823 in fact the use of tace inhibitors as sars antiviral agents has already been proposed in experimental models 2324ade is a phenomenon by which viruses use preexisting non-neutralizing antibodies from previous exposure to invade host cells through fc receptor-mediated internalization this is most commonly observed during secondary dengue virus denv infection causing severe hemorrhagic disease 25 notably the possibility of ade between zika virus zikv the causative agent of zikv congenital syndrome 26 and denv has been intensely debated recently 27-29 moreover ade has been the focus of debate for ebola 30 and hiv 31 infectionsduring ade preexisting antibodies elicited during a previous viral exposure are not able to neutralize viral particles during a secondary infection with any antigenic-related virus instead igg-opsonized viral particles then target fcr expressed on endothelial and immune cells facilitating viral internalization into host cells further after intense viral replication endothelial cells may respond by increasing vascular permeability and allowing exudate extravasation and bleeding however monocytes become highly activated and may initiate a cytokine storm 32in the context of sars-cov-2 it is plausible to think that ade occurs as mentioned in the introduction section elderly 60 yr patients are more susceptible to infection for unknown reasons as coronaviruses in general are highly prevalent in the global population causing mild infection and flu-like symptoms seroconversion into previous circulating coronaviruses is probably widespread thus it is reasonable to infer that elderly patients for obvious reasons have been exposed to previous infections more times than younger subjects this would imply a vaster repertoire of antibodies against coronavirus epitopes produced by long-living plasma cells which in fact has recently been shown to expand during sars-cov-2 infectionhowever whether these antibodies are either neutralizers or enhancers must be further addressed it is worth mentioning that concerning the new sars-cov-2 sequencing analysis of the viral genome isolated in wuhan china indicated that mutations mainly occurred within the coding sequence of the spike protein which has less than 40 sequence identity with that of previously circulated coronaviruses 1 these mutations may be responsible not only for the spill over from bats to humans but also for inducing ade as changes in spike epitopes may result in interactions with non-neutralizing antibodies corroborating this a novel epitope which was lacking in previous isolates was mapped 33as covid-19 is not a hemorrhagic disease it is probable that ade if present is not mediated by endothelial cells however it has already been shown that lung epithelial cells express high levels of fcriia 34 moreover immune cells including monocytes and dendritic cells highly express this receptor these populations especially monocytes greatly account for the inflammatory infiltrate in the lungs during pneumonia which is consistent with the transient lymphopenia observed in patients as circulating cells may migrate to the lungs conversely lung imaging of patients with severe covid-19 shows a great degree of lung opacity which is consistent with edema and cellular infiltrate 5 thus it is feasible that lung-infiltrating monocytes expressing fcr greatly favor sars-cov-2 replication in the lung tissue accounting for the greater susceptibility of the elderly patientscorroborating this hypothesis young individuals and children do not represent the risk group for severe disease which greatly differs from the case of influenza 7 for instance in the context of ade it is plausible to think that childrenas they had less or no exposure to previous circulating coronavirusescarry a very restricted repertoire of iggor only low-affinity igmwhich is not capable of inducing ade in this context mapping complementarity determining regions cdrs in iggs from young and elderly individuals would be of great importance not only to find neutralizing antibodies but also to address this hypothesisadditionally previous studies on mers and sars have already highlighted the possibility of ade a recent report published by wan y et al elucidated the mechanism by which monoclonal antibodies mabs induce ade in human cells interestingly mabs that target the rbd of sars and mers spike proteins induced conformational changes in the protein that favors an interaction with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 the receptor for mers 38 moreover immunocomplexes also promoted viral entry however increasing concentrations of antibodies block viral invasion as rbds become inaccessiblethis is consistent with previous findings by wang q et al39 who infected the promonocytic cell line hl-czthat expresses both ace-2 and fcrwith sars-cov-2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of anti-sera their data demonstrated that high concentrations of antibodies neutralized the virus whereas lower concentrations induced ade more interestingly the anti-sera also recognized spike protein-related antigensanother study on sars-cov-2 using rhesus monkeys showed that immunization with full-length spike glycoprotein led to increased disease severity mostly to because of an increase in neutralizing antibodies nab 35 the study demonstrated that nabs switched the phenotype of lung-infiltrating macrophages to a pro-inflammatory m1 profile instead of the tissue-healing profile m2 this aggravated lung injury and greatly contributed to its pathology conversely previous studies using samples from deceased patients suffering from sars-cov infection indicated that nab titers reached higher levels earlier in these patients compared to that in patients who survived 36 this may indicate that ade and the role of preexisting antibodies are in fact very relevant to the overall outcome of the infectionthus as indicated in figure 2 circulating antibodies instead of neutralizing the current circulating sars-cov-2 may bind to viral particles and thus promote fc-mediated internalization by lung epithelial cells and infiltrating monocytes contributing to the worsening of covid-19 these are the most recent and mechanistic studies on ade of coronaviruses thus far although the data are consistent whether the phenomenon of ade is observed in patients with severe covid-19 is yet to be determined noteworthy however is the fact that immune complexes of low-avidity antibodies at sub-optimal concentrations were also responsible for the worsening of the pulmonary disease caused by h1n1 during the 2009 epidemic 37sars-cov-2 is the newest threat to human health and needs emergency action from governments and public health agencies worldwide especially because of its pandemic potential as recently declared by the world health organization who in this context it is essential to rapidly and deeply address all the possibilities concerning the severity of infection especially in the elderly population that accounts for approximately 10-12 of the mortality rate here we present several relevant aspects that may contribute to the increased susceptibility of the aforementioned population to covid-19 we believe that i increased expression of ace-2 in hypertensive patients being treated with ace inhibitors and at1r blockers and ii previous exposure to circulating coronaviruses with low neutralizing capacity to sars-cov-2 may greatly contribute to the increased susceptibility of the elderly patients to covid-19 to determine whether these hypotheses are correct further investigations are needed not only to better understand the etiology of the current sars-cov-2 infection but also to be better prepared for future epidemicsperon jps conceived and wrote the manuscript nakaya h helped editing the manuscriptdear editorwe recently published an article highlighting the special concerns while managing patients with diabetes in the times of covid-19 pandemic1 there have been some concerns about the use of angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs which were not clarified in our publication2 we are summarising the current evidence in this regard and will try to arrive at a reasonable conclusionin the absence of a vaccine and an antiviral drug for the covid-19 infection several therapeutic approaches are being studied one such approach is the use of inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system namely ace inhibitors and arbs on the other hand some concern has been raised about the fact that patients on these agents might be at an increased risk of infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars cov-2angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ace-2 is the receptor for sars cov-2 as well as other coronaviruses and is expressed in type 2 alveolar epithelial cells and endothelium the s-glycoprotein on the surface of coronavirus binds to ace2 this leads to a conformational change in the s-glycoprotein and allows proteolytic digestion by host cell proteases tmprss2 ultimately leading to internalization of the virion3 viral s-glycoprotein tmprss2 and ace-2 inhibition are potential targets of therapy and possibly vaccine developmentas ace-2 is essential to coronavirus infection its blockade is thought to be beneficial in preventingtreating this infection a retrospective analysis found reduced rates of death and endotracheal intubation in patients with viral pneumonia who were continued on ace inhibitors4 mice with coronavirus induced lung injury showed improvement when treated with losartan5 as far as cvid-19 infection is concerned the data on ras activation or the effect of its blockade is limited at present hypokalaemia could be a marker of ras activation and high incidence of hypokalaemia has been reported in patients with covid-19 infection6despite these small studies suggesting the benefit of drugs acting on ras there is some data albeit scarce from animal models and human studies that treatment with ace inhibitors and arb could cause up regulation of ace27 ibuprofen and thiazolidinediones have also been shown to do the same8

9 increased expression of ace2 could theoretically increase the risk of infection with sars cov-2 this could be a concern in people with diabetes who are at already elevated risk of infections because of many other factors however currently there is no evidence to support this hypothesis in view of lack of robust evidence for either benefit or harm it is reasonable for patients to continue using ace inhibitors and arb as recommended by european society of cardiology council on hypertension and european society of hypertension10

11severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 sars-cov-2 causes a respiratory disease that led to the fatal coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic in late 2019 the sars-cov-2 outbreak was first reported in wuhan china that later led to a true crisis worldwide huang et al 2020 coronaviruses covs are large enveloped non-segmented positive-sense rna viruses they generally cause mild enteric and respiratory diseases in animals and humans glass et al 2004 most human covs such as hcov-229e oc43 nl63 and hku1 usually cause only mild respiratory diseases fouchier et al 2004 sars-cov-2 causes acute highly lethal pneumonia with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for sars-cov and mers-cov-2 fouchier et al 2004 in contrast to sars-cov sars-cov-2-infected patients rarely show prominent upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms on presentation most infected individuals exhibit dry cough 8399 and dyspnea 59482 with findings of bilateral ground-glass opacities on radiographic images guo et al 2020 huang et al 2020 in most severe cases the characteristic symptom is respiratory distress 55 grasselli et althe reported mortality varies based on race sex age and comorbid conditions baud et al porcheddu et al 2020 currently the true mortality still is not well-established as the mortality may occur up to 30 days post infection based on current literature most severe sars-cov-2 cases progressed within 1421 days after disease onset various laboratory abnormalities have been observed even preceding the significant respiratory dysfunction lu et al 2020 mortality related to sars-cov-2 in china as reported by the who is about 34 guo et al 2020 sohrabi et al 2020 the most severe cases have been predominantly reported in elderly or subjects with preexisting conditions predominantly cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and congestive heart failure zhou et al 2020 interestingly these risk factors are similar to the reported risk factors diabetes hypertension obesity associated with mers-cov related mortality although mers-cov respiratory disease occurred in younger individuals assiri et al 2013 world health organization 2013 these clinical and epidemiological observations may provide some direction on the mechanism of disease recent reports indicate that a significant portion of sars-cov-2 related hospitalization in the usa are below the age of 50 years given the fact of a higher prevalence of metabolic diseases including obesity hypertension cardiovascular diseases and diabetes in the us population moore et al 2017 this infection may cause higher mortality the virus gains entrance into its host cell via the ace2 receptor how the known epidemiological and clinical manifestation of sars-cov-2 infection may be explained by perturbations of physiological functions of the ace2 receptor due to receptor virus interaction will be discussed in this manuscriptsars-cov-2 is single-stranded positive-sense rna virus containing 2632 kilobase kb genome the viral envelope consists of a lipid bilayer where the viral membrane m envelope e and spike s structural proteins are anchored unlike other corona viruses sars-cov-2 does not use aminopeptidase n apn and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 as a receptor raj et al 2013 similar to sars-cov sars-cov-2 utilizes a novel metallocarboxyl peptidase angiotensin receptor ace 2 to gain entry into human cells donoghue et al 2000 turner et al 2002 li et al 2003 similar to other cov during viral entry into the host cell the spike proteins s on the envelope of sars-cov-2 are cleaved into s1 and s2 subunits kirchdoerfer et al 2016 s2 does not interact with the receptor but it harbors the functional elements required for membrane fusion of the virion the s1 proteinreceptor interaction is the pivotal determinant for sars-cov-2 to infect a host species s1 contains the receptor binding domain rbd and directly binds to the peptidase domain pd of ace 2 to gain entry into host cells turner et al 2002 li et al 2003 yan et al 2020 despite high similarity between the rbd of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 several amino acid variations are observed in the middle of the binding domain of sars-cov-2 which provide an increased affinity to bind to ace2 more effectively wang q et al 2020 yan et al 2020 peptidase activity of ace2 is critical for the virion to gain access into the host cytosol similar to sars-cov proteolytic cleavage of s1 containing the receptor binding domain rbd at the c-terminus of s1 protein of sars-cov-2 is required to initiate interaction with pd of the ace2 receptor li et al 2005 yan et al 2020 cleavage of s1 protein is achieved by acid-dependent proteolytic cleavage by one or several host proteases including cathepsins transmembrane protease serine protease tmprss2 tmprss4 or human airway trypsin-like protease hoffmann et al 2020 the exact protease has not been identified proteolytic cleavage is followed by fusion of the viral and cellular membranes furthermore it has been shown that s protein cleavage occurs at two different sites within the s2 portion of the protein with the first cleavage important for separating the rbd and fusion domains of the s protein and the second for exposing the fusion peptide cleavage at s2 belouzard et al 2009 binding of s1 to the ace2 receptor triggers the cleavage of ace2 by a disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain 17 adam17tumor necrosis factor-converting enzyme tace at the ectodomain sites lambert et al 2005 heurich et al 2014 oarhe et al 2015 additionally tmprss2 cleaves ace2 at the intracellular c-terminal domain heurich et al 2014 hoffmann et al 2020 both cleavages ectodomain and endodomain by adam17 and tmprss2 facilitate effective cellular viral entry it appears that this process leads to shedding of host ace2 receptor belouzard et al 2009 that may contribute to the loss of ace2 function and systemic release of s1ace2 complexgenerally fusion with the host plasma membrane occurs within acidified endosomes that requires cleavage at s2 exposing a fusion peptide that inserts into the membrane the potential beneficial effect of chloroquine on sars-cov-2 is due to its effect on the endosomal uptake and acidification the process of fusion with the host membrane is followed by the formation of a funnel like structure built by two heptad repeats in the s2 protein in an antiparallel six-helix bundle facilitating the fusion and release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm the viral replication genome of covs contains a variable number world health organization 2013 lu et al 2020 porcheddu et al 2020 sohrabi et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 baud et al of open reading frames orfs two-thirds of viral rna mainly located in the first orf orf1ab translates two polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab and this encodes 16 non-structural proteins nsp while the remaining orfs encode accessory and structural proteins fehr and perlman 2015 the rest of the virus genome encodes four essential structural proteins including spike s glycoprotein small envelope e protein matrix m protein and nucleocapsid n protein fehr and perlman 2015 after replication and subgenomic rna synthesis the viral structural proteins s e and m are translated and inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum er followed by movement along the secretory pathway into the endoplasmic reticulum-golgi intermediate krijnse-locker et al 1994 fehr and perlman 2015 the m protein directs most protein-protein interactions for assembly of virus the interaction of m protein with e protein is required to form virus-like particles vlps suggesting these two proteins function together to produce coronavirus envelopesbecause of the central role of ace2 receptor as the viral entry point the understanding of the functional role of aceangiotensin receptor at and ace2mas receptor is critical for the understanding of the pathophysiological changes due to sars-cov-2 infection understanding of the molecular downstream effects of angiotensin ang on cellular signaling may explain the observed clinical picture of severe respiratory distress myocardial injury renal failure and increased mortality due to sars-cov-2 infection among the aging population and subjects with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases zhou et al 2020 zhu et al 2020sequence analysis suggests that ace and ace2 exhibit 42 amino acid homology and ace2 has evolved through gene duplication donoghue et al 2000 ace2 maps to chromosome xp22 spans 3998 kb of genomic dna and contains 20 introns and 18 exons turner et al 2002 the ace2 gene encodes a type i membrane-bound glycoprotein composed of 805 amino acids marian 2013 functional domains include a c-terminal transmembrane anchoring region carboxy-terminal domain n-terminal signal peptide region and an hexxh zinc binding metalloprotease motif catalytic domain li et al 2003 cerd-costa and xavier gomis-rth 2014 ace receptors are expressed in almost all tissues while ace2 is expressed on alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells ace2 is highly expressed in capillary rich organs such as lungs and kidneys but also in the gut and brain hamming et al 2004 tikellis and thomas 2012 roca-ho et al 2017 genetic polymorphisms of ace and ace2 are associated with hypertension cardiovascular disease stroke and diabetes crackower et al 2002 ramachandran et al 2008 jang and kim 2012 fehr and perlman 2015 despite the structural homology between ace and ace2 they have divergent physiological function ace regulates the renin angiotensin aldesterone system ras ace2 counterbalances the deleterious effect of the aceras pathway through its downstream ace2angiotensin 1-7mas axis the critical role of ras has been shown in the pathogenesis of metabolic inflammatory diseases de kloet et al 2010 classical activation of angiotensin ii depends on renin and ace activity prorenin a 46kd protein is the inactive precursor of renin upon activation of the juxtaglomerular apparatus jg of the afferent arterioles of the kidneys specialized proteases cleave prorenin to renin once renin is released into the blood it cleaves angiotensinogen into angiotensin ang i ang i is physiologically inactive but acts as a precursor of ang ii the conversion of ang i to ang ii is catalyzed by ace ace is expressed primarily in the vascular endothelium of the lungs and kidneys wakahara et al 2007 but also on the epithelium of the lungs and upper respiratory system after ang i is converted to ang ii it binds to angiotensin ii type i at and type ii receptors in the kidney adrenal cortex arterioles and the brain figure 1a ang ii acts on the adrenal cortex to stimulate the release of aldosterone xue et al 2011 leading to sodium and water retention while the effects of ang ii are rapid the effects of aldosterone are retarted due to slower effects on downstream targeted gene transcription the overall physiological net effects of ras activation is an increase in total body sodium total body water and increased vascular tone furthermore the binding of ang ii to at receptors results in vasoconstriction gustafsson and holstein-rathlou 1999 endothelial injury watanabe et al 2005 endovascular thrombosis tay and lip 2008 and increase blood volume increased ang ii is associated with hypertension and accelerated thrombosis in arterioles by activating the coagulation cascade both thrombin and platelets senchenkova et al 2010 singh and karnik 2016 interestingly the thrombogenic effects of angii on the platelets was not reversible by application of aspirin jagroop and mikhailidis 2000 at the cellular level angiotensin ii induces various signaling pathways including serinethreonine kinase erk jnkmapk as well as pkc malhotra et al 2001 studies have shown that ang ii effectively induces il-6 and tnf- possibly through serine tyrosine kinases erkjnk mapk activation g protein coupled receptor activation or through interaction with mineralocorticoid receptors funakoshi et al 1999 han et al 1999 ruiz-ortega et al 2002 luther et al 2006 ang ii is a potent activator of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate nadph oxidase and hence an inducer of reactive oxygen species ros production garrido and griendling 2009 furthermore ang ii activates neutrophils and macrophages flux to the affected tissues and inhibits the production of nitric oxide and hence promotes vascular injury kato et al 1996 nabah et al 2004 these considerations provide new visions to develop targeted therapies as ang ii functions as a pluripotent mediator to enhance cytokines il-6 tnf and others oxidative injury by ros endothelial injury by inhibiting no synthesis and vasoconstriction therefore inhibition of only one of its targets for instance il-6 may not provide significant therapeutic benefit in these patients currently there is an ongoing clinical trial to study the effect of monoclonal antibodies against il-6 receptor clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04317092it is very important to note especially in the context of sars-cov-2 infection that besides the classical rasace mediated ang ii formation formation of ang ii can occur through alternative pathways by various proteases these include tryptensin cathepsin g tonin kallikrein neutral endopeptidase and chymase figure 1a these proteases can cleave ang i to form ang ii kramkowski et al 2006 lorenz 2010 becari et al 2011 uehara et al 2013 most of these proteases are localized in specific tissues lungs myocardium arterioles kidney or brain and are not sensitive to ace inhibitors interestingly targeted inhibition of ace using ace inhibitors only decreased ang ii levels for a short period of time and ang ii levels return to baseline 1 week after treatment with ace inhibitors mento and wilkes 1987 furthermore it has been shown that application of ace and ang ii receptor blocker arb inhibitors in animal models leads to an increase in the expression of ace2 ishiyama et al 2004 part of protective function of ace and arbs is considered to be due to upregulation of ace2 therefore it is possible that upregulation of ace2 may provide more available receptors for viral entry and hence a higher viral load associated with poor prognosis chu et al 2004 this also suggests that in subjects who are on ace inhibitors the activation of alternative pathways may play a significant role in the formation of ang ii diaz 2020 currently a clinical trial is ongoing to assess the effect of acearb inhibitors clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04330300 on sars-cov-2 infection if the alternative pathways in the formation of ang ii are important it is highly unlikely that the acearb inhibitors play a role on the clinical course of sars-cov-2 infectionace2 acts as a ligand through its recently identified mas1 receptor which is a g-proteincoupled receptor donoghue et al 2000 santos et al 2003 ace2 is a monocarboxypeptidase which cleaves ang i into a non-apeptide ang 1-9 and ang ii into a heptapeptide ang 1-7 santos et al 2003 marian 2013 both peptides have vasodilatory and antiproliferative and protective functions by activating the masg receptor the ace2ang 1-7mas1 axis provides an endogenous counter-regulatory mechanism within the reninangiotensin system ras that balances the deleterious effects of the aceang iiat1 receptor axis santos et al 2003 mice deficient in mas1 or ace2 receptors exhibit cardiac systolic dysfunction increased blood pressure myocardial interstitial fibrosis endothelial dysfunction and exhibit increased susceptibility to intravascular thrombosis chronic kidney disease metabolic abnormalities and various other biological abnormalities that regulate the cardiovascular system yamamoto et al 2006 tikellis and thomas 2012 ace2 activation prevents the deleterious effects of ang ii on the cells and organisms such as cell death fibrosis angiogenesis and thrombosis formation fraga-silva et al 2010 tikellis and thomas 2012 recent autopsy results on sars-cov-2 infected humans showed diffuse alveolar damage with massive capillary congestion accompanied by microthrombi in vascular beds but a paucity of inflammatory infiltrates menter et al 2020 however pathological examination on autopsies have not investigated if sars-cov-2 infection leads to total destruction of ace2 receptors on the alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells interestingly in an animal model of sars-cov oudit et al found a marked decreased ace2 expression in the heart of infected mice oudit et al 2009 the key product of ace2 activity is ang-1-7 which is considered a biologically active member of the ras by binding to mas it induces many beneficial actions such as vasodilation inhibition of cell growth and protection from alveolar epithelial cell injury in addition it has antifibrotic anti-thrombotic and antiarrhythmogenic effects le tran and forster 1997 schindler et al 2007 li et al 2008 it has been shown that the ace2-ang-1-7-mas axis has a protective effect on the brain and prevents ischemic stroke jiang et al 2013in addition to its protective role in the cardiovascular system ace2 has a direct protective role in alveolar epithelial cells in the lungs ace2 has numerous physiological functions most of which are protective against lung injury similar to the endothelial site ace2 degrades the octapeptide ang ii by removing a single amino acid from the c-terminal end of the peptide to generate the heptapeptide ang1-7 our laboratory and others have shown that ace2 protects against lung injury by a degrading ang ii which is vasoconstrictive and proapoptotic for lung epithelial cells wang et al 1999 and profibrotic li et al 2008 uhal et al 2011 and b by producing the peptide ang1-7 which inhibits the actions of ang ii through binding to the mas receptor gopallawa and uhal 2014 in support of this protective role for ace2 pharmaceutical preparations of recombinant ace2 when administered to experimental animals protect against lung cell death inhibit acute lung injury and prevent lung fibrosis after chronic injury to the lungs li et al 2008 rey-parra et al 2012 as further evidence the application of a specific competitive inhibitor of ace2 dx600 to primary cultures of isolated aces increases the level of ang ii released into the serum-free culture medium by autocrine mechanisms reduces the amount of released ang1-7 and importantly induces apoptosis inhibitable by the at1 receptor blocker menter et al 2020 thus functional ace2 normally expressed by alveolar epithelial cells can be viewed as a critical survival factor for these lung cells in addition the enzymatic product of ace2 the ang1-7 itself protects against lung cells death by antagonizing that actions of ang ii le tran and forster 1997 if ang1-7 is applied to cultures of lung epithelial cells it can prevent lung cell death in response to either ang ii or the er stress inducer mg132 nguyen and uhal 2016 the ang1-7 receptor mas and the jnk-selective phosphatase mkp-2 appear to be critical in this protective action of ang1-7 response becauses irnas or antisense knockdowns of mas or mkp-2 can eliminate the ability of ang1-7 to prevent lung cell death gopallawa and uhal 2016 indeed ang1-7 itself and congeners of the peptide such as cyclic ang1-7 gopallawa and uhal 2016 have already been shown to protect the lungs in preclinical models of acute lung injury simoes e silva et al 2013 gopallawa and uhal 2014currently there are no targeted drugs specifically against sars-cov-2 recent efforts have been put forward of drug repurposing by screening of various available antiviral agents with the aim to identify possible treatments among those lopinavir originally used for treatment of human immunodeficiency virus was identified to have potential antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 unfortunately a randomized-controlled open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection showed no benefit of lopanavir cao et al 2020 other studies suggested that remdesivir gs5734 an inhibitor of rna polymerase originally developed to treat ebola infections has in vitro activity against multiple rna viruses including sars-cov-2 mulangu et al 2019 experimental data suggested that at micromolar concentration of remdesivir and chloroquine potentially blocked virus infection wang m et al 2020 current clinical trials are ongoing to assess the efficacy of remdesivir treatment alone or in conjunction with chloroquine in sars-cov-2 infection because hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are considered inhibitors of endosomal trafficking of sars-cov-2 these drugs are used as potential therapeutics both drugs are antimalarial drugs that are also used as antiinflammatory drugs in various autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis lupus erythematosus and respiratory diseases such as sarcoidosis martin et al 2009 talreja et al 2019 despite the high media coverage currently there are no randomized clinical trials to support their efficacy against sars-cov-2 infection however it is conceivable that their efficacy may vary in different stages of virion life cycle and virus interaction with the host these drugs may be beneficial in early stages of the infection when the virus requires endosomal uptake in fact during the preparation of this manuscript several non-randomized clinical trials have suggested a lack of significant efficacy of antimalarial drugs in the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection magagnoli et al 2020corticosteroids are the most conventional immunosuppressant drugs used to suppress inflammatory responses cinatl et al 2005 although the who cautions of their use they have been widely used despite lack of scientific data furthermore because of the high incidence of arterial hypertension diabetes and congestive heart failure in subjects with covid-19 corticosteroids should be used with caution it is well-described that corticosteroids potentiate the effect of ang ii and ras ullian et al 1996 hence it is less likely that corticosteroids provide any significant clinical benefit in this clinical scenarioconsidering the significant sars-cov-2 related risk factors for hospitalization and mortality among patients with metabolic diseases including obesity arterial hypertension cardiovascular diseases and diabetes that may reflect overall activation of the ras system modulation of ras activation through the ace2ang1-7mas pathway should be considered for treatment of this disease furthermore our clinical observation and published clinical data suggest a unique clinical presentation of sars-cov-2 patients most patients present with relatively preserved hemodynamics and lack of lactic acidosis but they have respiratory distress appear to be in a hypercoagulable state liu et al 2020 menter et al 2020 exhibit progressive renal failure cheng et al 2020 have stroke like features and myocardial injury zhou et al 2020 clinical observational studies indicate that in most cases the respiratory distress occurs many days in general about 14 days after the infection suggesting that this may not be a direct effect of the initial viral infection but rather the hosts reaction to the loss of function of ace2 and dysregulation of ang iiace2 pathways as well activation of host proteases our central hypothesis is that the binding of the coronavirus spike protein to ace2 leads to shedding of ace2 receptors by various proteases which in turn leads to the loss of protective function of the ace2mas axis in the lungs and other organs figure 1b in addition to the loss of protective function of ace2mas activation of classical pathway acerasang ii and alternative pathways through tissue specific proteases including cathepsins chymase-like proteases leads to an excessive production of ang ii at the tissue level this process may further shift the balance of protective ang 1-7mas and ace2 function to the detrimental effects of increased ang ii contributing to lung epithelial and endovascular injury therefore induction of the downstream pathway of ace2 by activating the ace2ang1-7mas axis may prove a useful strategy in preventing lung and cardiovascular damage associated with sars-cov-2 infections because decreased ace2mas activity augments the ang iiat1r activity and its hazardous consequence on increased pulmonary vascular endothelialepithelial injury and lung pathology inhibiting the activity of proteases necessary for cleavage of viral spike proteins for instance inhibition of enzymatic activity of adam17 and tmprss2 could serve as other novel therapeutic targets this could potentially block viral interaction with the receptor and its entry into the cells identification of specific proteases and development of inhibitors targeting proteases necessary for cleavage of spike proteins may prove to be viable in addition exploiting the protective effect of ang1-7 or its analogs such as ave0991 ave0991 pinheiro et al 2004 against deleterious effect of increased ang ii is feasible and might be effective for the symptomatic treatment of these patientsbased on the importance of ace2 as a counterbalance to the deleterious effects of ang ii the loss of ace2 and ang1-7 may be detrimental to the organism surprisingly little is known about the effect of sars-cov-2 virus binding to ace2 and how the viral binding on this receptor may modulate the ace2 enzymatic activity impact its role as a survival factor critical questions that are yet to be answered include 1 what effect does sars-cov-2 binding to ace2 have on its enzymatic activity and on its protective actions toward lung epithelial cells and lung injury 2 what effects does sars-cov-2 infection of lung epithelial cellsendothelial cells have on ace2 expression in the lungs and other organs 3 do known inhibitors or activators of ace2 have any effects on the binding of sars-cov-2 to the ace2 receptor andor infection of lung epithelial cells regardless these are questions of fundamental importance to our understanding of sars-cov-2 biology that need to be answered soonthe original contributions presented in the study are included in the articlesupplementary material further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authorsboth authors read and approved the final manuscriptthe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interestthe infectious disease caused by the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 sarscov2 covid19 broke out in wuhan china and spread to almost every country in the world millions of people have been infected many have died and everyday life has changed completely the disease is accompanied by range of different symptoms figure 1 rapidly accumulating data show that prognosis for patients with covid19 is good in those with mild disease but severe cases show relatively asymptomatic early progression followed by rapid worsening after symptom onset culminating in acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and significant disease manifestations figure 2 the presence of sarscov2 has been detected in multiple organs on autopsy including the pharynx lungs heart liver brain and kidneys highlighting the multiorgan tropism of this virus
1

early clinical experience suggested that older age and the presence of a number of comorbidities including hypertension cardiovascular disease diabetes mellitus and chronic respiratory disease increased the risk of death in patients with covid19
2
 
3
 in addition the reninangiotensin aldosterone ras system specifically the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 protein has been identified as playing an important role in facilitating entry of coronaviruses including sarscov2 into target cells especially in the lungs
4
 
5
 therefore it has been suggested that angiotensin receptor blockers arbs and ace inhibitors which affect ace2 expression may influence the susceptibility to and severity of infection with sarscov2

hypertension is very common affecting an estimated 139 billion individuals worldwide
12
 and the prevalence of hypertension increases with age affecting approximately 70 of older adults
13
 in addition ras inhibitors such as ace inhibitors and arbs are recommended and widely used for the treatment of hypertension
14
 
15
 
16
 however hypertension is not a single clinical entity but it instead manifests as a number of different phenotypes in asians the disease is characterized by salt sensitivity high rates of masked hypertension exaggerated morning bp surge and nocturnal hypertension
17
 nearly half of all patients with hypertension worldwide 44 live in south or east asia
18

the hope asia network was established in 2016 and is a member of the world hypertension league
19
 
20
 the mission of the hope asia network is to improve the management of hypertension and organ protection toward achieving zero cardiovascular events in asia
19
 
20
 this has become even more relevant in the current pandemic with high rates of infection in several asian countriesthis guidance from the hope asia network summarizes the latest findings on covid19 and hypertension including evidencebased recommendations for the management of hypertension during the current pandemicon march 20 2020 the italian institute of health announced that there had been 3200 covid19 deaths in italy
21
 the patients who died had an average age of 785 years median 80 years range 31103 years and 987 had at least one comorbidity
21
 hypertension was a common comorbidity in italian cases affecting 738 of patients 52 of whom were taking arbs or ace inhibitors
21
 however there are number of factors that could potentially confound a possible relationship between hypertension and severe covid19 table 1
22
 
23
 
24
 
25
 
26
 
27
 the first is age both severe covid19 and hypertension are common in the elderly in addition the identified risk factors table 1 are generally associated with aging andor vascular disorders both of which are common in patients with hypertension therefore the risk of developing severe covid19 is more likely to be due to underlying vascular endothelial dysfunction andor organ damage than high blood pressure bp per se ace2 receptors are expressed by endothelial cells
28
 and postmortem examinations have detected the presence of viral infection in endothelial cells
29

the spike protein on the surface of sarscov2 binds to the extracellular domain of transmembrane ace2 with s protein priming by transmembrane serine protease 2 tmprss2 to gain entry to host cells figure 3

30
 ace2 plays a regulatory role in the ras converting angiotensin i ang i into angiotensin 19 ang 19 or angiotensin ii ang ii into angiotensin 17 ang 17
31
 
32
 currently available data reflect a possible role for ace2 in heart failure myocardial infarction hypertension and the cardiovascular complications of diabetes mellitus and preclinical investigations suggest that activation of ace2 might have the potential to protect against hypertension and cardiovascular disease
31
 
33
 
34
 
35
 in addition angiotensin 17 appears to counteract the negative effects of ang ii attenuating inflammation suppressing vascular permeability and having vasorelaxant effects
36
 
37
 
38
 furthermore ace2 in the lungs and the reninangiotensin system has been shown to play a role in the pulmonary manifestations of coronavirus infection
39

interaction of ang ii with angiotensin type 1 receptors at1r activates a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 adam17 on the cell membrane via phosphorylation
40
 in turn adam17 cleaves the precursors of tumor necrosis factor tnf and interleukin il6 receptor il6r in the cell membrane to release tnf and soluble il6r
41
 tnf activates the nuclear transcription factor system nfb to induce the production of various inflammatory cytokines including il6 figure 4
42
 this represents a potential mechanism for the cytokine storm seen in some patients with covid19 and highlights the potential for agents blocking cytokine pathways especially the il6stat3 axis in managing covid19related cytokine storm
43

the fact that the sarscov2 virus uses ace2 as a mechanism to enter and infect cells meant that there was concern that cells with high ace2 expression would be most susceptible to infection with sarscov2 given that arb and ace inhibitors have been shown experimentally to increase expression of ace2 on cell membranes
28
 
44
 there was much discussion about the potential for higher infection rates and more severe disease in patients being treated with these agentsdespite the theoretical possibility that use of ras inhibitors increases the risk of infection with sarscov2 and the severity of covid19 illness analyses including patients from the current pandemic indicate that this does not seem to be the case table 2the effect of hypertension or therapy with ace inhibitors or arbs has been evaluated in at least three published studies to date table 2
45
 
46
 
47
 reynolds et al looked at history of antihypertensive usage in 12 594 patients undergoing covid19 testing in new york usa
47
 they did not find any association between the use of ace inhibitors arbs betablockers calcium channel blockers or thiazide diuretics and the likelihood of a positive or negative result on covid19 testing
47
 also in the united states mehta and colleagues failed to find any significant association between the use of ace inhibitors or arbs and covid19 test positivity
46
 similar findings were reported in a population casecontrol study from italy
45

data from four studies published by early may 2020 also failed to find a significant association between ras inhibitor use and worse outcomes in patients with covid19 table 2
48
 
49
 
50
 in one retrospective case series the proportion of patients using ace inhibitors or arbs did not differ significantly between those with severe vs nonsevere covid19 or between survivors and nonsurvivors
48
 however the inhospital covid19 mortality rate was higher in patients with vs without hypertension 21 vs 11
48
 in the other studies death rates for patients taking ace inhibitors andor arbs were actually lower than those in patients not receiving these antihypertensive therapies
49
 
50
 one of the studies from china reported that levels of the inflammatory markers high sensitivity creactive protein and procalcitonin were significantly lower in patients with hypertension who were vs were not receiving ace inhibitors or arbs
49

there are two possible mechanisms of cardiovascular damage in covid19 the first is direct viral infection of myocardial and vascular cells and the other is a systemic inflammatory reaction or cytokine storm figure 5 myocardial injury at the time of admission or due to disease progression is a strong indicator of poor prognosis in patients with covid19 troponin is a highly sensitive and wellknown marker of myocardial injurya systematic review and metaanalysis of data published between 1 december 2019 and 27 march 2020 including 4189 patients from 28 studies showed a significant trend for higher levels of cardiac biomarkers in patients with more severe covid19
51
 on metaregression analysis the only factor significantly associated with higher levels of cardiac injury biomarkers was the presence of hypertension p  03 in addition more severe covid19 markedly increased the risk of acute cardiac injury risk ratio vs mild disease 599 95 confidence interval ci 3041180 p  001 in turn the risk of covid19related death was significantly increased in the presence of acute cardiac injury risk ratio 385 95 ci 213696
51
 another analysis also reported that patients with severe covid19 had significantly higher levels of troponin than those without severe disease standardized mean difference 256 ngl 95 ci 68445 ngl
52

early data from wuhan china showed that 12 of patients admitted to hospital with covid19 had acute cardiac injury
53
 subsequent analyses investigated associations between underlying cardiovascular disease or myocardial injury and mortality in hospitalized patients with covid19 n  187
23
 patients with vs without myocardial injury defined as elevated troponin levels were significantly older 74 vs 60 years p  001 and more likely to have hypertension 598 vs 234 p  001
23
 
25
 during hospitalization those with myocardial injury had higher rates of ards 585 vs 147 p  001 acute renal injury 85 vs 03 p  001 and death 512 vs 45 p  001 the appearance of myocardial injury increased the risk of death by 426fold compared to patients without myocardial damage independent of cardiac function based on ecg and echocardiography findings figure 6
23
 
25

ddimer is a biomarker that reflects activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis
54
 ddimer levels of 2 gml were an independent predictor of inhospital death in patients hospitalized with covid19 in wuhan china hazard ratio 515 95 ci 1292067 p  001
55
 the 2 gml cutoff had 92 sensitivity and 83 specificity for predicting inhospital mortality and therefore might be a useful biomarker for predicting outcome and informing treatment decisions in patients with covid19 the cumulative rate of thromboembolic events in patients admitted to hospital in milan italy with covid19 n  388 was 21 28 of those in intensive care and 7 for those not in intensive care despite use of thromboprophylaxis in all patients admitted to the intensive care unit and threequarters of those treated on a general ward
56
 about half of all thromboembolic events occurred within 24 hours of hospitalization and 2 of patients developed dic
56
 a consensus statement on the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolismassociated covid19 infection has been published
57
 this recommends that patients with covid19 undergo assessment for the risk of venous thromboembolism and bleeding and are monitored regularly to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of venous thromboembolism and the use of strategies pharmacologic andor mechanical to prevent venous thromboembolism
57

key points regarding the clinical management of covid19 particularly in patients with hypertension based on evidence published before may 5 2020 are shown in table 4data that have been rapidly compiled during the pandemic to date indicate that there are a number of factors and biomarkers that can be used to identify patients with covid19 who are at high risk of more severe disease and adverse outcomes including death age seems to be the most important risk factor especially for covid19related death and hypertension is the most common comorbidity in covid19positive deceased patients
21
 other comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases smoking chronic lung disease chronic kidney disease and a suppressed immune system also increase the risks associated with covid19 infection especially when multiple comorbidities exist in the same patient
21
 thorough history taking and baseline assessments are therefore important another important screening tool is oxygen saturation which indicates severe disease if 94 on admission
3
 
58
 the relevance of ability to tolerate hypoxia was highlighted in an analysis from china showing that covid19 patients of highaltitude origin had a lower mortality risk than those from lower altitudes
59
 determination of relevant biomarkers especially troponin and ddimer provides an indication of myocardial injury and thrombotic risk and can help inform appropriate treatment strategiesfor nonhospitalized patients with covid19 ongoing management of comorbid conditions is essential to minimize risk this includes lifestyle factors such as diet and sleep along with maintaining regular medications eg antihypertensives and antidiabetics patients with hypertension on current therapy with ace inhibitors or arbs can continue treatment without any negative effects on covid19 outcomes ras inhibitors are particularly beneficial in patients who have heart failure or renal disease because they have a positive effect on prognosis for older patients with hypertension and no other comorbidities and risk factors calcium channel antagonists might be a good option for antihypertensive therapy maintaining good glycaemic control is also important because this might help reduce the risk of infection with sarscov2 and the severity of covid19
60
 in addition regular monitoring of home bp will help to ensure the achievement and maintenance of bp targets in patients with hypertensionlockdown requirements could impact on the ability of individuals to get regular exercise regular exercise is important for maintaining health status
61
 and to counteract the negative consequences of cardiovascular metabolic and respiratory diseases
62
 even if unable to get outside continuing some form of homebased exercise would be beneficial especially in older adults
63
 maintaining regular exercise could help to ensure that the current viral pandemic does not contribute to the worldwide obesity epidemic which in turn increases the rate of cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities
64
 ensuring that the world population is not burdened by high rates of noncommunicable diseases might help lessen the impact of future pandemics given that patients with comorbidities tend to fare poorly during an infectious disease pandemic
64
 another potential benefit of physical activity is its ability to stimulate immune function
65
 something that is highly relevant during a global pandemichealth care professionals should also be aware of the potential noninfectious impacts of covid19 for example noninfected individuals might be at risk of developing stressrelated physical health conditions such as gastrointestinal disturbances and cardiovascular disease and psychological disturbances such as anxiety and depressionstrict lockdown and social distancing rules are being enforced in many countries to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus in addition a large proportion of elective or nonessential procedures have been postponed or canceled to allow health care systems to cope with the influx of infectious disease cases this has created a requirement for a large proportion of health consultations to be conducted remotely telemedicine strategies are ideally suited to facilitating patient management in the absence of facetoface consultations and the value of this approach which has otherwise been slow to be widely used in clinical practice has become clear
66
 
67
 one of the hidden blessings of the covid19 pandemic may be the widespread adoption of telemedicine approaches to improve patient managementoutofoffice bp monitoring is a recommended approach for the diagnosis and management of hypertension

75
 therefore this field of medicine is better placed than many to be able to continue to effectively manage patients during a global pandemicnew information and communication technologybased home bp monitoring devices that perform automatic fixedinterval bp measurement during sleep and store or transmit the data could facilitate a novel approach to patient management
76
 validated wearable technologies for evaluation of home bp
77
 
78
 might also be useful for patient monitoring and management during the covid19 outbreak telemedicinebased strategies for managing bp were implemented and used effectively during the aftermath of the great east japan earthquake and tsunami in march 2011
79
 highlighting their potential for use during the covid19 pandemic to ensure that patients with hypertension have wellcontrolled bp this has the potential to help mitigate the negative effects of hypertension on prognosis in patients with covid19patients with hypertension are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality if they become infected with sarscov2 although this is confounded by other factors such as age and vascular disorders however all usual antihypertensive therapy including ras inhibitors should continue physicians need to take a holistic approach to patient management due the wide range of possible complications and biomarkers can provide important prognostic information overall multidisciplinary management of covid19 based on a rapidly growing body of evidence will help ensure the best possible outcomes for patients including those with risk factors such as hypertensionall authors report no potential conflicts of interest in relation to this articlewe are currently in the midst of a covid-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the global shutdown with more than a third of the worlds population facing some form of lockdown or quarantine measures is on an unprecedented scale and will no doubt be etched in history at the time of writing more than 2 million people have been diagnosed to have the infection with more than 50000 deaths worldwide it is expected that an even larger number are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and undiagnosedduring this time while the worlds focus is on the novel coronavirus there is a danger that other illnesses might be overlooked members of the public are being urged not to attend emergency departments for non-urgent matters with the dual intention of protecting healthcare workers whilst freeing resources to treat the covid-19 patients indeed hospitals have reported a decrease in the number of patients attending emergency departments with myocardial infarctions and cerebrovascular accidents 1 2 it is likely that patients are concerned about contracting the virus while attending the hospital and are staying away as there are reports of delayed presentation of patients with acute myocardial infarctions 3 it is imperative that these other life-threatening conditions are not forgotten while we deal with the coronavirusin addition to the acute conditions management of stable chronic illnesses such as hypertension and diabetes may also be affected many hospitals worldwide have cancelled all in-person elective patient care including routine outpatient clinics and moved towards telemedicine as part of social distancing measures doing so also preserves resources to help tackle supply chain problems and other challenges created by a surge in patients infected by the novel coronavirus even in these circumstances it is important that blood pressure and blood glucose levels are monitored regularly this is particularly important as patients with diabetes and hypertension may be at higher risk for complications of covid-19 4early data from china and the united states suggest that hypertension appears to be the most prevalent comorbidity among patients admitted with covid-19 being present in at least 3049 of them 4 5 hypertensive patients who develop covid-19 are more likely to be admitted to hospital than normotensive individuals 6 the presence of hypertension also seems to be associated with poorer outcomes from covid-19 7 it not clear whether it is hypertension per se that contributes to the increased morbidity or whether patients with hypertension have more underlying health problems as data have confirmed that patients with multiple comorbidities are likely to fare worse 8 we should bear in mind though that these are retrospective data from patients admitted with covid-19 and therefore can only suggest association and not causation nevertheless the interaction of sars-cov-2 virus with ace2 in the endothelial cell 9 does raise the possibility that endothelial dysfunction which commonly occurs in hypertension 10 may exacerbate the effect of the virusa major problem during a pandemic with a hitherto-unknown organism is early conflicting data that can cause uncertainty and confusion in the management of these patients it has been shown that sars-cov-2 binds to cells via the angiotensin converting enzyme ace 2 receptor 9 thereby gaining entry to the cells concern was therefore raised at the start of the pandemic that ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs medications that are commonly used for hypertension and heart failure could have a potential deleterious effect 11 as ace2 is widely expressed in the cardiovascular system and is up regulated by these drugs in some tissues in a subset of animal models 12 13 these initial publications led to a considerable amount of discussion and debate with the counter argument being that ace inhibitors and arbs have been shown to protect from lung injury in experimental models of coronavirus infections 14 these agents have also previously been demonstrated to reduce systemic inflammation and could potentially reduce the degree of multi-organ failure seen in severe covid-19 15 it was also considered that uncontrolled blood pressure or heart failure that could ensue as a result of discontinuation of these therapies and could contribute to morbidity in infected patients guidance was promptly issued advising that these drugs not be discontinued 16 17 subsequent data have raised the possibility that patients treated with ace inhibitors or arbs do indeed have a better outcome with the crucial caveat that the possibility of unmeasured confounding and bias precludes drawing cause-effect conclusions from the clinical studies available thus far a recent retrospective study from china comparing outcomes on hospitalised patients with covid-19 with and without ace inhibitors or arbs for hypertension has suggested that in the former all-cause mortality was lower adjusted hr 042 95 ci 019092 p  003 18 another retrospective study from china showed that fewer patients on ace inhibitors or arbs had severe disease as compared with those who were not on these drugs 235 and 48 respectively the ace inhibitorarb-treated group also had significantly higher cd3 and cd8 t cells and a trend towards lower il-6 levels 19 more recent analyses preprints though have suggested that after adjustment for certain likely confounders the signal for improved outcomes is no longer as strong as first believed 20 in the end the effects of treatment with ace inhibitors or arbs will only be positively identified through rcts which are ongoing 21there is also mounting concern about possible thromboembolic complications of the virus and a possible procoagulable state 22 various factors which can lead to a hypercoagulable state such as inflammation hypoxia immobilisation dehydration and diffuse intravascular coagulation have been described in covid-19 in addition hypertension has also known to be associated with a hypercoagulable state 23 and it is possible that an interaction between these two conditions might lead to a worsening thrombotic milieuwe are still learning more about this new virus and information continues to mount in the meantime it would be prudent to continue the guideline-based management of all chronic conditions and cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension healthcare practitioners need to ensure that patients are appropriately advised and have access to their drugs patients should be made aware that despite the lockdown pharmacies and hospitals are still open indeed the british heart foundation has recently issued a notice reminding the public not to ignore chest pain and seek help immediately as they also report a 50 drop in patients presenting with a myocardial infarction since the start of the pandemic 22 general practitioners and family physicians are still available for consultations even if it is over the telephone patients should also be encouraged to monitor their blood pressure at home be adherent with treatment and adopt healthy lifestyles in many countries individuals are allowed to go out to exercise while ensuring they maintain social distancing and take all the other necessary precautions as advised by their public health authoritiesthis current pandemic has brought about profound changes in the social and economic lives of many it has also changed the way healthcare is being delivered and prioritised even when social restrictions are relaxed it is hard to imagine that things would quickly if ever go back to how they were before the pandemic whilst we get used to the new normal way of life we should remember that other diseases and illness are still out there and still need our care perhaps this is a time for much of the control of chronic illnesses to go back to the community and the patients we have to ensure that patients with chronic illnesses are not forgotten in our fight against sars-cov-2 and do not end up as collateral damageangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is a

ace2 processes angiotensin i and the at1 and at2 receptor agonist angiotensin ii to produce angiotensin 19 and the mas receptor agonist angiotensin 17 respectively but its exact role in the renin-angiotensin system ras needs to be clarified one group has reported that c57bl6 ace2  mice exhibit a severe reduction in cardiac contractility which is rescued in the ace ace2  double knockout6 in contrast another group has disclosed that ace2  mice of 129svev c57bl6 and mixed background do not exhibit cardiac contractility defects but have increased susceptibility to angiotensin ii-induced hypertension7 while a third group has revealed that male ace y mice are more susceptible to heart failure and death after transverse aortic constriction than their normal littermates8 supporting a role for ace2 in cardiac function transgenic mice overexpressing ace2 in the heart have lower mean arterial pressure with rare focal myocyte vacuolization myofibril splaying and nuclear enlargement many of these mice develop terminal ventricular fibrillation with lethal arrhythmias9
furthermore male ace2 y mice but not female ace2  mice also accumulate fibrillar collagen in the renal glomerular mesangium leading to development of glomerulosclerosis of the kidneys10 in addition ace2  mice exhibit lower body weights than wild type mice with reduced fat mass11 moreover ace2 is also utilized by the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus as the receptor for infection12 ace2  mice are resistant to sars corona virus infection13 finally ace2  mice have enhanced vascular permeability increased lung edema and worsened lung function in several murine acute respiratory distress syndrome ards models14 with the many potential functions of ace2 small molecule inhibitors of this enzyme could be utilized to help further define the physiological roles of this proteaseace2 belongs to the zinc metalloprotease family and it has been reported that classical ace inhibitors such as captopril and lisinopril do not attenuate ace2 enzyme activity as part of a strategy to discover lead molecules for an ace2 inhibitor program a directed screen of ace2 versus a set of metalloprotease inhibitors from the glaxosmithkline compound collection was performed surprisingly although confirming that classical ace inhibitors like captopril were inactive in the screen the thiol acid 1a was identified as a potent ace2 inhibitor k

the thiol analogs 1a1s were prepared as depicted in scheme 1
 the acids 3a3s were activated in situ via the carbodiimide converted into the activated esters with the aza-hydroxybenzotriazole and then coupled to the amine hydrochloride 4 to produce the fully protected amides subsequent hydrolysis of the methyl ester as well as the thioacetate with lithium hydroxide afforded the thiol acids 1a1s17
the thiol acids 3a3s were produced by three different routes acids 3c and 3e were prepared by reaction of the commercially available thiols 2c and 2e xs with acetyl chloride in contrast the acids 3k 3m and 3n were produced from the alcohols 2k 2m and 2n xo via the mitsunobu reaction with thioacetic acid18 alternatively the acids 3a3b 3d 3f3j 3l and 3o3s were synthesized from the commercially available amino acids 2a2b 2d 2f2j 2l and 2o2s xnh by diazotization of the amines to afford the bromides then subsequent displacement of the bromides by potassium thioacetate with stereochemical inversion some stereochemical erosion presumably resulting from formation of the -lactone before nucleophilic trapping resulted during the mitsunobu and diazotization reaction steps but after coupling with the amine 4 the minor diastereomer could be removed via chromatographythe structureactivity relationships of p1 analogs are depicted in table 1

 it provides insight into the sar of the thiol series in addition to binding to the imidazole nitrogens of 374his and 378his and the carboxylate of 402glu the active site zinc coordinates the thiol of the inhibitor also the terminal carboxylate of the inhibitor forms electrostatic interactions with the guanidine of 273arg and accepts hydrogen bonds from the imidazoles of 345his and 505his moreover the carbonyl of 346pro accepts a hydrogen bond from the amide nitrogen of the inhibitor while the amide carbonyl is stabilized by a hydrogen bond to 515tyr furthermore the p1 methylene biphenyl substituent of 1i forms significant lipophilic interactions with the quite large s1 channel composed of the lengthwise canal between the two subdomains including residues 274phe 276thr 346pro 367asp 370leu 371thr and 374his this biphenyl substituent is hypothesized to occupy a different part of this large pocket than the carboxyl inhibitor co-crystallized in 1r4l the p1 r-sec-butyl group of the inhibitor forms van der waals interactions with the s1 pocket composed of 347thr 504phe 510tyr and 514arg as shown in the close-up of the s1 subsite depicted in figure 2
 510tyr forms part of a pocket which the -branched methyl of the p1 r-sec-butyl group occupies larger substituents are disfavored as they would require movement of the phenol side chain of 510tyr thus this model agrees with the sar since the s1 subsite can tolerate cyclobutyl and cyclopentyl substituents but is less accepting of a cyclohexyl groupa model of the inhibitor 1i
19 20 docked into the active site of ace focusing on the s1 subsite based on the x-ray structure of lisinopril with ace22 is shown in figure 3
 from the model it is apparent that the methyl group of the r-sec-butyl p1 moiety of inhibitor 1i bumps into the enzyme helping explain the 330-fold selectivity for ace2 versus ace the branching nature of 518val atom cg1 makes this portion of the s1 pocket smaller than in ace2 518val is the homologous residue in ace to 510tyr in ace2 this 510tyr to 518val substitution from ace2 to ace and resulting alteration of the s1 pocket volume helps explain the reduced ability of ace to accommodate -branching in p1 substituentsalthough x-ray structures of nep co-crystallized with a thiol-based inhibitor pdb code 1y8j23 and an analog with a p1 bi-phenyl moiety pdb code 1r1h24 are available as nep belongs to a different metalloprotease family m13 vs m2 no reasonable model of these thiol inhibitors bound to nep could be determined to help explain the increase in nep selectivity of -branched p1 analogs likely protein movement to accommodate potent nep inhibitors like 1o is required the movement of multiple amino acid residues in proteins is difficult to predict accuratelyin summary a series of -thiol amide-based inhibitors of ace2 with varied substituents at the p1 position were synthesized inhibitors containing linear alkyl p1 moieties were some of the more potent analogs in the ace2 enzymatic assay the smaller -branched p1 substituents exemplified by inhibitors 1i and 1l maintained similar potencies and increased selectivity versus ace and nep information gained from these studies has proven to be useful in the design of other ace2 inhibitors these inhibitors will be reported in due course furthermore a potent pan aceace2nep inhibitor 1o and a potent dual ace2nep inhibitor 1p have been identified these tools may prove useful in further defining the roles these

symptoms progressing in some cases to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 1 2 or myocarditis 36 covid-19 was classified as a pandemic by the world health organization who on march 11 2020 the disease has reached nearly every country as of april 16 2020 there were 2090110 confirmed cases worldwide with 139469 deaths 7 the death and disability from covid-19 combined with the lack of approved treatments have created an unmet need for efficacious therapiesas researchers and pharmaceutical companies race to develop vaccines and antivirals some have turned to remedies with little to no supporting evidence at least 300 iranians have died and 1000 have sustained blindness and brain damage from methanol poisoning in the mistaken belief that alcohol could prevent coronavirus infection 8 social media have propagated the misinformation that snorting cocaine or bleach will prevent infection 911 the desperation of these acts speaks to an urgent unmet need for effective therapeutics against sars-cov-19we intend for this review to familiarize readers with the toxicities of potential therapeutics for covid-19 and possible treatments for those toxicities this review draws on multiple sources combining news articles social media posts and peer-reviewed research we identified the substances included in this review based on discussion in the media and our experience as practicing physicians scientists and pharmacists we rely on industry or news reports if no other source of information was available our discussion here presents our knowledge of novel therapeutics as publicly known in early april 2020this article will discuss some therapeutic options against sar-cov-2 using the life-cycle of sars-cov-2 to understand the mechanism and toxicity of each agent we will discuss 1 viral cell entry inhibitory eg chloroquine hydroxychloroquine apn01 2 viral replication inhibitors eg protease inhibitors nucleotide analogs 3 nucleic acid vaccines and 4 miscellaneous

infect humans 229e nl63 oc43 hku1 mers-cov sars-cov-1 with three sars-cov-1 mers-cov and sars-cov-2 causing severe disease in humans 3 the genetic sequence of sars-cov-2 closely resembles that of sars-cov-1 a beta-coronavirus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic in 2003 much of our current understanding of sars-cov-2 is based off in vitro and in vivo experiments conducted to investigate the pathogenesis of sars-cov-1coronavirus spreads between humans through respiratory droplets sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 gain entry when the spike protein on the surface of the viral capsid binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme ii ace2 on type ii alveolar cells leading to fusion of the viral and host cell membranes and injection of the viral rna into the host cytoplasm 12 once inside the cell the virus replicates its genetic material and then releases newly created virus particles virions each of these steps is an opportunity for treatments to disrupt the normal coronavirus life cycleresearchers are currently investigating treatments for covid-19 by developing vaccines and novel drugs as well as testing existing medications a vaccine against sars-cov-2 may be clinically available in 1218 months 13 medications approved by the food and drug administration fda for other purposess such as chloroquine are being repositioned to treat covid-19 therapeutic repurposing ie repositioning is an expedited drug-development strategy to reuse currently fda-approved therapeutics for new medical indications on march 28 the fda granted emergency authorization for the use of chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate to treat covid-19 14 the european medicines agency recommended restricting their use pending the outcome of clinical trials 15 the american academy of clinical toxicology aact the american association of poison control centers aapcc and the american college of medical toxicology acmt recommended in a joint press release that use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine should occur only under the direction of a medical provider for an fda-approved indication or as part of a trial for the treatment of covid-19 or as part of an approved hospital protocol 16our discussion does not cover all drugs and is not intended to be exhaustive in the absence of direct evidence we expect drugs of a similar class to have similar toxicitychloroquine is a 4-aminoquinoline primarily used to treat malaria an infectious disease caused by several plasmodia species chloroquine concentrates in acidic environments such as the digestive vacuole of plasmodia spp or the golgi apparatus of human cells chloroquine prevents plasmodia from crystallizing heme to hemozoin 17 leading to a buildup of heme that becomes toxic to the parasite the golgi apparatus is a collection of vesicles where post-translational modifications such as glycosylation occurchloroquine freely diffuses into vacuoles the acidic environment of the vacuole favors the protonated charged form which cannot freely diffuse away ion trapping leading to a buildup of chloroquine in the vacuoles chloroquine alters the glycosylation of ace2 which decreases the affinity of ace2 for the coronavirus spike protein reducing sars-cov-2 entry in vitro 18 additionally chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine inhibit the toll-like receptor tlr pathway the tlr pathway is involved in pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling 19chloroquine was found to inhibit sars-cov-1 infection and he sequence and structure homologies between sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 suggest that chloroquine could reduce sars-cov-2 infectivity 18 indeed one in vitro study demonstrated that chloroquine inhibits sars-cov-2 entry 21 guangdong province recommended 500 mg chloroquine twice a day for 10 days for any person diagnosed with covid-19 without contraindications to chloroquine 20 one abstractcommentary suggests efficacy but cites an audio transcript of a press conference in guangdong china the supporting data for which is not available 22doses greater than 5 grams of chloroquine are associated with mortality due to ventricular dysrhythmias and hypokalemia 23 cardiovascular collapse and profound hypotension  can occur within 13 hours of overdose sodium channel blockade results in qrs widening on ecg 24-26 neurologic effects include seizures and cns depression 27 oxidative stress can lead to hemolysis particularly in patients with g6pd deficiency potassium channel blockade can result in prolonged qtc interval and torsades de pointes and clinicians should avoid using qt prolonging agents if chloroquine toxicity is presentin this current pandemic a man in arizona died after ingesting chloroquine phosphate a form of chloroquine used for treating aquariums using it to self-medicate 24 and cases of chloroquine poisoning have been reported in nigeria 25 it is important to store chloroquine safely to avoid secondary harm as little as 10 mgkg of chloroquine in children which could be 12 pills requires medical evaluation 27 mgkg was the lowest fatal dose in toddlers 28hydroxychloroquine is a derivative of chloroquine it is considered less toxic the difference in mechanisms of action between chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is not fully understood chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are dealkylated into desethylchloroquine by cyp3a45 and 2c8 29 hydroxychloroquine is also dealkylated into desethylhydroxychloroquine by 2d6 19 chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine inhibit 2d6 which can increase serum concentrations of metoprolol propranolol opiates antidysrhythmics antidepressants and antipsychotics 30the minimum fatal dose of hydroxychloroquine is not well defined the minimum dose reported to elicit severe symptoms hypotension hypokalemia and ventricular dysrhythmias is 4 g 31 one case report from 1965 for which the full text is not available describes a 16 year old who died after reportedly ingesting 12 g of hydroxychloroquine 32 an 18-year-old girl who ingested 20 g of hydroxychloroquine developed hypokalemia hypotension and ventricular tachycardia but survived with intubation epinephrine infusion high-dose diazepam and potassium repletion 33 see treatment of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine toxicity section three other case reports describe a total of five severely symptomatic patients who survived overdoses of 2036 g of hydroxychloroquine with aggressive interventions including epinephrine and high-dose diazepam 3336data regarding the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in treating covid-19 are limited one clinical trial that has not been peer reviewed suggests that in patients with a clinical diagnosis of covid-19 25 out of 31 who received hydroxychloroquine clinically improved after 5 days as compared with 17 out of 31 in the control group 37 in that study one patient who received hydroxychloroquine developed a rash without mucosal involvement and another developed a headache both resolved without interventionin 1988 riou et al published a prospective study of 11 patients who were anticipated to have a likely lethal ingestion of chloroquine greater than 5 g of chloroquine and compared them to 11 historical controls these individuals were treated with epinephrine infusion initial 025 gkgmin titrated to sbp  100 mmhg 2 mgkg of diazepam over 30 min intubation and nasogastric aspiration diazepam was continued at 12 mgkg per day over 24 days ten of these 11 patients survived to hospital discharge compared with 1 out of 11 patients in the control group 23 diazepam perhaps not intuitively was incorporated in this combination therapy due to animal 38 and human evidence that it may be beneficial in combined overdoses this study has largely shaped the recommended treatment of epinephrine and high dose diazepam though not without some controversy regarding its generalizabilityhypokalemia is a common finding in chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine overdose and is likely due to intracellular shift of potassium in a retrospective study of 191 patients with chloroquine toxicity a serum potassium lower than 30 mmoll was correlated with mortality and the serum potassium decreased as serum chloroquine levels increased 39 the linear relationship between serum potassium and chloroquine concentrations suggests that hypokalemia reflects an effect of chloroquine itself although the severely ill patients also received epinephrine infusions beta-adrenergic agonists can cause intracellular potassium shifts total body potassium stores are not expected to be depleted in the setting of chloroquine toxicity raising concern for rebound hyperkalemia as toxicity resolves as such some clinicians recommend less aggressive potassium repletion supplementing normal daily potassium with 80 meq per 24 h 39 though if severe hypokalemia is present it would be reasonable to replete while observing for rebound hyperkalemia the treatment for acute toxicity from hydroxychloroquine is thought to be the same as for acute toxicity from chloroquineqrs prolongation from xenobiotic-induced sodium channel blockade is often treated with sodium bicarbonate boluses and infusions administration of sodium bicarbonate may treat the cardiac sodium channel blockade but worsen hypokalemia so patient-specific characteristics must be considered when weighing the use of this therapylipid emulsion therapy did not lead to return of spontaneous circulation when given during cardiac arrest for either a hydroxychloroquine ingestion or a combined ingestion of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine 40 two case reports suggest that lipid emulsion can reverse hypotension averting cardiac arrest 41 42 in the second case report one patient received lipid emulsion therapy and did not develop significant cardiotoxicity beyond a prolonged qtc interval although this patient ingested a smaller dose of hydroxychloroquine 5 g 42 extracorporeal circulatory support could be considered for severe overdoses refractory to other treatments 43chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can both lead to retinopathy it is rare for this toxicity to develop before 5 years of therapy 44 and is not expected with short-term use of 3995 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who ever used hydroxychloroquine 65 discontinued it because of eye complaints although probable or definite retinal toxicity was documented in less than 1 the risk of retinal toxicity increased by fivefold once lifetime exposure reached 1 kg 44 long-term use of hydroxychloroquine has also been associated with cardiomyopathy 45 46clinicians should also be mindful of secondary effects of an increase in demand for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat covid-19 hydroxychloroquine is used to treat systemic lupus erythematosus sle some patients with sle have been unable to fill their prescriptions due to shortages 47 some state pharmaceutical boards have noted surges in prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine

recombinant human ace2 protein first developed to treat sars 49 it may treat covid-19 by preventing sars-cov-2 entry and reducing acute lung injury it does so by acting as a soluble molecular decoy for sars-cov-2 preventing the virus from binding to cellular ace2 in a dose-dependent fashion 50 ace2 in vitro is the essential receptor for the sars-cov-2 entry 51 and also serves to maintain normal lung physiology when the virion binds to cell surface ace2 this lung protective signalingis lost by preventing ace2-mediated sars-cov-2 interaction and therefore restoring physiologic ace2 signaling apn01 may reduce acute lung injury 52 a randomized unblinded clinical trial is underway in china to investigate the efficacy of apn01 to reduce viral load and the duration of covid-19 symptoms 53a phase i trial of apn01 from 2013 by haschke and colleagues was well-tolerated with no cardiovascular side effects in 22 healthy subjects toxicity from recombinant proteins in general arises from inadvertent activation of the immune system unintentional immunogenicity and binding of the recombinant proteins to other cell surface receptors triggering cellular signal transduction cascades that were not consciously targeted off-target binding unintentional immunogenicity can lead to the formation of anti-drug antibodies that can deposit in tissues as immune complexes for example immune complexes can deposit in the kidney impairing the kidneys ability to filter out toxins and recover electrolytes if the immune system treats the recombinant protein as an antigen treatment may precipitate serum sickness off-target binding of apn01 could modulate renin-angiotensin signaling altering blood pressure and organ perfusion one abstract provides evidence that up to 12 mgkg per day caused no immunogenicity or cardiovascular toxicity in three healthy human volunteers 54leronlimab cytodyn is an investigational humanized igg4 monoclonal antibody against ccr5 receptors found on t

endpoints 59reasoning by analogy with approved therapeutics in oncology the acute toxicity from humanized antibodies can include 1 immunosuppression predisposing to opportunistic infections or viral-induced neoplasias 2 immunostimulation including the dramatic cytokine storm of fevers chills myalgias and acute lung injury similar to a severe presentation of covid-19 and 3 hypersensitivity reactions 60 the specificity of antibodies is likely to give rise to idiosyncratic side effect profiles and not all antibodies will cause the same degree of immunosuppression or immune cell activationwe expect humanized antibodies to be less likely to cause serum sickness than antibodies raised in horse ie anavip or raised in sheep ie crofab anavip rare disease therapeutics inc and crofab protherics inc are antibody therapies used to treat envenomation by north american crotalids a humanized antibody is an antibody raised from non-human species and then modified to increase its similarity to naturally occurring human antibodies so as to provoke less of a humoral immune response in humans for example antibodies raised in mice can have their fc region replaced by human sequences to decrease immunogenicity 61the overall goal of nucleotide analogs is to halt the production of new viral rna making it impossible for infected host cells to become manufacturing sites for new virions nucleotide analogs do this by incorporating a base into the replicating strand from which viral rna polymerase cannot elongateremdesivir gilead is a prodrug metabolized to an adenosine nucleotide analog it has demonstrated in vitro efficacy against sars-cov-2 21 favipiravir toyama chemical mimics adenosine and guanine leading rna-dependent rna polymerase to make error-ridden nonfunctional viral genome progeny 62in the absence of data on remdesivir or favipiravir toxicity one can extrapolate from the toxicity reported for other nucleoside analogs metabolic acidosis can occur with therapeutic use usually after a month or more of treatment 63 though it has also been observed in acute overdose severe metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate is a toxicity of nucleoside analogs that has a high mortality peripheral neuropathy is a dose-related subacute phenomenon seen with stavudine 23-didehydro-23-dideoxythymidine d4t didanosine ddi and zalcitabine ddc 64 bone marrow suppression is seen in about 5 of patients starting 3-azido-23-dideoxythymidine azt treatment 65 pancreatitis and myopathy have been observed with several medications in this class 66 each of these toxicities are thought to reflect mitochondrial dysfunction in addition to inhibiting viral polymerase nucleoside analogs also inhibit mitochondrial dna polymerase-gamma leading to decreased mitochondrial dna and synthesis of mitochondrial proteins 64 if severe toxicity occurs the offending agent should be stopped there is no specific antidote though some suggest that treatment with mitochondrial cofactors such as thiamine riboflavin l-carnitine and vitamin c may help patients recover 63 additional idiosyncratic toxicities may also occur for example tenofovir inducing crystalluria 67protease inhibitors prevent infected cells from forming competent new virions by binding to and inactivating viral proteases to halt viral replication viral proteases process the initial products of translation to make the final versions of viral proteins viral proteases are unique to each virus the crystal structure of the sars-cov-2 main protease has recently been identified 68 drugs that are effective against one virus are not expected to be effective against another virus unless the viruses proteases are sufficiently similar protease inhibitors that target hiv protease for example do not target hepatitis c protease even though both are rna viruses the crystal structure of the sars-cov-2 main protease has been identified and it closely resembles sars-cov-1 but not any known human proteases 68screening of hiv protease inhibitors against sars-cov-1 found that nelfinavir but not ritonavir inhibited viral replication in vitro 69 although this study described the efficacy of nelfinavir it did not determine if nelfinavirs effects were specifically due to sars-cov-1 protease inhibition another screening study identified lopinavir but not nelfinavir as inhibiting sars-cov-1 and demonstrated that treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir abbvie and ribavirin reduced mortality and ards compared to treatment with ribavirin alone 70 ritonavir is added to lopinavir as a pharmacokinetic booster 71 ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome cyp 3a4 the enzyme that inactivates lopinavir the same regimen lopinavir-ritonavir with ribavirin was used as post-exposure prophylaxis for healthcare workers treating patients with severe middle east respiratory syndrome mers also caused by a coronavirus which showed a 40 decreased risk of infection and no severe adverse effects were reported 72early experience in the treatment of sars-cov-2 suggests that patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir commonly experience nausea and vomiting as well as mild transaminase elevations 73 lopinavir-ritonavir seemed to hasten recovery in a case series of 10 hospitalized patients 74 but a larger randomized trial of 99 test subjects and 100 controls showed no difference in time to clinical improvement 75 in all three studies many patients receiving the combination left the study due to nausea vomiting and diarrheaacute overdose of protease inhibitors is uncommon but a large overdose of more than 50 g of lopinavir-ritonavir was generally well tolerated and managed supportively 76 ritonavir is a very potent inhibitor of cyp3a4 ki 059  012m and may slow the metabolism of drugs which are substrates of cyp3a4 leading to potential dangerous drug-drug interactions 77lopinavir-ritonavir is associated with increases in transaminases in 310 of individuals being treated for hiv though clinically significant liver injury appears to be rare and resolves with drug removal 78 a cholestatic pattern of injury is sometimes observed which may be explained by lopinavir reducing expression of the bile salt export pump bsep in human hepatocytes 79 a latency period of 1 month or longer is common which may make this a less relevant feature in the treatment of sars-cov-2 there are genetic variations polymorphisms across patients such as a loss-of-function of cyp3a4 80 that can make patients more susceptible to metabolic toxicities 81 screening for these susceptibilities is not practical in the setting of short duration treatment for sars-cov-2 arthralgias may occur in 35 of patients 82 achilles tendinopathy has been reported in individuals taking lopinavir-ritonavir even in short-term use for post-exposure prophylaxis 83protease inhibitors cause lipodystrophy characterized by central adiposity dorsocervical fat deposition buffalo-hump and extremity wasting when used to treat hiv multiple mechanisms may explain these metabolic derangements including inhibition of srebp-1 a master regulator of lipogenesis and adipocyte differentiation and direct inhibition of glucose transporter-4 79s-trimer refers to a vaccine made to resemble the spike protein the protein on the capsid surface that binds to ace2 in alveolar cells to initiate viral entry the spike protein is an attractive target because it elicits an immune response and mutations in the spike protein may explain the virulence of sars-cov-2 the sars-cov-2 spike protein binds about ten times more tightly to ace2 than the sars-cov-1 spike protein does 84 the mutations also create the need for new therapeutics as that same paper noted that three monoclonal antibodies raised against sars-cov-1 spike protein did not strongly bind to sars-cov-2 spike protein the s-trimer vaccine candidate is expected to be tested in pre-clinical studies shortly the generation of antibodies against the spike proteins of sars or mers 85 was challenging because the spike proteins of coronaviruses are heavily glycosylateddna vaccines work by inserting dna plasmids that encode antigens into host cells this generates cellular and humoral antigen-specific immunity allowing the patient to mount an immune response to the target disease 86 87 studies are ongoing regarding the effectiveness and longevity of vaccine immunogenicity for several infections including hiv mers ebola and zikagls-5300 inovio pharmaceuticals inc geneone life science inc a dna vaccine for mers-cov is entering phase 2 trials mers-cov is the coronavirus that causes middle east respiratory syndrome gls-3500 encodes for the mers-cov spike glycoprotein and demonstrated an immunogenic response in non-human primates in phase 1 studies gls-5300 demonstrated local injection site symptoms in most patients along with headaches malaise and myalgia some patients developed mild creatinine phosphokinase elevations but no renal injury or myopathy developed 88ino-4800 inovio pharmaceuticals inc is a dna vaccine that encodes the sars-cov-2 spike protein and is delivered intradermally 89 a phase 1 clinical trial ino-4800 started in early april to enhance uptake dna vaccines are administered via an electroporation device such as the cellectra 90 safety and tolerability studies of the cellectra did not identify severe adverse events though injection site pain mild elevations in creatinine phosphokinase and paresthesias were described 91 animals that received the vaccine produced antibodies and t cells against the virus 13 a phase 1 clinical trial ino-4800 has startedbeyond local tissue reactions dna vaccines raise the concern of adverse events from plasmid integration with host dna disrupting usual transcription in vitro studies thus far suggest that the rate of insertional mutagenesis is lower than the rate of spontaneous mutations in mammalian cells generally dna vaccines appear to be safe without apparent off-target effects or idiosyncratic toxicities 87messenger rna mrna vaccines direct the production of antigens but unlike dna vaccines cannot integrate into the host genome lowering the risk of mutations 92 once in the cytosol mrna vaccines direct antigen production and then rapidly degrade moderna therapeutics in collaboration with the national institute of allergy and infectious disease announced that it launched a phase i trial of the mrna-1273 the mrna-1273 vaccine is a novel lipid nanoparticle encapsulated mrna-based vaccine that encodes for the prefusion stabilized form of the spike protein 93 the prefusion form refers to the spatial conformation of the spike protein before it binds to ace2 an antibody against the prefusion form could prevent viral entry as well as mitigate the spread of virionsazithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic used for its ability to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome it is also used to treat exacerbations of copd and reactive airway disease this second use may reflect azithromycins modulatory effect on immune cells it reduces respiratory syncytial virus rsv release by decreasing interferon signaling in vivo and inhibits proinflammatory cytokine release in airway smooth muscle and epithelial cells 94 a prospective trial in france of 22 patients noted that a combination of 600 mg hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin 500 mg on the first day and then 250 mg each day for the next 4 days reduced viral load more effectively than hydroxychloroquine alone 95 this trial broke randomization as those who declined treatment were analyzed as controlsthe main toxicity from azithromycin is qtc prolongation leading to cardiac dysrhythmias owing to herg an inward rectifying potassium channel blockade 96 in one cohort study a 5-day course of azithromycin led to a nearly three-fold increase in cardiovascular death as compared to other antibiotics 97 although a follow-up cohort study of similar size 2204100 prescriptions 98 and meta-analysis of prospective randomized controlled trials identified no increased risk in mortality 99we expect the combination of azithromycin and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to be more likely to precipitate cardiac dysrhythmias than either alone azithromycin weakly blocks herg from conducting potassium ions across the cardiac membrane while chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine decrease the number of ions available for transitthere is concern in the media that angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inhibitors may increase susceptibility to sars-cov-2 100 ace inhibitors can increase ace2 expression in human tissue 101 potentially creating more binding sites for sars-cov-2 the receptor-binding domain rbd of sars-cov-2 has a high affinity for ace2 however ace inhibitors have been shown to reduce viral entry by competitive inhibition of spike protein binding to ace2 in vitro 102 lastly alveolar cells infected with coronavirus express less ace2 on their cell surface than normal cells in vitro knocking down the expression of ace2 in uninfected mice creates acute lung injury histologically similar to that seen in sars suggesting intact ace2 function serves a lung-protective role 103one could interpret these findings to suggest that those patients taking ace inhibitors may benefit from stopping them while those not taking them may benefit from starting at this time however there is no direct clinical evidence of any impact of ace inhibitors on the clinical trajectory of those with covid-19 a retrospective study from wuhan china identified hypertension diabetes and cerebrovascular disease as poor prognostic factors but did not isolate the relative risk attributable to taking an ace inhibitor 1 the worse outcome in this study of patients on ace inhibitors may reflect the generally poor outcomes of patients with multiple comorbidities no patient should abruptly discontinue an ace inhibitor except at the direction of a physician blood pressure rapidly rises in the first 48 hours after ace inhibitor discontinuation 104 which could precipitate hypertensive emergencies and subsequent acute pulmonary edemathat same study stated that ibuprofen increases ace2 receptor expression but provided no supporting evidence neither the who 105 nor the fda 106 recommends withholding ibuprofen for symptomatic treatment of covid-19convalescent plasma refers to pooled plasma or immunoglobulins from patients who have been infected and then recovered from a disease in ten patients seropositive for sars-cov-2 and hypoxic but not intubated one dose of 200 ml of convalescent plasma led to a nearly immediately undetectable viral load and improved oxygenation in 3 days 107 in five patients who were intubated with radiographic evidence of acute lung injury transfusion of 200250 ml of convalescent plasma on days 10 and 22 of admission reduced hypoxia in all five and three were able to be weaned from mechanical ventilation 108risks commonly associated with plasma transfusion include 1 transfusion-associated acute lung injury trali 2 transfusion-associated circulatory overload taco and 3 allergicanaphylactic reactions other less common risks include 1 transmission of infections 2 febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions 3 rbc alloimmunization and 4 hemolytic transfusion reactions 109 a meta-analysis of studies that used convalescent plasma to treat sars and influenza a h1n1 reported no adverse effects beyond minor infusion reactions such as chills and fevers 110 four critically ill patients with sars-cov-2 had no significant adverse events when treated with convalescent plasma and supportive care 111the unmet need for effective treatments for covid-19 has spurred pharmaceutical companies to develop or repurpose therapeutics against sars-cov-2 frontline providers may be unfamiliar with the usage of older therapeutics such as chloroquine or medicines typically used by subspecialists like dna vaccines protease inhibitors or convalescent plasma therapy in conjunction with effective infection control policies a combination of measured and reasoned repurposing of existing therapies development and vetting of novel drugs and guidance by medical toxicologists may reduce morbidity and mortality from covid-19 and avoid cases where the cure is worse than the diseasethe renin-angiotensin system ras is not only an endocrine but also a paracrine and an intracrine system 1 in mammals the intravascular ras plays a key role in maintaining blood pressure homeostasis and fluid and salt balance and the tissue or local ras is involved in physiological and pathological processes such as tissue growth and remodelling development and inflammation 2 in a classical ras the substrate angiotensinogen agt which is released into the circulation from the liver is degraded by the enzyme renin that originates in the kidney generating the inactive angiotensin i ang i when this decapeptide comes into contact with angiotensin-i-converting enzyme ace at the endothelial surface of blood vessels the c-terminal dipeptide is cleaved giving rise to angiotensin ii ang ii the main effector molecule of the ras through interactions with specific receptors particularly its type 1 or at1 receptor ang ii stimulates a wide variety of signalling pathways in the heart blood vessels kidneys adipose tissue pancreas and brain initiating most of the physiological and pathophysiological effects that have been attributed to the ras 3 due to the function of directly generating the main effector ang ii ace  together with the classical axis aceang iiat1  has been at the core of ras studies since its discoveryin 2000 a homologue of ace known as angiotensin-i-converting enzyme 2 ace2 was cloned by two independent research groups 4 5 evidence indicates that ace2 negatively regulates the activated ras by degrading ang ii to the heptapeptide ang-17 moreover through the mas receptor a g protein-coupled receptor the resulting ang-17 counterbalances the cardiovascular effects of ang ii by opposing many at1 receptor-mediated actions 6 ace2 and the axis ace2ang-17mas are becoming the focus of intense research regarding the ras 1 the discovery of a prorenin receptor prr and the introduction of renin inhibitors have also brought prorenin back into the spotlight 7 far from being a straightforward cascade containing one substrate agt two proteases renin and ace two peptides ang i and ang ii and one receptor at1 the ras currently consists of several axes upstream and downstream of the classical cascade which include more than two dozen peptidases nearly a dozen ang fragments and at least six different receptors 8 here we review three critical proteases ace ace2 and renin within and beyond the ras and thus intend to find new connections between natural plant andor food resources and the rasace ec 34151 is a monomeric glycoprotein that is distributed in many tissues and biological fluids there are two isoforms of ace in humans somatic ace sace and germinal ace gace somatic ace is found in many types of endothelial and epithelial cells 9 germinal ace or testicular ace is present exclusively in germinal cells in the male testis although ace is a type i integral membrane protein it can also be released as a soluble enzyme into extracellular fluids such as plasma and seminal and cerebrospinal fluids following post-translational proteolytic cleavage by a membrane protein sheddase or secretase 10 11 12somatic ace and gace are encoded by a single gene containing 26 exons the promoter for sace is situated in the 5 flanking region of the first exon whereas that for gace is within intron 12 which results in different lengths for the two isoforms the longer sace 150180 kda is transcribed from exon 1 to exon 26 excluding exon 13 whereas the shorter gace 90110 kda is transcribed from exon 13 to exon 26 exon 13 encodes a unique sequence for the n-terminus of gace whereas downstream exons encode a common sequence for both isozymes 13somatic ace and gace both consist of a 28-residue hydrophilic c-terminal cytoplasmic domain a 22-residue hydrophobic transmembrane domain that anchors the protein in the membrane and an n-terminal ectodomain fig 1
 that is heavily glycosylated with mannose galactose fructose n-acetylneuraminic acid and n-acetylglucosamine 14 the ectodomain of sace is further divided into two similar domains n domain and c domain encoded by the homologous exons 411 and 1724 respectively and each domain contains an active his-glu-x-x-his hexxh sequence 9 somatic ace is the only known metallopeptidase with two homologous active sites 15 which implies that there has been a gene duplication event during evolution 16 except for a unique sequence constituting its n-terminus gace is identical to the c-terminal half of sace 17 due to cleavage of the membrane-bound residues by ace secretase soluble circulating ace lacks a transmembrane portion and a cytosolic domain 18the three-dimensional x-ray crystallographic structure of a deglycosylated truncated version of gace c domain of sace reveals a preponderance of -helices with a zinc ion and two chloride ions incorporated a deep narrow channel separates the molecule into two subdomains and the active site is located toward the bottom of this channel an n-terminal lid on the top of molecule appears to allow only small peptide substrates access to the active site cleft in fact the structure bears little similarity to that of carboxypeptidase a m14 family on which the initial drug development of ace inhibitors was based instead it resembles rat neurolysin m3 family and pyrococcus furiosus carboxypeptidase m32 family despite sharing little sequence similarity with these two proteins 17 corradi et al 18 reported the crystal structure of the n domain of sace similarly it has an ellipsoid shape with a central groove dividing it into two subdomains one of which contains the n-terminal region that covers the central binding cavity but the structure reveals differences in the active site and it contains only one chloride ion equivalent to chloride ii of gace the three-dimensional structures of c domains based on gace and n domains provide an opportunity to design domain-selective ace inhibitors that may exhibit new pharmacological profiles 17 18according to the catalytic mechanism and the critical amino acid residue involved peptidases are classified into four major types serine cysteine aspartic and metallo 15 ace is an m2 family metallopeptidase mae the gluzincins 19 two histidine residues of the functional motif hexxh and a third distant glutamate positioned 2324 residues further towards the c-terminus are the ligands for the zinc cofactor 20 an activated water molecule complexed to zn2 serves as the nucleophile to attack the carbonyl group of the targeted peptide bond 15the activity of ace is also chloride dependent chloride primarily activates the active sites of ace and enhances the binding of substrates 9 each active domain of ace displays differences in sensitivity to chloride activation 21 the activity of the c domain of sace depends highly on chloride ion concentration and is inactive in its absence whereas the n domain can be completely activated at relatively low concentrations of this anion and is still active in the absence of chloride 22 23 germinal ace depends on chloride to a lesser extent compared with the c domain of sace 9 cushman and cheung 24 reported an optimal in vitro ace activity of rabbit rung acetone extract in the presence of 300 mm nacl at ph 8183the two active domains of sace are also subtly different in substrate specificity they hydrolyze bradykinin almost equally but the c domain active site can hydrolyze ang i substrate p 23 and hippuryl-his-leu 25 more efficiently while the n domain active site preferentially hydrolyzes ang-17 26 luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone lh-rh 23 the haemoregulatory peptide n-acetyl-ser-asp-lys-pro acsdkp 27 and alzheimer amyloid -peptide a 28 fuchs et al 29 proved that the c-terminal catalytic domain was the main site of ang i cleavage in mice the differentiation of catalytic specificity might be due to very subtle variation in substrate-specific amino acids 22 and chloride-induced conformational alteration of active sites 23ace acts as an exopeptidase to cleave dipeptides from the free c-termini of two typical substrates ang i and bradykinin for certain substrates such as cholecystokinin 30 substrate p 31 and lh-rh 32 which have amidated c-termini ace not only displays exopeptidase activity but also acts as an endopeptidase 33 the most prominent example of endopeptidase activity is ace hydrolyzing the synthetic a-140 peptide into four fragments an a-840 peptide and the others corresponding to products of a-17 hydrolysis 34 thus ace might have a more general impact on the metabolism of biologically active peptides than previously recognized 16 the two substrates used most often for measuring ace activity and inhibition in vitro  hippuryl-his-leu and n-3-2-furylacryloyl-l-phenylalanylglycylglycine fapgg  only have the n-termini blocked and substrates with two termini blocked have been developed 22ace was originally isolated in 1956 as a hypertensin-converting enzyme 35 in the ras ace cleaves the decapeptide ang i-110 asp-arg-val-tyr-ile-his-pro-phe-his-leu into the octapeptide ang ii-18 by removing the c-terminal dipeptide his-leu when the ras is overactive ang ii exerts its harmful effects primarily via the at1 receptor whereas the at2 receptor may oppose and counterbalance those effects mediated by at1 receptor to exert protective actions 1 ang ii is a potent vasoconstrictor stimulates the release of aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone or vasopressin and increases the retention of sodium and water these effects act directly in concert to raise blood pressure a nonapeptide derivative of ang i des-asp1-ang i-210 prevents infarction-related and non-infarction-related cardiac injuries and disorders his-leu can be cleaved from the peptide by ace to produce ang iii-28 14 which has 40 of the vasoconstriction activity of ang ii ang iii exerts its effects in principle in a similar manner to ang ii and may be equally or even more important in mediating the release of vasopressin 1 ace also degrades ang-19 to ang-17 then further degrades this peptide to the inactive ang-15 fig 2
 in addition ace also termed kininase ii inactivates the vasodilators bradykinin-19 arg-pro-pro-gly-phe-ser-pro-phe-arg and kallidin lys-bradykinin in the kallikrein-kinin system by cleaving the c-terminal dipeptide phe-arg ace eventually cleaves its primary metabolite bradykinin-17 into the shorter fragment bradykinin-15 36through ang ii and aldosterone ace may also be implicated in the impairment of nitric oxide bioavailability and cell oxidative stress augmenting the generation of reactive oxygen species and peroxynitrite 37 38 with the ability to hydrolyze neuropeptides such as enkephalin 39 40 substrate p neurotensin 31 and lh-rh ace may be involved in the functioning of the brain and nervous system ace may affect the digestive system by hydrolyzing the peptide hormone cholecystokinin and gastrin 30 the in vivo experiment conducted by azizi et al 41 proved that acute ace inhibition could increase the level of the natural stem cell regulator acsdkp in plasma acsdkp substantially inhibits cell cycle entry of normal haematopoietic stem cells and protects haemopoiesis against damage caused by cycle-active cytotoxic agents 42 acsdkp can also inhibit the proliferation of hepatocytes 43 and lymphocytes 44 and stimulate angiogenesis 45 in vivo the in vivo antifibrotic effect of ace inhibition is partially mediated by acsdkp 46 ace may also affect susceptibility to alzheimers disease by degrading a and preventing the accumulation of amyloid plaques in vivo 47 in the brains of amyloid precursor protein swedish mutation transgenic mice ace converts a142 to a140 and degrades a and chronic inhibition of ace with captopril enhances predominant a142 deposition 48 however through the inhibition of brain ace activity in the a2535-injected mice perindopril ameliorates cognitive impairment and may therefore have a beneficial effect on alzheimers disease as well as hypertension 49using the assumed mechanistic analogy to other zinc metallopeptidases plus the knowledge that several snake-venom peptides potentiate the action of bradykinin by inhibiting ace efforts were undertaken to develop orally-active peptide analogues for potential use in the treatment of hypertension 9 the first such compound captopril or d-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl-l-proline is an analogue of the ala-pro sequence with sulphydryl as a strong chelating group for the zinc ion its adverse effects which were the same as those caused by mercapto-containing penicillamine prompted the design of non-sulphydryl ace inhibitors 50 the results were two active inhibitors enalaprilat and lisinopril they are both essentially tripeptide analogues with a zinc-co-ordinating carboxyl group and a phenylalanine that occupies the s1 groove in the enzyme lisinopril is a lysine analogue of enalaprilat but it is hydrophilic with greater affinity than enalaprilat the later compounds are all variations of the first three inhibitors with most of the differences residing in the functionalities that bind the active site zinc and the s2 pocket in addition to phosphonates ketones are also useful as chelators 51currently there are more than 10 ace inhibitors marketed that are widely used as first-line therapy for cardiovascular diseases including hypertension heart failure heart attack and left ventricular dysfunction according to the functional moiety they are divided into three types thiol captopril carboxylate benazepril enalapril lisinopril moexipril perindopril quinapril ramipril trandolapril or phosphate fosinopril some ace inhibitors are now administrated clinically as ethyl-ester prodrugs which have good bioavailability but are inactive in their own right they are then converted to the active diacid molecules in vivo by esterasesas a drug class ace inhibitors are very effective have a relatively low incidence of side effects and are well tolerated a common side effect of ace inhibitors is a dry cough which appears in 520 of patients and may result in the discontinuation of treatment another serious problem is angioedema which affects 0105 of patients and can be life-threatening the two side effects have generally been attributed to altered concentrations of bradykinin 51 use of ace inhibitors during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy is contraindicated because of their association with an increased risk of foetopathy a group of conditions that includes oligohydramnios intrauterine growth retardation hypocalvaria renal dysplasia anuria renal failure and death exposure to ace inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy may place the infant at increased risk for major congenital malformations 52the initial drug development of clinical ace inhibitors was based on the assumption of an active site related to that of carboxypeptidase a but organized to remove a dipeptide rather than a single amino acid from the c-terminus of its substrate it is now known that sace has two active sites neither of which resembles that of carboxypeptidase a and that these sites are not identical clinical ace inhibitors however show little discrimination between these two active sites 9 ang i is hydrolyzed predominantly by the c domain of sace in vivo 29 but bradykinin is hydrolyzed by both active sites 53 therefore a c domain-selective inhibitor would allow some degradation of bradykinin by the n domain and this degradation could be enough to prevent the accumulation of excess bradykinin that has been observed during attacks of angioedema that is the c domain-selective inhibition could possibly result in specialized control of blood pressure with fewer vasodilator-related adverse effects 51 a structure-activity study has proved that the group substitution involving the phenyl ring and carbon chain at the sulphonyl and propionyl moieties of captopril is essential for better activity towards the c domain of ace 54 there is increasing evidence that the n domain of sace is responsible for the in vivo degradation of the natural haemoregulatory hormone acsdkp 27 41 55 so n domain-selective inhibition might open up novel therapeutic areas two phosphinic tetrapeptides rxpa380 and rxp407 have been found to be highly selective inhibitors of the c and n domains of sace respectively 51 the availability of the three-dimensional structures of the c and n domains of sace makes the structure-based design of active site-specific inhibitors possible 17 18ace2 ec 3417- is also a type i transmembrane glycoprotein and its expression has now been recognized as being ubiquitous it appears to be susceptible to cleavage that releases the catalytical active ectodomain a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 adam17 also known as tumour necrosis factor-alpha cleavage enzyme tace is a major protease for soluble ace2 shedding while phorbol ester ionomycin endotoxin and the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha can also acutely induce ectodomain release 56 calmodulin binding sites have been identified in the cytoplasmic tail of ace2 and calmodulin inhibitors are proved to increase ace2 shedding 57 the cleavage site resides between amino acids 716 and 741 near the predicted transmembrane domain and residue lys548 in the ectodomain plays an important role in dictating ace2 ectodomain shedding 58 ace2 has 805 amino acids encoded from 18 exons and shares about 42 sequence identity with the n and c domains of sace 16 ace2 also belongs to the m2 family of metalloproteases but consists of a single active site domain that by sequence comparison more closely resembles the n domain than the c domain of sace fig 1 11 in addition to the conserved zinc metallopeptidase consensus sequence hexxh amino acids 374378 there is a conserved glutamate residue 24 residues c-terminal to the second histidine of the zinc motif which serves as the third zinc ligand 16 the three-dimensional structure of a truncated extracellular region of human ace2 shows that the active site domain residues 19611 can be further divided into two subdomains i and ii which form two sides of a long deep cleft and are connected only at the floor of the active site cleft by a prominent -helix the deeply recessed and shielded proteolytic active site of ace2 is a common structural feature of proteases and can avoid hydrolysis of correctly folded and functional proteins the zinc is co-ordinated by his374 his378 glu402 and one water molecule in the subdomain i near the bottom whereas a chloride ion is co-ordinated by arg169 trp477 and lys481 in the subdomain ii 58 the ace2 transmembrane c-terminal domain shares 48 sequence identity with collectrin fig 1 a non-catalytic protein shown to have a critical role in amino acid reabsorption in the kidney 59 pancreatic beta cell proliferation and possibly insulin exocytosis 6unlike sace and gace which are primarily dipeptidylcarboxypeptidases ace2 functions predominantly as a monocarboxypeptidase with a substrate preference for hydrolysis between proline and a hydrophobic or basic c-terminal residue 6 it is like carboxypeptidase a in its action model but is different in active structure because the latter has an hxxe zinc-binding motif with the third ligand histidine positioned 108135 residues further towards the c-terminus 16 ace2 efficiently cleaves a single residue phenylalanine from ang ii to generate ang-17 with about 400-fold higher catalytic efficiency than the conversion of ang i to ang-19 by removing the c-terminal leucine residue fig 2 other substrates with high catalytic efficiency are apelin-13 dynorphin a-113 and des-arg9-bradykinin 60 arg514 of ace2 has been identified as a residue critical to substrate selectivity 61 ace2 activity is also regulated by chloride ions it has been proposed that chloride binding induces subtle changes in the conformation of the active site which either facilitate or hinder substrate binding 6 for the substrate ang i ace2 activity increases with increased cl and a plateau is reached at approximately 500 mm cl for the substrate ang ii an increase in ace2 activity is observed as cl increases from 0100 mm but any further increase in cl decreases ace2 activity until a plateau is reached at 500 mm cl ace2 activity at 500 mm cl is even lower than that in the absence of cl 0 mm consequently an increase in cl above 100 mm which is the physiological concentration in human plasma increases ang i and decreases ang ii cleavage by ace2 this has an effect on the localized concentration of ang ii in the kidney where ace2 has a high level of expression and extracellular chloride ion levels fluctuate thus in vivo cl sensitivity may serve as a homeostatic regulatory mechanism 61 ace2 activity is unaffected by inhibitors of ace captopril lisinopril and enalaprilat or carboxypeptidase a benzylsuccinate and potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor 16the major function of ace2 is to counter-regulate ace activity by reducing ang ii bioavailability and increasing ang-17 formation as a result ace2 plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance between the two axes ace2ang-17mas and aceang iiat1 of the ras a chronic and sustained imbalance may lead to pathophysiology of the cardiovascular renal pulmonary and central nervous systems 62 studies have shown that ace2 overexpression and recombinant ace2 treatment can attenuate hypertension in animal models 63 64 while in humans there is a strong association between ace2 polymorphisms and hypertension in han chinese 65 in addition to the ang ii system ace2 may regulate blood pressure through other peptide systems such as bradykinin andor apelin 6 ace2 gene delivery 66 and ace-17 infusion 67 also have beneficial effects on atherosclerosis whereas ace2 deficiency accentuates vascular atherosclerosis and inflammation 67 in animal models regarding heart function ace2 null mice display impaired cardiac contractility 68 and the loss of ace2 in wild-type mice accelerates adverse ventricular remodelling by potentiation of ang ii effects by means of the at1 receptors 69 ang-17 through interaction with the mas receptor can improve atrial tachyarrhythmias 70 myocardial performance cardiac modelling and survival 3 6 in rodent heart failure models in humans ace2 gene variants might be involved in modulation of left ventricular mass in men 71 and soluble ace2 activity is increased in patients with heart failure and correlates with disease severity to exert cardioprotective actions 72 deletion of the ace2 gene in mice leads to the development of glomerulosclerosis and increased albuminuria 73 while treatment with the ace2 inhibitor mln4760 can worsen renal damage in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice 74 chronic treatment with ang-17 improves renal endothelial dysfunction via the mas receptor in apolipoprotein e-deficient mice by increasing levels of endogenous nitric oxide 75 whereas genetic deletion of the mas receptor in mice leads to a reduction in urine volume sodium retention microalbuminuria and reduced renal blood flow which are associated with upregulation of the at1 receptor and transforming growth factor-beta messenger ribonucleic acid 76 this evidence indicates the protective role of ace2ang-17mas in renal function ace2 has also been shown to regulate cardiovascular functions in brain regions overexpression of ace2 in the rostral ventrolateral medulla reduces high blood pressure and heart rate in spontaneously hypertensive rats shrs 77 in the nucleus tractus solitarius of shrs ace2 gene transfer improves baroreceptor heart rate reflex 78 in the mouse subfornical organ ace2 overexpression inhibits at1 receptor expression and prevents ang ii-mediated pressor and drinking responses 79 in addition ace2ang-17mas can exert cerebroprotective functions in endothelin-1-induced ischaemic stroke in rodent models 80 ace2 exerts a host of actions on the cardiopulmonary system which include prevention of endothelial dysfunction reduction in pulmonary oxidative stress attenuation of vascular impairment anti-inflammatory effects and anticardiac remodelling effects all these properties are responsible for the protective role of ace2 against pulmonary arterial hypertension 81structure-based drug screening has identified two ace2 activators a xanthenone 1-2-diethylaminoethyl-amino-4-hydroxymethyl-7-4-methylphenylsulphonyloxy-9h-xanthene-9-one xnt and resorcinolnaphthalein xnt hydrogen bonds with ace2 residues lys94 tyr196 gly205 and his 195 and resorcinolnaphthalein is involved in three hydrogen bonds with residues gln98 gln101 and gly205 xnt and resorcinolnaphthalein modulate ace2 activity possibly by two mechanisms logically the closed conformation of the enzyme cannot allow the substrate into its active site in the presence of compound the free enzyme may be shifted to the open form effectively increasing the activity coefficient of the enzyme alternatively product release is a rate-limiting step in ace2 turnover ace2 activity may be enhanced in the presence of compound as the enzyme-product complex empties more quickly and ace2 becomes available to start another cycle xnt and resorcinolnaphthalein enhance in vitro ace2 activity in a dose-dependent manner and show no significant effects on ace activity administration of xnt to shrs can result in a decrease in blood pressure improvements in cardiac function and reversal of myocardial perivascular and renal fibrosis 82 the protective role of xnt against hypertension-induced cardiac fibrosis is associated with activation of ace2 increases in ang-17 and inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 83 furthermore ace2 activation by xnt attenuates thrombus formation and reduces platelet attachment to vessels 84 xnt also prevents pulmonary vascular remodelling and right ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis in a rat model of monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension 85 development of xnt is being pursued to translate the vasoprotective concept of ace2 into an effective cardiovascular therapy 62 diminazine aceturate a small molecule antiprotozoal agent that shares structural similarity with xnt has recently been demonstrated to be a potent activator of ace2 and to decrease mean arterial pressure and myocardial fibrosis in shrs 86 intracerebroventricular infusion of diminazine aceturate prior to and following endothelin-1-induced middle cerebral artery occlusion significantly attenuates cerebral infarct size and neurological deficits in a rat model 80 these data suggest that diminazine aceturate may serve as a lead compound for the discovery of the next generation of drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular disease and hypertension 86interestingly peptidase-independent actions of ace2 have also been elucidated ace2 has been identified as an essential receptor for the coronavirus cov that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome sars the spike protein of sars-cov attaches the virus to its cellular receptor ace2 with a binding domain on the spike protein mediating the interaction 87 this ace2-spike interaction leads to endocytosis of virus particles through internalization with ace2 induces the fusion of virus with host cells and establishes sars-cov infection with the release of viral rnas into cytoplasm 6 the spike protein of sars-cov also induces tace-dependent shedding of the ace2 ectodomain with the involvement of the ace2 cytoplasmic domain cellular tace and the ace2 cytoplasmic tail promote viral entry and infection these observations indicate that ace2 shedding and its causative cellular signals may be attributable to sars-cov-induced tissue damage 88 an ace2 inhibitor n-2-aminoethyl-1 aziridine-ethanamine has been identified as being effective in blocking sars-cov spike protein-mediated cell fusion 89 the sars-cov receptor function of ace2 is independent of its catalytic activities for ang ii degradation but ace2-mediated ang ii degradation is still important for lung protection from sars pathogenesis 6 90 so the consequence of long-term activation of ace2 must be determined and the effects of ace2 activators on the immune competence of animals and their vulnerability to sars-cov infection must be tested before these molecules are ready for preclinical trials 64 ace2 is also the receptor for the human coronavirus nl63 that was discovered in 2004 in the netherlands and was shown to be globally distributed 91 additionally due to the high homology with collectrin at its transmembrane ace2 binds to b0at1-family amino acid transporters and contributes to the absorption of neutral amino acids in animal intestines 6 92 thus ace2 may be involved in multiple biological functionsrenin ec 342315 is a key enzyme of the ras since its discovery 100 years ago an impressive quantity of information about renin has been compiled it is generally accepted that the active renin found in the circulation of mammals almost exclusively originates from the kidney in addition to systemic renin there are a number of extrarenal tissues that express renin as part of the local or tissue-specific rass within the kidney renin is predominantly produced by the juxtaglomerular cells prorenin gene transcription in these cells is controlled through several mechanisms among which cyclic adenosine monophosphate campprotein kinase acamp response element binding protein stimulatory and calciumprotein kinase c inhibitory cascades are employed by physiological cues whereas signal transducers activators of transcription and nuclear factor b transcription factors inhibitory and members of the nuclear receptor superfamily probably become relevant in pathological situations prorenin is stored in vesicles activated to renin and then released upon demand the release of renin is under the control of the intracellular camp stimulatory ca2 inhibitory and cyclic guanosine monophosphate signalling pathways meanwhile a great number of intrarenally generated or systemically acting factors have been identified that control renin secretion directly at the level of renin-producing cells by activating the camp or ca2 signalling pathways 93 renin is an aspartyl protease with a typical structure made of two lobes the cleft between the lobes contains the active site characterized by two catalytic aspartic residues renin is a highly specific enzyme and has only one known substrate agt 94prorenin is the inactive precursor of renin in addition to the main organ the kidney other tissues such as the brain the adrenal gland the submandibular gland the glands of the reproductive system and adipose tissue are also able to secrete prorenin in the surrounding milieu and in plasma in contrast to renin prorenin is released constitutively renin and prorenin levels are usually well correlated under some physiopathological circumstances such as pregnancy and diabetes prorenin levels exceed by far those of renin 94 prorenin has a prosegment of 43 amino acid residues attached to the n-terminus of mature renin the prosegment folds into an active site cleft of mature renin to prevent catalytic interaction with agt 95 prorenin-renin conversion occurs in the kidney before renin is released from the juxtaglomerular cells several enzymes including proconvertase 1 and cathepsin b have been proposed to be responsible for this irreversible cleavage of the prosegment from prorenin to form mature renin a reversible non-proteolytic activation of prorenin may also occur at acidic ph andor low temperature prorenin is capable of undergoing a conformational change involving the unfolding of the prosegment from the enzymatic cleft this non-proteolytically-activated prorenin is fully enzymatically active 96 under physiological conditions approximately 2 of plasma prorenin is in the open form and can also display enzymatic activity 94the traditional assumptions of renin being just an enzyme responsible for the cleavage of agt and prorenin being just an inactive proenzyme were challenged by the cloning of a human prr in 2002 94 the prr is a single transmembrane-domain protein of 350 amino acids with a large unglycosylated and highly hydrophobic n-terminal domain responsible for renin and prorenin binding and a short cytoplasmic tail of about 20 amino acids involved in intracellular signalling 97 the prr was first identified on cultured human mesangial cells and bound well to renin and prorenin with a k
d in the nanomolar range 96 binding of prorenin induced a conformational change in the molecule increasing its enzymatic activity from virtually zero to values similar to those of active renin in solution without proteolytic removal of the prosegment 93 98 two regions in the human prorenin segment namely t7pfkr10p a gate that is not accessible by its specific antibodies until it is loosened from the active site cleft and i11pflkr15p a handle a protruding pentameric segment have been identified as being crucial for the non-proteolytic activation 99 renin bound to the prr displays a 3- to 5-fold increase in the catalytic efficiency of agt conversion to ang i compared with free renin 97 100 in addition to the ang-dependent function on the cell surface related to the increased catalytic activity of receptor-bound prorenin renin activity of activated prorenin and increased activity of renin that leads to the formation of ang i from agt the prr system also has ang-independent intracellular effects that are not necessarily related to the ras 7 pathological conditions like high blood pressure upregulate the receptor whereas elevated prorenin concentrations downregulate the receptor via translocation of the transcription factor promyelotic zinc finger protein to the nucleus 98 in the ang-independent signalling pathways prorenin-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 and subsequent phosphorylation of heat shock protein 27 result in actin polymerization while prorenin-induced activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 12 p44p42 signalling cascade leads to the intracellular expression of profibrotic genes giving rise to the synthesis of transforming growth factor- plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 collagen 1 and fibronectin these effects potentially increase cardiac and renal hypertrophy and fibrosis 97 101 102 103 the discovery of the prr has confirmed the hypothesis that renin is also a hormone it has been suggested that blocking the prr may be a new target for renal and cardiac end-organ protection 1 additionally the mannose-6-phosphateinsulin-like growth factor ii receptor can bind both renin and prorenin with high affinity and is believed to serve as a clearance receptor for reninprorenin an intracellular renin-binding protein has been also cloned and found to be an inhibitor of renin activity but its deletion affected neither blood pressure nor plasma renin 94after the discovery of the receptor a prr antagonist was designed based on the idea that the prosegment contains a handle region that binds to the receptor allowing prorenin to become catalytically active in a non-proteolytic manner 96 the antagonist also known as hand region peptide hrp consisting of 10 amino acids nh2-rillkkmpsv-cooh resembles the handle region i11pllkk15p of rat prorenin prosegment and will thus competitively bind to the prr as a decoy peptide and inhibit the receptor-mediated activation of prorenin 95 treatment with the hrp in diabetic mice and rats decreased the renal content of ang i and ii and inhibited the development of nephropathy without affecting hyperglycaemia 104 105 in stroke-prone shrs continuous subcutaneous administration of the hrp inhibited activation of the tissue ras without affecting the circulating ras or arterial pressure and significantly attenuated the development and progression of proteinuria glomerulosclerosis and cardiac fibrosis 106 107 infusion of the hrp in human prr transgenic rats significantly inhibited the development of glomerulosclerosis proteinuria mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and transforming growth factor- expression in the kidneys 108 future research should be able to determine to what degree the beneficial in vivo effects of hrp are due to prorenin blockade 98 and are related to interference with renin binding and the ras 4 decoy effects of the hrp however were not confirmed by other research groups 109 110 111 112ace inhibitors and at1 receptor blockers arbs are proven to be effective therapeutic agents in the treatment of cvd however both ace inhibitors and arbs lead to a substantial compensatory rise in circulating active renin and ang peptides that may eventually limit their therapeutic potential 113 moreover the increased ang i seen with ace inhibitors can subsequently be converted to ang ii by non-ace pathways mediated by chymase and chymotrypsin-like ang-generating enzyme 114 in addition to the side effects of ace inhibitors such as cough and angioedema a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in 2010 suggested that arbs are associated with a modestly increased risk of new cancer diagnosis although conclusions about the exact risk of cancer associated with each particular drug have not been drawn 115 based on this study the united states food and drug administration is conducting a review to assess the possible link between the use of arbs and cancer therefore direct renin inhibition may be an alternative pharmacological approach to ras inhibitionrenin is the rate-limiting step of the ras and the concept of blocking the ras at its origin by inhibiting renin has existed for at least 50 years 113 the first-generation renin inhibitors were peptide analogues of agt and the second-generation compounds were peptidomimetic agents that are dipeptide transition-state analogue inhibitors of the active site but these renin inhibitors had limited clinical use due to poor metabolic stability and oral bioavailability short duration of action weak antihypertensive activity and high cost of synthesis 114 a combination of molecular modelling and x-ray crystallographic analysis of the active site of renin led to the development of aliskiren a new non-peptide low-molecular-weight orally-active renin inhibitor aliskiren has a high binding affinity for renin and appears to bind to both the hydrophobic s1-s3-binding pocket and a large distinct subpocket that extends from the s3-binding site toward the hydrophobic core of the enzyme aliskiren is a potent competitive inhibitor of renin but very poorly inhibits related aspartic peptidases it shows no effects on cytochrome p450 isoenzyme activities and is not bound extensively to blood proteins therefore having a low potential for drug interactions 113 compared with the earlier renin inhibitors aliskiren is more resistant to intestinal degradation and possesses significantly improved oral bioavailability the terminal half-life ranges from 23 to 40 hours which makes it suitable for once-daily dosing aliskiren monotherapy displays an antihypertensive efficacy similar if not superior to that of other first-line antihypertensive drugs with a safety and tolerability profile similar to that of arbs combined with various antihypertensive agents aliskiren exhibits synergistic effects 114 from 2007 aliskiren was approved by regulatory bodies in both europe and the united states for use alone and with other agents in the treatment of hypertension 113 recent studies showed that aliskiren treatment also markedly increased the plasma concentration of prorenin in patients and failed to inhibit the non-catalytic effects of prorenin 110 116 the pharmaceutical company novartis reported that the addition of aliskiren to standard therapy for patients recovering from a heart attack did not provide the anticipated effect of limiting adverse changes to the hearts left ventricle in december 2011 novartis announced the early termination of the aliskiren trial in type 2 diabetes using cardio-renal endpoints altitude and advised that aliskiren should not be used in combination with ace inhibitors or arbs in patients with diabetes the study was conducted in type 2 diabetic patients at high risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular and renal events aliskiren 300 mg was given in addition to an ace inhibitor or an arb the overseeing data monitoring committee concluded that study patients were unlikely to benefit from aliskiren and that there was a higher incidence of adverse events related to non-fatal stroke renal complications hyperkalaemia and hypotension in this high-risk population after 1824 months of combined therapy wwwnovartiscom aliskiren has been shown to be a very safe antihypertensive after more than 20000 patient-years of data however as we have seen in ongoing telmisartan alone and in combination with ramipril global endpoint trial ontarget that the combination of telmisartan an arb and ramipril an ace inhibitor is associated with more adverse events without an increase in benefit in patients with vascular disease or high-risk diabetes without heart failure 117 the combination of multiple safe drugs in this class may no longer be a promising strategyover the last decade a number of food-derived compounds have been shown to have in vitro ace inhibitory activity some of them display significant antihypertensive activity in rats and humans among these compounds food-derived ace inhibitory peptides have been most widely studied 14 118 a quantitative structure-activity relationship study indicated that a potent ace inhibitory dipeptide should have a large and hydrophobic amino acid at the c-terminus and a non-polar amino acid or possibly a positively charged amino acid at the n-terminus for tripeptides the most favourable residues for the c-terminus are aromatic amino acids while hydrophobic amino acids are preferred for the n-terminus and positively charged amino acids are preferred for the middle position 119 the in vitro half-maximal inhibitory concentration ic50 values of food-derived ace inhibitory peptides are about 1000-fold higher than that of synthetic captopril but they have higher in vivo activities than would be expected from their in vitro activities it has been suggested that food-derived peptides might act via different antihypertensive mechanisms possess higher affinities for tissues and be more slowly eliminated than synthetic captopril 118 until now only two lactotripeptides vpp and ipp have been successfully commercialized data from van mierlo et al however did not support a blood pressure-lowering effect of the two tripeptides in caucasians 120 given the discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro results further investigation into the in vivo and clinical antihypertensive effects and mechanisms of food-derived ace inhibitors is necessary three dipeptides ir kf and ef in pea protein hydrolate have been identified as inhibiting renin activity in vitro 121 oleic acid and linoleic acid isolated from rice and some cereals also have in vitro renin inhibitory activity 122 123 a series of studies have shown that saponins from different foodplant sources primarily from soybean can inhibit in vitro renin activity 124 125 126 127 among them orally administered soybean saponin can lead to a reduction of blood pressure in shrs but the direct evidence for saponin suppressing plasma renin activity in vivo is still lacking 124 experiments are required to further investigate the biochemical and biological properties of these plantfood-derived non-peptides that are related to renin inhibition significant conceptual progress made in the last few years leads us to conclude that ace2 could serve as a new direction for improved therapeutics for cardiovascular disease compared with ace inhibitor therapy ace2 is an endogenous regulator of the ras targeting ace2 would not only produce the vasoprotectiveantiproliferative peptide ang-17 but would also influence the vasoconstrictiveproliferative effects of the aceang iiat1 axis as a part of the vasoprotectiveantiproliferative axis ace2 can effectively control fibrosis and structural remodelling and is extremely beneficial for pulmonary hypertension ace2 activation may provide improved protection and reversal of ischaemia-induced neural damage thus direct activation of ace2 could result in better outcomes in cardiovascular disease additionally ace2 is a multifunctional enzyme with many biologically active substrates the effects of ace2 on substrates other than ang i and ang ii may hold relevance for the treatment of cardiovascular disease 62 xnt analogues exist in many natural plant resources and have shown various physiological functions using these resources to search for in vitro ace2 activators would be a good starting point for developing plant food-derived ace2 activating agents ongoing experiments would characterize these ace2 activators compared with ras regulatory drugs these plantfood-derived bioactives appear more natural and safer to the consumer as part of a daily diet bioactives from food sources may result in a much lower healthcare cost plantfood-derived ras regulators could be applied in the prevention of hypertension and as initial treatment in mildly hypertensive individuals 118the authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest concerning this articlerecent commentary correspondence and a science translational medicine blog fang karakiulakis  roth 2020 gurwitz 2020 httpsblogssciencemagorgpipelinearchives20200317angiotensin-and-the-coronavirus have addressed the involvement of ace2 as the receptor for the sars viruses raising concerns about the use of angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors ace inhibitors for example captopril lisinopril enalapril as well as angiotensin receptor blockers arbs for example losartan valsartan telmisartan in individuals who have hypertension cardiovascular or renovascular diseasesall three of these publications report that arbs increase ace2 either based upon an observation of increased urinary ace2 furuhashi et al 2015 a misquote of a recent report wan shang graham baric  li 2020 of the interactions of sars cov with ace2 fang et al 2020 and amplification of this misquote httpsblogssciencemagorgpipelinearchives20200317angiotensin-and-the-coronavirusthe interpretation of the furuhashi et al 2015 furuhashi et al 2015 report that increased urinary ace2 indicates an increase in ace2 synthesis is likely incorrect for three reasons a the increase in urinary ace2 was only seen with olmesartan losartan candesartan valsartan and telmisartan did not increase urinary ace2 b soluble ace2 is ace2 that is shed from membranes reflecting a distinctly different process than ace2 synthesis increased urinary ace2 suggests a reduction in membrane bound ace2 indeed it has been suggested that increased urinary ace2 is a marker for and might be a causal factor for diseases associated with hyperactivity of the reninangiotensin system ras such as chronic kidney disease palau pascual soler  riera 2019 c urinary ace2 likely reflects proximal tubule ace2 expressed on the apical side of tubular epithelial cells that has been shed by the actions of adam17 also known as tnf converting enzyme tace and tnf convertase palau et al 2019 wysocki et al 2013 xiao et al 2014 the molecular weight of shed ace2 arising from the cell membranes from healthy individuals is 90 and  120 kda mizuiri et al 2011 well above the glomerular filtration limit so urinary ace2 would not reflect ace2 levels outside of the kidney wysocki et al 2013 unless smaller fragments of shed ace2 that retain immunoreactivity to the ace2 antibody used in the elisa assay are presentat this time the effects of atr1 blockers and ace inhibitors on membrane bound ace2 in human lung is unknown so any suggestion that they increase sarscov2 infectivity currently lacks a sound rationale danser epstein  batlle 2020 vaduganathan et al 2020 ace2 plays an important role in inactivating angiotensin ang ii as well as to generate ang 17 lazartigues feng  lavoie 2007 warner smith hooper  turner 2004 and any reduction in its activity could increase the ability of ang ii to stimulate at1 receptors which

which is reported to have cytoprotective properties in the lung and its vasculature y li et al 2016 ye  liu 2020 moreover it is unlikely that inhibitors of ace2 activity would significantly compete for the same or overlapping binding sites on ace2 as the active site of ace2 is the hemgh domain at amino acids 374378 while the putative sarscov2 spike protein binding domains are amino acids 3041 8284 and 353357 httpswww-ncbi-nlm-nih-govezproxylocallibrarynovaeduproteinnp0013583441 moreover the binding sites for sarscov1 on ace2 which are the same as those reported for sarscov2 walls et al 2020 are reported to not overlap with the substrate binding site of ace2 based upon the inability of the ace2 inhibitor mln4760 dales et al 2002 to inhibit sarscov1 binding to ace2 f li li farzan  harrison 2005 of interest however is the promising concept of administering exogenous ace2 coupled with the fc region of an immunoglobulin as a neutralizing antibody to serve as a decoy receptor and inactivator of sarscov2 kruse 2020 thereby preventing it from binding to membrane bound ace2 a similar strategy using ace2 expressing car t cells as a decoy with cytotoxic targeting of the sarscov2

coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as the receptor for its spike protein to invade cells and replicate1 ace2 presents a high homology with ace a key enzyme in the regulation of blood pressure2 in some animal studies reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas inhibitors a category that includes ace inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers have been reported to increase expression of ace23 4 5 these findings have led some researchers to postulate that the use of these drugs might enhance the access of sars-cov-2 into cells predisposing patients to infection or increasing severity of covid-196 7 8 this hypothesis was fuelled by results from the first case series that was published in which age hypertension diabetes and coronary heart diseaseconditions associated with the use of raas inhibitorswere identified as potential risk factors for severe cases and in-hospital deaths9 10 11 12 by contrast other authors have proposed use of angiotensin-receptor blockers as a preventive measure or even a therapy for covid-19 because of their potential to reduce lung injury caused by angiotensin ii13 raas inhibitors are among the most widely used drugs globally for indications such as hypertension heart failure kidney complications of diabetes and myocardial infarction hence their discontinuation because of covid-19 could cause patients harm14
scientific societies and drug regulatory agencies alike have advised against their discontinuation until sound evidence is available15

research in context
evidence before this study
inhibitors of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas have been hypothesised to predispose patients to more severe covid-19 this hypothesis is based on two facts these drugs have been reported to upregulate the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme ace 2 the gateway used by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 to enter cells and patients with severe covid-19 have a high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases many scientific societies adopted the position of not recommending the discontinuation of treatment yet epidemiological evidence is lacking and the hypothesis has not been confirmed or refuted we searched pubmed on april 15 2020 for publications in english since jan 1 2020 using the search terms covid-19 and ace inhibitors or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers or raas inhibitors or ras inhibitors or raas blockers or ras blockers filtering by human and observational study and no result was returned
added value of this study
using a case-population study design we found no difference between the risk of covid-19 requiring admission to hospital associated with the use of raas inhibitors and the risk associated with the use of other antihypertensive drugs once fully adjusted for age sex and cardiovascular comorbidities and risk factors additionally we found no increased risk with either ace inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers the lack of association between raas inhibitors and risk of covid-19 requiring admission to hospital was observed in both the most severe fatal cases and those needing admission to an intensive care unit and less severe inpatients
implications of all the available evidence
the available evidence supports that raas inhibitors are safe and should not be discontinued for fear of an increased risk of covid-19
to provide a solution to this urgent issue we designed a pharmacoepidemiological study with the aim of assessing whether the odds of exposure to raas inhibitors relative to other antihypertensive drugs was higher among patients with covid-19 admitted to hospital than in the general population adjusted for age sex and cardiovascular comorbidities and risk factorsin this case-population study we used an epidemiological approach conceived as a surveillance method to assess adverse drug effects16 to provide a rapid answer to our study question briefly this method uses data from a series of patients with an illness from a specific region cases and data from patients randomly sampled from a primary health-care database in the same region population controls assuming that the primary health-care database represents the source population of the cases a random sample of controls from that database would provide a valid estimate of the prevalence of the exposure and covariates in the source population approaching the primary base paradigm of case-control studies17

which extracts information from the electronic primary health-care records of the nhs from participating regions this database contains information from 115 million patients from madrid and the distribution of age and sex among patients is comparable to the population census of the region appendix pp 34 the horus and bifap databases access the same primary health-care data of patients in the madrid nhs and the catchment population of the seven hospitals taking part in the study and the population attending primary care were the samethe main outcome variable was admission to hospital of patients with covid-19 confirmed by a positive pcr test hospitals posted in-house protocols for clinical management and hospital admission based on criteria issued by the ministry of health including but not limited to respiratory failure oxygen saturation 90 severe hypoxaemia partial pressure of oxygen 60 mm hg or breathing rate 30 breaths per min while breathing ambient air abnormal chest x-ray compatible with covid-19-associated pneumonia bilateral pneumonia or unilateral pneumonia with damage in different lung lobes and relevant clinical alterations including haemodynamic hepatic renal or haematological derangements together with clinically significant laboratory abnormalities such as abnormal increase in d-dimer ferritin lactate dehydrogenase or c-reactive protein or severe lymphocytopenia the date of admission was considered the index date then we followed up patients and identified those who had been admitted to the icu or who died in hospital when considering a severity analysis these patients were considered to be the most severe casesthe antihypertensive drugs examined were ace inhibitors angiotensin-receptor blockers renin inhibitors aldosterone antagonists calcium-channel blockers diuretics -blockers and -blockers for cardiovascular indications appendix p 8 also we grouped ace inhibitors angiotensin-receptor blockers renin inhibitors and aldosterone antagonists alone or combined with any drug in a variable called raas inhibitors and calcium-channel blockers -blockers diuretics and -blockers alone or combined with other drugs different from raas inhibitors in a variable called other antihypertensive drugswe defined exposure to the drug or drugs of interest as current use when an individual had a prescription lasting until the month before the index date otherwise exposure was defined as non-use for the main analysis we generated a variable with the following mutually exclusive categories non-use of any antihypertensive drug current use of raas inhibitors and current use of other antihypertensive drugs and we used current use of other antihypertensive drugs as the reference category unless otherwise specified when a patient used a raas inhibitor concomitantly with any other antihypertensive drug they were always assigned to the raas inhibitor category subsequently we disaggregated the category current use of raas inhibitors into their different pharmacological subgroups ace inhibitors angiotensin-receptor blockers excluding current users of ace inhibitors aldosterone antagonists excluding current users of ace inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers and renin inhibitors excluding current users of any other raas inhibitor for some analyses we also disaggregated the category current use of other antihypertensive drugs into its respective components calcium-channel blockers -blockers diuretics and -blockers and used current use of calcium-channel blockers as the reference category among current users of raas inhibitors we distinguished when they used the drugs in monotherapy or combined with other antihypertensive drug either in fixed-dose combinations or concomitant use as separate medicinal products the date of first prescription of the current treatment episode was also extracted to estimate the duration of treatment categorised as up to 1 year and longer than 1 yearwe estimated the sample size needed for different scenarios of effect size ie odds ratio or and prevalence of use of antihypertensive drugs in controls assuming an  error of 005 and a power of 80 according to this calculation a sample size of 1000 cases and 10 000 controls would allow us to detect an or of 15 or greater if the prevalence of use of raas inhibitors among controls was at least 5we express quantitative variables as mean sd and qualitative variables as frequencies and percentages differences in means were assessed using the students t test and differences in percentages were assessed using the 2 test we describe the distribution of comorbidities among cases and controls and their association with covid-19 requiring admission to hospital was assessed through univariable conditional logistic regression to calculate crude ors and 95 cis adjusted for age and sex due to matchingwhen assessing potential confounding factors covariates we considered the presence of the following comorbidities at the index date history of hypertension diabetes dyslipidaemia defined as use of lipid-lowering drugs ischaemic heart disease atrial fibrillation heart failure thromboembolic disease cerebrovascular accident asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease chronic renal failure and cancer with the cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities we constructed a composite variable of background cardiovascular risk with the following three categories patients with history of any of ischaemic heart disease cerebrovascular accident heart failure atrial fibrillation or thromboembolic disease patients with any of the following cardiovascular risk factors and no cardiovascular disease hypertension dyslipidaemia diabetes or chronic renal failure and the remainder of patients without any cardiovascular diseases or risk factorswe assessed the association between current use of raas inhibitors and risk of covid-19 requiring admission to hospital compared with either current use of other antihypertensive drugs main analysis or non-use of any antihypertensive drug through univariable and multivariable conditional logistic regressions in the multivariable model we included all covariates described as potential confounding factors with the exception of hypertension to calculate adjusted ors and 95 cis current users of raas inhibitors had a prevalence of hypertension over 90 appendix p 13 for this reason we did not include hypertension in the multivariable model because the potential for confounding was minimalwe assessed potential effect modification by age 70 vs 70 years sex hypertension diabetes and background cardiovascular risk through a stratified analysis we assessed the statistical interaction by comparing the adjusted ors across different strata using the altman and bland test of interaction18 statistical significance was set at a p value of less than 005 however for stratified analyses we applied bonferroni correction to allow for multiple testing for which we set the statistical significance level at a p value of less than 0008 005 divided by 6ie the number of stratified analyses doneaccording to covid-19 severity we differentiated two groups of cases fatal cases and those requiring admission to an icu ie most severe and less severe cases in each group we analysed the association with raas inhibitors as described earlier and compared the adjusted or across the strata using the altman and bland test of interaction18
we planned four sensitivity analyses first an analysis for the correction for secular trends the control series was sourced from a 2018 population the last available year in the bifap database while cases were from 2020 thus in case the prevalence of use of raas inhibitors increased over time the exposure among controls would be an underestimate of 2020 data and as a result the adjusted ors could be overestimated to assess the magnitude of this potential problem we examined trends of use of different antihypertensive drug subgroups in the madrid population in bifap over the period 201218 and forecast the result corresponding to 2020 via a linear regression model then we divided the prevalence of use estimate for 2020 by the prevalence observed in 2018 for every antihypertensive drug class and took this ratio as an indicator of the overestimation of adjusted ors for raas inhibitors the ratio was 104 overall 105 for ace inhibitors and 101 for angiotensin-receptor blockers whereas for other antihypertensive drugs including calcium-channel blockers the ratio was close to 100 appendix pp 57 in the sensitivity analysis we corrected for these patterns of use dividing the adjusted or of raas inhibitors ace inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers by their respective estimated ratios 20202018 second we assessed the potential effect of media alerts concerns about the association between raas inhibitors and severe covid-19 were highlighted in several letters to medical journals8 9 10 and news began to appear in the spanish press and social media networks after march 16 2020 when the spanish agency for medicines and medical devices published a note recommending not to discontinue these drugs15 because this news might have had an influence on adherence to recorded treatment we stratified the results into two study periods march 116 and march 1724 third we excluded aldosterone antagonists and renin inhibitors from the raas inhibitor group for the main analysis we included aldosterone antagonists in the raas inhibitor group because these drugs have also been reported to upregulate ace2 expression19 but we did a sensitivity analysis to estimate the adjusted ors among raas inhibitors excluding aldosterone antagonists and renin inhibitors finally we included hypertension in our multivariable modelwe did all statistical analyses using statase version 15the funder of the study had no role in study design data collection data analysis data interpretation or writing of the report the corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publicationwe collected data on 1139 cases and 11 390 matched controls despite being matched by age and sex cases had a greater prevalence of diverse comorbidities than did controls table 1
the prevalence of use of different subgroups of antihypertensive drugs was higher in cases than in controls which yielded positive associations with risk of covid-19 requiring admission to hospital in both crude and fully adjusted analyses compared with non-use of any antihypertensive drug adjusted or for raas inhibitors 171 95 ci 146201 and for other antihypertensive drugs 182 147226 appendix p 9 when use of other antihypertensive drugs was set as the reference category the adjusted or associated with the current use of raas inhibitors was 094 077115 table 2
 no significant increase in the risk of covid-19 requiring admission to hospital was observed with either ace inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers nor did we find any difference when these drugs were used in monotherapy or in combination with other drugs table 2the adjusted ors associated with other antihypertensive drugs compared with non-use by different pharmacological subgroups were 196 95 ci 143269 for calcium-channel blockers 179 132243 for diuretics 168 116243 for -blockers and 196 057671 for -blockers appendix p 9 when the current use of calcium-channel blockers was set as the reference category the adjusted or was 087 065118 for raas inhibitors 074 054102 for ace inhibitors and 102 074140 for angiotensin-receptor blockers appendix p 10compared with long-term longer than 1 year users of other antihypertensive drugs long-term users of raas inhibitors had an adjusted or of 096 95 ci 076121 for risk of covid-19 requiring admission to hospital likewise compared with short-term users up to 1 year of other antihypertensive drugs short-term users of raas inhibitors had an adjusted or of 139 95 ci 092210the results of the assessment of the potential effect modification of raas inhibitors by age 70 and 70 years sex diabetes hypertension and background cardiovascular risk are shown in figure 2
 no significant interaction was observed with any variable except for diabetes for which a significantly reduced risk of covid-19 requiring admission to hospital associated with raas inhibitors was observed adjusted or 053 034080 test of interaction p0004 still significant after applying the bonferroni correction for multiple testing corrected significance level fixed at 0008393 345 of 1139 cases had the most severe form of covid-19 283 248 died in hospital and 110 97 survived but required admission to an icu the mean duration of hospital stay was 13 days sd 8 among survivors and 11 days sd 7 among non-survivors broadly compared with patients with less severe covid-19 in our study patients with the most severe covid-19 were older mean age 753 years sd 123 vs 658 years sd 159 p00001 and a higher proportion were male 264 672 of 393 with severe disease vs 431 578 of 746 with less severe disease p0001 table 3
 compared with current use of other antihypertensive drugs the adjusted or associated with the current use of raas inhibitors was 108 95 ci 080147 among the most severe cases and 086 066111 among the less severe cases table 3 in both severity groups the 95 cis for the adjusted ors of ace inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers compared with other antihypertensive drugs overlapped with each other indicating no significant differences table 3in our first sensitivity analysis the adjusted or of current use of raas inhibitors compared with current use of other antihypertensive drugs corrected for secular trends was 090 95 ci 074111 and 076 061095 for ace inhibitors and 109 087136 for angiotensin-receptor blockers in our second sensitivity analysis up to march 16 the adjusted or associated with current use of raas inhibitors compared with current use of other antihypertensive drugs was 098 95 ci 077125 and for march 17 onwards was 088 062124 figure 2 in our third sensitivity analysis the exclusion of aldosterone antagonists and renin inhibitors from the raas inhibitor group hardly had any effect overall adjusted or 092 95 ci 076112 among the most severe cases 106 078144 and among the less severe cases 084 065109 appendix pp 1112 and in our final sensitivity analysis the inclusion of hypertension in the multivariable model had little effect on the adjusted ors for raas inhibitors 100 082123 ace inhibitors 085 068106 or angiotensin-receptor blockers 117 093147here we show that the current use of raas inhibitors is not associated with an increased risk of covid-19 requiring admission to hospital including fatal cases and those admitted to an icu compared with other antihypertensive drugs no substantial difference was observed between ace inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers nor among short-term and long-term users sex age and background cardiovascular risk did not significantly affect the results although use of raas inhibitors was associated with a reduced risk of covid-19 requiring admission to hospital in patients with diabetesour results do not support the hypothesis that previous intake of raas inhibitors facilitates or increases the severity of covid-19 this hypothesis emerged when two facts were linked the finding that raas inhibitors upregulate the expression of ace23 4 5 19 and the observation that hypertension diabetes and ischaemic heart disease were highly prevalent among patients with severe covid-199 10 11 12 conditions for which raas inhibitors are widely used however these facts are only two pieces of a more complex puzzle evidence to support the idea that ace2 might have a dual role in covid-19 is increasing20 on the one hand ace2 overexpression might increase the susceptibility of cells to sars-cov-2 but on the other hand its downregulation associated with older age male sex and cardiovascular comorbidities and further heightened by sars-cov-2 binding and internalisation21 22 could increase the unopposed action of angiotensin ii and have a key role in the subsequent organ injury23 ace2 counteracts the deleterious effect of raas axis in patients with covid-19 liu and colleagues24 reported that serum concentrations of angiotensin ii were significantly higher in infected individuals than non-infected individuals and was linearly associated with viral load and lung damage ace2 inactivates angiotensin ii and increases the generation of angiotensin 17 a peptide that acting on the mas receptor exerts a vasodilatory effect and anti-inflammatory and antioxidative actions20 in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards reddy and colleagues25 observed a higher ratio of angiotensin 17angiotensin i among survivors than non-survivors which adds evidence to the idea that the counter-regulation exerted by the axis of ace2angiotensin 17mas receptor benefits patients with ards in line with this theory recombinant soluble ace2 has been shown in animal models of ards to protect subjects from lung injury26 27 28 and clinical trials are underway in patients with covid-19 nct04287686 finally to our knowledge the case series of patients with covid-19 published to date has not been adjusted for important potential confounding factors such as sex age and cardiovascular comorbidities29 in our study we used controls who were matched to cases for sex and age and we also adjusted for a number of comorbiditiesto our knowledge two epidemiological studies have been published to date that aimed to explore the association between raas inhibitors and covid-19 comparing severe cases with less severe cases among inpatients30 31 neither of these studies found an increased risk of severe outcomes associated with these drugs and in one study30 a substantially reduced risk of death and transfer to a critical care unit within 7 days of admission to hospital was observed among users of ace inhibitors or 029 95 ci 010075 notably in both studies the authors considered not only exposure to ace inhibitors before 7 days or at admission to hospital but also during hospital stay in our study we used population controls not just a case series and only considered drugs used before admissionseveral cardiovascular comorbidities are clearly linked to severe covid-19 and raas inhibitors are often used to treat such cardiovascular conditions thus substantial confounding by indication can be expected32 in our view this bias explains the positive association we found between current use of any antihypertensive drug and risk of covid-19 requiring admission to hospital compared with non-use of such drugs which did not disappear after full adjustment for comorbidities this problem can be mitigated if current users of raas inhibitors are compared with current users of other drugs that share at least partially their indications but not their safety issues32 for instance some researchers have recommended calcium-channel blockers as a suitable alternative treatment to raas inhibitors because calcium-channel blockers have not been reported to increase the expression of ace28 following this reasoning other antihypertensive drugs in general and calcium-channel blockers in particular can be considered a more valid comparator group than non-use of such drugs we followed this approach and reassuringly we found no increased risk when using either of these drug groups as the reference group nevertheless raas inhibitors do not share all indications with other antihypertensive drugs hence the comorbidity pattern associated with use of these drugs might not overlap and some residual confounding by indication could remain to explore the extent of this possibility we examined the comorbidity pattern associated with various types of antihypertensive drugs among controls and found much fewer differences among the types of drug than when they were compared with non-users which reinforces the validity of our approach appendix p 13the risk reduction associated with raas inhibitors among individuals with diabetes who had been admitted to hospital for covid-19 not explained by chance deserves a comment diabetes has been reported as a risk factor for severe covid-1933 the biological underpinning for this clinical observation is not yet known but experimental models of diabetes in mice have shown that ace activity is high in the lungs34 if this activity also occurs in humans patients with diabetes who have covid-19 might present a great imbalance in the aceace2 ratio ace activity would be high due to diabetes and ace2 would be low due to downregulation induced by sars-cov-2 that could explain the increased severity of covid-19 among patients with diabetes and also the protective effect of raas inhibitors suggested by our datathe lack of an increased risk of covid-19 requiring admission to hospital associated with raas inhibitors compared with other antihypertensive drugs was found in both patients with most severe and less severe disease suggesting that the outpatient use of these drugs neither facilitates nor aggravates the infectionour study has several limitations first we used different data sources to extract information from cases hospital records and primary health-care records through horus consulted case by case by local researchers and controls bifap database which automatically extracted data from primary health-care records however both horus and bifap access the same primary health-care data which was the main source for determining comorbidity and drug exposure in our study making major information bias unlikely second cases were recorded as of march 2020 whereas controls were sourced from records in march 2018 which might have affected the results due to secular trends in use of antihypertensive drugs however when we corrected for secular trends we saw little change in the estimated adjusted or third we did not collect data on smoking and other lifestyle habits eg exercise diet alcohol intake which might have affected the association between raas inhibitors and covid-19 requiring admission to hospital however these habits are correlated with several comorbidities that were included in the regression model fourth we obtained information on drug prescriptions but adherence to treatment cannot be guaranteed hence when we have used the term drug use we should say drug prescribed the effect of non-adherence in our results is difficult to measure but would most probably cause a non-differential misclassification of exposure that if relevant would distort the estimates towards the null value fifth we did not collect information on clinical and analytical covariates during patients stay in hospital nor did we collect information on in-hospital treatment eg if raas inhibitors were continued or withheld in hospital which might have been interesting for the assessment of the association of antihypertensive drugs with severity of and fatality due to covid-19 sixth we did not analyse any dose effects finally as in any other observational study residual confounding due to unmeasured or unknown confounders cannot be ruled outin summary the results of the present study suggest that the outpatient use of raas inhibitors does not increase the risk of covid-19 requiring admission to hospital including its most severe forms this finding should be confirmed using other data sources study designs and populations meanwhile the data available along with the important role of ace inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers in the management of several cardiovascular diseases do not support their discontinuation as a preventive measure against covid-19after publication study data will be made available on reasonable request to the corresponding author a proposal with a detailed description of study objectives and statistical analysis plan will be needed for assessment of requests additional materials might also be required during the process of assessment de-identified participant data will be provided after approval from the principal researchers of the participating hospitalsthe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic is associated with a high risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome and mortality 14 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 facilitates sars-cov-2 entry into host cells in the respiratory tract and altered ace2 regulation is speculated to play a role in the pathogenesis of covid-19 5 in the setting of the covid-19 pandemic there has been increasing interest in the physiologic and pathophysiologic function of ace2 6 here we briefly review the role of ace2 in the renin-angiotensin system the therapeutic potential of ace2 and potential interactions of ace2 with sars-cov-2 and its role in covid-19 pathophysiologyace2 is a mono-carboxypeptidase with a single enzymatic binding site that acts as a key counter-regulatory component of the renin-angiotensin system 7 ace2 is the only known homolog of ace it shares 42 of sequence identity with somatic ace and 61 similarity in the area surrounding the active site 8 9 ace2 is expressed on the surface of endothelial and epithelial cells in membrane-bound form as well as soluble form in several tissues throughout the body including the kidneys heart gastrointestinal tract and lungs 10 11ace converts angiotensin i ang i to ang ii which acts on the ang ii type 1 receptor at1r resulting in vasoconstriction sodium and fluid retention by the kidney oxidative stress inflammation fibrosis and impaired fibrinolysis 11 12 in direct opposition to the cascade of physiological effects of the aceang ii pathway the net effect of the ace2ang-17 pathway is vasodilation and anti-inflammation ace2 hydrolyzes ang ii converting it to ang-17 see fig 1 the conversion of ang ii to ang-17 diminishes the availability of ang ii to bind at1r forestalling the vasoconstrictive proinflammatory and prothrombotic effects of at1r activation 7 1013 additionally ang-17 acts on the mas receptor causing the release of nitric oxide prostaglandin e2 and bradykinin 11 resulting in vasodilation natriuresis and a reduction in oxidative stress and inflammation 14 15 ace2 also cleaves several other peptides including converting ang i to ang-19 which is a less-bioactive peptide 16ace2 plays an important role in the development of several pathologic conditions including hypertension cardiac hypertrophy and kidney disease for example in human kidney tissue the ratio of ace to ace2 expression is higher in subjects with hypertension compared with those without hypertension 17 these findings are consistent with more-pronounced vasoconstrictive and anti-natriuretic effects of ace compared with ace2 activity in hypertensive individuals several experimental and human studies have also demonstrated a reduction in glomerular ace2 expression in diabetic and non-diabetic kidney disease 8 correspondingly experimental studies in mice show that pharmacologic inhibition of ace2 promotes the development of microalbuminuria and diabetic nephropathy 18 19 human data suggest that ace2 may be upregulated in individuals with existing cardiovascular disease which is speculated to be a compensatory response to counteract the deleterious effects of ang ii 20 in sars-cov-2 while ace2 facilitates viral entry in host cells it may also have protective effects against severe acute lung injury 21given its vasodilatory natriuretic anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects via increased ang-17 and decreased ang ii soluble ace2 has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target in hypertension chronic kidney disease cardiovascular disease and viral respiratory disease in experimental studies chronic administration of soluble ace2 has been associated with degradation of ang ii and an increase in ang-17 2224 animal studies consistently demonstrate a reduction in blood pressure with recombinant ace2 administration and in mouse models recombinant ace2 attenuated diabetic kidney injury 22 and myocardial remodeling 24 recombinant ace2 has also been proposed as a treatment for severe viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome recombinant ace2 reduces acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome in mice with viral pneumonia 25 children infected with respiratory syncytial virus have higher plasma ang ii concentration compared with healthy controls suggesting upregulation of aceang ii and downregulation of ace2ang-17 and supporting ace2 as a potential therapy in respiratory syncytial viral lung disease in humansace inhibitors block the conversion of ang i to ang ii while ang ii receptor blockers directly inhibit at1r both of these medications decrease blood pressure and inflammation and mitigate fibrosis in hypertension cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease in several animal models these antihypertensive agents have been shown to increase ace2 expression in the heart and kidneys 2629 however in humans ace inhibitors and ang ii receptor blockers have not been associated with increased kidney ace2 expression or circulating ace2 activity 30 31ace2 is the binding site for the sars-cov-2 viral spike s protein and facilitates viral entry into the host cell there has been recent speculation that ace inhibitors and ang ii receptor blockers may increase the risk of development and severity of covid-19 due to potential upregulation of ace2 by these medications 32 however sars-cov-2 facilitates ace2 endocytosis downregulates ace2 expression and promotes ace2 shedding from the cell surface leading to an increase in ang ii concentration and a decrease in ang-17 this is likely important in covid-19 pathophysiology due to the proinflammatory effects of ang ii with corresponding loss of ang-17-mediated counter-regulation 33 the prothrombotic effects of excess ang ii could underlie covid-19 hypercoagulability 34 35 upregulation of aceang ii with downregulation of ace2ang-17 in the vascular endothelium could promote covid-19-associated vasculopathy 36 37 extrapolating from sars-cov animal models increased ang ii in patients with covid-19 due to loss of ace2 could mediate acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome 38 in experimental models ang ii administration induces at1r-mediated ace2 internalization and degradation 39 ace inhibitors and ang ii receptor blockers may have a therapeutic benefit in covid-19 by reducing ang ii concentration and at1r activation thus it remains unclear if ace inhibitors or ang ii receptor blockers have a beneficial or harmful effect in sars-cov-2 infection and covid-19ace2 has important counter-regulatory effects on the renin-angiotensin system and has been implicated in covid-19 pathogenesis medications that act on the renin-angiotensin system including ace inhibitors and ang ii receptor blockers may impact covid-19 infection and severity via potential interactions with ace2 however the direction and magnitude of these effects are unknown at this time several international societies have released statements discouraging discontinuation of ace inhibitors and ang ii receptor blockers in patients who are treated with these medications for hypertension heart failure and chronic kidney disease amidst the covid-19 pandemic 6 given the clear benefits of these agents in hypertension chronic kidney disease coronary heart disease and diabetes there is an urgent need for further research to improve our understanding of the relationship between agents that act on the renin-angiotensin system and outcomes among individuals with covid-19 with several studies currently underway 6sars is an infectious disease with a high mortality rate caused by the human coronavirus sars-cov ksiazek et al 2003 the severity and global spread of the 2003 sars outbreak has led to the search for specific antiviral compounds against sars-cov results from both in vitro studies and case reports from the clinic have been published but no consensus treatment has yet been established major efforts are being made to understand the mechanism of sars-cov replication in order to identify drug targets of specific antiviral compounds chu et al 2004 liu et al 2004 thiel et al 2003 vastag 2003 wu et al 2004 coronaviruses are enveloped positive-strand rna viruses that initiate infection of susceptible cells by binding to human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ace-2 on the host cell membrane via the viral s protein li et al 2003 xu et al 2004 following receptor binding and membrane fusion the infectious genomic rna is delivered into the cytoplasm and viral gene expression is initiated resulting in the translation of two replicasetranscriptase polyproteins these two enzymes are responsible for the replication of the viral genome as well as the generation of a multiple subgenomic mrnas including those encoding the structural proteins s spike m membrane e envelope and n nucleocapsid de haan et al 2002 a complex set of regulatory mechanisms controls the viral gene expression and additional virus-encoded enzymes such as helicase and proteases are crucial for the production of infectious virus particles thiel et al 2003 progeny virions are assembled in the endoplasmatic reticulum-golgi apparatus and released from infected cells by exocytosis the viral entry and assembly processes as well as the enzymatic steps involved in viral replication constitute potential targets for antiviral therapyunderstanding the mechanism of viral replication is not the only key step towards identification of effective drugs against a virus development of rapid screening assays is also essential for antiviral drug discovery the present standard infectivity assay for sars-cov is based on viral infection of veroe6 cells followed by visual monitoring of cytopathic effects cpe ksiazek et al 2003 the low-throughput nature of this assay format limits its use for efficient screening of large chemical libraries this study describes the development of a stable cell line susceptible to sars-cov that constitutively expresses egfp which can be used for the automated screening of inhibitors of virus activity a high degree of correlation between virus replication and reduced egfp signal is expected for highly cytopathic viruses such as sars-cov where the background egfp signal is rapidly reduced by extensive cell death the specificity and selectivity of compounds active in this sars-cov screening assay were determined by parallel screening for cytotoxicity and inhibition of a porcine coronavirus using similar assay formats this set of assays was used in the screening of a test panel of 3388 randomly chosen chemical compounds to demonstrate its application to drug discoverythe porcine kidney cell line llc-pk1 and the african monkey

g for 5 min and stored at 80 c until use the 50 cell culture infectious dose ccid50 was determined by titration on llc-pk1 or veroe6 cells depending on virus using 10 serial five-fold-dilution steps after 5 days incubation at 37 c the plates were inspected for cpethe test compounds were serially diluted four-fold in cell culture medium and mixed with 200 ccid50 of tgev or 300 ccid50 of sars-cov and 1000 of llc-pk1-egfp or veroe6-egfp cells corresponding to a final concentration of 25000 cellsml in 384-well blackview plates corning corning ny the plates were sealed with gas permeable membrane and incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 c and 5 co2 after 5 days the wells were examined for egfp expression using an argon laser-scanning microscope the microscope settings were excitation at 488 nm and emission at 510 nm and the fluorescence images of the wells were converted into signal values the results were expressed as ec50 values defined as the concentration of compound achieving 50 inhibition of the virus-reduced egfp signals as compared to the untreated virus-infected control cellsto test for cytotoxicity cells were incubated with serial compound dilutions as described above but in the absence of virus challenge the 50 cytotoxic concentration cc50 was determined by comparing the egfp signal from treated wells to that of control wells containing untreated cells and calculated similarly to ec50two selectivity indices si were calculated the cytotoxicityantiviral activity si provides a measure of the range where a compound is effective without being cytotoxic and was calculated as the ratio cc50ec50 the tgevsars-cov si represents the specificity of a compound in inhibiting sars-cov over tgev and was calculated as the ratio tgev ec50sars-cov ec50the validity of reduced egfp expression as a marker for virus activity was determined by titration of a sars-cov stock on veroe6-egfp cells and by calculating titers based on both egfp signal and cpe similar experiments were performed using tgev and llc-pk1-egfp cellsto determine the sensitivity of the assays defined as the lowest virus titer resulting in a detectable decrease in egfp signal serially diluted sars-cov or tgev stocks were added to their respective indicator cells and the egfp signals were recorded as described for the screening assayto determine intra- and inter-experiment reproducibility 25000 veroe6-egfp cellsml were added together with 300 ccid50 of sars-cov into 192 wells of a 384-well plate and an additional 192 wells of the same plate were seeded with 25000 uninfected veroe6-egfp cellsml as controls the egfp signal of each well was recorded 5 days post plating as described for the screening assay the experiment was repeated on three separate days and intra-experimental variation was determined by calculating mean egfp signals for the virus-infected and control cells plated within the same day inter-experimental variation was determined by calculating the mean egfp signal for the experiments performed on three separate days standard deviation sd coefficient of variation cv and signal ratio for control versus virus-infected cells were calculated for both intra- and inter-reproducibility experimentsto demonstrate the specificity of the assay defined as the ability to detect selective sars-cov inhibitors serial dilutions of an ace-2 antibody were prepared in phosphate buffered saline pbs sigma st louis mo and analyzed in parallel in the sars-cov tgev and cytotoxicity screening assays as described aboveto identify potential classes of pharmacological agents active against sars-cov a range of previously described antiviral compounds was tested table 1
 the antiviral agents included compounds targeting both viral and cellular factors ribavirin so et al 2003 and azt furman et al 1986 zhang et al 2001 were included as representatives of the widely used class of nucleoside analogs inhibiting viral polymerases selected antiviral protease inhibitors have been implicated as being active against the sars-cov yamamoto et al 2004 wu et al 2004 chu et al 2004 meriting the inclusion of lopinavirritonavir a range of non-specific antiviral reagents was included such as aurintricarboxylic acid ata dextran sulfate 5000 ds5000 and novaron glycirrhizin and s-nitroso-n-acetylpenicillamine were included due to previously reported activities against sars-cov by unclear mechanisms of action cinatl et al 2003 keyaerts et al 2004 additionally a variety of antiviral compounds acting on cellular targets were included such as p38 map kinase inhibitors tgf- inhibitors and 21 ace inhibitors table 1 separately 3388 randomly chosen compounds from a proprietary chemical library were tested all compounds were dissolved at 20 mm dimethylsulphoxide dmso sigma and then diluted in cell culture medium to a final dmso concentration below 05 to provide convenient indicator cells for the high-throughput screening assays stable cell lines constitutively expressing egfp were generated veroe6 and llc-pk1 cell lines were transduced with a packaging retrovirus carrying the egfp gene and 100 clones were isolated for each cell line for subsequent characterization studies the cells were subjected to facs analysis of egfp expression to select those clones exhibiting a profile of high mean fluorescence intensity and homogeneous signal fig 1
 the egfp expressing clones were further evaluated for susceptibility to virus infection showing all clones were susceptible to either sars-cov or tgev as measured by cpe induction after virus challenge data not shown the growth characteristics of the veroe6-egfp and llc-pk1-egfp clones were similar to the parental veroe6 and llc-pk1 cell lines data not shown indicating that the egfp expression did not affect cell proliferation as expected the transduced cells showed an exponential growth that was dependent on the initial cell density a representative example is shown in fig 2
 moreover the growth experiments showed that a final seeding density of 25000 cellsml was suitable for keeping the cells in the exponential growth phase throughout a 5-day assay period taking all selection criteria into account clone 21 of veroe6-egfp and clone 45 of llc-pk1-egfp data not shown were selected as indicator cells to be seeded at a density of 25000 cellsml in the screening assaysto ensure a reliable screening platform the reduced egfp expression was validated as a marker for virus-induced cytopathic activity and the robustness and specificity of the assays were determined the validity of using quantification of a reporter gene such as egfp to measure viral activity was determined by virus titration experiments calculating titers based on both cpe and egfp measurements the titration experiments showed a virus-concentration dependent loss of egfp expression and that virus titers scored by both methods were in good agreement table 2
 confirming that egfp expression can serve as a marker for activity of these two virusesthe assay sensitivity was determined by the lowest virus titer resulting in an at least two-fold decrease in egfp signal the indicator cells showed a significant reduction of egfp signal at virus titers as low as 20 ccid50 sars-cov and 12 ccid50 tgev fig 3
 confirming that the measurement of egfp expression in these cells allows sensitive detection of low levels of virusassay robustness or intra- and inter-assay variation was assessed by multiple egfp measurements on the same day and over several days the signal ratio between uninfected control cells and virus-infected cells varied between 41 and 198 suggesting a sufficient dynamic range to measure antiviral activity of test compounds table 3
the specificity of the assay defined as the ability to detect selective sars-cov inhibitors was determined by testing an anti-ace-2 antibody specific for the sars-cov receptor in the screening assays the antibody showed a selective and potent inhibition of sars-cov at non-cytotoxic concentrations fig 4
and table 4
the antiviral ec50 value was 143 m when measuring virus inhibition based on egfp signal table 4 and 156 m when using cpe as read-out data not shown this further shows the close correlation between egfp expression and viral cytopathic activity together the validation experiments showed that the screening system was reproducible and specific for the detection of agents active against sars-covthe sars-cov screening system was initially used to test a selection of pharmacological agents the compounds included agents targeting different viral factors as well as inhibitors of cellular p38 kinase tgf- and ace table 1 one of the 21 ace inhibitors table 4 showed a selective antiviral activity against sars-cov using a cytotoxicityantiviral activity si criterion of 3 however the llc-pk1-egfp cell line appeared to be more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of the compound than the veroe6-egfp cell line indicating that the ace inhibitor may exhibit cellular effects not observed in the sars-covveroe6-egfp assay system the other tested agents showed no antiviral activity below the cytotoxic concentration table 4 and data not shownto test the possible use of the assay system in a high-throughput setting a total of 3388 small molecule compounds were tested for selective antiviral activity against sars-cov sixty-four compounds were active in the sars-cov assay and 18 of these compounds exhibited a cytotoxicityantiviral activity si of at least 3 listed as compounds ar in table 4 the ec50 values ranged between 083 and 957 m out of the 18 anti-sars-cov active and non-cytotoxic compounds 2 showed a tgevsars-cov si of at least 3 in the absence of cytotoxic effects on any of the two indicator cell lines compounds n and p in table 4 together these results show that the combination of assays used in this screening system has the potential to provide an efficient basis for drug discoveryan important aspect of drug screening for new viral diseases is the choice of assay system a drug candidate has to fulfill a number of requirements regarding potency target specificity and cytotoxicity thus a screening system was designed with three parallel types of assays with similar set-up and read-out to evaluate all these parameters concurrently at the initial screening phase susceptible cell lines were equipped with egfp reporter genes and used for quantification of cytotoxicity sars-cov and tgev activity this assay system can be readily applied to high-throughput screening and has many advantages over assays based on laborious and subjective scoring of cpe or plaque formation the assay system described in this study requires minimal manipulation after assay set-up and no staining washing fixation or manual inspection of the tissue culture plates which is especially advantageous when working with hazardous viruses such as sars-covthe strategy to use parallel counter-screening of chemical compounds on a porcine-specific member of the coronavirus family was employed to select drug candidates with high specificity for the human sars-cov highly virus-specific compounds are more likely to exhibit a well-defined single viral target and binding site this greatly facilitates structure-activity analysis and optimization of active compounds identified in an initial screening thus the platform of three parallel screening assays described here obtains more data from the potentially useful compounds at the initial screening step than simple infectivity assays and therefore speeds up downstream drug development it is of course conceivable that potent antiviral drug candidates can be developed from compounds targeting multiple coronaviruses compounds active against other coronaviruses may be selected from the data obtained in this screening system and analyzed separatelyanalyzing a panel of reported antiviral compounds with different mechanisms of activity tested the screening system the finding that an ace inhibitor showed selective activity against sars-cov is in line with the reported usage of ace-2 as a receptor for this virus li et al 2003 ribavarin although active against a wide range of viruses and used as sars therapy so et al 2003 was shown in this study to be inactive against sars-cov in vitro at non-cytotoxic concentration which is in line with previous reports tan et al 2004 cinatl et al 2003 wu et al 2004 yi et al 2004 the variation in results obtained in this study from novaron glycirrihizin and s-nitroso-n-acetylpenicillamine as compared to previously published results may be due to assay conditions including virus strain multiplicity of infection detection method and compound concentration and handling cinatl et al 2003 keyaerts et al 2004 notably other independent groups have also observed lack of anti-sars-cov activity of glycyrrhizin hertzig et al 2004 yi et al 2004 the assay system was also evaluated in the setting of a chemical library screen compounds that were selectively active against sars-cov at non-cytotoxic compound concentrations were identified in the library screen these compounds show a potential for further optimization into potent inhibitors of sars-cov and merit detailed characterization regarding mechanism of actionin conclusion this report describes a robust screening system for identification of drug candidates selectively active against sars-cov this screening system meets the requirements of a successful high-throughput assay such as minimal manipulation after assay set-up low sample volume and automated detection of end-point furthermore this system offers considerable benefits from a first round of screening regarding selectivity specificity and toxicity of the compound resulting in an improved data set from an initial screen in comparison with existing assays based on simpler observation such as plaque formation or analysis of cpe this system with its ease of handling and good level of containment is well suited to drug discovery against the sars-cov and should be applicable to other emerging high-risk pathogenic virusesace2 angiotensin iconverting enzyme 2mers middle east respiratory syndromerbd receptorbinding

coronavirus disease 2019covid19 and has rapidly spread across the world from the initial outbreak point in wuhan china in late 2019 1 it has become a global health emergency and on march 11 2020 the world health organization who declared a pandemic status of this novel coronavirus outbreak since no approved drug that is specifically targeted to this virus exists at this point in time drug repositioningrepurposing is thought to be the most effective and feasible approach toward this clear and present threat and researchers have initiated studies by employing various means in order to find potential therapeutics 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11the sarscov2 genome is very close to that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sarscov 1 from the past efforts to cure rna virus infections including the experiences from the sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers epidemics several potential target proteins and drugs have been proposed 12 13 the 3clike main proteinase surface glycoprotein 8 and rnadependent rna polymerase are thought to be the most promising targets for anticovid19 therapeutics for example the antihiv drug lopinavirritonavir which has been proposed to treat sars 14 15 is expected to be effective toward sarscov2 3clike proteinase 16 17 additionally the antiviral drug remdesivir is expected to target the rnadependent rna polymerase 18the recent studies on drug repositioningrepurposing involve a variety of computational methods such as network analysis text mining machine learning and structurebased drug repositioning sbdr 19 20 21 22 23 24 among these methods sbdr is the most promising to find specific drugs toward a defined target protein and it prompted the quick structure analyses of sarscov2 3clike proteinase and surface glycoprotein 8 25although structure analyses of many other sarscov2 proteins would soon follow predictions of other protein structures with homologyknowledgebased theoretical methods would be required until structure analyses are completed especially for the proteins currently out of focus as drug targets in the presented study therefore the homology models of sarscov2 proteins and their ligand complexes were comprehensively constructed also the structural models of the complexes between sarscov2 proteins and potential drugs were proposed by comparing the ligand molecules of the proteins and approved experimental or natural drugsthe amino acid sequences of sarscov2 proteins table 1 were retrieved from the refseq database at ncbi 26 and structural modeling templates were sought with the sird system httpsirdnagahama-i-bioacjpsird which accepted multiple query sequences and sought for similar sequences more than 30 sequence identity to query with known structures in the protein data bank pdb 27 by using blast 28 this system also sought for the templates of protein complex structures in which two or more proteins in the multiple query were associated or any ligand bound to query proteins the coordinates of template structures were obtained from the pdb 27 and were rendered into the biological quaternary structuresinitial structural models were constructed by using modeller 29 in some cases the resultant models contain residues with rare dihedral angles ramachandran outliers rare shape of side chains rotamer outliers and short atomatom distances atomic crashes then the models were further modified by iteratively applying molecular dynamics and geometry minimization procedures of phenix 30 to eliminate aforementioned outliers and finally manual model modifications with visual inspection on coot for resolving rotamer outliers or atomic crashes 31 the model quality was evaluated with molprobity 32 the percentages of rotamer outlier ramachandran outlier and crash score were monitored for each model to achieve less than 2 005 and 5 respectivelythe molecular formula of 8085 drugs in total was retrieved from the kegg database 33 and the drugbank database 34 the molecular formula of 5780 metabolites in total which have been used for natural medicines natural drugs was obtained from the knapsack database 35the structures of the ligand molecules in the known complex structures as sought in the template search process were exhaustively compared with that of the drugs by using complig 36 complig matches molecular graphs and evaluates the similarity score of two molecules a and b as minma bma ma bmb where ma and mb are the total numbers of atoms and bonds in molecules a and b respectively and ma b is the total number of atoms and bonds matched between molecules a and b both element and chirality if applicable should be identical for atoms and bond order should be identical for bonds to be matchedselected drug molecules were built into the protein models by superposing drug molecules to known original ligand molecules with complig according to the graph matching results the dihedral angles in the drug molecules were adjusted toward the corresponding angles in the original ligand molecules and corresponding atoms were superposed between drug and known ligand by fixing the coordinates of the latter the models of proteindrug complexes were further modified with phenix and coot the constraints for drug molecules were generated by using the elbow application in phenix hydrogen bonds were evaluated with canonical parameters constraints were relaxed by 04  and 20 degrees 37 by using chimera 38 the proteinligand complexes were also assessed by using the dsx score function 39the sarscov2 genome encodes 11 genes open reading frames and the polyprotein from orf1ab is processed into 16 proteins polypeptides through cleavages by the papainlike proteinase and 3clike proteinase activities 1 12 40 as a result of template search the appropriate structural templates were found for 17 sarscov2 proteins among a total of 26 and their homology models were constructed table 1 the 9 unmodeled proteins included those from very short orfs namely nsp11 13 amino acid residues orf7b 43 residues and orf10 38 residues and probable membrane proteins nsp6 orf3a orf6 m and orf8 which were annotated by the sosui server 41since a considerable amount of structural studies have already been done for sarscov and merscov proteins most of the available templates were from these viruses and they had highsequence similarity more than 90 to sarscov2 proteins two proteins namely papainlike proteinase nsp3 and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein could not be modeled into a single structural model as a result of homology search template structures covering the entire protein were unavailable template structures were separated into 6 and 2 fragmentdomain models respectively consequently the coverages of structural model were 56 and 69 of total residues for papainlike proteinase nsp3 and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein respectively table 1the third region of papainlike proteinase nsp3 nsp4 3clike proteinase nsp9 endornase surface glycoprotein envelope protein and cterminal region of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein was modeled into homomultimer as the heteromultimeric models nsp7 and nsp8 were modeled into hetero16mer rnadependent rna polymerase nsp7 and nsp8 were modeled as heterotetramer 112 stoichiometry 3to5 exonuclease and nsp10 formed heterodimer 2oribose methyltransferase and nsp10 also formed heterodimer and homotrimer of surface glycoprotein was modeled in complex with human angiotensin iconverting enzyme 2 ace2 table 1although the models of sarscov2 protein would be useful for structurebased virtual screening potential drugs for these proteins were sought by rather simple knowledgebased method in the presented study the ligand molecules that were complexed with the homologs of sarscov2 protein in the pdb were extracted and structurally similar molecules to the ligands were sought among the approvedexperimental drugs retrieved from the kegg database 33 and the drugbank database 34 many of the approved drugs such as morphine aspirin or penicillin have been adapted from natural medicines 42 43 the molecules in the natural medicines are expected to serve as argent therapeutics therefore the ligand structures were also compared with the components of natural medicines natural drugs registered in the knapsack database 35the original ligand molecules and the detected drug molecules are summarized in table 2 a total of 11 ligand molecules were matched to 21 approvedexperimental and 5 natural drugs and the complex models of the sarscov2 proteins with several promising drugs those with high similarity score or placed in higher ranking were constructed as follows3clike proteinase is involved in the processing of viral polyprotein 44 this enzyme is one of the most extensively studied drug targets and thus analyzed in complex with various peptide mimetic inhibitors 45 46 47 48 unexpectedly these ligands did not show very high similarity to known drug molecules table 2 as a peptide mimetic drug carfilzomib showed highest score to the template ligand ligand code azp of 3clike proteinase homolog fig 1a however the similarity score between the ligand and the drug was only 0754 carfilzomib is the irreversible proteasome inhibitor targeted to the subunits with chymotrypsinlike activity and has been approved for refractory multiple myeloma or waldenstrms macroglobulinemia 49 50 a complex model of carfilzomibsarscov2 3clike proteinase was constructed in the model carfilzomib formed a parallel sheet with his164glu166 and side chains of his41 cys145 met165 leu167 phe185 and gln189 contributed major interactions fig 1bc these residues were conserved between the template sarscov and the model sarscov2 proteins carfilzomib covalently binds to active site threonine through epoxy moiety and the epoxy moiety is also reactive with thiol group of cysteine although a possible covalent linkage between carfilzomib and the catalytic cys145 of sarscov2 3clike proteinase was not explicitly modeled the epoxy moiety was placed close to the catalytic residue in this model the fitness of the ligand to sarscov2 3clike proteinase in the model was evaluated by the dsx function and the score of carfilzomib 1396 was even better than that 998 of inhibitor n3 in the complex crystal structure of sarscov2 3clike proteinase pdb id http6lu7surface glycoprotein is used for a viral

hypertension medicating drugs and several acedrug complexes have been reported 52 53 54 lisinopril enalaprilat and captopril which show similar structures to each other fig 2a have been targeted toward ace and approved for hypertension treatments 55 56 57 58 in the structural complex models these drugs were bound to the protein through a zn2 coordination with glu384 his356 and his360 fig 2bc these residues were conserved between the template ace and the model ace2 structures the drug molecules also formed electrostatic interactions with arg255 and arg500 even though these residues were not conserved between ace and ace2 gln259 and ser504 in ace the sarscov2 surface glycoprotein interacted with ace2 through the receptorbinding domain rbd while the bound drugs had no direct interaction to the rbd fig 2c suggesting that those drugs would not directly interfere the hostpathogen interactionthe dsx scores for lisinopril enalaprilat and captopril in the models were 327 436 and 250 respectively these scores were considerably inferior to that 746 of the specific inhibitor mln4760 in the crystal structure of human ace2 complex pdb id http1r4l 59the complex of 2oribose methyltransferase nsp16 and nsp10 is involved in the modification of the viral rna caps 60 the structure of 2oribose methyltransferase subunit was determined in complex with sadenosyllmethionine ligand code sam 7methylguanosine5triphosphate5guanosine gtg and sinefungin sfg 61 62 63 among these ligands sadenosyllmethionine is used for a therapeutic against depression liver disorders fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis 64 but also is an authentic substrate for this enzyme sinefungin is a natural drug produced by streptomyces griseolus and experimentally used as antibiotics 65 66 67 fig 3athe residues of 2oribose methyltransferase ser74 asp99 asn101 asp130 and met131 were involved in the major interactions with sinefungin fig 3bc these residues were conserved among the template proteins sarscov and betacoronavirus and sarscov2as the drugs similar to these ligands several investigational adenosine a1 receptor agonists namely tecadenoson selodenoson and trabodenoson were found fig 3a these molecules share adenosine moiety and this moiety interacts with the aforementioned 5 conserved residues in the complex models the dsx scores of sinefungin tecadenoson selodenoson and trabodenoson were 756 543 700 and 553 respectively the scores of sinefungin and selodenoson were comparable to that 749 of the genuine substrate sadenosyllmethionine in the complex crystal structure with merscov 2oribose methyltransferase pdb id http5yniin the presented study knowledgebased models of sarscov2 proteins were constructed by homology modeling and comparison of the known ligands with drugs since a considerable number of structure analyses have already reported for coronavirus proteins including those of sarscov 66 1726 of the sarscov2 proteins could be modeled based on highly similar 85 sequence identity and 89 coverage on average templates table 1several drugs were suggested to bind to the sarscov2 targets table 2 the procedure employed in the presented study should largely limit the extent of search because it depends on the presence of ligands in known complex structures however it is noteworthy that the binding of suggested drugs to the homologous proteins of the sarscov2 targets would be probable because of the presence of structural evidencesthe complex models were constructed for several highscored andor highranked drugs unexpectedly no drug was detected for one of the most promising drug targets 3clike proteinase with a similarity score higher than 08 in the previous study the score more than 08 was suggested to be required for highly similar interactions between ligand and protein 36 it is implied that the inhibitors bound to the 3clike proteinase in the known structures are considerably deviated from most of the approved proteasetargeted drugs for example the antihiv drug lopinavirritonavir which was expected to target sarscov2 3clike proteinase 16 17 showed only limited similarity score 0513 to the known ligand ligand code axp of sarscov 3clike proteinase fig 2a one possible reason for the low similarity to drugs is that the protease inhibitors tend to have higher molecular weight and thus their molecular structures showed large variety another reason would be that a majority of the protease inhibitory drugs are targeted toward serine or zinc proteases 68 69 also the expected drug lopinavirritonavir has been designed for hiv protease which is aspartic protease these proteases are structurally distinct from 3clike proteinase known to be a cysteine protease this observation implies that structure optimizations would likely be required for repurposed drugs for sarscov2 3clike proteinase consequently the presented study suggested carfilzomib which has been targeted toward threonine protease and approved for multiple myeloma treatment 49 50 as a marginally resembling drug the model showed however carfilzomib fits well even better than the specific inhibitor n3 according to the dsx score into the active site by forming considerable stabilizing interactions and no severe steric hindrance fig 1canother potential target is the complex of surface glycoprotein and ace2 to prevent virus entry into the cell 70 71 many hypertension drugs are targeted to ace and the presented study highlighted the approved drugs namely lisinopril enalaprilat and captopril as potential ligands for ace2 an expectation in advance was to find a drug that bound to ace2 and also interfered the interactions between surface glycoprotein and ace2 however as the models revealed the drugbinding site of ace2 existed inside a deep cleft in the center of ace2 molecule and the ligands do not interact directly with the surface glycoprotein fig 2cthe human ace2 has been demonstrated to change its conformation from open to close forms pdb ids http1r4l and http1r42 respectively upon inhibitor binding 59 thus if this conformational change involves the interface to the rbd of surface glycoprotein a drug bound to the drugbinding site might interfere with the binding between ace2 and surface glycoprotein indirectly this allosteric inhibition mechanism however is not highly expected because no obvious conformational change was observed in the interface region when comparing the open and close conformations of ace2 most of the predicted drugs are targeted toward ace not ace2 and ace and ace2 diverge considerably in their amino acid sequences 44 identity the fitness of the drugs was evaluated to be lower than the specific inhibitor to ace2 therefore effects of the predicted ace drugs on preventing surface glycoproteinace2 interactions would not be highly promisinganother target presented results highlighted was 2oribose methyltransferase nsp16nsp10 complex which is less focused as a target of drug repurposing 2oribose methyltransferase is required to finalize the cap structure 7megpppa2ome of coronavirus rnas by transferring a methyl group to 2 oh group of ribonucleotide from sadenosyllmethionine 72 73 the cap structure is essential for viral mrnas to be translated and escape from innate immune system in the host cell thus inhibition of this enzyme might prevent virus propagation despite the overall sequence identities between templates sarscov or human betacoronavirus and sarscov2 enzymes were relatively low 66 the residues interacting with the drugs were conservedamong the suggested drugs for this enzyme sinefungin is a naturally occurring and verified inhibitor of 2oribose methyltransferase since a toxicity was detected 74 however appreciation of this natural drug should be carefully considered although tecadenoson has been examined in a clinical trial for atrial fibrillation and passed phase ii test final results were not formally reported at this point of time 75 trabodenoson was designed for treating ocular hypertension and primary openangle glaucoma 76 but had failed in the phase iii clinical trial test due to lack of superiority over placebo selodenoson was designed to control heart rate 77 and it seems still in a developmental stage since tecadenoson and trabodenoson appeared to have cleared the phase i tests these drugs would worth examining against covid19 the dsx score suggested the fitness of sinefungin or selodenoson is comparable to the genuine substrate of the 2oribose methyltransferaseseveral structure

wrote the manuscript all authors commented on the manuscriptthe most common comorbidities reported in epidemiological studies of patients with covid-19 are hypertension diabetes mellitus coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease a higher number of comorbidities which increase with age are correlated with poorer clinical outcomes guan et al 2020 yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 epidemiological data show that the probability of dying from an infection with the sars-cov-2 virus increases with age from 02 in patients  39 years old to 8 in patients aged 7079 years and 15 in patients  80 years old the novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency response epidemiology team 2020 world health organization 2020 therefore it is not surprising to find an association between the use of drugs that are more commonly prescribed in older patients and poorer outcomes of covid-19 however this association alone does not yet describe anything about causalitythe reason for suspicion that some drugs might worsen the prognosis of covid-19 stems from current reports that for example ace inhibitors may lead to an increase in the number of ligands to which the sars-cov-2 coronavirus docks this hypothesis was expressed in a commentary in nature reviews cardiology zheng et al 2020 and a letter in the british medical journal sommerstein and grni 2020 the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 a membrane-bound aminopeptidase serves as a receptor for the coronavirus and therefore an entry portal into cells ace2 is also the entry receptor for sars-cov which caused the 20022004 sars outbreak during therapy with drugs such as arbs or ace inhibitors more ace2 receptors are formed theoretically producing more docking sites for the new coronavirus zheng et al 2020 because an ace inhibitor lisinopril and an arb losartan are both among the 10 most commonly used drugs with a combined 152 million prescriptions per year in the usa alone iqvia institute 2019 these patients would represent a substantial group of people at riskamong the coronaviral structural proteins the spike s protein facilitates viral entry into the host cell the s protein consists of two functional domains the s1 domain and the s2 domain the s1 domain mediates the attachment of the virus to surface receptors of the host cell whereas the s2 domain mediates subsequent fusion between viral and host cell membranes and endocytic entry of the virus hoffmann et al have recently shown that the sars-cov-2 s protein engages ace2 as the crucial entry receptor and employs the host cell serine protease tmprss2 for s protein priming hoffmann et al 2020 furthermore the direct binding of the sars-cov-2 s protein to ace2 has been confirmed by recent cryo-em studies walls et al 2020ace2 is primarily located in the lungs where it is mostly expressed in alveolar epithelial type ii cells type ii cells secrete surfactant and hence are critical to the gas exchange function of the lungs injury to these cells could explain the severe lung injury observed in covid-19 pneumonia ace2 is also found in the heart intestines kidneys and blood vessels and in soluble form in serum which may explain why covid-19 in addition to pneumonia can cause multiple organ failure in severe casesace2 constitutes an important alternative renin-angiotensin system ras pathway that counterbalances the classical ras pathway guignabert et al 2018 in the classical ras pathway angiotensin ii which is formed from angiotensin i by ace1 induces aldosterone secretion salt and water retention inflammation and severe arteriolar vasoconstriction via binding to the at1 receptor in contrast ace2 primarily hydrolyzes angiotensin ii into two other biologically active products of the ras cascade angiotensin-1-9 and angiotensin-1-7 which promote vasodilation and also reduce cell growth and inflammatory responses guignabert et al 2018animal experiments in response to the 20022004 sars outbreak have shown that infection with sars-cov leads to dysregulation of ras with reduced ace2 expression and an increase in angiotensin ii which increases lung damage kuba et al 2005 notably the injection of sars-cov s protein into mice worsened acute lung failure in vivo but this effect could be attenuated by blocking the classical ras pathway kuba et al 2005 imai et al observed that ace2 protected against severe acute lung injury in an experimental murine model of acute lung injury whereas components of the classical ras pathway including ace1 angiotensin ii and the at1a receptor promoted disease pathogenesis induced lung edema and impaired lung function furthermore recombinant ace2 protected the mice from severe acute lung injury imai et al 2005current evidence therefore suggests that ace2 serves both as an entry receptor of sars-cov-2 and to protect the lungs from injury which may be the case with covid-19 interestingly monteil et al showed that human recombinant soluble ace2 hrsace2 which has already been tested in phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of acute lung injury and pulmonary hypertension can significantly block the early stages of sars-cov-2 infection in vitro monteil et al 2020 as a result a phase 2 clinical trial with hrsace2 for the treatment of covid-19 was recently initiated in europe eudract number 2020-001172-15our knowledge about ace2 regulation in response to drugs is predominantly based on animal experiments in rodents treatment with ace inhibitors or arbs increased cardiac or renal ace2 expression andor ace2 activity ferrario et al 2005 soler et al 2009 in animal models of arterial hypertension myocardial infarction pressure overload or diabetes mellitus cardiac ace2 was downregulated compared with healthy control animals ocaranza et al 2006 tikellis et al 2006 qiao et al 2015 wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 treatment with an arb ibuprofen or pioglitazone reversed the decrease in ace2 expression in diseased animals whereas almost no effect on ace2 expression was observed in control animals qiao et al 2015 wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 other cox-2 inhibitors and ppar- ligand have not been investigated and the precise mechanisms were not established thus it remains unclear whether effects of ibuprofen and pioglitazone on ace2 expression are drug class effectsdata in humans are scarce for most patients with heart failure and during the acute phase of myocardial infarction treatment with ras inhibitors showed an increase in cardiac or circulating ace2 which was explained by the severity of heart disease rather than ras inhibitor treatment zisman et al 2003 goulter et al 2004 epelman et al 2009 although animal data suggest that drugs such as arbs ace inhibitors ibuprofen or pioglitazone can upregulate cardiac or renal ace2 the evidence from animal experiments is not fully consistent and it remains unclear whether the results are transferable to humans although the primary target of sars-cov-2 is ace2 on the cell surface of alveolar type ii cells data on drug-induced changes in pulmonary ace2 are lacking although there is evidence that comorbidities can have significant effects on ace2 expression it is difficult to assess the net effect on ace2 expression in patients moreover it would have to be shown that a drug-induced increase in ace2 expression is sufficient to facilitate sars-cov-2 entrythe local inflammatory process in severe covid-19 can induce parenchymal injuries such as damage to the alveolar-capillary unit shi et al 2020 local inflammation involves the production of prostaglandins by inducible cyclooxygenase 2 cox2 and the recruitment and activation of effector cells such as polymorphonuclear neutrophils this contributes to the development of pain and fever that occur during infection which is the main reason why nsaids are so commonly used in infections alternatively cox2 also has a pivotal role in the resolution of inflammation thereby preventing self-inflicted damage from the immune response levy et al 2001nsaids work by inhibiting the activity of cyclooxygenase enzymes cox1 or cox2 thereby blocking the production of prostaglandins that are involved in the recruitment and activation of effector cells such as polymorphonuclear neutrophils pmns given the dual role of cox2 in the inflammatory response such as amplifying the initial acute phase and then promoting resolution the question arises whether taking nsaids during sars-cov-2 infection could improve or complicate the course of the disease the question becomes particularly important because of the two-phase immune response to sars-cov-2 infection the first immune defense-based protective phase and the second inflammation-driven damaging phase leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards respiratory failure and subsequent fatality shi et al 2020 due to the current novelty of covid-19 data concerning the influence of nsaid use on covid-19 outcomes remain neededa retrospective study of critically ill 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic patients did not show any evidence that nsaid use affects mortality epperly et al 2016 following the sars outbreak caused by sars-cov investigators discovered that the nsaid indomethacin had direct antiviral activity against sars-cov via blocking viral rna synthesis independent of cox inhibition amici et al 2006 furthermore antiviral activity has been confirmed in vivo in dogs infected with canine coronavirus amici et al 2006 but no human studies have been performed to confirm a positive effect for indomethacin treatment on sars-cov or sars-cov-2 infections notably observational studies suggest an association between pre-hospital nsaid exposure and a protracted and complicated course of pneumonia voiriot et al 2019 a survey by the french national agency of medicine and health products safety revealed that infections caused by varicella and some bacterial infections could be aggravated by the nsaids ibuprofen and ketoprofen based on this report the safety committee of the european medicines agency recently initiated a review of these drugs the mechanisms by which nsaid use may lead to a complicated course of pneumonia are uncertain it could be assumed that the intake of nsaids suppresses the main symptoms of inflammation such as fever and pain and therefore delays the timely detection of pneumonia and the subsequent start of appropriate therapy voiriot et al 2019 accordingly most nsaid drug labels warn that these drugs could mask the signs or symptoms of infection another mechanism could be the immunological effects of nsaids such as the impaired resolution of inflammation thus resulting in prolonged disease voiriot et al 2019in summary there is currently no scientific evidence establishing a clear link between arbs ace inhibitors or ibuprofen and the worsening of covid-19 in contrast the experimental data support the idea that ace2 not only serves as an entry receptor for sars-cov-2 but also protects the lungs from acute injury ras inhibitors may therefore even be beneficial in covid-19 infectionavailable information to date does not support interruptions or changes in ongoing chronic treatments with ibuprofen or ras blockers recommendations are as followsbased on the currently available evidence effective treatment with ras blockers should not be discontinued or switched the relatively hypothetical risk of worsening covid-19 does not justify discontinuing or switching arbs or ace inhibitors due to the specific risk of destabilizing blood pressure control stroke heart attack or worsening heart failure van der wardt et al 2017 halliday et al 2019 insufficient control of concomitant diseases caused by drug discontinuation could make patients more susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection and complicate the course of diseasecurrently there is insufficient evidence to recommend patients who take ibuprofen for medically indicated reasons to change their anti-inflammatory medication in light of the covid-19 pandemic nsaids should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible period the choice of drug to treat fever or pain in covid-19 should be based on a benefit-risk assessment for known side effects eg kidney damage gastrointestinal ulceration and the respective treatment guidelines that in most cases recommend paracetamol as the first treatment option for fever or pain associated with infectionsangiotensin-converting enzyme ace and ace2 share homology in their catalytic domain and provide different key functions in the reninangiotensin system ras ace cleaves angiotensin i ang i to generate angiotensin ii ang ii 1 2 whereas ace2 reduces angiotensin ii levels 3 4 and is a negative regulator of the system the importance of the ras in acute respiratory distress syndrome ards has recently re-emerged owing to the identification of ace2 as a receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus sars-cov 5 in 2003 sars spread throughout the world causing more than 800 deaths due to ards 6 our studies demonstrated that ace2 protects mice from acute lung injury 7 as well as sars-mediated lung injury 8 in this article we review the role of the ras in particular ace2 in the pathogenesis of ards the possible applications of modulating the ras for the treatment of ards are also discussedards is the most severe form of acute lung injury multiple predisposing factors for ards have been reported and include sepsis acid aspiration trauma or infections with viral pathogens such as sars-cov moreover very recently h5n1 avian influenza virus has caused high lethality due to ards 9 despite recent progress the mortality associated with ards remains very high and there is no pharmacological therapy that has been shown in large-scale trials to impact mortality in ards 10factors predicting the onset or severity of ards are poorly understood but the low incidence of ards in the relatively large group of patients at risk has been shown also there are large differences in plasma ace concentrations between individuals but such concentrations tend to be similar within families 11 these suggest the involvement of genetic components in the pathogenesis of ards the human ace gene dcp1 is located on chromosome 17q23 and contains a restriction fragment length polymorphism defined by the presence insertion i or absence deletion d of a 287-bp alu repeat sequence in intron 16 nearly 50 of the variance in plasma ace activity can be accounted for by this ace insertiondeletion id polymorphism the d allele being associated with higher ace activity 12 importantly recent cohort studies of ards showed a significant association between an ace id polymorphism and the susceptibility and mortality of ards 13 the dd genotype frequency was increased in patients with ards compared with the control cohort ninety-six patients fulfilling the criteria for ards were genotyped for the ace polymorphism together with individuals from three comparison groups 88 patients with non-ards respiratory failure ventilated in the intensive care unit icu 174 icu patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and 1906 individuals from a general population group dd genotype frequency was increased in the patients with ards compared with the icu p

  00009 and the general population group p
  000004 in addition the ace dd allele significantly correlated with mortality in the ards group another study showed that patients carrying the ace ii genotype have a significantly increased survival rate 14 in that study the 28-day mortality rates were significantly different in the three ace genotypes 42 65 and 75 for ii id and dd respectively p
  0036 in the ards group taken together these data suggest a potential role for ras in the pathogenesis of ards and implicate genetic factors in susceptibility and progression of this syndromein addition to genetic correlation studies substantial clinical studies suggest the possible activation of ras in patients with ards for instance in patients with ards an elevation of ace levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid has been observed despite a reduction in circulating ace 15 reduced circulating ace levels may reflect loss of enzyme release from a damaged pulmonary vascular endothelium and may not be representative of activity in the lung compartment also it has been reported that the pulmonary capillary endothelium-bound pceb ace activity correlates with the severity of lung injury in the patients with acute lung injury 16 these data suggest the possible activation of ras in patients with ards interestingly recent retrospective epidemiological studies demonstrated that the prior outpatient use of an ace inhibitor was associated with decreased mortality in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia although further studies are needed to examine whether ace inhibitors are protective when used in an inpatient settings for patients lacking traditional indications for the use of these medications 17in 2000 a novel homologue of ace was cloned termed ace2 3 4 ace and ace2 share homology in their catalytic domain and provide different key functions in the ras ace cleaves angiotensin i to generate angiotensin ii 1 2 whereas ace2 reduces angiotensin ii levels 3 4 the biological effects of ang ii are mediated through two specific receptors ang ii receptor type 1 at1r and ang ii receptor type 2 at2r 1 2 the targeted disruption of murine ace2 resulted in increased ang ii levels impaired cardiac contractility in aged mice upregulation of hypoxia-induced genes in the heart 18 and worsened heart failure following aortic banding 19 loss of ace on an ace2 background or pharmacological inhibition of the ras can at least partially reverse the cardiac phenotypes 18 these genetic data demonstrate that ace2 counterbalances the function of ace and negatively regulates ang ii levels within the ras fig 1
our group has investigated the role of ace2 in ards using ace2 knockout mice 7 in acid aspiration-induced ards endotoxin-induced ards as well as peritoneal sepsis-induced ards ace2 knockout mice exhibited very severe disease compared with control mice that express ace2 loss of ace2 expression in mutant mice also resulted in enhanced vascular permeability increased lung edema neutrophil accumulation and worsened lung function of note these pathologic manifestations occurred without apparent changes in heart contractility or pulmonary vascular tone among the experimental groups mechanistically the negative regulation of ang ii levels by ace2 accounts in part for the protective function of ace2 in ards for example at1 inhibitor treatment or additional ace gene deficiency on an ace2 knockout background rescues the severe phenotype of ace2 single mutant mice in acute lung injury in addition ace knockout mice and at1r knockout mice but not at2r knockout mice showed improved symptoms of acute lung injury therefore in acute lung injury ace ang ii and at1r promote acute lung injury whereas ace2 and the at2r protect from lung injury 7 importantly the treatment with catalytically active but not enzymatically inactive recombinant ace2 protein improved the symptoms of acute lung injury in wild type mice as well as in ace2 knockout mice suggesting ace2 protein as a possible novel therapeutic target for ards fig 2
within a few months following the publication of the sars-cov genome ace2 was identified as a potential receptor in cell line studies in vitro 5 ace2 binds sars-cov spike and supports syncytia formation the fusion of spike-protein expressing cells into large multinucleated cells that can be also seen in real sars infections using a mouse sars infection model with ace2 knockout mice our group then provided evidence that ace2 is indeed essential for sars infections in vivo 8 when ace2 knockout mice are infected with the sars coronavirus they were resistant to virus infection virus titers from the lung tissues of infected ace2 knockout mice were 105-fold lower than that isolated from the lungs of sars-cov-infected wild type mice thus without excluding a second functional sars-cov receptor ace2 is an essential receptor for sars infections in vivodespite many studies on sars-cov one mystery of sars-cov is why in contrast to the other coronaviruses infections with the sars-cov trigger severe lung disease with such high mortality accumulating evidence further indicates that severe sars infections are dependent on the burden of viral replication as well as on the immunopathologic consequences of the host response our studies have implicated the involvement of the ras in sars pathogenesis intriguingly wild type mice infected with sars-cov showed markedly downregulated ace2 expression in lungs similarly treatment with recombinant sars-spike protein in the absence of any other virus components downregulates ace2 expression in vitro and in vivo thus sars-cov-infected or spike protein-treated wild type mice resemble ace2 knockout mice and similar to ace2 mutant mice spike-treated wild type mice show markedly more severe pathology in acute lung injury in addition in spike-treated mice ang ii peptide levels were increased and the worsened ards symptoms could be partially reversed by at1r blocker treatment thus the downregulation of ace2 expression in sars-cov infections might play a causal role in sars pathogenesis especially in disease progression to ardspulmonary circulation is a potentially important target for the ras activation in the lung for instance ang ii via its type 1 receptor at1r induces pulmonary vasoconstriction in response to hypoxia suggesting important roles of at1r in elevating pulmonary vascular tone that can result in pulmonary edema 20 also infusion of ang i 21 or ang ii 22 can produce pulmonary edema independent of catecholamine release these data suggest an important role for the ras in regulating pulmonary vascular tone which might also contribute to the pathogenesis of ardsin addition to increased vascular tone and a subsequent hydostatic edema formation accumulating data suggest that ang ii also increases vascular permeability via at1r whereas stimulation of at2 receptors exerts an opposite effect 23 several mediators have been implicated in ang ii regulated vascular permeability changes including eicosanoids ie leukotriene c4 prostaglandin e2 and i2 and vascular permeability factor however relatively few studies have addressed whether the ras is involved in the increased vascular permeability observed in ards our study demonstrated that loss of ace2 results in increased vascular permeability using evans blue dye injections as an in vivo indicator of albumin leakage in mice this vascular permeability was significantly attenuated in the lungs of at1r mutant mice these data indicate that loss of ace2 expression and increased ang ii levels can trigger leaky pulmonary blood vessels through at1r stimulation in ards 7both ace and ace2 are unspecific proteases and can cleave additional substrates that might also play important roles in aceace2-regulated ards independent of ang ii one of the ace and ace2 targets is bradykinin and its peptide metabolites bradykinin is the key effecter in the kallikreinkinin system and also functions as a major proinflammatory mediator bradykinin is degraded by two main kinases which are ace also known as kinase ii in this system and neutral endopeptidase the biological effects of bradykinin are mediated by b1 receptor b1r and b2 receptor b2r b2r mediate most the known effects of bradykinin including antiproliferative antioxidant and antithrombotic effects 24 the in vivo effects mediated via b1r or b2r are still poorly characterized a recent study suggests that expression of b1r is induced by cytokines during inflammation in rats 25 albeit the role of bradykinin in ang ii-induced inflammation remains unclearace2 can remove in in vitro assays the c-terminal residue from apelin and other vasoactive peptides such as neurotensin and neurotensin-related peptide kinetensin moreover the opioid peptides dynorphin a 113 and -casamorphin are also substrates of ace2 in contrast to ace ace2 does not metabolize bradykinin but catalytically inactivates both des-arg9-bradykinin and lysdes-arg9-bradykinin 3 26 thus although many ace2 functions have been attributed to the regulation of ang ii levels ang ii itself is probably only part of the ace2 story and other ace2 substrates might play a major role in understanding ace2 functions importantly our own preliminary results suggest that inhibition of the bradykinin receptor can also alleviate ards yi and jmp unpublishedrecently the critical importance of ras in the pathogenesis of ards has been established in genetic animal models ace2 protects murine lungs from acute lung injury induced by acid aspiration endotoxin shock and peritoneal sepsis 7 in addition ace knockout mice and at1r knockout mice but not at2r knockout mice showed improved symptoms of acute lung injury 7 consistent with other experimental studies 17 27 28 also ace2 has been identified as a key sars-cov receptor 5 8 and importantly ace2 plays a protective role in sars-cov-mediated lung injury 8 therefore in acute lung injury ace ang ii and at1r promote acute lung injury whereas ace2 and the at2r protect from lung injury these findings might provide the opportunity to develop recombinant ace2 as a novel drug in ards along with at1r inhibitor or ace inhibitor to possibly treat emerging infectious lung diseases such as avian influenza a h5n1 and other diseases that affect lung function table 1
 in addition as ace2 is an unspecific protease it would be also interesting to investigate the role of ace2 and its metabolites including angiotensin-17 des-arg9-bradykinin apelin or dynorphin in ards we look forward to the use of angiotensin system-modulating agentsmolecules in particular ace2 as novel therapeutic agents to treat severe acute lung failure a syndrome that affects millions of people without any yet effective drug treatmentscoronaviruses cov have long been recognized as causative agents of diseases that negatively impact production in livestock poultry and companion animals holmes 2003 bovine coronavirus bcov is classified in the order nidovirales family coronaviridae subfamily coronavirinae genus betacoronavirus and species betacoronavirus 1 it is prevalent worldwide and antibodies can be detected in the majority of cattle hasoksuz et al 2008 host-shifting events involving in cross species transmission in bcov have been described in the past involving captive wild ruminants alekseev et al 2008 dogs kaneshima et al 2006 and humans holmes 2003 enteric infections associated with bcov have been recognized in alpaca crias cebra et al 2003 and has been detected in intestinal tissue from adult alpacas suffering hemorrhagic enteritis genova et al 2008 this article reports the occurrence of a betacoronavirus similar to bcov in fecal samples from 1 to 3 week old alpaca crias in the high peruvian andes based on partial nucleotide sequencing of rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp genebetween february and march 2009 60 fecal samples with normally consistency from 1 to 3 week old asymptomatic crias of six farms of the la raya experimental research station in melgar province puno department peru which is located at 4200 m above sea level were used in this study three of these farms alpacas and cattle shared the same pastures the method of sampling from animals complied with the principles of ethical committee in the use of animals of the school of veterinary medicine and animal science of university of so paulototal rna of fecal samples was extracted using trizol reagent invitrogen and cdna synthetized using 50 ng of random primers invitrogen and 200 u of moloney murine leukemia virus m-mlv reverse transcriptase invitrogen following the manufacturers recommended protocol detection of cov was performed using a pancoronavirus nested pcr reaction with specific primers targeting the rdrp gene chu et al 2011 positive and negative control reaction were kakegawa strain of bcov and dietylpirocarbonate depc treated water respectively platinum taq dna polymerase invitrogen was used for pcr and nested according to the manufacturers protocolamplicons of cov were purified using exosap-it pcr product cleanup affymetrix and sequenced with an abi prism 3500 genetic dna analyzer applied biosystems the maximum likelihood tree using gtr as substitution model was constructed using mega v 606 software tamura et al 2013eleven of the 60 fecal samples were positive for coronavirus these positive samples came from crias on two different farms located approximately 100 m from each other both with mixed alpaca-cattle pastures phylogenetic analysis of the generated sequences 393 nt all segregated within the species betacoronavirus 1 fig 1

paper has a financial or personal relationship with other people or organizations that could inappropriately influence or bias the content of the papera new coronavirus sars-cov-2 covid-19 has been identified as the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars a severe form of viral pneumonia associated with high mortality this virus spread from china to the rest of the world into a real short period and with an important severity leading the world health organization who to consider a global emergencysars-cov-2 is a rna virus sharing about 80 of the viral genome with sars-cov responsible for the 2003 outbreak wu 2020several studies confirmed that the virus is able to penetrate into human cells by binding to ace-2 protein the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 which is part of the renin-angiotensin system ras guoping et al 2020 and considered as a possible membrane receptor it has also been noted that patients infected by this virus during the sick days have functional variations in the concentrations of enzymes components of the ras huang et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 this is a defense mechanism of the human host that helps against the infection or is responsible for a worsening of clinical conditions and as consequence to be corrected pharmacologically gurwitz 2020the renin-angiotensin system ras is a physiological mechanism able to regulate different functions of the body in particular the most important are the regulation of blood pressure the volume of circulating plasma volemia and the tone of the arterial muscles through different mechanisms ras is an enzymatic cascade the main enzyme pathway classical is renin which converts the angiotensinogen released by the liver into angiotensin i ang i ang i is subsequently converted to angiotensin ii ang ii by the angiotensin-converting enzyme ace there is also another non-classical enzyme pathway mediated by ace-2 atlas 2007 in this pathway ace-2 converts ang ii to angiotensin 1-7 ang 17 and ang i to angiotensin 1-9 ang 19ace-2 is a type i membrane metallocarboxypeptidase with high ace homology the functions are distinct and the two enzymes are also expressed differently in tissues for example ace-2 is most expressed in renal cardiovascular pulmonary and gastrointestinal tissues ace activity is highly expressed in the lungs brain and kidneys nehme et al 2019 some aspects on the correlation between the various stages of sars-cov-2 infection and the ras variation remain to be clarified sars-cov-2 infection has been divided into three phases the first asymptomatic or slightly symptomatic the second and the third more severe characterized by hyperinflammatory state in the second and third phase it seems that the worst damage is caused by a generalized inflammatory state caused by a cytokine storm and responsible for severe lung injury and multi-organ dysfunction watkins 2020several studies have shown that variation in the ras can be very related to sars-cov-2 infection and involved in all stagesace-2 has been identified as an input membrane receptor for sars-cov-2 in epithelial lung cells this evidence may suggest that increased expression of ace-2 is related to an increased risk of sars-cov-2 infectionin addition as described above variations in ras were noted during the various stages of sars-cov-2 infection in particular the evidence showed increased activation of the system in the early stages and then decreased in subsequent stages although the data showing these variations are conflicting and not entirely clear zheng et al 2020 fang et al 2020 certainly the activation of ras is known to change in conditions such as copd asthma during viral infections and in smokers demonstrating that the system is related to correct lung and airway function the evidence suggests that the physiological balance of the ras system and especially between aceace-2 is likely to be altered by sars-cov-2 viral infection this ras imbalance is likely to play a role in lung lesion and inflammatory state activation but these aspects have yet to be clarified in this direction the pharmacological approach to regulated the concentration of aceace-2 could be a way to moderate severe lung damage virus-induced bavishi et al 2016 ferrario et al 2005 in addition ace-2 has been shown to play a role in fibrogenesis and inflammation of different organs including the lungs studies in patients infected with sars-cov-2 showed that ace-2 expression has a rapid increase in the first hours of viral infection then begins rapid down-regulation in the lung tissue when the patient enters stage two and three of the infection however it can be possible that ace-2 has a protective effect and when it decreases there is a worsening of the lungs inflammatory state in addition specific studies show that ace-2 expression is decreased in respiratory diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis or copd it should also be noted that ang ii ang 17 and ang 19 have different biological effects in fact the biological effects of ang ii are vasoconstrictor and aldosterone release stimulant but can cause also myocardial hypertrophy interstitial fibrosis endothelial dysfunction increase of inflammation state oxidative stress and increased of coagulation biological effects that if altered can cause serious complications in a patient with sars-cov-2 infection zhang et al 2020 ang ii can cause increased inflammation through production of il-6 tnf tumor necrosis factor and other inflammatory cytokines recinos et al 2006 yamamoto et al 2011 lee et al 2002however it is important to note that all these biological effects are mediated by at-1 receptors at-1r ace-2 can reduce the negative effects of ang ii through several mechanisms for example by the conversion of ang ii to ang 17 ang1-7 has opposite biological effects to ang ii through the mas receptor masr and type ii receptors of ang ii at-2r the masr are expressed on the surface of bronchial muscle and alveolar epithelium of the lungs magalhaes et al 2015 and the ang 17 has anti-inflammatory and antifibrosis effects by masr agonist effect chen et al 2013 meng et al 2014in addition masr are expressed on platelets and ang 17 mediates the antiaggregant effects fang et al 2013 pai et al 2017 fraga-silva et al 2011 because it is able to increase prostacyclines fraga-silva et al 2008 this description suggest that pharmacological modulation of ras at different stages of sars-cov-2 infection could be a beneficial and effective therapya pharmacological approach modulating ras could be of clinical benefit to fight sars-cov-2 infection agents acting on ras can be distinguished as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors aceis angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs and direct renin inhibitors dris bavishi et al 2020these agents are currently indicated for the treatment of various cardiovascular diseases with excellent clinical efficacy aceis are able to reduce blood pressure by acting with ace inhibition which converts ang i to ang ii arbs are ang ii antagonists on the type 1 receptor at-1r finally dris block plasma renin activity and inhibit the conversion of angiotensinogen to ang i the three different classes described above have different effects on the regulation and enzymatic expression of ras in fact on the basis of in vitro studies it seems that the use of aceis with a blockade of the enzyme ace increases the expression of the enzyme ace-2 stimulating other synthesis pathways although these data are not fully confirmed and at the moment very contradictory vaduganathan et al 2020 the use of arbs seems to be linked to a slight increase in the expression of both ace and ace-2 finally the use of dris by inhibiting the upstream ras cascade seems to inhibit expression and consequently decrease ace and ace-2 concentrations this shows that there are available agents able to act with a different modulation of ras expression and its components these evidences suggest that ras could be modulated with a pharmacological approach to avoid complications of viral infection there is a scientific debate still ongoing for several months as to whether increased ace-2 using aceis or arbs could be a risk factor for covid-19 infection at the moment epidemiological data do not show any correlation between the use of aceis or arbs and increased likelihood of infection or complications of sars-cov-2 however an increase in ace-2 in the more severe stages of viral infection could be beneficial an increase in ace-2 synthesizes more ang 17 and ang-1-9 with vasodilating antinfiammatory and antifibrotic properties schindler et al 2007 imai et al 2005 in addition the use of arbs increases the stimulation of at-2r by ang ii with vasodilating antifibrotic and antioxidant effectsin conclusion there is currently no evidence which demonstrate that the use of aceis or arbs should be discontinued in treated patients because they do not represent a risk factor that increases the likelihood of sars-cov-2 infection mancia et al 2020 however it has been shown that the activation of the ang ii-at-1r axis can promote lung damage while increasing ace-2 and activating the ang 17masr axis may protect against lung damage kuster et al 2020 european society of hypertension 2020 ras modulating agents may be beneficial in combating sars-cov-2 infection clinical studies are necessary to confirm these hypothesesmore extensive epidemiological studies should be designed to investigate the real correlation between ras and covid-19 in particular to clarify whether an increase of ace-2 with aceis or arbs can be considered an important risk factor of sars-cov-2 infection and whether an increase of ace-2 in the most severe stages of infection can play a protective

interest to disclosecoronaviruses covs have a single-stranded rna genome size range between 262 and 317 kb positive sense covered by an enveloped structure1 the shape is either pleomorphic or spherical and it is characterized by bears club-shaped projections of glycoproteins on its surface diameter 80120 nm1 among all the rna viruses the rna genome of cov is one among the largest2 the number of open reading frames orfs in the cov genome ranges from six to ten2 cov genetic material is susceptible for frequent recombination process which can give rise to new strains with alteration in virulence3 there are seven strains of human covs which include 229e nl63 oc43 hku1 middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov and 2019-novel coronavirus ncov responsible for the infection with special reference to the involvement of the respiratory tract both lower and upper respiratory tract eg common cold pneumonia bronchiolitis rhinitis pharyngitis sinusitis and other system symptoms such as occasional watery and diarrhea45 among these seven strains three strains proved to be highly pathogenic sars-cov mers-cov and 2019-ncov which caused endemic of severe cov disease5 the reservoir of sars-cov is unknown but bats and subsequent spread to himalayan palm civets are hypothesized6 mers-cov also has a zoonotic origin in the middle east and the transmission is through camels7 among these the sars-cov outbreak started in 2003 in guangdong province of china and the second outbreak of the mers-cov outbreak in 2012 in saudi arabia146 previous to these two attacks cov was known to cause milder disease and these two outbreaks highlighted their adaptive potential to the changing environmental conditions and they are classified under emerging viruses knowledge about the structure metabolic pathways of cov and pathophysiology of cov-associated diseases is important to identify possible drug targets8the most important structural proteins of cov are spike s protein trimeric membrane m protein envelop e protein and the nucleocapsid n protein some of the viruses such as beta-covs also have hemagglutinin esterase he glycoprotein3 the rna genome of cov has seven genes that are conserved in the order orf1a orf1b s oef3 e m n in 5 to 3 direction the two-third part of the rna genome is covered by the orf1ab which produces the two viral replicase proteins that are polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab9 sixteen mature nonstructural proteins nsps arise from further processing of these two pps these nsps take part in different viral functions including the formation of the replicase transcriptase complex the remaining genome part of the virus encodes the mrna which produces the structural proteins ie spike envelope membrane and nucleocapsid and other accessory proteins9 another important envelop-associated protein which is expressed by only some strains of cov is the he protein10 the rna genome of cov is packed in the nucleocapsid protein and further covered with envelope11in case of sars-cov transmission is through droplet infection respiratory secretions and close person-to-person contact1112 it can also spread through sweat stool urine and respiratory secretions13 when virus enters into the body it binds to the primary target cells such as enterocytes and pneumocytes1112 thereby establishing a cycle of infection and replication other target cells of cov are epithelial renal tubules tubular epithelial cells of kidney immune cells and cerebral neuronal cells1112cov attaches to the target cells with the help of spike proteinhost cell protein interaction angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ace-2 interaction in sars-cov14 and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp-4 in mers-cov15 after the receptor recognition the virus genome with its nucleocapsid is released into the cytoplasm of the host cells the viral genome contains orf1a and orf1b genes which produce two pps that are pp1a and pp1b16 which help to take command over host ribosomes for their own translation process17 both pp1a and pp1b take part in the formation of the replication transcription complex16 after processing of pp by protease it produces 16 nsps all nsps have their own specific functions such as suppression of host gene expression by nsp1 and nsp2 formation of a multidomain complex by nsp3 nsp5 which is a m protease which has role in replication17 nsp4 and nsp6 which are transmembrane tm proteins18 nsp7 and nsp8 which act as a primase16 nsp9  a rna-binding protein the dimeric form of which is important for viral infection induction of disturbance to the dimerization of nsp919 can be a way to overcome cov infection20 nsp10 acts as a cofactor for the activation of the replicative enzyme21 nsp12 shows rna-dependent rna polymerase activity nsp13 shows helicase activity nsp14 shows exoribonuclease activity nsp15 shows endoribonuclease activity and nsp16 has methyltransferase activity18 all nsps have an important role in replication and transcription18synthesized proteins such as m e and s are entered into the endoplasmic reticulum er-golgi intermediate compartment ergic complex and make the structure of viral envelope22 on the other hand the replicated genome binds to n protein and forms the ribonucleoprotein rnp complex the outer cover is formed by the m e and s proteins22 finally the virus particle comes out of the ergic by making a bud-like structure23 these mature virions form a vesicle which fuses with the plasma membrane and releases the virus particles into the extracellular region2324 the detailed structure of cov and its life cycle is depicted in figures 1 and 2 on infection the sars-cov and mers-cov cause a surge of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines which cause damage to lung tissue13 deterioration of lung function and then finally lung failure in some cases25currently there is no specific antiviral drug for the treatment of cov-associated pathologies most treatment strategies focus on symptomatic management and supportive therapy only2627 some therapeutic agents that are under development or being used off-label are ribavirin interferon ifn- and mycophenolic acid7 there are many newspaper articles citing effectiveness of anti-hiv drugs ritonavir2829 lopinavir29 either alone or in combination with oseltamivir29 remdesivir and chloroquine28 and among these ritonavir remdesivir and chloroquine showed efficacy at cellular level28 which further need experimental support and validationas there is no well-defined therapy available which specifically targets cov in this article we have reviewed the possible protein structures which could be potential targets for the development of a therapeutic approach for the treatment of covwe screened pubmed and rcsb

were extracted using endnote and title and abstract screening was done using rayyan qcri full texts of these screened articles were further screened for possible inclusion in the systematic review articles that evaluated different druggable targets of cov and evaluated different therapeutic measures against some identifiable target were included for further reviewthe main components of the s1 domain are the n-terminal domain ntd and the c-terminal domain ctd the s1 domain acts as a major antigen on the surface of the virus40 and has a receptor-binding domain rbd25 the 18 residues of ace-2 interact with the rbd contain 14 amino acids of sars-cov spike protein45 and for this contact k341 of ace-2 and r453 residue of rbd play the most important role if point mutated on the d454 or r441 of rbd it disturbs the binding activity with ace-225 the s1 domain interacts with the ace-2 or dpp-4 receptors of the host anti-ace-2 antibody blocked viral entry and replication in vero e6 cells1445 one

interferes with the virus receptor binding51other inhibitors ssaa09e2 block the s-ace2 interaction ssaa09e1 inhibits the host protease cathepsin l which is important for viral entry and ssaa09e3 prevents fusion of host and viral cell membrane52kao et al identified 18 small molecules that targeted the s-ace-2-mediated entry of virus into human cell53 in 293t cells expressing ace-2 one of these agents ve607 showed a significant inhibition of sars-pseudovirus entry53 in vero e6 cells two other molecules tetra-o-galloyl beta-d-glucose and luteolin also inhibited sars-pseudovirus and sars-cov

protein is the smallest 8412 kda size tm structural protein of cov5859 two distinct domains comprise the e protein the hydrophobic domain and the charged cytoplasmic tail however the structure is highly variable among different members of the cov family59the e protein has a special role in viral morphogenesis especially during assembly and egress59 covs lacking e protein show lower viral titer immature and inefficient progenies5860 oligomerization of e proteins leads to the formation of ion channels61 however the importance of these ion channels is still not clear many other studies infer that the e protein acts in coordination with other intracellular proteins and modulates the activity of those proteins59 e protein also acts as a virulence factor59 e protein has an important role in cov assembly and budding formation24 apart from this e protein found around the er and golgi body regions60 hexamethylene amiloride blocks this e protein-associated ion channel activity in the mammalian cells expressing sers-cov envelop protein62maintenance of the shape of the viral envelope is the most important function of the m protein60 and the m protein performs this job by interacting with other cov proteins63 incorporation of golgi complex into new virions60 and stabilization of nucleocapsid protein60the m protein is characterized by three tm domains64 with c-terminal inside long and n-terminal short outside63 the details of the protein structure is available in uniprot65 through multiple proteinprotein interactions the m protein plays a crucial role in viral intracellular homeostasis60 interaction between mm ms and mn proteins takes a special part in viral assembly60 the ms interactions are necessary for the interaction of spike protein in the ergic complex also known as the golgi complex which is later incorporated into new viral progenies60 the mn interactions are crucial for the stabilization of the rnp complex nucleocapsidrna complex which forms the viral core60 the m protein and the n protein are the major viral envelope proteins defining viral shape but it also takes part in the formation and release of virus-like particles60m protein also takes part in the sensitization of the host by the virus66 the m protein of sars-cov activates the nuclear factor kappa pathway and ifn-beta pathway through a toll-like receptor-dependent mechanism again a mutated m protein v-68 failed to illicit an ifn-beta response66mice vaccinated with sars-m dna showed t-cell immune response both induction and proliferation57 and cytotoxic t-cell response was seen against sars-dna-transfected alveolar epithelial cellsthe structure of nucleocapsid protein n protein is conserved across different members of the cov family the three characteristic intrinsically disordered regions idrs of the nucleocapsid n protein are the n-arm central linker cl and the c-tail4 the ntd and the ctd are the major structural and functional domain of the nucleocapsid protein the most important function of the n protein ntd is rna binding while the primary job of the ctd is dimerization49 as the cl region is rich in arginine and serine residue content it also contains a large number of phosphorylation sites26 the c-terminal idrs take an important part in nucleocapsid protein oligomerization and nm protein interactions67formation and maintenance of the rnp complex are the most important functions of the n protein9 it also regulates the replication and transcription of viral rna and in the host it inhibits protein translation through ef1-mediated action9 alteration of host cell metabolism host cell cycle n proteins are reported to inhibit cdk4 and apoptosis39 in human peripheral blood n protein inhibits cell proliferation through the inhibition of cytokinesis68the ntd contains sites for rna binding the rna-binding sites on the ntd of n protein were identified by observing its interactions with ribonucleoside 5-monophosphates amp ump cmp and gmp26 using the information about interaction between amp and ump binding to the ntd of nucleocapsid protein inhibitors of rna binding were designed three-dimensional structure with all complex can see from pdb that is 4lmc 4lm9 4lm7 and 4li4 respectively26 one such molecule which was designed with this strategy is n-6-oxo-56-dihydrophenanthridine-2-yl n n dimethyl amino pj34 which was designed using the hcov-oc43 model26 binding of pj34 on ntd affects the genome binding and replication process of cov26 the crystal structure of cov-oc43 n-ntd with inhibitor pj34 complex is given in pdb id 4kxj26 on the basis of interactions between pj34 and ntd of nucleocapsid protein another inhibitor was designed that is h3 6-chloro-7-2-morpholin-4-yl-ethylamino quinoxaline-58-dione which also inhibits rna binding2669 this highlights the importance of ntd in rna binding some of the herbal products such as catechin gallate and gallocatechin gallate both are polyphenolic compounds have shown the inhibitory action against sars-cov70the ctd of n protein has a primary role in oligomerization especially the c-terminal end a c-terminal tail peptide sequence n377389 competes with the oligomerization process and significant inhibition of viral titer was seen at 300 m concentration71n220 which is a nucleocapsid protein peptide showed a high binding affinity to human mhc-1 in t2 cells and the peptide sequence was successful in activating t-cells cytotoxic in transgenic animals the peptide further showed potential to selective killing of nucleocapsid protein expressing cells

hydrolyzed all ntps88 toxicity issues are main obstacles in the development of inhibitors of helicase and nonspecificity of inhibitors may cause serious toxicity87 however despite theoretical limitations helicase is being increasingly recognized as a druggable target for different disease conditions89once entered into the host cell the subsequent life cycle of sers-cov requires low ph90 inhibitors of ph-sensitive endosomal protease block cov infection9091 several different small compounds and molecules have been reported against virus infection amiodarone gets accumulated in the acidic organelles vacuoles on exposure to amiodarone shows alteration in intracellular organelles especially enlargement of late endosomes in in-vitro environment amiodarone inhibited coronavirus infection in vero cells92 at priori trypsin cleavage of s protein is essential for a successful viral entry however trypsin cleavage also does not affect the efficacy of amiodarone92in the rcsb database only one pdb pdb id 6lu7 is there on the 2019-ncov which is in complex with n3 inhibitor the complete sequence of the 2019-ncov is available93 however it is only 95 similar to bat-sl-covzc45

traditional chinese medicines background use of stem cells is also evaluated frequently94nilthere are no conflicts of interestthe reninangiotensin system ras plays a central role in the control of cardiovascular functions by maintaining the physiologic homeostasis of blood pressure and electrolyte balance abnormal activation of the ras has been associated with the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension myocardial infarction or heart failure 13 for many years the angiotensin-converting enzyme ace has been known as the key enzyme in the regulation of the ras 4 5in the year 2000 a novel homologue of ace was cloned termed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 6 7 despite the sequence similarity in their metalloprotease catalytic domains ace and ace2 differ in their substrate specificity this difference has important physiological consequences whereas ace cleaves the decapeptide angiotensin i ang i into an octapeptide angiotensin ii ang ii 4 5 ace2 functions as a carboxypeptidase cleaving a single residue from ang i generating angiotensin-19 6 7 and a single residue from ang ii to generate angiotensin-17 79 fig 1 targeted disruption of murine ace2 resulted in increased systemic ang ii levels impaired cardiac contractility in aged mice and upregulation of hypoxia-induced genes in the heart 10 these genetic data for the first time demonstrated that ace2 functions as a negative regulator of ang ii levels within the ras in the heart

recently ace2 has been identified as a functional receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-coronavirus sars-cov in vitro 11 12 and in vivo 13 during several months in 2003 a newly identified illness termed sars spread rapidly throughout the world causing more than 800 deaths and disrupting travel economics and social life 1416 a novel coronavirus termed sars-cov was identified as the causative sars pathogen 17 18 the death rate following infection was 10 due to the development of atypical pneumonia characterized by high fever and the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 1921 ards is the most severe form of acute lung injury characterized by pulmonary edema accumulation of inflammatory cells and severe hypoxia 1921 ards has a very high mortality rate of 3050 and affects nearly one million individuals worldwideyear ards can be triggered by various diseases such as sepsis trauma aspiration acute pancreatitis or pneumonias including infections with sars-cov or avian and human influenza viruses 19 20 22 23the sars-cov receptor ace2 is expressed in the lungs of healthy and diseased humans 24 and our recent studies definitely showed that ace2 is indeed an essential receptor for sars infections in mice in vivo 13 in the pathogenesis of ards ang ii is upregulated by ace and drives severe lung failure via the ang ii type 1 at1 receptor 25 on the other hand ace2 and the ang ii type 2 receptor regulate opposing effects and have protective roles against lung injury in addition sars-cov-mediated down-regulation of ace2 appears to play a causative role in severe acute lung injury in sars through enhanced activation of at1 receptors 13the beneficial effects of ace inhibitors or at1 receptor blockers on hypertension in the clinics have been functionally proven by in vivo models using mice deficient in ace angiotensinogen or the ang ii type 1a receptor all of which mice show lower blood pressure 9 26 27 fig 1 the in vitro activity of ace2 to cleave ang ii to angiotensin-17 encouraged researchers to propose that ace2 is also a major regulator of blood pressure homeostasis after our initial study showing reduced ace2 expression in different hypertensive rat strains 10 the upregulation of ace2 expression is reported in the under-nutrition programmed hypertension rats 28 and at1 receptor blocker-treated 29 or all-trans retinoic acid-treated 30 hypertensive rats accompanied by a reduction in blood pressure on the other hand it was surprising to find that ace2 knockout mice per se show apparently normal blood pressures 10 however it is likely that mouse-strain-specific background genes might influence the effects of ace2 on blood pressure despite no direct correlation between essential hypertension and ace2 polymorphisms in an earlier clinical study 31 two recent chinese population studies indicated that the ace2 g8790a polymorphism is associated with cardiac incompetence in essential hypertension patients or with hypertension in metabolic syndrome patients 32 33 these findings implicated the significance of the ace2 g8790a polymorphism in cardiovascular diseases of note all of these studies investigated single nucleotide polymorphisms snps located in the introns of the ace2 gene the effects of these snps on the activity andor expression of ace2 are still unknown nevertheless the data of hypertensive rats and human ace2 snps implicate the possible significance of ace2 in blood pressure regulation and further studies are awaitedinitially ace2 was identified and cloned from human failing heart tissue 7 in line with this increased ace2 expression in the failing heart has been reported independently 3437 and the protective role of ace2 in pressure-overload-induced heart failure was recently shown in a transverse aortic constriction model using ace2 knockout mice 38 furthermore the function of ace2 in basal condition was defined by the echocardiography measurements showing a progressive impairment of heart contractility in aged ace2-gene-deficient mice without histological changes in the heart 10 the observed phenotype of ace2 mutant mice resembles the defective heart found in patients with cardiac stunninghibernation 39 cardiac stunning and hibernation reflect adaptive responses to prolonged states of tissue hypoxia that can occur in coronary artery disease or following bypass surgery 39 40 pathologically chronic hypoxic conditions can lead to compensatory changes in myocyte metabolism 41 upregulation of hypoxia-induced genes 42 43 and possibly resembling myocyte-specific vascular endothelial growth factor mutant mice 44 the link between cardiac stunninghibernation and the heart defect observed in ace2 knockout mice has to be further investigatedinterestingly additional deletion of ace gene on an ace2 mutant background rescued the cardiac contractility phenotype of ace2 single knockout mice and also reversed the increased ang ii peptide levels 10 the normal cardiac functions of aceace2 double-mutant mice suggest that aces catalytic products account at least in part for the observed contractile impairment of old ace2 single-mutant mice 10 these observations for the first time demonstrated at the genetic level that ace2 counterbalances the enzymatic actions of ace it seems that increased local cardiac ang ii might have been the cause for the cardiac abnormalities in ace2-deficient mice nevertheless it remains unclear why the elevated heart ang ii levels do not induce cardiac hypertrophy in the ace2-deficient mice for instance in experimental models it is well established that cardiomyocytes express ang ii receptors and undergo hypertrophy and fibrosis in response to ang ii stimulation 45 thus it is important to note that ang ii-independent pathways could also play an important role in aceace2-regulated heart functionsthe major sites of ace expression in our body are vascular endothelial cells in the lungs and thus it has been proposed that systemic ang ii is mainly generated in the lung 4 5 46 experimentally a possible role of ang ii in lung disease has been implied from animal models of pulmonary fibrosis elicited by bleomycin or irradiation-mediated lung injury in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats or mice ace inhibitors or at1 receptor blockers can attenuate epithelial apoptosis interstitial fibrosis and collagen deposition 4750 those reports implicated ace inhibitors or at1 receptor blockers as possible therapy for pulmonary fibrosis seen in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 51 sarcoidosis 52 irradiation-induced pneumonitis 47 or fibrosis that develops as a side effect of chemotherapy in cancer patients 53 however there are not enough published clinical studies to make any firm conclusion whether these inhibitors indeed show beneficial effects a recent cohort study of ards showed the significant association between ace insertiondeletion d polymorphism and the susceptibility and outcome of ards 54 the d allele of the human ace gene confers increased ace activity in plasma and the dd genotype frequency was increased in the patients with ards compared with the control groups 54 moreover the dd allele was significantly associated with mortality in the ards group thus based on inhibitor experiments in rodents and ace allelic correlation studies in humans it has been suggested that the ras could have a role in acute lung failure and pulmonary fibrosisour group investigated the role of ace2 in ards by using ace2 knockout mice in three different ards models acid-aspiration-induced ards endotoxin-induced ards and peritoneal sepsis-induced ards ace2 knockout mice show very severe disease compared with wild-type mice 25 loss of ace2 expression in mutant mice resulted in enhanced vascular permeability increased lung edema neutrophil accumulation and worsened lung function importantly treatment with catalytically active recombinant ace2 protein improved the symptoms of acute lung injury in wild-type mice as well as in ace2 knockout mice 25 thus ace2 plays a protective role in acute lung injury mechanistically the negative regulation of ang ii levels by ace2 accounts in part for the protective function of ace2 in ards for example at1 inhibitor treatment or additional ace gene deficiency on an ace2 knockout background rescues the severe phenotype of ace2 single-mutant mice in acute lung injury 25 in addition ace knockout mice and at1a receptor knockout mice showed improved symptoms of acute lung injury 25 therefore in acute lung injury ace ang ii and at1 receptor function as lung-injury-promoting factors while ace2 protects from lung injury 25 however similar to the heart we also have evidence that ace2-regulated but ang ii-independent pathways 8 55 might play a critical role in controlling ards following acute lung injury fig 2

within months of publication of the sars-cov genome 56 57 ace2 was identified as a potential receptor using in vitro cell line studies 11 ace2 has been demonstrated to bind sars-cov spike and to support syncytia formation the fusion of spike-protein-expressing cells into large multinucleated cells that can also be seen in real sars infections 11 after the identification of ace2 as a sars receptor in vitro liver-specific icam3-grabbing nonintegrin l-sign also known as cd209l was reported as a second receptor for sars-cov infection 58 fig 2 certainly both receptors seem functional for in vitro viral entry but it was unclear whether those receptors are required for in vivo sars infectionsusing a sars infection model in ace2 knockout mice our group was able to show that ace2 is indeed essential for sars infections in vivo 13 when ace2 knockout mice are infected with sars-cov they were resistant to virus infection 13 no lung histology from ace2 knockout mice challenged with sars-cov showed signs of inflammation 13 whereas some but not all sars-infected wild-type mice displayed mild inflammation with leukocyte infiltration 13 59 60 thus ace2 is an essential receptor for sars infections in vivo moreover the importance of l-sign in sars infection has been recently highlighted by the genetic analyses of a polymorphism that determines different numbers 39 of tandem repeat domains in exon 4 of the human l-sign protein 61 individuals homozygous for these tandem repeats ie the same number of tandem repeats in both alleles are less susceptible to sars infections than ones heterozygous for the repeats ie the different number of tandem repeats in each allele 62 it would be interesting to further investigate the functional importance of l-sign in vivo sars infections using model systems such as l-sign transgenic mice and to genetically compare the role of l-sign to that of ace2 in ace2-gene-deficient miceone mystery of sars-cov is why in contrast to the other coronaviruses infecting humans infections with the sars-cov trigger severe lung disease with such high mortality accumulating evidence further indicates that severe sars infections are dependent on the burden of viral replication as well as on the immunopathologic consequences of the host response in sars pathogenesis see reviews 63 64 moreover our own studies have implicated the involvement of the ras in sars pathogenesis first ace2 is a critical sars receptor in vivo and second ace2 and other components of the ras play a central role in controlling the severity of acute lung failure once the disease process has started 13 intriguingly before the identification of ace2 as a sars receptor it has been reported that some sars patients develop impaired heart contractility using echocardiograhic measurements 65 certainly the observed decrease in left ventricular performance during the acute infection phase may be related to a systemic inflammatory condition 66 which is not unique to sars nevertheless it is interesting to contemplate a possible link of the impaired heart function of sars patients and the reduced heart contractility in ace2 mutant mice in line with this idea wild-type mice infected with sars-cov showed markedly down-regulated ace2 expression in lungs 13 as well as in hearts unpublished moreover treatment with recombinant sars-spike protein without any other virus components down-regulates ace2 expression in vitro and in vivo 13 thus spike-treated wild-type mice resemble ace2 knockout mice and similar to ace2 mutant mice spike-treated wild-type mice show enhanced ras signaling leading to markedly more severe pathology in acute lung injury therefore the down-regulation of ace2 expression by spike in sars-cov infections might be a possible explanation for sars pathogenesis especially in disease progression to ards although the enhanced ras signaling is unique in sars-cov infection the down-regulation of virus receptor by interaction with virus ligand is also seen in other viruses for instance cd4 a receptor for hiv internalizes with hiv gp120 resulting in the disruption of immune cell functions 67 and cd46 a measles receptor is down-regulated by measles hemagglutinin leading to the impairment of complement pathways and immune systems 68 on the other hand any consequences of the down-regulation of sialo-glycoconjugate receptor by influenza a virus 69 are yet unknown the finding of enhanced ras signaling and severe acute lung injury as consequences of ace2 down-regulation by sars-cov might possibly implicate that other emerging infectious lung diseases like h5n1 avian flu may also utilize the receptor down-regulation system to impair host immuneinflammatory systems and induce severe lung diseases thus it is interesting to investigate the consequences of down-regulation of other virus receptors upon virus infectionace2 has now been identified as a key factor for protection from ardsacute lung injury and ace2 functions as a critical sars receptor in vivo since sars spike-protein-mediated ace2 down-regulation appears to contribute to the severity of lung failure these findings may explain how the sars-cov has turned into a lethal virus in addition in an acid aspiration ards mouse model strong down-regulation of ace2 protein in the injured lung was observed while ace expression remained unchanged thus recombinant ace2 protein could not only be a treatment to block the spreading of sars but also to protect sars patients from developing lung failure furthermore those findings could apply to investigating the therapeutic efficacy of ace2 in ards that develops in other emerging lung infectious diseases like avian influenza a h5n1 70 or other diseases that affect lung function 71 in addition to recombinant ace2 protein therapy ace2 gene therapy would be another candidate recently lentivirus-mediated gene delivery of ace2 into rat hearts was shown to successfully attenuate ang ii-induced cardiac hypertrophy 72 however especially for the acute phase of ards tissue-specific delivery of exogenous recombinant ace2 protein might be the first line of choice while avoiding systemic adverse effects we look forward to the further elucidation of the pathophysiological role of ace2 and to the use of ace2 as a therapeutic targetangiotensin-i converting enzyme ec number 34151 or ace as it is more commonly known is an extensively glycosylated integral membrane protein hooper et al 1987 hooper and turner 1987 wei et al 1991 ripka et al 1993 which functions as a zinc dependent dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase to remove the c-terminal dipeptide from its peptide substrates in a zinc dependent manner cushman and cheung 1971 das and soffer 1975ace is a key component of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system raas an essential hormone system responsible for the homeostasis of blood pressure in mammals ace processes the precursor peptide angiotensin i to give angiotensin ii which is a potent vasoconstrictor it also destroys the vasodilating properties of a second peptide bradykinin skeggs et al 1954 zaman et al 2002 acharya et al 2003 gonzalez-villalobos et al 2013 ace therefore functions to increase blood pressure and as such has long been targeted in the treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular ailments through the use of ace inhibitors turner and hooper 2002the initial discovery and partial purification of ace occurred in the 1950s yet it was not until 2003 that the first human ace structure of tace was reported natesh et al 2003 one of the main reasons for the 50 years that elapsed between the discovery of ace and the report of the first structure is the extensive glycosylation estimated at 30  of the weight of the enzyme acharya et al 2003 but shown to be essential for expression and function gordon et al 2003 corradi et al 2007 ultimately the structure of tace was determined using a minimally glycosylated truncated construct lacking the transmembrane domain natesh et al 2003the structure of tace is predominantly helical with twenty-seven -helices and only six short -strands which combine to form an ellipsoid shaped molecule fig 2a and b the structure shows six glycosylation sites all located on the surface of the protein key features of the molecule include a large central channel and an n-terminal lid the channel stretches approximately 30  across almost the entirety of the molecule effectively dividing it into two subdomains the channel narrows at the centre where the catalytic zinc ion is found as shown in fig 2c the n-terminal lid is formed by the three n-terminal helices 1 2 and 3 and appears to prevent the enzyme from hydrolysing large folded substrates natesh et al 2003in 2006 the structure of the n-domain of sace was determined providing the first opportunity for the two domains of sace to be compared the overall structure of the n-domain is essentially identical to that of the c-domain a predominantly helical ellipsoid shaped molecule with a long channel that narrows at the centre where the catalytic zinc ion is found in total it comprises 27 helices of which 18 are -helices and only 6 relatively short -strands fig 3a and bcomparing the structures of the n and c-domains provides some insight into the observed differences in substrate specificity the structures of both domains were solved with lisinopril an inhibitor that is slightly selective for the c-domain bound although lisinopril is bound in broadly the same conformation in both structures minor differences mainly concentrated in the s1 binding pocket help to explain the selectivity for example asp140 in the n-domain takes the place of glu162 in the c-domain glu162 forms electrostatic interactions with the lysyl side chain of lisinopril which asp140 is unable to replicate fig 3c corradi et al 2006by studying the structures of the n- and c- domains of sace significant progress has already been made towards the design of domain specific inhibitors rxpa380 was developed from a phosphinic peptide library and is highly selective for the c-domain with a ki three orders of magnitude lower than for the n-domain georgiadis et al 2004 the structure of the c-domain bound to rxpa380 was reported in 2007 corradi et al 2007 and provides an insight into the reasons for the specificity of this inhibitor fig 4in the c-domain phe391 in the s2 subsite makes an aromatic interaction with phe at the p2 position of rxpa380 in the n-domain phe391 is replaced by tyr369 which would not be able to replicate this aromatic interaction furthermore the structure suggests that the hydroxyl group of tyr369 would be within 2  of the p2 phe preventing the inhibitor from binding in the same conformation fig 4dfurther relevant differences are observed in the s2 subsite during the development of rxpa380 it was suggested that pro and trp at the p1 and p2 positions respectively were important determinants of c-domain selectivity the s2 subsite of the c-domain is lined by two valine residues val379 and val380 which create a hydrophobic environment for the pro and trp in the n-domain these valines are replaced by ser357 and thr358 destroying the hydrophobic environment fig 4da second phosphinic peptide rxp407 has been developed which selectively inhibits the n-domain fig 5a and b the structure of the n-domain in complex with rxp407 was reported in 2010 anthony et al 2010 it shows twelve hydrogen bonds from nine residues forming between the enzyme and inhibitor fig 5c all but two of these would be conserved in the c-domain interestingly the two residues that differ arg381glu403 and tyr369phe391 are located in the s2 subsite fig 5d further illustrating that interactions between the enzyme and inhibitors at this site are an important determinant of domain selectivitystructural studies of inhibitor binding to ace have been able to provide essential information relating to the subtle differences in the substrate binding pockets of the two domains this will be able to be exploited in the design of new domain specific ace inhibitors these may include not only c-domain specific inhibitors for use in the treatment of hypertension but also n-domain specific inhibitors targeting the roles of ace in other physiological processesin addition to the increasing understanding that mammalian ace is involved in a range of processes outside of blood pressure regulation in recent years a number of other homologues of ace have been identified which further emphasise the diverse range of functions of these enzymesin the year 2000 a study aiming to find novel genes involved in heart failure identified a cdna coding for a human homologue of ace tipnis et al 2000 this was the first evidence of an ace homologue in humans and the protein was appropriately named ace2 angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ec number 341723 like ace ace2 is a type i integral membrane protein it has a single catalytic domain that includes a zinc binding site ace2 and each domain of sace share 33  sequence identity so it appears that the two enzymes have arisen following a gene duplication event which then allowed considerable divergence in ace2 sequence krege et al 1995in contrast to the widespread expression of sace ace2 expression appears to be confined to the heart kidneys and testis furthermore ace and ace2 have quite distinct biochemical properties there is no evidence of ace2 having dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase activity as is routinely found in ace instead it removes a single residue from the c-terminus of its peptide substrates which include neurotensin and kinetensin bradykinin is not a substrate for ace2 although it is able to cleave angiotensin i but removes only a single c-terminal residue to give the nonapeptide ang1-9 ace2 is not inhibited by the ace inhibitors captopril lisinopril and enalaprilat tipnis et al 2000 donoghue et al 2000 crackower et al 2002the structure of ace2 reported in 2004 provides explanations both for the function of ace2 as a zinc dependent carboxypeptidase and for many of the observed differences between ace and ace2 towler et al 2004 the extracellular portion of ace2 was shown to consist of two distinct domains the first residues 19611 is a zinc metallopeptidase sharing 42  sequence identity with the catalytic domains of ace the second residues 612740 is 48  identical to human collectrin poor electron density was observed for the collectrin-like domain towler et al 2004the first ace-like domain is like ace predominantly helical it consists of two subdomains i and ii forming the sides of a cleft stretching 40  along and 15  across the molecule with a depth of 25  at the base of this cleft is the catalytic site it is located approximately halfway along the length of the molecule towards one side as illustrated in fig 6a the location of the active site is marked by the presence of the catalytic zinc ion as in ace and characteristic of zinc dependent proteases the catalytic zinc ion is co-ordinated by two histidines and a glutamic acid his374 his378 and glu402 in the absence of the inhibitor a water molecule completes the co-ordination of the zinc ionthe location of the catalytic site means that is shielded in the cleft that separates the two subdomains fig 6a a similar effect is achieved in ace with the catalytic site being located at the centre of the long substrate binding channel capped by the n-terminal lid like ace ace2 is extensively glycosylated with electron density observed at six n-linked glycosylation sites there are three disulphide bonds in the ace2 structure all of which are conserved in acean interesting feature of ace2 which has not been seen in ace is a large conformational change on inhibitor binding the two subdomains move relative to each other to close in around the inhibitor in the active site illustrated in fig 6differences in the subsites of ace2 compared to ace help to explain the observed differences in substrate specificity and catalytic properties in ace2 the s1 subsite is defined by four residues with large bulky side chains tyr510 arg514 phe504 and thr347 likely to restrict the size of residues that can be accommodated at the p1 position of substrates bradykinin and angiotensin both substrates of ace but not ace2 have phenylalanine and tyrosine respectively at the p1 position the side chains of which are unlikely to be accommodated by the restricted s1 subsite fig 6eanother significant difference between the two enzymes is observed in the s2 subsite where a glutamine residue in ace is replaced in ace2 by arg273 the large arginine side chain effectively blocks the s2 subsite prohibiting ace2 from acting as a dipeptidyl peptidase as ace does fig 6e this also explains why ace2 is not inhibited by classical ace inhibitors captopril lisinopril and enalaprilat which make contacts with the s2 subsite crackower et al 2002ace2 is an exceedingly important enzyme to study it has been shown to have an important role in heart failure crackower et al 2002 luft 2012 kuba et al 2013 santos et al 2013 and it has also been identified as a receptor for the coronavirus which was linked to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars li et al 2003 the structural details of this recognition have been characterised and were reported in 2009 wu et al 2009 it is also important to study ace2 to improve our understanding of ace homologues the diverged properties of ace2 highlight the range of processes that ace homologues may be involved in and the potential benefits that may come from studying them furtherone of the first insect ace homologues to be studied in detail was ance from drosophila melanogaster first identified in 1995 ance shares 45  sequence identity with human tace and as such has been used successfully as a model for studying the structural basis of inhibitor binding to human ace cornell et al 1995 tatei et al 1995although ance is able to hydrolyse angiotensin i and bradykinin two of the major substrates of mammalian ace no insect homologues of these peptides have been identified a lot of research has been performed to try and elucidate the physiological function of ance and thus insect ace homologues in the wider senseance mutant embryos develop normally but die during the early larval stages this indicates that ance has an essential role in a physiological process critical for survival isaac et al 2007 high levels of ance expression are observed in the gut epithelium and amniosera suggesting that ance may be involved in processing peptides required for contraction of the heart and gut muscle cornell et al 1995 tatei et al 1995ance expression is also concentrated around the reproductive organs of both male and female flies suggesting a role in reproduction further evidence for this was obtained in a 1999 study using insects with hypomorphic ance alleles male flies homozygous for the hypomorphic ance alleles were infertile as a result of sperm failing to develop properly suggesting that ance may be required for processing a peptide involved in spermatogenesis isaac et al 1998 1999 schoofs et al 1998further investigation in 2007 showed that ance expression is concentrated in the secondary cells of the accessory glands of the testis the accessory glands produce a number of peptides that mix with the sperm and the seminal fluid and induce physiological and behavioural changes in the female insect after mating it is reasonable to suggest then that ance is not only involved in spermatogenesis in the male but may also have a role in the female after mating isaac et al 2007with this in mind dup99b was suggested as a potential ance substrate dup99b can induce egg laying in females but in order to be functional the basic c-terminal dipeptide must be removed from the propeptide in theory this would make dup99b a good substrate for ance as yet it has not been possible to investigate this hypothesis further as ance is already expressed by the female reproductive organs rylett et al 2007 in order to understand any effect of ance on the female after mating tissue specific ance knockdowns in female flies would need to be performedance is not the only insect ace homologue which has been implicated in reproduction and it seems increasingly likely that this is a conserved function of these enzymes wijffels et al 1996 hurst et al 2003 ekbote et al 2003a ekbote et al 2003b macours and hens 2004 vercruysse et al 2004 for example ace has been shown to be necessary for egg laying by female anopheles stephensi mosquitoes where it has been suggested that it may be required to process a myotropic peptide needed for contractions of the oviduct ekbote et al 1999based on the evidence obtained so far it is clear that ance and acer have distinct physiological roles it is therefore not surprising that they have different substrate and inhibitor specificities for example unlike ance and mammalian ace acer is unable to cleave angiotensin i and also has a much lower affinity for bradykinin on the basis of these differences one would predict that there must be some variations between the active sites of these two enzymes taylor et al 1996 coates et al 2000 bingham et al 2006the structure of ance was first published in 2003 at 24  resolution kim et al 2003 this was followed in 2010 by higher resolution 20  structures in a different crystal form of the native enzyme and a number of enzyme inhibitor complexes akif et al 2010 2012 the overall architecture of ance is conserved from human ace and the molecule is also heavily glycosylated with three n-linked glycans visible in the structure at asn53 asn196 and asn311 no structure has yet been determined for acer however in 2005 bingham and co-workers proposed a model for the three dimensional structure of acer based on the ance structure reported by kim et al in 2003 kim et al 2003 bingham et al 2006 by comparing this model with the ance structure some explanations have been offered as to the observed differences in substrate specificity of these two homologous enzymesin ance the negatively charged side chains of asp360 and glu150 are likely to form electrostatic interactions with the c-terminal arginine of bradykinin based on the acer model asp360 is replaced by his368 which would be unable to replicate this interaction explaining the decreased affinity for and rate of hydrolysis of bradykinin by acer compared to anceance and acer also behave differently towards the c-domain selective inhibitor rxpa380 acer is inhibited by rxpa380 with a ki of 48 m whereas no inhibition is observed for ance the c-domain selectivity of rxpa380 has been partially attributed to two valine residues in the s2 pocket one of these is conserved in acer but replaced by a threonine in ance this mutation would decrease the hydrophobicity of this pocket which accommodates the tryptophan moiety of rxpa380 hence decreasing the affinity of the inhibitor for ance compared to acer and the c-domain kim et al 2003 bingham et al 2006these are just some of the potentially interesting features of the acer active site proposed based on the modelled structure bingham et al 2006 such small differences can have significant implications on substrate and inhibitor specificity whilst there remains a great deal more to be learnt about the in vivo functions of acer and indeed ance it is clear that like mammalian ace both of these enzymes are involved in a number of important physiological processes it follows then that studying these enzymes particularly from a structural perspective can only increase our understanding of the diverse range of functions of ace homologuesof the nine anoace genes six anoace2 3a 3b 4 5 6 and 7 are clustered together on the same chromosome and are likely to have arisen from relatively recent gene duplication events indeed anoace5 and 6 are predicted to share 97  sequence identity whilst anoace3a and 3b are coded for by the same gene and are identical save for the first exon burnham et al 2005anoace2-6 share many common features with each other and d melanogaster ance and acer all six of these anoace proteins were successfully modelled based on the structure of ance pdb code 2x8y akif et al 2010 using the automated mode of swiss-model arnold et al 2006 kiefer et al 2009 as would be predicted given the high sequence identity the crucial active site residues from ance were conserved in all of the models there were though differences in the subsites indicating probable differences in substrate preference these differences are summarised in table 1the s2 subsite has been identified as a crucial region conferring inhibitor and substrate binding specificity on the n- and c-domains of human sace hubert et al 1991 gordon et al 2003 dive et al 2004 corradi et al 2006 2007 krger et al 2009 anthony et al 2010 for example the substitution of tyr369 in the n-domain for phe391 in the c-domain is crucial for the c-domain selectivity of rxpa380 with phe391 forming an aromatic interaction with the phenyl moiety at the p2 position of rxpa380 that tyr369 is unable to replicate gordon et al 2003 corradi et al 2007 both the anoace5 and 6 models have a phenylalanine at the position of c-domain phe391 suggesting that they could form an interaction with an aromatic group at p2 anoace5 and 6 also have a conserved negative charge at the position of glu403 of the c-domain which is replaced by arg381 in the n-domain fig 7a these two observations suggest that anoace5 and 6 and the c-domain of sace may accommodate substrates with similar functionalities at the p2 positionin contrast the anoace2-4 models have a tyrosine at the position of n-domain tyr369 indicating that they would not tolerate an aromatic group at p2 and may instead have a preference for a group to which they could form a hydrogen bond unlike the n-domain anoace2-4 do not have a large positive side chain at the position of arg381 like the c-domain anoace2 3a and 3b have a glutamate whilst anoace4 has a serine fig 7b the models therefore suggest that anoace2-4 share some features of both the n- and c-domains of human sace at the s2 subsite and this may well be reflected in their substrate and inhibitor binding propertiesbased on the models of anoace2-6 there appear to be some potentially significant differences in the s1 subsite compared to the two domains of sace for example the n- and c-domain have a conserved phenylalanine reside phe490 and phe512 respectively which is replaced by tyrosine in anoace2-6 fig 7c this could have potentially significant consequences on inhibitor and substrate interaction as the stacking interaction between the phenyl moiety at p1 of both rxpa380 and rxp407 would not be maintained interestingly a tyrosine is conserved at this position in d melanogaster ancethere are also interesting substitutions at the position equivalent to the c-domain glu143 the negative charge here is retained in ance and the anoace2 model in the n-domain and anoace3a 3b 5 and 6 it is lost and replaced by serine n-domain or glutamine most significantly though in anoace4 lys133 occupies this position fig 7c the large positive lysine side chain is likely to have a significant effect on the type of groups that anoace4 can accommodate in the s1 subsitethe anoace2-6 models also all have a conserved positive charge either lysine or arginine in the s1 subsite which although conserved as lys62 in ance is replaced by gln54 and leu81 in the n- and c-domains respectively fig 7c the introduction of these large positive side chains into what is in both domains of sace quite a large pocket of space is likely to influence the size and charge of functionalities that can be accommodated by anoace2-6 in the s1 subsitebased on our models anoace5 and 6 have an additional negative charge in their s1 subsites compared to ance the two domains of sace and anoace2-4 both have glu54 which takes the place of a small non-polar side chain in the other subsites fig 7c overall the models suggest that the s1 subsites of anoace2-6 are quite polar environments compared to sace the models presented here are not sufficient to determine the effect that this may have on binding properties further work will be needed to investigate thisthere is comparatively little variation in the s1 and s2 subsites of the anoace2-6 models compared to in the other subsites a potentially significant difference is at the position of c-domain val380 this residue has been implicated in the selectivity of rxpa380 for the c-domain it contributes to a hydrophobic environment for the tryptophan moiety of the inhibitor that is lost in the n-domain as val380 is replaced by thr358 interestingly the valine at this position is conserved only in anoace2 and is replaced by a threonine in anoace3-6 this small difference which has such a significant effect in determining the domain selectivity of rxpa380 highlights how subtle variations in the subsites of these enzymes can have significant effects on their biochemical propertiesanoace2-7 are clustered together on the same chromosome and thought to have arisen from a relatively recent gene duplication event anoace1 is predicted to be considerably different to the other anoace homologues belonging to a different functional grouping and is likely to have acquired highly diverged functions burnham et al 2005 akif et al 2012 it is perhaps not surprising then that anoace1 was much more challenging to model and so an experimentally determined crystal structure will surely be needed to study the mechanism of action of this enzyme in more detail it seems that this enzyme will make an exceedingly interesting case study and could reveal more unknown roles of ace homologues aiding our understanding of this increasingly complex enzymethe discovery of the anoace9 gene which appears to code for a protein with two homologous catalytic domains arranged in tandem provided the first evidence of a two domain ace homologue in insects this now means that this domain arrangement also seen in sace has been selected for on three separate occasions burnham et al 2005 this organisation must surely then be in some way advantageous studies of human sace have resulted in the suggestion that there may be some negative co-operativity between the two domains georgiadis et al 2003 binevski et al 2003 andjar-snchez et al 2004 burnham et al 2005 corradi et al 2006 however more evidence is required before a conclusion can be reached studying the structure and function of anoace9 could potentially yield a lot of information about the benefits of this organisationangiotensin converting enzyme has been known of and studied for half a century however it is only in the last decade that we have truly begun to understand the diverse range of physiological functions of this enzyme and its homologues we now appreciate that ace and its homologues have extensive functions outside of blood pressure regulationstructural studies have greatly improved our understanding of the different biochemical properties of ace homologues the elucidation of the human tace structure in 2003 was a huge breakthrough in the study of ace and was followed by the report of the n-domain structure in 2006 the structure of the d melanogaster homologue ance is also frequently used as a model of human acethe discovery and subsequent study of ace homologues from other organisms most significantly d melanogaster has highlighted the diverse range of functions of this enzyme ace homologues are conserved in insects where amongst other proposed roles there is substantial evidence for them having an essential role in reproductionstudying insect ace homologues has already greatly improved our understanding of the mammalian enzyme but these enzymes are also important to study in their own right nowhere is this more evident than in the a gambiae ace homologues the a gambiae genome codes for more ace homologues than has been seen in any other insect genome thus far and includes a two-domain enzyme comparable to saceinitial genomic studies have indicated that these enzymes may be involved in metabolism the immune response and reproduction however much more evidence is required to confirm this this could potentially be achieved by treating the mosquitoes with ace inhibitors and observing the effect that this has a similar approach has previously been taking with a stephensi which indicated that ace homologues were involved in reproduction ekbote et al 1999 however this is unlikely to distinguish between the functions of the different anoace homologues hence a better approach may be to use rnai to selectively knockdown the individual genes liao et al recently used this approach successfully in their work on acer liao et al 2014as we have discussed d melanogaster ance has been successfully used as a model for inhibitor binding to human ace it is not unreasonable to consider that it may be possible to use anoace9 in a similar way as a model for human sace in order to learn more about the rationale for the presence of two homologous domains arranged in tandemhere we have modelled the active sites of the a gambiae ace homologues based on the structure of d melanogaster ance and compared them to the human and d melanogaster enzymes whilst this is of course no substitute for experimentally determined crystal structures it has indicated some key differences that could potentially be exploited in the design of insect specific ace inhibitors perhaps targeting their role in reproduction in the longer term such inhibitors could be designed for use in insecticides which would be particularly useful when considering a gambiae as a vector for the transmission of the malaria causing parasite p falciparumthe novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  sars-cov-2 disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic has been associated with severe respiratory disease incidence and increased mortality 1 angiotensin converting enzyme ace 2 is a homologue of ace but also a receptor for the coronaviruses 2 ace2 is highly expressed in the lungs heart gastrointestinal gi tract and kidney thus affecting the cardiovascular system cv and the immune system 3 the overexpression of ace2 was reported to enhance viral entry and replication intracellularly 4 covid-19 also called sars-cov-2 may also use ace2 as a receptor to initiate infection leading to severe complications from the heart acute coronary syndrome acs and fulminant myocarditis lungs pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and gi tract diarrhoea syndrome 5ace2 gene expression is affected by several factors including gender ace2 gene is x-linked ace2 gene polymorphisms comorbidities increased in the presence of cvd hypertension diabetes and drug therapy 6 with regard to drugs angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists mra have been reported to raise ace2 activity in human and animal studies 7 there are only a few animal studies available showing that statins may also increase ace2 activity 8 9 in the era of the covid-19 pandemic such a drug effect may be considered as potentially worrying 10 in this context it was recently even suggested that arbs could be replaced with ace inhibitors and that statin treatment may be discontinued during the pandemic particularly in primary prevention settings 11however before implementing such strategies we should consider several issues firstly as the covid-19 infection progresses ace2 is downregulated thus potentially generating an inflammatory response leading to impaired cardiac contractility and acute lung injury 5 7 12 therefore reduced ace2 expression is linked to worse outcomes on the other hand ace2 overexpression has been associated with several beneficial effects ie prevention of adverse cardiac remodelling and fibrosis improvement of vascular endothelial dysfunction reduction of blood pressure and protection from ards 7 12 both statins and arbs were reported to exert these benefitssecondly a combination of statinsarbs were used during the 2014 ebola virus disease epidemic in sierra leone leading to improved outcomes and increased survival 13 these drugs can affect the host response to infection not the virus especially by preventing endothelial dysfunction a shared feature of several virus infections 14 their combination seemed to promote a return to homeostasis allowing patients with ebola virus infection to recover on their own 15third patients with cardiovascular disease cvd were shown to be more prone to covid-19 infection and with worse prognosis 16 17 elevated inflammatory markers such as c-reactive protein crp and interleukin-6 il-6 have been recognised as predictors of covid-19 infection severity and mortality suggesting a virus-activated cytokine storm syndrome 18 19 therefore as well as immunomodulation covid-19 treatment should also target reduction of inflammation in this context statins have been consistently reported to exert immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties 2030 also it was previously suggested that statins could enhance host defence and suppress inflammation thus representing a practical and inexpensive adjunctive or alternative host-directed treatment for infections by viruses fungi protozoa and bacteria 31 similarly there are data supporting an anti-inflammatory role for arbs 3234fourth statins may also prevent a viral-induced acute coronary syndrome also in covid-19 positive patients by stabilising atherosclerotic plaques 35 as well as prevent acute kidney injury aki 36 both acute cardiac injury and aki are predictors of covid-19-induced mortality 37 statin therapy may prevent these complications and thus increase survival of note statins can protect against contrast-induced aki ci-aki 3841 this is of clinical importance especially in hospitalised patients who undergo diagnostic or therapeutic procedures involving the administration of contrast media eg computed tomography of the lungsfifth effective lipid-lowering therapy llt and significant cholesterol reduction might significantly suppress coronavirus infection it was show that for infectious bronchitis virus ibv coronavirus drug-related cholesterol reduction disrupts lipid rafts an important element for the cellular entry of coronavirus that enable the binding of the coronavirus with the host cells and consequently further infection 42 it was also observed in the studies with porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov that cholesterol present in the cell membrane and viral envelope coronaviruses are positive-sense enveloped rna viruses contributes to pdcov replication by acting as a key component in viral entry thus the pharmacological sequestration of cellular or viral cholesterol with effective llt significantly blocked both virus attachment and internalisation 43 all these mechanisms might suggest a critical role of statins and llts in the inhibition of coronavirus infectionin covid-19-positive patients the majority of baseline cvd is of atherosclerosis origin with the worst prognosis for patients being at the high and especially very high and extremely high risk of cvd 16 thus intensive llt with statins andor fixed combination with ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisinkexin type 9 pcsk9 inhibitors seems to be critical indeed we should do our best to maximally improve therapy adherence and thus have a better prognosis for the infected cvd patients 44 45 in this context there are no premises that pcsk9 inhibitors because they are monoclonal antibodies in relation to the above-mentioned high cytokine storm during infection should be discontinued in contrast pcsk9 inhibitors should be continued to achieve further low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl-c lowering based on the lower the better principle because then we might significantly stabilise atheroma plaque reduce the risk of cvd events and reduce inflammation 4648 recent available data have confirmed the role of pcsk9 inhibition in reducing the process of inflammation via decreasing main vascular inflammatory markers reducing infiltration of monocytes into the subendothelial layer and inhibiting monocyte migration apart from the reduction of pro-inflammatory mediators pcsk9 inhibitors could ameliorate vascular inflammation 47 finally a direct local anti-inflammatory action of pcsk9 inhibitors independent of ldl-c reduction has been shown in animal models however it still merits further investigation 47 48it is of special interest now due to the fact that coronavirus might also use different receptors to enter the host cell that treatment with pcsk9 inhibitors has beneficial effects on ldl-c lowering via inhibition of ldl-receptors ldl-r this might exert an antiviral effect among others on hepatitis c viral hcv infection through down-regulation of the surface expression of ldl-r and cluster of differentiation cd 81 on hepatic cells and a positive association with increased inflammatory responses as well as with septic shock 48 in a recent paper we confirmed that there is no association between pcsk9 levels and resistance to antibiotics or the condition of patients hospitalised in intensive care units a finding of clinical importance in the covid-19 infection era 49sixth there are conflicting results regarding the possible effects of statins on ards development and outcomes 50 51 it was suggested that statins act beneficially in hyper-inflammatory ards patients defined by increased biomarkers of inflammation coagulation and endothelial activation 52 but not in hypo-inflammatory patients 53 54 a potential benefit of arbs on survival in ards patients has also been reported 55 56 nevertheless there is a paucity of data on this field and thus further research is needed to elucidate the association between statin therapy arbs and acute lung injuryof note drug-drug interactions should also be considered in this context simvastatin and lovastatin are contraindicated in patients on lopinavirritonavir therapy due to an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis 57 atorvastatin rosuvastatin and other statins can be used at the lowest possible dose based on the instructions included in the summary of product characteristics spc 58 taking this into account we should be careful while treating covid-19 disease patients with statins being on antiviral drugs and some antibiotics including macrolides because they might increase the risk of statin-associated muscle symptoms sams 59 60 therefore their careful monitoring is highly recommended to avoid unnecessary drug-related side effects and at the same time optimising llt therapy to achieve the individuals ldl-c goal in this context in patients at very high cvd risk requiring intensive llt it is reasonable to initiate therapy with polypillsfixed combinations of statins at lower doses and ezetimibe with or without pcsk9 inhibitors as available aimed at reducing the risk of sams 59 60a position statement of the european society esc council on 13 march 2020 as well as of other national and international societies highlights the lack of evidence on harmful effects of ace inhibitors and arbs on the incidence and progression of covid-19 infection and strongly supports the continuation of usual antihypertensive therapy 6 61 regarding statins their beneficial effects on inflammation vascular heart and lung function strongly support the continuation of their use due to their significant effect on cvd prevention pcsk9 inhibitors should also be continued as available physicians should wait for strong evidence and recommendations from international scientific societies before altering their patients drug therapy in the covid-19 eraa key role for ace2 is emerging in the conversion of the octapeptide ang ii to its metabolite angiotensin-17 ang17 for example a compensatory increase in ang17 levels in failing human heart ventricles has been correlated with upregulation of ace2 5 and cardiac myocyte ang17 levels are increased in ischaemic cardiomyopathy 6 the physiological role of ang17 has been controversial but it generally appears to oppose the pressor proliferative and pro-fibrotic actions of ang ii 7 and acts through its own g-protein-coupled receptor this would suggest that ace and ace2 might act as counterbalances in the reninangiotensin system ras figure 1 the successful production of ace2 null ace2 mice supports this hypothesis 8 ace2 knockout mice show major cardiac contractility defects and increased levels of ang ii 8 and overall studies in these mice suggest that ace2 is a key regulator of cardiac function although the mechanism by which this is mediated is unclear however double knockouts in which both ace and ace2 genes have been deleted do not show the cardiac defects of the ace2 knockout alone 8 emphasizing the yinyang nature of ace and ace2 expression when ace2 is transgenically overexpressed in mouse heart cardiac defects are again observed most notably a lethal ventricular arrhythmia which is associated with disruption of gap junction formation 9 the high incidence of sudden death in these mice correlated with the levels of ace2 transgene expression surviving older mice showed a spontaneous downregulation of the transgene and restoration of normal cardiac function there are also indirect associations of ace2 expression with hypertension in particular crackower et al
8 noted that in the rat the ace2 gene maps to a defined quantitative trait locus associated with hypertension and additionally two single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ace2 gene locus have been associated with human cardiovascular disease 10 another disease model in which ace2 expression has recently been studied is diabetes in streptozotocin-induced diabetes in the rat expression of renal tubule ace2 mrna and protein was substantially reduced whereas an increase in ace2 protein expression was seen in the diabetic glomeruli 11 the significance of these changes and the underlying mechanisms involved remain to be elucidated clearly searches for possible correlations of ace2 mrna and protein over- or under-expression with human cardiovascular and renal disease are warranted to determine whether these correlations mirror the effects observed in rodent models several potent and relatively selective inhibitors of ace2 have been described 12 13 and the modelling of the active site of ace2 14 based on the recently reported structure of human ace 15 will facilitate the development of new classes of specific inhibitors the active site model also provides an explanation for the differences in substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity between ace and ace2 14during several months of 2003 the virus that caused the newly identified illness severe acute respiratory syndrome sars spread rapidly from china throughout asia to canada and beyond causing almost 800 deaths and disrupting travel economics and even scientific conventions the death rate following infection approached almost 10 almost as mysteriously as it appeared perhaps as a result of public health measures the disease faded away only to re-emerge in china this year the speed with which the infection spread and the severity of the symptoms led to a massive effort to identify the agent responsible within months it had been identified as a positive strand rna virus classified as a member of the coronavirus family sars-cov its genome was sequenced 16 17 and the search was underway to identify the cellular receptor for the virus as with other coronaviruses it is the n-terminal portion s1 domain of the viral spike s glycoprotein that mediates the initial high-affinity binding to a receptor on the surface of susceptible cells the spike sits in the viral envelope and projects outwards to give a corona-like appearance to the virus hence its name the replication strategy of the virus is summarized in figure 2
 and figure 3
depicts the coronavirus-infected cellmichael farzan and colleagues 18 demonstrated that the s1 domain of the sars-cov s protein bound to the african green monkey kidney cell line vero e6 which is permissive for viral replication they were then able to co-immunoprecipitate the protein responsible for viral binding and entry this sars-cov receptor a glycoprotein of mr 110 000 was identified by mass spectrometry as ace2 its identity was confirmed by showing that when ace2 was overexpressed in human cells non-permissive for viral infection sars-cov entry and replication were facilitated this process was blocked by an ace2 antibody 18 the tissue distribution of ace2 also appears to show some correlation with the sites of sars-cov infection and disease pathology independently xiao et al
19 confirmed that ace2 was a sars-cov receptor and showed that the receptor-binding domain was probably located between residues 272 and 537 of the spike glycoprotein farzans group 20 has now established the recognition region within a 193 amino acid sequence residues 318510 and smaller fragments were unable to bind ace2 a crucial aspartic acid in this region was essential for binding with ace2 modelling of the ace2 structure based on the known structure of ace has provided another approach to predicting potential binding contacts between ace2 and the sars-cov s protein 21 but ultimately experimental studies are essential to identify the nature of the interactions between these two proteins the recent solution of the structure of ace2 22 which supports much of the earlier modelling of the active site of the enzyme 14 should facilitate studies of ace2 and s protein interactions two unexpected features of ace2 inhibitor binding arise from the structural studies 22 first inhibitor binding induced a large conformational change in the enzyme that aligns crucial residues for catalysis second the inhibitor binds to the enzyme in an inverse orientation from that predicted from the binding of the acei lisinopril to the active site of ace 22another zinc peptidase aminopeptidase n apn acts as the receptor for several other coronaviruses 23 again with this receptor its distribution can be correlated with sites of infection however apart from the zinc-binding region apn and ace2 bear no discernible sequence homology and show a different membrane topology several features probably facilitate the usurping of plasma membrane peptidases as viral receptors they exist as ectoenzymes in which the bulk of the protein including the catalytic domain faces the extracellular space and they are heavily glycosylated they are also abundantly expressed on certain cell types for example apn constitutes 5 of the membrane protein of the kidney brush border the catalytic domain itself is not responsible for coronaviral interaction in either ace2 or apn because mutations of key active site residues do not affect viral infection this probably reflects the fact that the catalytic site of ace2 is buried deep in a narrow cleft within the protein and is accessible only to the oligopeptide substrates of the enzymein a relatively short space of time ace2 has gained prominence in several disease states and not just those of cardiovascular origin as originally predicted from its close similarity to ace other physiological correlations for ace2 are also appearing recently for example ace2 immunoreactivity in the kidney has been shown to double during pregnancy in rats leading to the suggestion that ace2 might contribute to the localized overproduction of ang17 in the kidney observed in pregnancy which might protect against rises in blood pressure 24 it is therefore conceivable that deficient expression of ace2 might underlie pathological conditions of pregnancy such as pre-eclampsiaperhaps too much attention to date has focused on the ability of ace2 to produce ang17 from ang ii future analysis of the physiological roles of ace2 needs to bear in mind that it can metabolize a range of biologically active peptides other than angiotensin-related peptides 14 25 for example it can hydrolyse des-arg9-bradykinin which is the endogenous ligand of the bradykinin b1 receptor in this context the availability of potent and selective inhibitors of ace2 12 13 will provide valuable pharmacological tools for exploring the physiology and pathology of the enzyme the therapeutic potential of ace2 inhibitors in cardiovascular-related diseases however is questionable given the apparent cardioprotective nature of ace2 activity much further study is needed in this area indeed mechanisms for selectively increasing cardiac or renal ace2 levels might be desirable in some conditions this will require an understanding of the factors that regulate its tissue-specific expressionthe biggest surprise however was the identification of ace2 as a viral receptor 18 and although current data are consistent with ace2 as a sars-cov receptor there might be other receptors or co-receptors for this virus that are yet to be discovered effective therapies against sars are urgently required should further major outbreaks occur from studies on other coronaviruses a vaccination approach might be viable although not without limitations 26 hence soluble ace2 fragments or ace2 antibodies might provide alternative anti-viral therapeutic approaches although the possible side-effects of blocking ace2 are unknown indeed infection by sars-cov might affect ace2 function adversely which could in turn contribute to some of the pathology of the disease given the ability of viruses to usurp cell-surface peptidases and the prevalence of ace in respiratory and other tissues ace itself might have a role as a receptor for an as yet unidentified virusthe recent coronavirus pandemic crisis is due to viral infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 causing uncontrolled inflammatory conditions in the human lung soon after the first transmission emergence of sars-cov from animals to humans in china in 2003 1 a genetically evolved beta-coronavirus genus similar to human viruses was discovered in chinese horseshoe bats rhinolophus sinicus 2 to date pneumonia is epidemiologically caused by diverse viruses for example adenovirus influenza virus middle east respiratory syndrome virus mers-v parainfluenza virus respiratory syncytial virus rsv sars-cov and enteric enveloped cov can cause pneumonia in human hoststhe world health organization who reported the official terminology of the 2019-novel coronavirus 2019-ncov on 13 january 2020 and on february 11th who edited the name of the disease caused by 2019-ncov to coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 in academia the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv provided official nomenclature to the virus as sars-cov-2 due to the similarity between the novel coronavirus and sars-cov 3 sars-cov-2 is spreading and causing a global health-threatening emergency 4 researchers have been in a race to develop anti-viral drugs against sars-cov-2 even before the who declared a worldwide pandemic threatening human lives preventive and therapeutic drugs for patients infected with sars-cov-2 are yet to be discoveredthe covs as enveloped forms can also infect the gastrointestinal track git although most other enteric viruses are naked in morphology 56 covs can also rarely infect neural cells 7 there is unfortunately no solid information on how the coronaviruses infect humans and animals with reciprocal infectivity and cause a zoonotic viral outbreak this is in contrast to influenza viruses which are known to selectively utilize sialic acid sa linkages 8 currently only limited information is available on -covs such as sars-cov and its receptor usage and infectible cell types from different species host cell surface o-acetylated sas are recognized by the lectin-like spike proteins of sars cov-2 for the first step of attachment to host cells infectious virus interaction with the host cell surface is mediated by sialoglycans as the most important phenomenon in eukaryote-parasite co-evolution o-glcnac a minor glycan source is mainly found in the nucleus and cytosol figure 1 apart from the general roles of glycans covs recognize host cells and attach to host cell surface molecules to enter the host cells for example activity of the hemagglutinin-esterase he enzyme relies on the typical carbohydrate-binding lectin and receptor-destroying enzyme rde domains most -covs target 9-o-acetylated sas but certain species have switched to recognizing 4-o-acetyl sa instead 89 crystallographic data for the molecular structure of type ii he provides an explanation for the switching mechanism to acquire 4-o acetyl sa binding this event follows the orthodox ligandreceptor interaction lri lectincarbohydrate interaction lci lectinglycan interaction lgi lectinsphingolipid interaction lsi proteinglycan interaction pgi proteincarbohydrate interaction pci and also proteinprotein interaction ppi recently 332 protein candidates were suggested to be sars-cov-2-human protein interacting proteins through ppis among these 66 human proteins as druggable host factors were further characterized as possible fda-approvable drugs 10 if ppi is involved however carbohydrates or glycans may serve as co-receptors or co-determinants previous reports suggest that carbohydrates act as receptor determinants in most cases the general principles of pci stereochemistry potentiate the saligand switch by way of simple conformational shifts for the lectin and esterase domain this indicates that our examination of natural adaptation should be directed to how carbohydrate-binding proteins measure and observe carbohydrates leading to virus evolution toward transitional host tropismthe 9-carbon sas are mainly animal-specific with anionic sugars attached to terminal sugars sas exist in two forms neugc and neuac neugc is a differentially modified form of the parental sa form neu5ac sas are structurally diverse for example several modified sa forms are known for their structures including neuraminic acid neuc n-acetyl neuraminic acid neuac n-glycolyl neuraminic acid neugc no-diacetyl neuraminic acid occurs in horses no-diacetyl neuraminic acid occurs in bovines and n-acetyl o-diacetyl neuraminic acid occurs in bovines figure 2 sialyltransferases sts biosynthesize different sa linkages sa linkage diversity occurs at the 2-3 2-6 2-8 or 2-9 to the sa or gal residues figure 3 for example in formation of 23 sa or 26 sa structures 23-st and 26-st utilize substrates such as gal-14-glcnac figure 4 the most frequent modification of sas is o-acetylation at positions of c4 c7 c8 and c9 of sa figure 5mammal- and avian-infectible covs consist of the broad-ranged subfamily of coronavirinae the ictv recommended classification is as follows riboviria realmnidovirales order cornidovirineae subordercoronavirida familyorthocoronavirinaecoronavirus genus the four cov genera 11 are the -cov -cov -cov and -cov the 2019-ncov or sars-cov-2 belong to the -cov genus and are zoonotic and cause mammalian infection causing respiratory disease in the human lung the -cov and -cov genus target mammal hosts while the -cov and -cov genus target avians and certain mammals the -cov genus has a b c and d lineages among these lineage b includes sars-cov and sars-cov-2 lineage c includes mers-cov the b lineage sars-cov and c lineage mers-cov which are classified as -covs exhibit lethal rates of 10 and 35 in humans respectivelycovs in humans are associated with respiratory infections such as colds with clinical importance as experienced for the previous outbreak in 2003 of sars-human cov hcov hcov-hku1 and hcov-nl63 1213 human infectious hcov includes seven species including -cov hcov-nl63 and hcov-229e and -cov sars-cov sars-cov-2 hcov-oc43 hcov-hku1 and mers-cov cov rna sequences mutate at a high frequency among the known rna viruses covs bear the longest genome sizes of 26 to 32 kb length rna nucleotide sequences of cov ssrna genomes isolated from covid-19 patients in wuhan show a high homology of 89 with the nucleotide sequence of the previously known bat sars-like cov-zxc-21 strain and 89 with the previous sars-cov the initial wuhan cov isolates belong to the -cov genus and were therefore termed sars-cov-2 or 2019-ncov 14 sars-cov-2 infects human respiratory tracts and causes outbreaks of pneumonia sars-cov-2 is a novel cov and originates from the wuhan district in china the genome sequence of sars-cov-2 exhibits 79 sequence homology with the sars-cov rna sequence and 50 with the mers-cov sequence 15in rna viruses the s glycoprotein pdb 6vsb is the biggest protein heavily glycosylated and its n-terminal domain ntd sequence binds to the host receptor to enter the er of host cells sars-cov-2 s-glycoprotein bears 22 n-glycan sequons in each protomer therefore the trimeric s glycoprotein surface is dominated by 66 n-glycans the s glycoprotein mediates direct and indirect interaction of virus with host cells in the infection cycle all covs exhibit a surface s glycoprotein which bears the receptor-binding domain rbd the s glycoprotein has a distinct spike structure when s glycoprotein binds to its host receptor a host furin-like protease cleaves the s glycoprotein which liberates the spike fusion peptides allowing entry of the virus into the host cell 18 the furin-like protease-generated s1 and s2 exist as a s1s2 complex where s1 in a homotrimeric form interacts with the host cell membrane and s2 penetrates the cytosolic area for sars-cov and mers-cov the s1 c-terminal domains ctds have a dual role in virus entry via attachment and fusion the s1 ntd binds to carbohydrate receptors because the s1 domains act as the rbd the ctd of s1 recognizes protein receptors via rbdsin rna viruses the n protein recognizes the viral rna genome the n protein pdb 6m3m binds to the rna genome via the ntd and ctd the n protein tethers to the viral rna and replicasetranscriptase complex rtc nsp3 pdb 6vxs of cov blocks the innate immune responses of hosts after entrance into the host cells for cov transcription and particle release rna chaperones such as nonspecific nucleic acid binding proteins potentiate ssrna conformation shifts representatively the n protein is known as the rna chaperone protein for example glycogen synthase kinase 3 gsk3 phosphorylates the sars-cov n-protein and thus gsk3 inhibition contributes to reduced replication activity of sars-cov 19 in addition heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein a1 hnrnp a1 regulates the preformed mrna splicing in the nucleus and continuous translation hnrnpa1 interacts with sars-cov n protein to form a replication and transcription complex during ssrna genome biosynthesis 20e protein is the most abundant structural protein needed to assemble virus particles in the cytosol as a tm protein e protein is the smallest structural protein with a mw of 12 kda the e protein has an ntd in the extracellular region and a ctd in the cytosolic region the e protein bears an ectodomain in the ntd and an endodomain in the ctd it has also an ion channel domain e protein is present in the cytosolic region of infected cells and only a limited amount is incorporated into the envelope of virions 21 most e proteins assemble and bud in new virus particlesthe m protein contains three tm domains and is an abundant structural protein with a mw of 30 kda it consists of a small glycosylated ntd in the extracellular region and ctd in the cytoplasmic region the m protein forms a scaffold for virus assembly in the cytosol via binding to s glycoprotein and n protein 22 for example e protein and n protein are co-expressed with m protein to form virus-like particles vlps that are released from the cells as the m and e protein are involved in cov assembly then covs bud into the ergic trafficking by membrane vesicles and transported via the exocytosis-secretory pathway 2324 the dimeric m protein binds to the nucleocapsid-m protein binds to s glycoprotein for s glycoprotein retention in the ergicgolgi complex the m-n protein complex keeps the n proteinrna complex stable for nucleocapsid and the viral assembly-m and e proteins constitute the virus envelope for successful release of virus-like particleshe hemagglutinates and destroys receptors as rna viruses covs bear rdes which are used in effective attachment to hosts and also reversely in detachment from the hosts for example enveloped rna viruses evade the hosts via their rdes currently rde-related functional enzymes such as neuraminidase na and sa-o-acetyl-esterase are known sa-o-acetyl-esterase was originally identified in influenza c virus and in nidoviruses cov and torovirus as well as in salmon anemia virus teleost orthomyxovirus the origin and evolution of cov sa-o-acetylesterases are correlated to other viruses the fusion event of s glycoprotein and he is specific for hcov attachment to sa-associated receptors in the host 25 the he has acetylesterase activity 26 in early sa-related biology influenza ab viruses were found to recognize chicken erythrocytes in 1942 27 they caused hemagglutination through clumping by virus-borne hemagglutinin these phenomena were widely found in influenza viruses paramyxoviruses newcastle disease ndv and mumps virussas have various derivatives of more than 50 chemically different structures formed from the basic n-acetylneuraminic acid neu5ac on the main ring of pyranose and the glycerol side chain sa are modified by acetyl- lactyl- methyl- and sulfo-groups individually or in multiple combinations 28 multiple enzymes are involved in the modifications 29 historically the first discovered sa was crystallized by gunner blix via a hot mild acid extraction of bovine submaxillary mucin in 1936 it consisted of two acetyl groups among these only one acetyl group was attached to nitrogen 30 blix isolated a 9-o-acetyl sa of the common sa n-acetylneuraminic acid neu5ac chemically described as 9-o-acetyl-n-acetylneuraminic acid neu59ac2 neu59ac2 neu5ac and neu5gc are naturally occurring sa species in mammals a common modification is o-acetylation in fact o-acetylation of sas is common in organismsthe o-acetyl modification occurs in single positions of c-4 c-7 c-8 and c-9 of sa as well as in combined c-positions to yield neu45ac2 neu59ac2 and neu579ac3 sas neu5ac9nac is a chemical and biologic mimic of neu59ac2 in the sa-glycans the c-7 andor c-9 o-acetylations are catalyzed by the sa o-acetyltransferase enzyme cas1 domain containing 1 casd1 figure 6 casd1 catalyzes the addition of acetyl groups to the sa c-7 at the late golgi apparatus compartment 31 thereafter an enzyme termed migrase transfers the additional acetyl-group from c-7 to c-9 although this enzyme has not been identified 29 casd1 uses acetyl-coenzyme a as a donor substrate and cmp-neu5ac as an acceptor substrate but with weak activity on cmp-neu5gcbiologically the sa o-acetylation event confers merits to hosts such as protection from pathogenic invasion and maintenance of systemic self-homeostasis the o-acetylation event of sas protects the sa-containing glycans from neuraminidase nasialidase action because o-acetyl-groups inhibit microbial na activity the chemical structure of the o-acetyl group is quite unstable and susceptible to esterase enzymes sialic acid cleavage of the di-acetylated neu579ac3 by bacterial nas decreases two-fold when compared to mono-o-acetylated neu5ac the o-acetylated glycan modification invites interaction with viruses antibodies and mammalian lectins 32 therefore the sa o-acetylation modification confers specific functions to organismsfor example in the horse c4-o-acetyl modification of neu5ac sa occupies more than 50 of the total sa content the c4-o-acetylated neu5ac neu45ac2 inhibits the influenza a2 virus ha de-acetylation reagents such as naoh or naio4 treatment completely hemagglutinate neu45ac2 by elimination of the c4-o-acetyl group 33 the c4-o-acetyl neu5ac species are found in various sources such as equine erythrocyte gm3 starfish a rubens and fish 3435363738 c4-o-acetylated neu5ac facilitates the initial attachment of viruses to target cells like the influenza c virus infectious salmon anemia virus isav a member of the orthomyxoviridae family contains he and hef proteins to mediate virus entry and exit c4-o-ac neu5ac is the major receptor determinant of isav in receptor binding and destruction 38 while the influenza c virus recognizes c9-o-ac neu5ac the acetylesterase rde of isav cleaves c4-o-ac via 4-sa-o-acetylesterase with a short turnover time whereas c9-o-ac neu5ac is cleaved by 9-sa-o-acetylesterase with a long turnover time 34the position of sa o-acetylation is linked to functions including substrate differentiation of enzymes such as nas and esterase by c4 o-ac previous development of o-ac site-selective na inhibitors were based on the conceptual consideration of different o-ac positions the o-ac of sas is site-specific as c4 of neu5ac is considered to be a potential position for modification historically inhibitors of influenza a and b viruses-sialidases were designed by von-itzstein in 1993 39 the ac group-based c4 substitution interacts with amino acid glu-119 present in the active site of sialidase guanidine-attached c4 of c2c3 unsaturated sa neu5ac2en inhibits activity of sialidases isolated from influenza a virus singapore157 and b virus victoria10285 the same scenario was applied for sialidase inhibition of the human parainfluenza virus type 3 which has hn and fusion proteins 40 the c4 of neu5ac2en was substituted by alkyl groups such as the o-ethyl group for example zanamivir has a substitution with a 4-guanidino group with an ic50 of 25 m thus sialidase inhibition is important for c4 modification of neu5ac2en later oseltamivir with the tradename tamiflu basel switzerland and zanamivir with the tradename relenza london uk were established 41 these drugs exhibit some adverse side effects that restrict clinical usethe sa 9-o-acetylation in hosts allows hosts to evade influenza a virus hemagglutinin ha recognition and some lectins of factor h fh cd22siglec-2 and sialoadhesinsiglec-1 instead the influenza c virus ha recognizes the hosts -elimination and permethylation eliminate the 9-o-acetyl group from sas chemical modification of the c-9 position of neu59ac2 generates a 9-n-acetyl analog 9-acetamido-9-deoxy-n-acetylneuraminic acid neu5ac9nac a mimic of neu59ac2 with influenza c virus-binding capacity which is not cleaved by the he 42 sa o-acetylesterase regulates the presence of 79-o-ac and 9-o-ac sa o-acetylation and deacetylation are involved in development cancer and immunology sa o-acetylation alters host lectin bindings such as siglecs 29 the presence of 9-o-ac can also reduce the activity of nas 43 sa modifications regulate pathogen binding or pathogen nas influenza abcd viruses use sa as their entry receptors influenza a and b subtypes bind to sas via ha and na to allow endocytosis of the virus and fusion of the viral envelope with endosomes in contrast influenza c and d subtypes bear only one coated glycoprotein termed the he fusion protein hef the hef acts as the ha and na hef recognizes 9-o-acetyl sa for entry into cells while the esterase domain removes 9-o-acetyl-groups and liberates the virus from mucus and mis-assembled virus aggregates after budding the 9-o-ac on cells prevents the na activity and ha binding of the influenza a type virus 44influenza a and b viruses bear two spikes of receptor-binding ha and na 45hef is indeed an ancient type of sa-o-acetylesterase in contrast to ab the influenza c virus bears one spike with triple functions of hef as a homotrimer 46 each hef subunit bears two neu59ac2-binding sites and binds to the 9-o-acetyl group in parallel another modification of o-acetylation is found indeed influenza c virus bears sa-o-acetylesterase 47 which converts 5-n-acetyl-9-o-neuac neu59ac2 to 5-neu5ac the 9-o-acetyl sa is a unique determinant for the influenza c virus receptor and neu59ac2 is crucial for receptor activity but not neu5gc or neu5ac 48 neu59ac2 is an essential determinant for influenza virus c type-specific host cell tropism nas cleave the -ketosidic linkages to the d-gal or galnac sa-o-acetylesterases cleave different o-acetyl linkages figure 5 the oh-group of tyr224 and the guanidino group of arg236 interact with the ch3co-carbonyl oxygen 49 hef sa-o-acetylesterase is found in several enveloped  ssrna viruses of influenza c virus and also in certain covs and toroviruses 47 the covs are different from the orthomyxoviruses which hold a segmented  ssrna genome and are instead evolutionary linked to the family coronaviridae order nidovirales 45covs and toroviruses of the coronaviridae family are specific for the o-ac sa receptors their s and he glycoproteins are similar to influenza c virus hef covs and all toroviruses bear he gene form class i envelope membrane proteins of about 400 amino acid residues which bear 7 to 12 n-glycosylation sites 50 he multimer forms enter virions bovine cov bcov and hcov-oc43 similar to influenza c virus recognize neu59ac2 and bear sa-9-o-acetylesterase 8 cov hes are all o-acetylesterases the he enzymes found in torovirus cov and influenza c virus are evolutionarily interspecies-mutated with about 30 homology by heterologous rna recombination 51 and horizontal gene transfer therefore viral hes are diverse and widespread over evolutionhes as envelope proteins are found in covs orthomyxoviruses and toroviruses coronaviral hes are involved in virus attachment to sa species he protein in -covs binds to neu59ac2 form sa and agglutinates the red blood cells rbcs of rodents 52 as with sa-o-acetylesterase he potentiates viral entry with the s protein and spreading via the mucosal glycans it contains a carbohydrate-recognizing domain crd known in lectin the he glycan-binding domain gbd mediates virus attachment to sas on host cells he is the only ha this indicates that compared to the s glycoprotein he is only minor a ha and the s

adhesion molecule 1a ceacam known as cd66a as the key receptor 53 murine covs hes acquired by horizontal gene transfer bind to c9-o-ac neu5ac however some murine cov hes cannot bind to c4-o-ac neu5ac the original mouse mhv he binds to c9-o-ac neu5ac while the mhv s-strain he evolutionarily acquired the ability to bind to c4-o-ac neu5ac 125354 in terms of structure the c5 n- and c9 o-ac neu5ac-accomodating hydrophobic pocket was shifted to a c5 n- and c4-o-ac neu5ac-accomodating pocket 55type i he is specific for the 9-o-acetylated sas 9-o-ac-sas type ii he is specific for 4-o-ac-sas the sa-binding shift indicates quasi-synchronous adaptations of the sa-recognition sites of the lectin and esterase domains type i he monomers of -cov lineage a have a bimodular enzymelectin domain similar to cellular glycancarbohydrate-modifying proteins originally he homologs are found in various viruses including toroviruses and orthomyxoviruses such as the influenza virus cd and isavirus as well as the exceptional case of -cov lineage a among covs the he gene was transmitted to a -cov lineage a progenitor via horizontal gene transfer from a 9-o-ac-siarecognizing hef as shown in influenza virus cd he acquisition and expansion occurred by cross-species transmission over he evolution and this phenomenon reflects viral evolutionary adaptation to host sa-containing glycans therefore cov he receptor switching precedes virus evolution driven by sa-containing glycan diversity of hosts for instance the bcov he prefers 79-di-o-ac-sas which is also a target of the bovine torovirus he for a more outstanding case such a switching event occurred in the murine covs for the -cov lineage a type switch toward o-ac-sa recognition in the he specificity of murine covs two different murine cov subtypes of virus group exist with one subtype possessing the typical 9-o-ac-sa type i attachment factor and the other exclusively 4-o-ac-sa type ii attachment virus group 56the first coronaviral he proteins identified were from the porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus phev bcov and hcov-oc43 which bear sa-9-o-acetylesterases similar to hef 8 rat cov rcov has sa-4-o-acetylesterases converting neu45ac2 to neu5ac 535758 some murine covs prefer 4-o-ac-sas and others 9-o-ac-sas hcov-oc43 and bcov prefer 2-6-sa 9-o-acetylation by their sa-o-acetyleseterases the s glycoproteins of bcov and hcov-oc43 are neu59ac2-recognizing lectins and agglutinate murine rat and chicken erythrocytes due to the enriched 9-o-ac-sa species 52 bcov and hcov-oc43 adapted to sa receptor determinants of 9-o-ac-sa receptors 59 for a second receptor the binding of s glycoprotein to neu59ac2 receptor is essential for entry into cells bcov-infection is prevented by prior treatment of cells with na enzyme or with viral sa-o-acetylesterases blocking the roles of he and s glycoprotein in sa-dependent entry to host cellsin -covs such as tgev ha-activity is attributed to the sa-recognizing activity to 23-neugc 6162 the sa-binding site is present on the n-terminal region of the s-glycoprotein of tgev tgev has two types with enteric and respiratory tropism the respiratory tgev has the porcine aminopeptidase n papn-binding domain and sa-binding domain nucleotide 655 of the s gene is essential for enteric tropism and the s219a mutation of the s glycoprotein confers the enteric to respiratory tropism shift in addition a 6-nucleotide insertional mutation at nucleotide 1124 which yields the y374-t375insnd shift of the s glycoprotein causes enhanced enteric tract tropism tgev interacts with sa species on mucin-like glycoprotein mgp a highly glycosylated protein in an sa-dependent manner on mucin-secreting goblet cells 6 mgp sa-binding allows virus entry via the mucus layer to the intestinal enterocytes different from tgev the s glycoprotein of porcine cov has no hemagglutination activity due to deletion of the sa-binding site of the s glycoprotein 61 the loss of sa-binding activity is correlated to the non-enteropathogenicity sas function as ha-mediated entry determinants for tgev causing the enteropathogenic outcome of the virus and sa-recognition activity is also responsible for virus amplification in cells sa-binding activity-deficient tgev can propagate in cells through papn known as cd13 as a receptor 6263 the sa-binding activity potentiates infection and is crucial for intestinal infectionin -cov he mediates viral attachment to o-ac-sas and its function relies on the combined cbd and rde domains most -covs target 9-o-ac-sas type i but certain strains switched to alternatively targeting 4-o-ac-sas type ii for example the sa-acetylesterase enzyme in bcovs and hcov-oc43 is known to have hemagglutinizing activities as a type of sa-9-o-acetylesterase 8 the sa-acetylesterase is the he surface glycoprotein in bcov the three-dimensional structure of bcov he is similar to other viral esterases 9 the he gene is found only in the -cov genus the acetylesterase of murine covs differs in its substrate binding specificity from that of bcov and hcov-oc43 which is specific for o-acetyl residue release from sa c-9 murine covs prefer to esterize 4-o-acetyl-neuac 64 the -cov acetylesterase destroys the receptors and this specificity is similar to that of influenza viruses acetylesterase activity can be inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate and this agent decreases viral infection levels 65 as deduced from the sa acetylesterase of hcov-oc43 8 the 9-o-ac-sa species is a receptor binding determinant for erythrocytes and entry into cells 59 the bcov he protein has dual activity of acetylesterase and ha 9 bcov widely agglutinates erythrocytes and purified he only agglutinates neu59ac2-enriched erythrocytes of rats and mice bcov and hcov-oc43 can agglutinate chicken erythrocytes while purified he cannot in contrast to the he protein purified s glycoprotein can agglutinate chicken erythrocytes 52 indicating that the major ha is the s protein which acts as the major sa-binding protein however the role of o-ac-sas is not certain to be essential in receptors and sa-binding activity may be essential only to the he protein but not to the s glycoprotein 54in -covs ibv strains known as poultry respiratory infectious pathogens can agglutinate erythrocytes ibv prefers to recognize 23-neuac and the sa functions as a host entry receptor for infection 66 glycosylation of ibv m41 s1 protein rbd is crucial for interaction with chicken trachea tissue and rbd n-glycosylation confers receptor specificity and enables virus replication the heavy glycosylated m41 rbd has 10 glycosylation sites n-glycosylation of ibv determines receptor specificity however the host receptor has not yet been found na treatment reduces the binding of soluble s to kidney and tracheal epithelial cells the ibv s protein recognizes epithelial cells in a sa-dependent manner the sa-binding ability of ibv is necessary for infection of tracheal epithelial cells and lung respiratory epithelial cells 67 the sa-binding site is located on s1 of the ibv s protein although the ibv-specific protein receptor is not known in contrast to bcov or hcov-oc43 ibv lacks an rde sa binding of ibv is likely more essential than in other viruses such as tgevin torovirus which belongs to the family coronaviridae the toroviruses are grouped into the torovirinae subfamily and the torovirus genus the known toroviruses can infect four species of hosts constituting bovine equine porcine and human toroviruses they mildly infect swine and cattle through the he protein which is similar to the -cov he protein 68 the he protein is a class i membrane glycoprotein which forms homodimers with a mw of 65 kda the rde protein he reversibly binds to glycans 15 through binding to sas the acetyl-esterase activity disrupts sa binding he hemagglutinates mouse erythrocytes and cleaves the acetyl-ester linkage of glycans and acetylated synthetic substrate p-nitrophenyl acetate pnpa 69 similar to cov torovirus he is an acetylesterase type which cleaves the o-acetyl group from the sa c-9 position using neu59ac2 and n-acetyl-789-o-neuac 64 however torovirus he exhibits a restricted specificity for the neu59ac2 substrate but not for the neu5789ac3 substrate with a unique sa-binding site generated by a single amino acid difference in porcine thr73 and bovine ser64 for each he 70the s glycoprotein sars-cov-2 initiates infection of the host cells the molecular basis of cov attachment to sugarglycan receptors is an important issue as demonstrated by recent cryo-em defining the structure of the cov-oc43 s glycoprotein trimer complexed with a 9-o-acetylated sa 56 cryo-em structures of the trimeric ectodomain of s glycoprotein were observed using forms complexed with neu5ac neu5gc sialyllewisx slex 23-sialyl-n-acetyl-lactosamine 23-slacnac and 26-slacnac respectively the receptor-binding site is commonly conserved in all cov s glycoproteins which attach to 9-o-ac-sa species with similar ligand-binding pockets to the cov hes and influenza virus cd hef glycoproteins indicating conserved recognizing structures 25 the s glycoprotein-9-o-acetyl-sa interaction resembles the ligand-binding pockets of cov hes and influenza virus cd he fusion glycoproteins hcov-oc43 and bcov recognize 9-o-ac-sa s glycoproteins engage 9-o-acetyl-sas the 9-o-acetyl sas are the binding site for hcov-oc43 s glycoprotein and related -1 cov s glycoproteins however sa-binding sites on the 9-o-acetyl sialyl receptors of mers-cov s glycoprotein and hcov-oc43 s glycoprotein are different 71 thus covs use two different entry and attachment receptors therefore s glycoproteins of covs are distinct from influenza virus a has which bind to the neu5ac species by conserved binding sites the ligand-binding sites of bcov he enzyme influenza hef enzyme and cov s glycoprotein have evolved 9-o-ac-sa binding through hydrogen bonding with the 9-o-acetyl carbonyl group and hydrophobic pocket formation with the 9-o-acetyl methyl group 7172 however influenza ha cannot bind to 9-o-acetyl-sas but can bind to neugcs 73 the hcov-oc43 s glycoprotein hcov-hku1 s glycoprotein bcov s glycoprotein and phev s glycoprotein therefore share the ligand-binding specificity of influenza cd hef enzyme although they are functionally more similar to influenza virus ab ha whereas cov he or influenza virus ab na have rde activitiescov hes are functionally similar to influenza virus cd hef glycoproteins in cov the s glycoprotein recognizes the 9-o-ac-sa sugar while the he acts as the rde enzyme with sa-o-acetyl-esterase activity to release virions from infected host cells for example hcov-oc43 also has a similar he as an rde 71 in influenza c and d viruses hef glycoproteins act similarly to the cov he 74 in influenza a virus rde na releases virions from host cells however mers-cov does not have a similar enzyme and thus mer-cov binding to sa receptors is mediated by energetically reversible interactions of the lipid rafts with increased sa receptors 75 thus enhancing dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 or carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 ceacam5 recognition power and viral entry 76 and membrane-associated 78-kda glucose-regulated protein grp78 77mers-cov s glycoprotein can hemagglutinate human erythrocytes and mediates virus entry into human respiratory epithelial cells mers-cov s glycoprotein attachment is not observed for 9-o-acetylated or 5-n-glycolyl sas but is observed for 23-sa linkage over 26-sa linkages sa-binding sites of mers-cov s glycoprotein and hcov-oc43 s glycoprotein are not conserved 78 although they engage 23-sas on the avian host cell surface 79 mers-cov recognizes 23-sa and to a lesser extent the 26-sas and sulfated slex for binding preference thus s glycoproteins may have independently evolved sa recognition the acquisition of sa-binding ability of mers-cov s seems to be an evolutionarily recent event because hku4 s1 and hku5 s1 cannot hemagglutinate human erythrocytes 75 indicating flexible evolutionary exchange allowing cross-species transmission towards host cell tropism of covs in conclusion cov recognition of 9-o-ac-sas for infection is based on a conserved sequence for engagement of sa-related carbohydrate ligands across covs and orthomyxovirusessars-cov-2 needs ace2 for entry host proteases such as human ace2 help viral entry through removement of a barrier to enter human cells through unknown receptors human ace2 is known for its role as the sars-cov-2 entry receptor and the sars-cov receptor the enzyme ace-2 in the renin-angiotensin system ras is associated with cov entry into lungs ace2 mediates sars-2002 entry into host cells via s glycoprotein interaction with the ace2 receptor the ace2 levels on the plasma membrane correlate with virus infectivity ace2 expression is present in most tissues such as the lung epithelium it is highly expressed by respiratory epithelial cells and type iii lung alveolar epithelial cells 88 the host receptor is not linked to the classification of covs mers-cov a -cov does not recognize the ace2 receptor in contrast the -cov hcov-nl63 recognizes the ace2 receptor ace2 is a membrane-anchored carboxypeptidase with 805 amino acid residues and is captopril-insensitive it contains 17 amino acid residues as a signal peptide in the n-terminal region a type i membrane-anchored domain in the c-terminal region an extracellular n-terminal domain with heavy n-glycans a n-terminal sars-cov-binding and carboxypeptidase site and a short c-terminal cytoplasmic tail the ace2 gene is located on chromosome xp22 two ace2 forms are known a membrane-bound form and a soluble formace cleaves angiotensin i ang i substrate to ang ii ang ii recognizes the ang ii receptor type 1 at1r contributing to systemic and local vasoconstriction fibrosis and salt retention in vascular organs ace2 has the opposite function of ace ace2 is a close homolog to human ace ace2 activity on ang ii is about 400-fold higher than that on ang i ang-1 to ang-7 recognize the g protein-coupled receptor gpcr mas to activate vasorelaxation cardioprotection antioxidative action antiinflammation and anti-ang ii-signaling therefore the ace2-ang-1 to ang-7 axis is a target candidate for cardiovascular diseases ace2 shows similar binding structures between ncov and sars-cov the three proteins of ace ang ii and at1r contribute to progression of lung injury in humans ace2 removes a single amino acid residue from ang ii to yield the vasodilator named ang 1-ang 7 ace2 cleaves ang-i to ang 1ang 9 and ang ii to ang-1 to ang-7 the biggest difference between ace2 and ace is that ace2 has a non-inhibitory property by ace inhibitorspulmonary ace2 is potentially a candidate target in cov-involved inflammatory pathogenesis if ace inhibitors and ang ii-at1 blockers are dosed ace2 expression is increased however currently we have no conclusive evidence that the inhibitors help sars-cov or sars-cov-2 entry rather sars-cov infection reduces ace2 expression therefore sars-cov-2 host tropism is not related to ace2 expression ace2 levels and ang iiang 17 levels regulate the pathogenic progression ace2 expression is upregulated by gene polymorphisms and ace inhibitors or angiotensin ii receptor blockers such as sartansa disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain adam family of zn-metalloproteinases belongs to membrane proteins the well-known adam17 is a tnf--converting enzyme tace called the sheddase for tnf- other adam sheddase family members include adam9 adam10 and adam12 adam17 mediates ace2 shedding sars-cov s glycoprotein activates cellular tace and consequently facilitates virus entry soluble ace2 as the n-terminal carboxypeptidase domain form is derived from the original ace2 form by an adam17 metalloprotease in the membrane 89 adam17 is indeed an enzyme that can convert membrane type pro-tnf- to soluble tnf- a functional proinflammatory cytokine therefore adam17 inhibition indicates an anti-inflammatory response and adam17 inhibitors are promising candidates for tnf--induced inflammatory diseases the short c-terminal domain of ace2 is removed by adam17 and tmprss2 however tmprss2 cleaves ace2 competitively with the adam17 metalloprotease sars-s protein-ace2 binding leads to adam17tnf--converting enzyme tace-cleavage of ace2 facilitating extracellular ace2 shedding and consequent sars-cov entry into host cells 9091 only tmprss2 cleavage allows sars-cov entry into host cells through endocytosis and fusion soluble ace2 also recognizes the virus and prevents sars-cov-2 infection sars-cov-2 infection requires membrane ace2 and tmprss2 the ace2b0at1 complex binds to the s glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 intestinal membrane ace2 and lung tmprss2-shedded ace2 can act as alternative entry sites for sars-cov-2 sars-cov-2 infects the lungs and intestine via tmprss2-cleaved ace2 if tmprss2 is engaged in sars-cov-2 entry and ace2 downregulation tmprss2 inhibition would lead to covid-19 prevention although ace2 is expressed both in type i and type ii lung alveolar epithelial cells sars-cov and sars-cov-2 target only type ii epithelial cells due to the ace2tmprss2 interaction therefore supplementation of ace2 soluble ace2 or ang-1 to ang-7 should be a way to reduce sars-cov-2-related symptomstmprss2-cleaved ace2 is involved in sars-cov and mers-cov infections sars-cov-2 uses ace2 for cell entry through tmprss2 priming of the s glycoprotein figure 7 infection of the h7n9 influenza and h1n1 influenza a subtype viruses are also mediated by tmprss2-cleaved ace2 this implies that tmprss2 can be targeted as a strategic antiviral therapy 92 transmembrane protease serine 2 termed tmprss2 a type ii tm ser protease ttsp also cleaves ace2 the human tmprss2 gene located on chromosome 21 comprises androgen receptor elements ares in the upstream 5-flanking region 93 tmprss2 expression is regulated in an androgen-dependent manner the tmprss2 gene encodes 492 amino acids the original form is cleaved into the major membrane form and the minor soluble form tmprss2 activates protease activated receptor 2 par-2 and activated par-2 upregulates matrix metalloproteinase-2 mmp-2 and mmp-9 tmprss2-activated hepatocyte growth factor hgf induces c-met receptor signaling tmprss2 activates sars-cov and mers-cov the sars-cov s glycoprotein is cleaved by host-borne tmprss2 human airway trypsin-like protease hat tm protease serine 13 mspl serine protease desc1 desc1 furin factor xa and endosomal cathepsin lb sars-cov can enter cells upon cleavage by protease tmprss2 or endosomal cathepsin lb 90 virus s protein precursor is cleaved by host proteases the spikes are cleaved by endosomal cathepsin and by golgi or plasma membrane tmprss2 in the step of assembly or attachment and release the serine protease inhibitor camostat effectively blocks lethal sars-cov infection to mice however serine protease and cathepsin inhibitors are not effective thus tmprss2 is suggested to be an acting protease for sars-cov entry into host cells but not by cathepsin cis-cleavage liberates sars-cov s glycoprotein fragments into the extracellular supernatant trans-cleavage activates the sars-cov s glycoprotein on the target cells potentiating efficient sars-cov s glycoprotein-driven viral fusion tmprss2-activated sars-cov facilitates enveloped virus entry into cells tmprss2 is important for sars-cov entry and infection 81949596the fact that sars- and mers-cov infections are potentiated by tmprss2 indicates that tmprss2 is a promising target for therapeutic agents for example several ser protease inhibitors such as camostat mesylate inhibit tmprss2ace2-involved sars-cov-2 entry camostat a serine protease inhibitor reduces influenza virus titers in cell culture camostat-treated tmprss2 inhibition in calu-3 cells greatly reduces sars-cov viral titers and improves survival rate in sars-cov infected mice a treatment of 10-m camostat blocks mers-cov entry to african green monkey kidney vero-tmprss2 cells and blocks viral rna synthesis in calu-3 cells upon mers-cov infection aprotinin is a polypeptide with 58 amino acid residues that was isolated from bovine lungs another serine protease inhibitor nafamostat inhibits mers-cov entry and infection by tmprss2 inhibition 93 nafamostat mesylate blocks the tmprss2ace2-involved sars-cov-2 envelopepm fusion and prevents sars-cov-2 entry 95 nafamostat mesylate inhibits viral entry and thrombosis in covid-19 patients similarly an fda-approved mucolytic cough suppressant bromhexine hydrochloride bhh inhibits tmprss2 ic50 075 m and hence blocks infection of cov and influenza virus mprss2 as a host factor plays a pivotal role in sars-cov and mers-cov infections fda-approved tmprss2 inhibitors are yet under development because tmprss2 mediates efficient viral entry and replication it should be a promising target for new therapeutics against cov infectionthe ser exopeptidase dpp-4human cd26 pdb 4l72 a type ii tm ectopeptidase functions as a host cell receptor for mers-cov the rbd structure was characterized by crystallography approaches of the mers-cov s glycoproteindpp4 complex dpp4 is a single type ii tm glycoprotein with a small cytoplasmic tail in the n-terminal region and is present as a homodimeric form dpp4 cleaves x-proline dipeptides from the n-terminal region s glycoprotein recognizes sa species and dpp44 as the attachment and entry receptors respectively the mers-cov s1 n-terminal domain attaches to dpp4 as the host receptor 81 the s2 c-terminal domain of mers-cov anchors to cellular pm to enter mers-cov s glycoprotein is cleaved at a sequence between the s1 and s2 domains 96 another cleavage site s2 is present in the s2 domain mers cov s glycoprotein sialyl receptors are expressed in the camel nasal respiratory epithelial cells and the human lung alveolar epithelial cells which express dpp4 binding capacities are hindered by the sa 9-o-acetyl group or sa 5-n-glycolyl group 75entry of host cells needs binding of s glycoproteins to the ceacam receptor forming s-protein-mediated membrane fusion the trimeric s glycoprotein bears three s1 receptor heads the three s1 heads of the virus bind to three receptor molecules on the host cell cholesterol is indirectly involved in membrane fusion through ceacam engagement into lipid raft microdomains increasing multiple s protein interaction with the receptors and triggering membrane fusion 97 the enveloped cov mhv binds to ceacams on cholesterol-depleted cells in bhk cell cultures the ntd of s1 recognizes ceacam1 for mers-cov another ceacam5 isoform is the attachment factor for virus entry 75 the cov s1 ntd has a similar tertiary structure to human galactose-recognizing galectins mhv s1 ntd binds murine ceacam1a and bcov s1 ntd binds sugar 9899100 ceacam1a is a cell adhesion protein cam and its mrna is alternatively spliced the cryo-em structure of mhv s complexed with ceacam1a was elucidated 101 thus hcovs evolutionarily combined the galectin gene of hosts into their s1 glycoprotein gene while bcov s1 protein is present without such gene recombination but contains the sugar-recognizing lectin capacity mhv s1 protein also evolutionarily acquired murine ceacam1a-recognizing activity 102 therefore covs are under evolution to adapt their host receptor interaction to infect cross-species hosts 80103 on the host side to escape the lethal pressure from cov infections hosts have also evolved to acquire sa-binding proteins such as siglecs to inhibit or activate the innate immune cellsboth raft and non-raft ceacams are involved in the viruscell membrane fusion event formation of ceacam-associated mhv particles or ceacam-induced mhv fusion is possible by gpi-anchored ceacams through the binding between ceacam and s proteins however mhv can bind to both gpi- and tm-anchored ceacams in addition soluble ceacams also mediate s glycoprotein-driven fusion 104 this implies that membrane anchors are not intrinsically necessary in fact ceacams are present in different tissue-specific isoforms 105 nevertheless gpi-anchored ceacams are more effective for mhv infection than tm-anchored ceacams soluble ceacam receptors can bind to viral s glycoproteins and induce conformational shifts to acceptable s glycoprotein-involved membrane fusions 106 for example soluble ceacam forms interacts with s1 fragments 107 and alters the s1s2 association stability 108 and s1 oxidation confirmation 109 s proteins are structurally shifted prior to membrane fusion for the cross-linking of viruses and cells integral hydrophobic peptides of the s2 chain are embedded into membranes via membrane hydrophobic cholesterolsmers-cov s glycoprotein also recognizes a 78-kda glucoseregulated protein grp78 or heat shock 70 kda protein 5 hspa5 known as binding immunoglobulin protein bip or byun1 which is encoded by the hspa5 gene in humans hsp5a is a er-resident unfolded protein response upr protein stressed cell status such as viral infection increase expression and translocation of hspa5 to the pm to form a membrane protein complex grp78 modulates mers-cov entry in the presence of the dpp4 as a host cell receptor additionally lineage d -cov and bat cov hku9 bcov-hku9 also bind to grp78 76 a cell surface receptor grp78 was predicted to be another covid-19 receptor as an s glycoprotein binding site 110 the prediction was made using the combined technology of molecular modeling docking with structural bioinformatics grp78 or bip is a chaperone protein located in the er lumen 111 known er-bound enzymes include activating transcription factor 6 atf6 inositol-requiring enzyme 1 ire1 and protein kinase rna pkr-like er kinase perk 112 depending on threshold of unfolded protein accumulation grp78 releases ire1 atf6 and perk and is activated resulting in translation inhibition and refolding stress-overexpressed grp78 can avoid er retention and is translocated to the membrane grp78 translocated to the cell pm can recognize viruses by its substrate-binding domain sbd for virus entry into the cell figure 8 in sequence and structural alignments and proteinprotein docking rbd of the cov spike protein recognizes the grp78 sbd as the host cell receptor the predicted region iii c391c525 and region iv c480c488 of the s glycoprotein and grp78 are highly potential binding sites region iv is the grp78 binding-driving force these nine amino acid residues are being molecularly targeted for the designation and simulation of covid-19-specific drugs this process is the mechanism underlying the cell surface hspa5 grp78 exposure and this is exploited to be used for pathogen entry such pathogenic entry into host cells has been observed in multiple infections including pathogenic human viruses such as human papillomavirus ebola virus zika virus and hcovsas well as fungal rhizopus oryzae 113114115116 therefore natural products can inhibit cell-surface hspa5 recognition of the viral s glycoproteinamong the six hcovs the -cov hcov-229e s protein recognizes hapn known as cd13 or membrane alanyl aminopeptidase ec 34112 porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus virus pedv binds to protein receptor apn of human- and pig neuac species as its co-receptor apart from hapn tgev and pedv bind to sa species 117 although sa recognition by tgev is not essential in the first step of entry cycle hcov-229e recognizes hapn known as cd13 for its entry receptor hapn pdb 4fyq or cd13 ec 34112 which is a zn-dependent metalloprotease has a mw 150 kda with 967 amino acids cd13 is a type ii tm protein with a short cytoplasmic domain in the n-terminal region and long extracellular region in the ctd the ctd has a pentapeptide sequence specific for the zincmmps the apn binding domain is located on the ctd of pedv s1 amino acid 477629 residues while the sa-binding domain is found in the n-terminal region of pedv s1 amino acid 1320 residues 118 cd13 is also a receptor for hcov-229e human cytomegalovirus porcine cov tgev feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv feline enteric virus fecv and canine-infectious covs 119120121122 homodimeric cd13 digests luminal peptides the hapn-encoding anpep gene is a dominant component in proximal tubular epithelial cells small intestinal cells macrophages granulocytes and synaptic membranes if this gene is defective leukemia or lymphoma are transformed 123 porcine and human apn exhibit about 80 protein identity fipv and fecv are in the same group as hcov-229e and tgev thus porcine apn is also an attachment site for pig tgev with an additional second receptor hcov-229e first binds to cd13 and consequently clusters cd13 in caveolae-associated lipid rafts 120for glycan interaction hcov-nl63 and mhv utilize heparan sulfate proteoglycans hspgs as attachment enhancers 87124 viruses recognize hspgs as attachment molecules in the spike s protein-deficient virions the m protein recognizes hspg the s proteins generally bind to the viral cellular receptor however the m protein also acts as a receptor in the early step of hcov-nl63 infection the m membrane protein of hcov-nl63 recognizes the attachment site of hspgs hcov-nl63 m protein binds to hspg for the initial attachment of virus to host cells and thereafter the m and s proteins cooperate for virus entrance into the host cells 125 hspgs are glycosaminoglycan gag-carrying proteins frequently used as a secondary receptor for viral entry hspgs are composed of covalent-bonded hs chains as a gag form the hs gag linkage structure of tetrasaccharide exhibits glua13glcnac14gal13gal14xyl-o-serine glycosyltransferases involved in hs gag synthesis include glcat-ii glucuronosyltransferase and glcnact-ii n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase ii for heparan sulfate synthesis figure 9 gag is used as docking sites for virus interaction with the host cell surface gags contain negatively charged n- and o-sulfated sugars 126 the biosynthetic pathway and biologic roles in early embryogenic morphogenesis and vulval morphogenesis of hs and chondroitin sulfate gag have been elucidated in caenorhabditis elegans 127 the negative charges mediate the interaction of gags and their ligands through electrostatic forces interaction of hspg with ligands potentiates many virus infectious cycles for examples adeno-associated virus human t cell lymphotropic virus type 1 human papilloma virus 16 herpes viruses hepatitis b and c viruses kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus human papilloma viruses and merkel cell polyoma virus recognize the hspgs 128129 hspgs increase virulence upon interaction with viral factors required for viral attachment and replicationalthough hcov-hku1 utilizes o-acetyl-sas as attachment sites the hcov-hku1 s protein also interacts with mhc-i c hla-c as an additional attachment molecule 85sars-cov uses the c-type lectins of dc-sign and dc-l-sign as additional or secondary receptors glycans on the s glycoprotein are recognized by dcl-sign for virus attachment and entry seven glycosylation sites of the s glycoprotein have been found to be essential for dcl-sign-driven virus entry 86130tetraspanin cd9 but not tetraspanin cd81 associates with dpp4 and the type ii tm serine protease ttsp member tmprss2 a cov-activating protease to form a cell surface complex 131 this cd9dpp4tmprss2 complex permits mers-cov pseudovirus entrance into the host cells the tetraspanins have four tm spanning regions linked by one large and one small loop in the extracellular region tetraspanins form virus entry baselines and open cov entry routes to help viral entry into host cells mers-cov s interacts with dpp4 receptors via the rbd receptor involvement causes cleavage using proteases such as the previously described tmprss2 association of tetraspanin cd9 with the dpp4tmprss2 complex triggers the s glycoprotein mers-covs enter the cells via endocytosis and cathepsins cleave the s proteins 132sas are predominant surface determinants for pathogen attachment adherence and entry to host cells eleven representative vertebrate virus families utilize sas as initial entry receptors or as attachment factors interaction of virus with sa-containing glycans is complex because virus sa-binding lectins are inherently of very low affinity viruses acquire enzymes to catalyze virion elution by regional depletion of binding receptors 56 tm s glycoprotein recognizes oligosaccharide receptors using cryo-em technology and observed structures of s glycoprotein trimers of cov oc43 complexed with 9-o-acetylated sa s glycoprotein was demonstrated to mediate virus adhesion and entry to host cells all cov s proteins show conservation in binding to 9-o-acetyl-sas mers-cov also recognizes 9-carbon sugar sa species mers-cov s-1a binds to sa species for example sa23- over sa26-linkages expressed in human erythrocytes and mucins are preferentially targeted by mers-cov s-1a binding is hence blocked by sa modification to 5-n-neugc and 7 9-o-neuac species 73 for example impairment of ace2 receptor glycosylation does not influence s-glycoprotein-ace2 interaction however sars-cov-2 virus entry into respiratory epithelial host cells was downregulated 133 changes in ace2 n-glycans do not apparently influence interaction with the sars-cov s glycoprotein but instead impair viral s glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion the receptor glycan structures decide the entry of some human viruses changes in ace2 receptor sialylation influences interaction affinity between virus ligands and host receptor inter-species or individual genetic variations such as drift and mutation may occur in sars-covs this explains currently emerging differences in cov responses within the same population such as humanson the other hand from the aspect of virus ligand the s glycoprotein decorates viral surfaces and is therefore the target for vaccination design virus internalization requires potential glycosylation of viral glycoproteins among the three viral envelope components s and m are the major glycoproteins and e is nascent and not glycosylated the m glycoprotein consists of a short glycosylated ectodomain in the n-terminal region the s glycoprotein expressed in hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus is an ha that recognizes n-acetyl-9-o-neuac as a binding receptor expressed on erythrocyte surfaces 134 for example bcovs attach to the surface receptor of n-acetyl-9-o-neuac 9-o-acetylated sas on host cells tgev and pedv are currently known as a similar class of such covs pedv infects multiple hosts including bat pig human and monkey where bats are considered to be the evolutionary origin for pedv the s glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 utilizes different glycosylation patterns to recognize its receptors the glycosylation sites in minimal rbd exhibits similar sites to other covs the trimeric sars-cov-2 s glycoprotein is also highly glycosylated with 66 n-glycans but a few o-glycans 135 glycosylation of s glycoproteins leads to immune evasion in the mers-cov and the bat-specific cov-hku4 glycosylation is linked to zoonotic infection for fusion-based entry 136clq and clq-oh are under investigation worldwide to treat covid-19 figure 10 clq and its derivative clq-oh block cov replication amplification and spread in in vitro culture via inhibition of ace2 receptor glycosylation in hcovs interaction of the s glycoprotein with gangliosides initially occur as the first entry step during the replication cycle of the virus clq and clq-oh have been alternative drugs for ra and several autoimmune diseases for 70 years although they are anti-malaria prophylaxis drugs clq-oh is an aminoquinoline with less toxicity than clq clq-oh bears an n-hydroxyethyl side chain which increases its solubility compared to clq 141 clq-oh modulates activated immune cells via downregulation of tlr signaling and il-6 production 142 clinical trials are also under consideration for the efficacy and safety of these drugs regarding the action mechanisms clq and clq-oh-mediated inhibition of ace2 terminal glycosylation was considered in in vitro vero e6 cells clq significantly inhibits sars-cov spread by interfering with ace2 function acting at the entry and post-entry steps of sars-cov-2 replication and infection the binding affinity of ace2 to s glycoprotein is simulated to be lowered by treatment with clq-oh or clq clq may modify the binding affinity between ace2 and s glycoprotein by alterations in ace2 glycosylation or modification clq-oh ec50 072 m and clq ec50 547 m inhibit sars-cov-2 143using computer simulation techniques clq and clq-oh have been suggested to recognize the enzymatic active site of the udp-glcnac 2-epimerase known as an essential enzyme in sa biosynthesis 144 blocking the sialylation of host cells the mechanism underlying the glycosylation inhibition may support the antiviral properties of clq and clq-oh through interactions of clq or clq-oh with ndp-saccharide mutases or glycosyltransferases 145 clq was reported to inhibit quinone reductase 2 146 known as a catalytic mimetic or structural neighbor of udp-glcnac 2-epimerases 147148 if clq or clq-oh inhibits sa synthesis the inhibitory properties may support the antiviral activity of clq or clq-oh against sars-covs because the sars-cov receptor ace2 contains sa species in fact clq exhibits in vitro anti-sars-cov-1 activity via defective glycosylation of viral ace2 in vero cells 149 in addition the interference of clq or clq-oh with sa synthesis may broadly be applicable as an antiviral because the hcovs or other orthomyxoviruses also utilize sas as entry molecules 150 however the detailed mechanisms should be further elucidated the clq treatment efficacy in covid-19 patients has however not been conclusively determinedlipid rafts are also viral attachment sites viruses such as ibv dengue virus ebola virus hepatitis c virus hiv human herpes virus 6 measles virus newcastle disease virus poliovirus west nile virus foot-and-mouth disease virus simian virus 40 rotavirus influenza virus and marburg virus also use lipid rafts for virus entry 151152153154155156 in avian cov ibv structural proteins of the ibv virus are co-localized with pm lipid rafts embedded with the ganglioside gm1 hcov-229e entry is prevented by cholesterol depleted conditions because hcov-229e clusters in caveolae-associated lipid rafts 157 caveolae of caveolin-1 -2 and -3 are cross-linked 158 and control the molecular distribution between rafts and caveolae in a regulatory mechanism s protein-cd13 cross-linking occurs via cd13-caveolin-1 sequestering hcov-229e particles similarly exhibit a longitudinal distribution property hcov-229e-colocalized caveolin-1 undergoes the next step of virus infection caveolin-1 knockdown inhibited hcov-229e endocytosis and entry and thus caveolin-1 is essential for hcov-229e infection tgev also endocytoses by a clathrin-mediated mechanism in mdck cells 159 other viruses including hcov-oc43 also use an entry receptor sequestered to cross-linked caveolae 160 in sars-cov the first entry step to host cells needs ace2 in intact lipid rafts by the s glycoprotein 151 ace2 is associated with caveolin-1 and gm1 in membrane rafts depending on its cell-type specific localization 161 raft integrity with cholesterol and ace2 is necessary for sars-cov pseudovirus entry into vero e6 cells and for sars-cov-microdomain-based entry c-type lectin cd209 l l-sign can also form lipid rafts and acts as a sars-cov receptor 162 information of the cov entry pathways is important for therapeutic designation of sars-cov-targeting drugs for example if agents disrupt lipid-raft localization of the ace2 receptorclq binds the sas and gangliosides in lipid rafts with a high affinity therefore clq or clq-oh prevents the s glycoproteinganglioside binding clq or clq-oh binding to sa consequently prevents s glycoprotein binding to host receptors the n-terminal region of sars-cov-2 s glycoprotein interacts with gangliosides a ganglioside-binding site gbs or ganglioside-binding domain gbd is present in the ntd of the s glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 using molecular modeling and simulation technology clq has been suggested to recognize the sas and gangliosides human type neu5ac binds to clq and clq-oh thus sas are binding targets of clq and clq-oh clq and clq-oh have two specific recognition sites in the polar sugar residues of ganglioside gm1 the first site is found at the tip of the sugar residues of gm1 with an interaction energy of 47 kjmol the clq rings face the galnac residue of gm1 while the second site is in a large region of the sugar-ceramide junction and the sugar residues several amino acid residues of the s protein ntd which are phe-135 asn-137 and arg-158 recognize the ganglioside gm1 the s glycoprotein ntd-gm1 complex is suggested to form a trimolecular complex with two molecules of ganglioside gm1 anchored to the ntd of s protein 163 the ace2-binding rbd is suggested to be a potential gbs located on a differential site of the s glycoprotein ntd the protein sequence interfacing surface of the ntd is the consensus gbds 164 the amino acids gly pro andor ser residues found in gbd motifs are in the same 111158 amino acids of the ntd as the ganglioside-attachment interface the gbd is conserved throughout viral isolates from worldwide covid-19 patients the gbd potentially increases viral attachment ability to pm lipid rafts and contact between host ace-2 and s protein 165 the interaction between clq-oh and 9-o-acetyl-neuac is also similar to the 9-o-acetyl-neuac-clq interaction the clq-oh oh group enhances the interaction of clq with sa via a hydrogen bond 163 in conditions with clq or clq-oh derivative treatment the s glycoprotein cannot bind to gangliosides in in silico studies which are used to uncover the action mechanism clq and clq-oh prevent the binding of s glycoprotein to gangliosides the clq-sa complex is formed in a mixed surface and balls by the positioning of the negative charged cooh group of neu5ac and one of the two cationic charges of clq 163 covs preferentially bind to 9-o-acetyl-neuac 60 differentiating with other viral propertiesas clq interacts with the gm1 sugar part the n-terminal domain of the s protein loses viral attachment capacity to the cell receptors 166 the s protein ntd and the clqclq-oh maintain the same position during gm1 binding consequently preventing gm1 binding to the s protein and the drug at the same time because the ntd and the clqclq-oh simultaneously recognize gm1 asn-167 forms a hydrogen bond with the galnac residue whereas an aromatic phe-135 stacks to the glc residue of gm1 therefore the antiviral activities of clq and clq-oh is to block the interaction between the sars-cov-2 s glycoprotein and gangliosides on host cell surfaces the lipid composition of host cell pm can also be a potential target for preventive and therapeutic drugs against such virusesthe sars-cov-2-caused covid-19 pandemic is a global public health issue in the 21st century in order to coordinate efforts against and mitigate the public health consequences of the spreading and outbreak of the disease the international community has been exchanging independent information and knowledge the scientists and epidemiologists exchange covid-19 information to highlight interdisciplinary approaches the pandemic outbreak issue has raised interest in the pathology and epidemiology of the disease the current covid-19 pandemic resulted in establishment of the covid action platform of the world economic forum wef to perform evidence-based cutting-edge research and analyze the fast-evolving pandemic the virus outbreak data network vodan of the gofair data alliance also pursues to apply the best remedy against the pandemic infection in the aspect of basic biology most -covs recognize 9-o-acetyl sas but certain viruses have switched to binding 4-o-acetyl sa originally he is found in other viruses such as toroviruses and orthomyxoviruses influenza cd and isavirus the exceptional -cov lineage a is the only one to bear he among the covs virus entry and replication inhibitors need to be urgently developed computation-fused artificial intelligence accelerates therapeutic agent development the sars-cov-2 genome shows 80 similarity to the previous sars-cov and sars-targeting agents can be commonly treated to the related sars-cov-2 patients for better understanding of the entry pathway of sars-cov-2 the importance of the carbohydrates including sas on cell and virus surfaces is again emphasizedthe coronavirus sars-cov-2 responsible for the pandemic which started in wuhan china during the latter part of 2019 has spread to 213 countries areas and territories according to the who 12 by april 16th 2020 and continues to spread infecting approximately 84500 and causing the death of approximately 8000 people daily although young people usually develop mild symptoms it can cause severe lower respiratory disease affecting mostly the elderly and individuals with other co-morbidities such as cardiovascular problems pre-existing respiratory disease diabetes hypertension or cancer 1sars-cov-2 belongs to the cov genera of the coronavirinae subfamily of the order of nidovirals 3 compared to sars and merscoronavirus strains that caused the two most recent epidemics in 20022003 and 2012 respectivelyit mostly resembles sars-cov-1 200203 with 795 sequence identity and the same mechanism for host cell entrance via the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ace-2 surface protein of the cell 4due to the urgent need for effective drugs to attenuate the disease and the long-lasting process of novel drug development researchers are focusing on drug repositioning among the drugs approved or developed for other purposes that have been proposed for the treatment of sars-cov-2 and are under clinical trials most are enzyme inhibitors targeting the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp or the protease of the virus among them favipinavir ribavirin remdesivir and galidesivir act as rdrp inhibitors while lopinavir ritonavir 56 and danoprevir are viral protease inhibitors in addition drugs aiming to prevent the entrance and formation of the viral particles have been proposed such as chloroquine hydroxychloroquine 7 and apn01 8lopinavir and ritonavir designed and approved for the treatment of aids were the first protease inhibitors used for the treatment of sars-cov-2 56 both drugs were proposed as promising agents for the treatment of sars-cov-1 by an in silico study conducted in 2016 which had evaluated the probable activity of several hiv-1 protease inhibitors against the sars-cov-1 protease using docking analysis 6 the in silico results were promising although coronavirus proteases are cysteine proteases while the hiv-1 protease belongs to the aspartate protease family 6upon release of the first sars-cov-2 main protease structure mpro to the protein data bank on march 2020 several in silico studies have been conducted to find potent protease inhibitors 910111213141516171819 the in silico-evaluated compounds were mostly approved drugs of all categories 910111213141516171819 and natural plant 1113 as well as marine 16 products since docking analysis was performed in most cases in randomly selected approved drugs independently of the rational of their initial design and their initial target pharmaceutical agents of different drug categories have been proposed among the most potent predicted inhibitors were anti-bacterial 1019 anti-fungal 10 anti-viral 12 anti-tuberculosis 12 anti-nimatoid 17 anti-protozoal 17 anti-helminthic 19 anti-inflammatory 19 anti-tumor 1012 vasodilator 10 vasoprotective 12 anti-convulsant 12 bronchodilator 12 anti-psychotic 10 agents and vitamins 12 among the anti-viral agents are ribavirin a nucleoside analogue used for the treatment of lassa fever virus influenza a and b and hcv 12 telbivudine a nucleoside analogue used for the treatment of hav 12 the hiv-1 integrase inhibitors raltegravir and dolutegravir 13 and the hiv-1 protease inhibitors darunavir and saquinavir 14 according to a more recent in silico research published on april 15th the hcv protease inhibitors simeprevir and faldaprevir as well as the hiv-1 protease inhibitors indinavir and tipranavir along with saquinavir were predicted to act as better mpro inhibitors compared to the lopinavir and ritonavir used in clinical practice 15 danoprevir was the first anti-hcv protease inhibitor which was approved for clinical trials clinical trial nct04291729proteases are central enzymes in the biology of humans and viruses and several of them have become drug targets for anti-viral therapy as well as for the treatment of various diseases there is a number of approved drugs that act as protease inhibitors 20 among the main proteolytic enzymes are the viral proteases of hiv-1 with more than fifteen approved or on-trial drugs and of hcv with more than ten drugs in addition a number of drugs against human proteases have been developed among them are renin inhibitors with seven compounds and ace inhibitors with more than twenty compounds with applications in the treatment of hypertension thrombin as well as coagulation factor xa inhibitors used as anti-thrombotic agents dpp-4 inhibitors gliptins are used for the treatment of type ii diabetes with seventeen drugs of this type mentioned in the who drugs stem book 21the above proteases belong to different classes according to the catalytic amino acid while the sars-cov-2 main protease is a cysteine protease 2022 the hiv-1 enzyme is an aspartate protease 2023 the human drug target renin also belongs to this family on the other hand the hcv protease 24 as well as the human protease dpp-4 25 the coagulation factor xa 26 and thrombin 27 are serine proteases while the angiotensin-converting enzyme ace belongs to the metalloproteinase family 2028as far as cleavage recognition motifs are concerned the sars-cov-2 main protease cleaves the viral polyprotein at no less than 11 sites recognizing the sequence leu-gln  seralagly 22 the hiv-1 protease recognizes nine cleavage sites in its polyprotein substrate with sequence differences that keep the feature of cleavage most commonly between phe and pro alternatively it cleaves between amino acids with hydrophobic or aromatic side chains tyrmetleuphe  prophetyralaleumet 23 the hcv protease cleaves its polyprotein substrate at four sites recognizing a gluasp-gluasp-xxx-cys  ser general motif 24 the human organism protease dpp-4 preferentially cleaves at x  pro or x  ala sites 25 whereas thrombin preferentially cleaves at the glyalavalilepro-arg  seralaglythrnoted-xnoted-argnote motif 27 the coagulation factor xa cleaves after arg recognizing a motif valproile-glnaspglu-phegly-arg  ser-leu 26 renin recognizes the sequence ile-his-pro-phe-his-leu 29 while angiotensin-converting enzyme ace recognizes the angiotensin i sequence asp-arg-val-tyr-ile-his-pro-phe  his-leu 28similarities between proteases at the catalytic amino acids of the active site and in the nature of amino acids of the substrate may be an indication for efficient inhibition of the proteases by the same inhibitors however the nature of surrounding amino acids of the active site and the 3d structure of the active center are also of great importancein the present study the 3d structure of the sars-cov-2 main protease was compared with the 3d structures of proteases which are drug targets with approved inhibitors in addition a number of approved inhibitors of the above proteases were evaluated by docking analysis for their ability to inhibit the sars-cov-2 main protease interacting with the active site of the enzymesince the 3d structure of the active site of the enzyme is crucial for catalytic activity we proceeded to a comparison of the sars-cov-2 main protease mpro with the hiv-1 protease the hcv protease ns3 protein and the human proteases dpp-4 thrombin factor xa renin and ace which constitute known drug targets with approved inhibitorssignificant 3d similarity was found between the sars-cov-2 and the hcv protease p  134  104 as well as between the sars-cov-2 protease and -thrombin p  742  104 interestingly the protein parts with increased structural alignment included the catalytic area of the enzyme the lowest similarity was observed in the case of angiotensin-converting enzyme and coagulation factor xa figure 1 and figure 2the structural similarity between the sars-cov-2 protease and some of the selected proteases in combination with the existence of the same amino acids at certain positions of the substrate cleavage site such as ser at the p1 position of the recognition sequence of the hcv protease and thrombin are promising features in the effort to identify effective sars-cov-2 protease inhibitors among the approved drugs of the selected proteasesto investigate this possibility further we proceeded to docking analysis of randomly selected approved or on-trial inhibitors of the selected proteases table 1 an exception from the random selection was made for the hiv-1 inhibitors where lopinavir and ritonavir were selected because they have already been proposed for the treatment of sars-cov-2 the rest of the drugs that were selected are the anti-hcv drugs telaprevir and boceprevir the dpp-4 inhibitor sitagliptin the renin inhibitor alisliren the ace inhibitor captopril the thrombin direct inhibitors argatroban and dabigatran and the coagulation factor xa inhibitor rivaroxabandocking analysis was performed using the sars-cov-2 structure 6lu7 the results were promising for most of the compounds with the exception of the ace and renin inhibitors captopril and aliskiren for which the calculated free binding energy was 517 and 466 kcal mol1 respectively table 2 according to our previous experience and to the literature a free binding energy higher than 55 kcal mol1 is an indication that the compound is inactive 3233the best results were obtained for the hcv protease inhibitors telaprevir and boceprevir with free binding energies of 1005 and 916 kcal mol1 respectively followed by the thrombin inhibitor argatropan and the dpp-4 inhibitor sitagliptin with free binding energies of 903 and 880 kcal mol1 respectively the hiv-1 protease inhibitors ritonavir and lopinavir showed a little lower predicted activity with free binding energies of 896 and 865 kcal mol1 respectively docking analysis to the whole enzyme indicated that the enzyme active site is the second preferred binding site of lopinavir ritonavir and boceprevir according to this observation the expected inhibitory action of these compounds is to be lower than that predicted based on their binding energy to the active site 32 rivaroxamban and dabigatran are also expected to be active with calculated free binding energies of 797 and 657 kcal mol1 respectivelysince the evaluation of the randomly selected hcv protease dpp-4 -thrombin and coagulation factor xa inhibitors showed promising results we proceeded to the evaluation of a more extended sample of approved drugs of these categories including a number of drugs currently in phase iii clinical trial table 3 table 4 for better estimation of the probable inhibitory effect of the selected compounds a second protein structure of the sars-cov-2 protease was also used pdb id 6m2n the whole enzyme including both protease subunits was selected for the process for comparison reasons the estimated binding energy of the compounds to their initial targets were also calculated for the same reasons for some of the most promising sars-cov-2 candidate inhibitors the estimated binding energy to the hiv-1 4rvj protease structure was calculateddocking analysis of both sars-cov-2 protease structures gave similar results interestingly 20 out of the 24 compounds which were selected for evaluation exhibited lower estimated binding energy than the initial inhibitor of the 6m2n structure 745 kcal mol1 34 and of the n3 inhibitor 741 kcal mol1 35 docking of the compounds to the target proteases for which they were designed showed a generally higher binding probability lower estimated binding energy for the initial targets compared to the sars-cov-2 protease but the most active compounds showed comparable results for the two targets for example faldaprevir exhibited an estimated binding energy of 1127 kcal mol1 for the sars-cov-2 protease and 1115 kcal mol1 for the hcv protease while teneligliptin showed 987 kcal mol1 for the new protease and 916 kcal mol1 for its initial targetaccording to the estimated free binding energies all evaluated drugs could act as sars-cov-2 protease inhibitors among the hcv protease inhibitors faldaprevir exhibited the lowest free binding energyteneligliptin and gemigliptin are the most promising drugs among the dpp-4 inhibitors in the group of anti-coagulants inogartan and argatroban of the first randomly selected compounds were the most promising among a-thrombin inhibitors and edoxaban among factor xa inhibitors docking analysis of the whole enzyme indicated that the enzyme active site is the first preferred binding site for all the hcv protease and dpp-4 inhibitors presented in table 3 but the third preferred site for inogatran and the second for edoxaban consequently the expected inhibitory action of inogatran and edoxaban are to be lower than that predicted based on their relative binding energy to the active site in conclusion faldaprevir teneligliptin and gemigliptin are the compounds expected to exhibit the highest activity against the sars-cov-2 main proteasethe sars-cov-2 protease preferentially cleaves its substrate after gln which follows leu and before a ser or ala or gly amino acid leu-gln  seralagly the gln amino acid at the p1 position of the substrate is an amino acid with a relatively long side chain leading to a polar amide group with hydrogen donoracceptor possibility as shown by studies of complexes of the mpro enzyme with substrate analogues 34 gln is placed in vicinity to cys145 at the subsite s1 of the active center surrounded by the side chains of the amino acids asn142 glu166 his163 and his172 and the main chains of phe140 and leu141 the p2 amino acid leu has a relatively long hydrophobic but not bulky or aromatic side chain the side chain of leu is inserted at the s2 subsite which consists of the side chains of the amino acids his41 met49 tyr54 and met165 placed in vicinity to asp187 the p4 amino acid of the peptide interacts with the amino acids met165 leu167 phe185 and gln192 and the main chain of gln189in the case of the substrate analogue n3 in addition to polar or hydrophobic interactions a hydrogen bond hb is formed between the his163 side chain and o of the lactam ring which serves as a mimetic of the gln amino acid of the natural substrate 34 a second hb is formed between the h of the closest to the lactam ring nh group of the backbone of the ligand and the co of the main chain of his164 of the enzyme while the nh group of the backbone of leu amino acid of the ligand interacts with the co of the backbone of gln189 of the enzyme the lactam ring as a mimetic of the gln amino acid of the substrate is also present at the structure of the a-ketomide inhibitors designed by zang et al 22 in this case the h of the nh group of the lactam ring forms two hydrogen bonds with the co of the main chain of phe140 and the carboxylate of glu166 while the co oxygen of the lactam moiety forms a hydrogen bond with the imidazole of his163 in the most active compound of this series the p2 leu of the natural substrate has been replaced by a cyclopropane while the pyridon ring at the p3 position participates in complex stabilization through hydrogen bonds with the o of the side chain of gln189 and the nh of the main chain of glu166the two above substrates constitute peptidomimetics with peptide bonds between amino acid mimetic moieties in both cases the catalytic amino acid cys145 forms a covalent bond with the ligand most of the approved drugs proposed as sars-cov-2 protease inhibitors according to in silico studies are not peptidomimetics according to docking analysis various groups may be placed at the s1 subsite such as the 7-methoxy-8-methyl-quinoline moiety of simeprevir 15 or the oxadiazole group of raltegravir which adopts a curved form within the binding pocket 13 interaction with thr24 thr25 and ser46 also seems to play an important role in complex stabilization of many compounds including raltegravir and ribavirin 12most inhibitors used in this study do not contain the classic peptide bonds but share with peptide substrates the characteristic of many polar hda groupsin gemigliptin the tetrahydropyridine ring and the 2-amino-4-oxobutyl bridge are placed at the s1 subsite between glu166 and cys145 a hydrogen bond between the co group of the backbone of glu166 and the nh2 group of the 2-amino-4-oxobutyl bridge contributes to complex stabilization while cys145 participates in hydrophobic interactions with carbons of the bicyclic moiety figure 3 the trifluoromethyl pyrimidine moiety interacts with his41 of the s2 subsite which stabilizes the complex by halogen bond formation with the f atoms and pi interactions with the pyrimidine ring halogen bonds are also formed between the f atoms of the fluoropiperidinone ring and amino acids val186 arg188 and thr190in linagliptin the n of the piperidine ring participates in hydrogen bond interactions with the o of the co group of the main chain of glu166 of the s1 subsite while the nh2 substituent of the ring forms hb with pro168 the his41 of the s2 subsite participates in complex stabilization by polar interaction with the n atom of the methylquinazoline and by hydrophobic and pi interactions with the carbons of this moiety while met49 also forms hydrophobic interactions additional stabilization is achieved by the interaction of met165 with the dihydropurine moiety figure 3in faldaprevir the cyclopentyl carbamate moiety participates in hydrogen bond formation with the asn142 of the s1 subsite while hydrogen bonds are also formed between the 2-ethenylcyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid group and the amino acids thr25 and ser46 figure 4in the case of melagatran a curved conformation is adopted the catalytic amino acid cys145 forms hydrophobic interactions with cyclohexan while asn144 of the s1 subsite strongly contributes to complex stabilization via polar interaction with the n atom of the aminoacetyl acid group at the s2 subsite the nh group of the side chain of his41 participates in hydrogen interaction with the o of the methyl carbamoyl bridge while met49 is involved in hydrophobic interactions with the phenyl ring of the molecule in addition the oh group of the nearby ser46 participates in hydrogen bond formation with the nh2 of the benzimidamide group figure 5in betrixaban the chloropyridin moiety is placed at the s1 subsite interacting via halogen bonds with the amino acids glu166 phe140 and leu141 and via hydrophobic interactions with cys145 in addition a hydrogen bond is formed between cys145 and the n of the amide bridge connecting the chloropyridin-2yl and the methoxybenzyl rings of the molecule his41 of the s2 subsite forms pi interactions with the carbons of the methoxyphenyl ring the nn-dimethylbenzimidamide moiety placed in the area of the s4 subsite strongly contributes to complex stabilization via the hydrophobic interaction between met165 and the phenyl ring as well as by hydrogen bond formation between the amino acids arg188 thr190 and gln192 and the n of the nn-dimethylbenzimidamide moiety figure 5in general there is a great variety between the groups placed at the s1 or s2 subsites of the enzyme as concluded by our results and the literature 121315 most of the amino acids involved in complex stabilization of the natural substrate and the peptide analogues 2234 participate in interactions with the studied compounds as well however the substantial interaction with his163 in peptidomimetic complexes is not observed in the interaction pattern of the most potent compounds different structures may offer the possibility of interaction with the crucial amino acids of the sars-cov-2 active site contributing to complex stability however the right distances between polar hda hydrophobicaromatic moieties constitute important features of each structureaccording to docking analysis all active molecules are long enough to interact simultaneously with amino acids surrounding glu166 cys145 and amino acids in the vicinity of thr25 and his41 and contain several hydrophobic and aromatic moieties as well as hydrogen bond donoracceptor groups capable of hydrogen bond formation and polar interactions the enzyme amino acids involved in hydrogen bond formation are glu166 pro168 gln189 arg188 thr24 thr25 thr26 his41 cys44 ser46 asn142 gly143 cys145 his164 thr190 and glu192 figure 3 figure 4 figure 5 figure 6 and figure 7 apart from the polar and hydrophobic interactions at least two hydrogen bonds are formed in the case of the most active compounds while interactions with phe140 were also involved in complex stabilization of argatrobanthe most promising compounds of all categories contain multiple hydrophobic moieties as well as polarhydrogen donoracceptor moieties the most active molecules of the categories of gliptines and previrs are relatively long molecules and adopt linear conformationshydrophobic moieties at distances of approximately 9  11  14  and 16  are present in all potent compounds met165 his41 cys44 cys145 leu167 of the mpro active site are mainly involved in hydrophobic and pi interactions with a maximum distance between them of approximately 18  figure 3 figure 4 figure 5 figure 6 and figure 7 polar or hydrogen donoracceptor moieties are present at multiple distances with a distance of 8  being common in active compounds glu166 and his 41 at a distance of approximately 13  participate in hydrogen bond and polar interactions of the most potent gliptins figure 3 and figure 6 while ser46 thr25 and asn142 at a distance of approximately 12  participate in hydrogen bond formation of faldaprevir in the sars-cov-2 protease amino acids involved in hydrophobic and polar interactions are distributed in all the active sites although pi interactions are mostly observed at the region of his41 distances of approximately 5  9  11  and 16  are observed between amino acids participating in polar and hydrophobic interactionsamino acids with hydrophobic or polarhydrogen donor acceptor properties exist at similar distances at the active sites of the initial target of these compounds dpp-4 and the hcv protease respectivelyfor example in the case of the gliptins initial target dpp-4 a great number of tyrosine amino acids are present at the active site as shown in the case of teneligliptin figure 6 the amino acids tyr586 phe355 tyr667 tyr667 ty548 and tyr632 are involved in hydrophobic and pi interactions with distances among them varying between 8  and 19  the amino acids arg123 glu203 glu204 ser631 tyr633 and asn711 are involved in polar interactions and hydrogen bond formation all hydrophobic interactions originate from amino acids oriented at the same moiety of the active site while the amino acids participating in polar interaction are placed in the other moiety distances between 11 and 18  are observed between amino acids of the active site participating in polar and hydrophobic interactions the length of the molecules the great number of polar and hydrophobic groups the flexibility of the molecules and the appropriate distances between characteristic groups seem to favor binding of gliptins at the mpro active site a higher binding energy was estimated for the smaller molecule alogliptin figure 7in the case of thrombin inhibitors a number of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions mainly stabilize the complex his41 ser46 and met49 participate in hydrogen bond formation between melagatran and mpro enzyme while leu27 his41 met49 and cys145 are involved in hydrophobic interactions although these interactions lead to a substantially low estimated binding energy of the compound the significantly higher hydrogen bonds pi bonds polar and hydrophobic interactions may be responsible for the much better prediction results for binding to the initial protease target ala189 ala190 gly219 cys191 cys220 trp215 his 57 and leu99 seem to be involved in binding to thrombinthe evaluated compounds were approved drugs currently on the market with the exception of four compounds which were under phase iii trial table 4 there are several compounds among the most promising ones which are characterized as well-tolerated or having no side effects such as danoprevir and sovaprevir of the hcv protease inhibitors teneligliptin and gemigliptin but also trelagliptin evogliptin and gosogliptin among the dpp-4 inhibitors inogatran and melagatran of -thrombin inhibitorsthe dpp-4 inhibitors developed for the treatment of diabetes type ii as well as the -thrombin and factor xa inhibitors used as anti-coagulants may not be appropriate for patients who do not suffer such problems however they may be worth consideration for patients already being treated for type ii diabetes or with anti-coagulants moreover higher platelet count and increased coagulation features are observed in covid-19 patients with severe pneumonia compared to patients with non sars-cov-2-induced pneumonia furthermore according to recent results anti-coagulant treatment by heparin administration reduced mortality of covid-19 patients with severe pneumonia and markedly elevated d-dimers 35in general the results can be considered as promising for some of the evaluated drugs and could be useful for scientists working in the field in vitro evaluation is also within our future targets if the recombinant sars-cov-2 protease becomes available in the marketthe 3d

flexible method 3637docking analysis was carried out on a molecular docking server using autodock 3839 as previously described 32 the lamarckian genetic algorithm lga and the solis and wets local search method 40 were used for the docking simulation during docking all rotatable torsions were released autodock parameter set- and distance-dependent dielectric functions were used in the calculation of the van der waals and the electrostatic terms respectively100 different runs that were set to terminate after a maximum of 2500000 energy evaluations were performed in each docking experiment the population size was set to 150 a translational step of 02  and quaternion and torsion steps of 5 were applied during the search docking analysis of the hcv protease and the hiv-1 protease presented in table 3 was performed using autodock42 via ligandscout among the values calculated by the program is the estimated free binding energy which is an indicator of the probability of the compounds to form a stable complex with the selected enzyme target and consequently the probability to be effective enzyme inhibitorsthe protein structures chosen from the protein data bank and the docking center and docking box chosen for each docking analysis were as follows for docking analysis of the sars-cov-2 main protease enzyme the structure 6lu7 of the enzyme in a complex with the competitive inhibitor n3 xavlxx n-5-methylisoxazol-3-ylcarbonylalanyl-l-valyl-l-n1-1r2z-4-benzyloxy-4-oxo-1 -3r-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-ylmethylbut-2-enyl-l-leucinamide 3435 was used this was the first enzyme structure in complex with an inhibitor that was released in the protein data bank on march 18th 2020 and was the only one available when the preliminary docking studies of this research were performed although the enzyme is in the form of a dimer of identical subunits only one subunit was available in the form of a pdb file at the pubmed structure the docking center was kept at x  1046 y  41037 and z  73009 and the docking box was set at x  30 y  40 and z  25 to surround the binding site of the inhibitor active site of the enzymefor active compounds the docking was repeated extending the docking box to cover the whole enzyme to ensure that the compound does not preferentially bind to other sites of the enzyme instead of the active site 32for better estimation of the probable inhibitory effect of the selected compounds a second protein structure of the sars-cov-2 protease complexed with the inhibitor 567-trihydroxy-2-phenyl-4h-chromen-4-one was also used pdb id 6m2n in this structure both subunits were included in the pdb file and the whole enzyme constructed by the two identical subunits was used the use of the two subunit form was preferred as it could enable the evaluation of a probable interference of the second subunit in binding of the inhibitors since glu166 which commonly participates in complex stabilization interacts with ser1 of the other protein chain the docking center was set at x  6173 y  3518 z  2326 and the docking box was set at x  20 y  20 z  20for comparison reasons the estimated binding energy of the compounds to their initial

preparation for the evaluation of the docking method the initial ligand was docked to the enzyme and the position was compared with its initial position at the complex examples of the similarity of the two positions are shown at figure 8the 3d structure alignment of the sars-cov-2 main protease with the hiv-1 and hcv viral proteases as well as with the human proteases dpp-4 thrombin coagulation factor xa renin and ace showed greater similarity with the hcv protease and with thrombin this finding in combination with the fact that these two proteases preferentially cleave before ser like sars-cov-2 protease enhances the possibility of finding effective sars-cov-2 inhibitors among the approved anti-hcv protease and anti-thrombin inhibitors docking analysis of 34 approved or phase iii trial protease inhibitors to the sars-cov-2 protease revealed several drugs that may act as sars-cov-2 protease inhibitors within the classes of the hcv protease dpp-4 -thrombin and coagulation factor xa inhibitors twenty five of them exhibited estimated binding energy lower than the reference inhibitor n3 and twenty one lower than 800 kcal mol1 several of the most promising compounds are approved drugs characterized as well tolerated in subjects compared to lopinavir and ritonavir most of the evaluated compounds showed better results as characterized by lower predicted free binding energy and high preference for binding to the active site compared to other sites of the enzyme these promising in silico results encourage further evaluation for in vitro and in vivo anti-viral activity the dpp-4 inhibitors developed for the treatment of type ii diabetes as well as -thrombin and factor xa inhibitors used as anti-coagulants may not be appropriate for patients who do not suffer such problems but may be useful for patients who need such treatment it is worth mentioning that diabetic patients belong to the high-risk group for this virus while anti-coagulant therapy has been proposed for covid-19 patients with severe pneumoniacoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and since the initiation of the pandemic it has caused globally hundreds of thousands of deaths 1 while the majority of people with covid-19 wont require hospitalization being asymptomatic or with mild symptoms for those who need the clinical features may evolve to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and cardiac injury major risk factors for developing severe symptoms is age sex with a prevalence in males as well as obesity diabetes hypertension and respiratory or cardiovascular diseases 23 as no covid-19 specific drugs are available 4 a better understanding of the underlying covid-19 pathobiology is requiredat the molecular level sars-cov-2 entry into target cells is facilitated by the spike s protein of the coronavirus sars-cov-2 infection starts with binding to zinc metallopeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 which enables viral attachment to the surface of target cells an additional step refers to s protein priming by the transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 56 fig 1
 reportedly furin protease is also likely involved in the sars-cov-2 infection process 7 these processes are similar to those used for sars-cov transmissibility 8 notably as for sars-cov where the endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsins bl ctsb ctsl are also needed for viral cell entry 89 ammonium chloride treatment strongly inhibited sars-cov-2 cell entry into tmprss2- 293t cells suggesting that sars-cov-2 can likely use either tmprss2 or ctsbl for cell infection 5 tmprss2 expression in lung tissues may be a determinant of viral tropism and pathogenicity at the initial site of sars-cov-2 infection 10 and as for sars-cov 11 it may reduce viral control by the humoral immune response notably in common with sars-cov sars-cov-2 infection is enhanced by tmprss2 10ace2 is a critical component of the renin-angiotensin system ras which plays a key role in maintaining blood pressure homeostasis as well as fluid and salt balance 12 the components of the system mainly include renin angiotensinogen agt angiotensin ii angii angiotensin converting enzyme ace angiotensin ii type 1 receptor at1r and angiotensin ii type 2 receptor at2r fig 1 angii is generated by angi from ace and is a key effector peptide of the system causing vasoconstriction ras overactivation has been implicated among others in the induction and progression of hypertension atherosclerosis diabetes heart failure renovascular disorders pulmonary hypertension and fibrosis pneumonia and sepsis 1314 ace2 a highly homologous to ace metalloprotease functions as a negative regulator of the agt system as it reduces angii levels by producing the sorter ang1-7 and ang1-9 peptides which can then activate the anti-inflammatory and vasodilation-promoting receptor mas masr fig 1 14 recombinant ace2 protects mice from severe acute lung failure and loss of ace2 expression is likely involved in increased vascular permeability one of the hallmarks in ards pathogenesis 15 ace2 also links amino acid malnutrition to intestinal inflammation as it is a key regulator of dietary amino acid homeostasis innate immunity and gut microbial ecology 16 overall the balance between the aceangiiat1r and the counter-regulatory ace2ang17masr axes is critical in the physiological regulation of neural cardiovascular blood pressure and kidney functions 17although ace2 expression seems to correlate with susceptibility to sars-cov infection in cell assays and it is downregulated by sars-cov 18 the relationship between ace2 expression levels and the susceptibly to sars-cov-2 infection remains elusive also it is not clear whether sars-cov-2 infection interferes with ace2 expression nonetheless it is logical to assume that high ace2 expression levels andor the simultaneous co-expression of the ace2 tmprss2 and ctsbl proteins in sars-cov-2 targeted tissuescells may lead to higher risk for sars-cov-2 infection to get more insights on this issue we mapped ace2 tmprss2 ctsb and ctsl genes and corresponding proteins expression in human tissues and pathology as well in response to sars-cov-2 used therapeutic treatments by analyzing expression datasets from geo arrayexpress and protein atlas databases our findings provide a rational explanation for most of the clinical features of covid-19in this gene expression profiling meta-analysis study the ace2 ace2 entrez id 59272 ensembl ensg00000130234 and tmprss2 tmprss2 entrez id 7113 ensembl ensg00000184012 genes related microarray datasets were retrieved from ncbi and arrayexpress databases the selection of datasets from ncbi or arrayexpress was based on the terms homo sapiens organism ace2 gene symbol or tmprss2 gene symbol respectively along with additional data filtering for updown genes in the differential expression search filter in geo profiles of ncbi the ncbi and arrayexpress databases were also searched for currently investigated therapeutic approaches against covid-19 eg interferon-beta ifn- remdesivir lopinavir ritonavir chloroquinehydroxychloroquine and a number of immunosuppressants and the terms ace2 gene symbol or tmprss2 gene symbol the records collected after database search include 63 ace2 150 tmprss2 36 ifn- 34 chloroquine and 13 hydroxychloroquine entriesfollowing the removal of duplicate entries from the ncbi and array express databases the unique datasets n250 were collected additional datasets were excluded by eliminating the non-geo entries n69 and those n26 with insufficient data specifically datasets were excluded if these were non-geo entries or if a very low number of samples per statecondition was provided thus the requirements of geo2r tool were not met gene expression analysis of the 155 selected datasets was performed using the ncbi provided geo2r tool aiming to identify differential expression of the genes of interest ie ace2 tmprss2 ctsb and ctsl across different experimental conditions statistically significant cases p-value 005 were chosen for visualization see prisma flowchart fig s1 19additional information about the expression levels of ace2 tmprss2 ctsb and ctsl genes and proteins across human tissues and recorded pathologies was gathered from the human protein atlas database finally the terms ace2 tmprss2 ctsb and ctsl were searched in kegg pathways and the found pathwaysmolecules were used to screen drugbank for drugs at various phases of development that modulate identified kegg pathwaysdifferential regulation of the sars-cov-2 spike protein receptor ace2 and of the priming protease tmprss2 genes in geo and arrayexpress databasesgiven that sars-cov-2 infection rate in human cells likely depends on the expression levels of its receptor ace2 and the priming protease tmprss2 we initially performed an expression profiling meta-analysis at the geo and arrayexpress microarrays databases we found that the ace2 gene is significantly less expressed in venous vs arterial endothelial cells in biopsies of patients with nephrosclerosis a hypoxia-related glomerulopathy as well as in various biological settings following treatment with lipopolysaccharides tumor necrosis factor tnf and interleukins -4 il-4 and -13 il-13 fig 2

a table s3 for ace2 and tmprss2 genes very low expression levels were found in brain and blood tissues as well as in most cell lines studied on the contrary high ace2 and tmprss2 genes co-expression was found in kidney gallbladder colon duodenum small intestine salivary and thyroid glands also the ace2 gene is highly expressed in heart and in testissimilarly according to protein atlas database the ace2 protein is expressed in adrenal gland and testis and in high levels at the gastrointestinal tract while tmprss2 in highly expressed in kidney and in the gastrointestinal tract fig s3 table s4 a notable observation in these analyses was again a tendency for a positive correlation of the ace2 and tmprss2 genes expression patterns fig 3b thus an intervention that modulates either ace2 or tmprss2 expression would likely also affect the non-targeted generegulation of the ace2 tmprss2 ctsb and ctsl genes following treatment with ifn1- chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine and screening of kegg pathways and drugbank for the identification of possible anti covid-19 treatmentsgiven that a number of combinational therapeutic schemes 4 are currently being prioritized for covid-19 treatment we also performed a more focused search in geo and arrayexpress databases for these drugs and the ace2 tmprss ctsbl genes our findings are shown in fig 4
see also tables s5s7 and refer to experiments containing information for ifn- chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine interestingly ifn- significantly induced ace2 gene expression in bronchial epithelial cells fig 4a table s5 on the other hand chloroquine administration in hiv-infected patients tended non-significant to induce ctbs gene expression likely due to a negative feedback loop aiming to restore physiological cathepsins activity fig 4b table s6 finally hydroxychloroquine suppressed ace2 and tmprss2 genes expression and induced ctsb and ctsl genes expression in pbmc cells of systemic lupus erythematosus patients fig 4c table s7we then analyzed kegg pathways modulated by ace2 tmprss2 and ctsbl and found ace2 to be involved in renin-angiotensin system and protein digestion tmprss2 in transcriptional mis-regulation in cancer prostate cancer and influenza a and ctsbl in renin secretion antigen processingpresentation autophagy lysosome phagosome apoptosis nod-like receptor signaling pathway proteoglycans in cancer rheumatoid arthritis fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis table s8 modules of these pathways were used to probe drugbank in order to identify drugs experimental in trials or approved that target components of these pathways we also searched for clathrin-mediated endocytosis- actin- and tubulin-polymerization inhibitors tables s9s26 see also fig 1 a number of potentially usable drugs include anti-androgens or ar inhibitors vasodilators tnf blockers or interleukins activity modulators tables s9s26our findings indicate that the major cellular components ie ace2 tmprss2 and ctsbl that enable sars-cov-2 infection in human cells are widely expressed in human tissues being enriched in kidney heart as well as in the tissues of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract with minimal expression for ace2 and tmprss2 genes levels in brain and blood cells these data are in accordance to recent similar approaches focused solely on the ace2 gene 2021 regarding lung a primary site of infection it was recently found that both the ace2 and tmprss2 genes are primarily expressed in bronchial transient secretory cells 22 it was also found that sars-cov-2 entry factors are highly expressed in nasal epithelial cells 23 the enrichment of all sars-cov-2 infection-related cellular components in the gastrointestinal tract explain diarrhoea and sars-cov-2 sustained isolation from stool as a major symptom of covid-19 224 and suggest that the intestine may represent a major entry site for the virus due to consumption of contaminated food considering that ace2 expression correlates with sars-cov the close relative of sars-cov-2 infection rate in cells 1518 it is likely that even in patients with no underlying morbidities most major human organs are potentially vulnerable to covid-19in addition of tissuesorgans enrichment to ace2 tmprss2 and ctsbl genes expression we also found that the ace2 likely as a counterbalancing anti-inflammatory response and tmprss2 genes are induced in various pro-inflammatory conditions including obesity barretts esophagus stomach infection by helicobacter pylori diabetes autoimmune diseases and oxidized ldl several of these morbidities have been already recognized as risk factors for severe disease and death 2 while others indicate novel possible risk factors for severe covid-19 notably in the particular biological settings assayed these genes were induced by exhaustive and likely moderate exercise as well as by cigarette smoke growth factors viruses infections and interferons see below we also found a strong positive regulation by androgens largely explaining the increased sensitivity of men to covid-19 2in high-risk covid-19 conditions like hypertension respiratory disease and cardiovascular disease the aceangiiat1r axis is overactive and likely ace2 expression and thus sars-cov-2 available binding sites increases when patients are treated with drugs that suppress aceangiiat1r eg at1r blockers 25 so when a hypertensive patient is infected by sars-cov-2 it is in high risk simply because the aceangiiat1r is overactive but partly suppressed by at1r blockers and ace2 is overexpressed the infection by sars-cov-2 likely eliminates the ace2ang17masr regulatory axis fig 1 leading to sudden exaggeration of the aceangiiat1r activity causing thus ards and at the systemic level among others kidney and cardiac failure fig 5
 indeed sars-cov infection in mice downregulates ace2 protein but not ace contributing to severe lung injury 12 also loss of ace2 expression and locally increased angii production triggers leakage of pulmonary blood vessels through at1r stimulation in ards 15 interestingly in a model of nanoparticles-mediated lung injury due to direct binding to ace2 that led to suppression of ace2 activity and expression levels the administration of losartan an at1r antagonist can ameliorate nanoparticles-induced lung injury 26since ace2 tmprss2 and ctsbl genes are widely expressed in human tissues eg heart and kidney leakage of pulmonary blood vessels during ards fig 5 would likely allow virus spreading in the circulation enabling direct infection of these organs decreased ace2ang17masr activity and systemic failure although there is likely no detectable viremia ie infectious virus in plasma during asymptomatic infection or prior to clinical disease 27 sars-cov-2 rna has been detected in blood donations from patients with mild symptoms 28 and detectable sars-cov-2 viral rna in blood is a strong indicator for further clinical severity 24 overall and since aging another risk factor for covid-19 correlates with increased ace1ace2 ratio in a rat model 29 high risk covid-19 patients or even not hypertensive patients as a prophylactic measure should likely receive additional ras inhibitors to decrease systemic damage riskgiven the delicate balance between the aceangiiat1r and ace2ang17masr regulatory axes along with the aforementioned morbidities being induced due to disruption of this balance in favor of aceangiiat1r activation the development of effective covid-19 therapeutics seems particularly puzzling specifically covid-19 is a two-phase disease namely a infection and spreading life cycle of the virus fig 1  -  in the respiratory and likely gastrointestinal tracts and b ards induction which can then lead to systemic failure fig 5  -  thus as it is seemingly both the virus and the uncontrolled response of a patients immune system that promote lethality effective treatments thus should probe both the life cycle and the side-effects induced by sars-cov-2 current under investigation or in clinical trials therapeutics for covid-19 include azithromycin bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor chloroquinehydroxy-chloroquine lysosomotropic agents inhibiting the activity of endosomallysosomal compartments lopinavirlavipiravirremdesivir antiviral drugs and ocilizumab a humanized monoclonal antibody against the il-6 receptor 4 for alternatives andor additional combinatorial approaches we searched kegg pathways for the ace2 tmprss2 ctsb and ctsl terms figs s3s5 and drugbank for agents at various phases of development tables s9s23 that target modules of the found pathways additional information for clathrin-mediated endocytosis as well as for actin or tubulin polymerization inhibitors in shown in tables s24s26for targeting the virus life cycle the magic bullet will be the development of an effective vaccine here cell lines that express ace2 see fig 3a2 table s3 and facilitate viral replication may be most efficient in large-scale vaccine production in another approach soluble ace2 eg rhace2 apn01 gsk2586881 can be likely used to neutralize the virus by competitive binding and also rescue cellular ace2 activitytowards blocking sars-cov-2 binding to ace2 or reducing available binding sites by ace2 downregulation possible approaches may involve a antibodies or small molecules that target ace2 eg ssaa09e2 which blocks early interactions of sars-cov with ace2 30 or b tnf androgen or ar inhibitors see tables s9s26 as we found that these interventions can strongly suppress ace2 and tmprss2 genes expression yet given the anticipated toxic effects of systemic loss-of ace2 activity whatever intervention should be transient and with constant monitoring of the clinical output an alternative and likely safer as compared to ace2 inhibition approach would be the usage of tmprss2 specific inhibitors tmrpss2 is druggable and camostat mesylate partially blocked sars-cov-2 entry into caco-2 and vero-tmprss2 cells 5 additional benefits of tmrpss2 inhibition would be the reduced viral tropism at the initial site of sars-cov-2 infection and enhanced humoral immune responses see above next steps to be targeted at the sars-cov-2 life cycle include membrane fusion and clathrin-mediated endocytosis here the clathrin-mediated endocytosis inhibitor ikarugamycin 31 the dynamin inhibitor dynasore or its analogs 32 or the actin depolymerizing drug latrunculin b 33 can be tested in preclinical models also ssaa09e3 prevents fusion of the viral membrane with the host cellular membrane in a sars-cov infection model 30 intracellularly novel sars-cov-2 specific antiviral drugs will target the sars-cov-2 main protease due to its essential role in processing the polyproteins that are translated from the viral rna 34 alternatively existing antiviral can be tested as according to molecular docking studies they bind tightly to rna dependent rna polymerase 35other intracellular components of the virus life cycle that can be targeted include tubulin andor ctsbl fig 1 for the former colchicine a tubulin polymerization inhibitor 36 is a promising at least in patients with ards 37 drug while for the latter chloroquine or hydroxy-chloroquine are already used against covid-19 38 yet in spite of promising clinical data obtained for chloroquinehydroxy-chloroquine which could also relate to reduced renin production fig s4 these lysosomotropic agents inhibit the activity of endosomallysosomal compartments non-specifically thus existing ctsbl specific inhibitors some of which are of endogenous origin and function as regulators of cathepsin b activity in the cell such as the cystatins 39 can be be also considered notably cathepsins bl activity increases significantly with age 40 and has been associated with arterial stiffening and atherosclerotic vascular disease 41 these observations further support the notion that age and cardiac dysfunction are risk factors for covid-19 at the dark side of inhibiting the acidic cellular endosomal compartments or ctsbl is their functional involvement in mhc class ii antigen ag presentation fig 1 42 thus the usage of chloroquinehydroxychloroquine ctsbl specific inhibitors or even the excessive contamination of the endosomal compartments by the virus itself could suppress mhc class ii antigen ag presentation this functional output along with the presence of o-linked glycans at the surface of the virus 43 could result in immunoevasion in this case clearance of the virus may proceed via proteasome-mediated mhc-i related ag presentation fig 1 44 and the activity of specific immune cells eg nk cells proteasome is downregulated during aging 45 and is less responsive to ifn- 46 which would then result in reduced ag presentation in mhc i molecules and consequently reduced immune responses fig 1 in the elderly in this context drugs andor small molecules that activate proteasome could provide useful additive therapeutics against covid-19 our previous high-throughput screenings for the identification of natural products modulating proteostatic pathways has revealed promising candidates that exert anti-oxidant activity and a parallel combinatorial action as ctsbl inhibitors and proteasome activators unpublished datain relation to phase 2 of the disease ie ards induction and the cytokine storm which can then lead to systemic failure 47 along with the downregulation of ace2 due to sars-cov-2 infection we propose that the use of the ang1-7 peptide or non-peptide analogs could bypass the loss of ace2 and reactivate the anti-inflammatoryvasodilatory masr signaling pathway fig 1 in support ang1-7 protects endothelial cells from high glucose-induced injury and inflammation 48 improves the action of insulin 49 and has shown protective action in heart failure 50 and stroke 51 due to the likely covid-19 infection-mediated overactivation of the pro-oxidative aceangiiat1r axis which can then promote endothelial dysfunction due to dysbalanced nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species ratios in the vessel wall 52 the use of drugs that activate anti-oxidant cellular defenses or act as radicals scavengers could be an additional prophylactic intervention finally regarding covid-19 induced cytokine storm ie the uncontrolled systemic inammatory response resulting from the release of large amounts of pro-inammatory cytokines 247 the idea of inhibiting key pro-inflammatory cytokines eg the il-6 receptor by tocilizumab makes sense 47 obviously however an excessive inhibition of the immune system by corticosteroids should be avoided 53 our findings that interferons and especially ifn- and ifn- induce the ace2 gene figs 2a 4 tables s1 and s5 indicate that their therapeutic activationp could upregulate the bindings sites and hence infection rates of the virus in targeted tissues thus the regulation of the ace2 tmprss2 and ctsbl genes from immune system key effector molecules should be studied in detailsin conclusion our data indicate possible novel high-risk groups for covid-19 they also provide a rich resource for a future investigations of covid-19 pathogenesis and b possible

clinical studies focusing on primary and secondary hemostasis during hantavirus disease showed thrombocytopenia in both hfrs and hcps a decreased plasma activity of coagulation factors ii v viii ix and x in acute hfrs patients prolongation of the prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin time increased thrombin generation and d-dimer levels and a decrease in adamts13 activity in acute puuv patients lee 1987 mackow and gavrilovskaya 2009 laine et al 2011 mustonen et al 2013 the ability to infect endothelial cells by hantaviruses has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo yanagihara and silverman 1990 pensiero et al 1992 toro et al 1998 although infection does not lead to cytopathic changes several studies observed endothelial cell dysfunction during hantavirus

endothelial cells han et al 2010 krautkramer et al 2014 to increased permeability and decreased huvec integrin ligand migration in vitro gavrilovskaya et al 2002 geimonen et al 2002 taylor et al 2013integrin 3 experimentally proven to be the receptor for hantavirus infection is abundantly present on the surface of endothelial cells gavrilovskaya et al 1999 song et al 2005 infection with pathogenic hantaviruses is suggested to result in the loss of function of the 3 integrin wang et al 2012 but also an increased 3 expression on cultured endothelial cells and platelets has been observed liu et al 2008 furthermore gavrilovskaya et al 2010 studied the adherence of quiescent platelets to sin nombre and hantaan virus infected endothelial cells seems to be the result of virus binding to the 3 integrin present on platelets gavrilovskaya et al 2010how the abnormalities in the primary thrombocytopenia and secondary hemostasis increase in thrombin generation and raised d-dimer levels are induced in puuv infected patients and the mechanism by which old-world hantaviruses cause hemorrhage andor renal failure remain largely elusive vaheri et al 2013b lack of specific treatment and an effective vaccine makes understanding of the pathophysiology of hantavirus infection an important medical need especially with the recently discovered association of puuv with cardiovascular

polyclonal anti-cd3 1500 served as an isotype controlto test if changes in cd41a expression was related to direct binding between puuv and platelets a mechanism shown in hantaan and andes virus

incubation step with puuv or vsv followed by a hantavirus detection antibody mouse mab anti-puuv-glycoprotein 1500 after washing substrate reaction was achieved by conjugate addition and tmb reaction steps as a final step we studied the potential blocking of platelet binding by puuv particles by the addition of a blocking step with polyclonal human anti puuv serum puuv coated plates and plates coated with 5 days old virus free veroe6 medium were incubated with a polyclonal puuv serum 150 from a case described in goeijenbier et al 2011 or with a puuv igg negative control human serum from a

between multiple groups non-parametric kruskal-wallis test was used with dunns multiple comparison test or a one-way anova with tukeys multiple comparisons test depending on the distribution of the datap 005 were considered significantto prevent puuv from in vitro loss of virulence virus stocks of not more than four passages were prepared freshly isolated huvec were infected with moi 05 and 3 the puuv infected and replicated in huvec as is summarized in figure 1 non-infected cells figures 1ab showed no red peroxidase staining confirming specificity of the puuv-staining from 24 h post infection with a low moi infection 05 onward figure 1c only a small percentage 10 of the cells were infected which strongly increased after 48 h figure 1d resulting in 50 of infected stained cells twenty-four hours after infection at a moi of 3 about 4050 of cells were infected figure 1e which increased further to 80 by 48 h figure 1f comparable kinetics were seen when viral rna copy numbers were determined to this end viral rna numbers were estimated both in supernatant figure 1g and cell lysate figure 1h at both mois the number of viral rna increased significantly 2-log after 48 h kruskal-wallis p  00028 in the supernatant as well as in the cell lysate confirming active viral replication viral replication reached a plateau at 72 h post infectionfurthermore western-blot analysis of the cell lysate for puuv nucleoprotein confirmed infection of huvec figure 1 the viral copy numbers in the supernatant or cell lysate of huvec incubated with bpl inactivated virus served as a control for non-replicating virus consistently the rna copy numbers did not increase over time indicating the efficient inactivation of the virus by bpl treatment efficient inactivation was confirmed by negative ipox staining of the huvec incubated with bpl inactivated puuv data not showngavrilovskaya et al 2010 reported the potential of hantaan and andes virus to bind quiescent platelets via 3 integrin since this observation is of much importance in further understanding the alterations in primary hemostasis and its role in disease mechanisms in hfrs we decided to confirm this mechanism for puuv using a different approach first we assessed the ability of quiescent platelets to bind to puuv infected huvec figure 2 binding of platelets was determined by measuring the intensity of cd41a platelet glycoprotein iib a heterodimeric integral membrane protein present only on platelets and megakaryocytes cd41a expression was significantly higher on the huvec monolayer after infection with a moi of 05 or 3 compared to the control detection of cd41a expression did not differ when platelets were not added to the huvec monolayers suggesting that there was no non-specific anti-cd41a binding to infected cells furthermore there was no difference in od values when an isotype control anti-cd3 was used to detect platelets based on cd41a expression statistically significant differences were measured between infected wells and wells incubated with virus free veroe6 medium negative control at 24 h post infection one way anova moi 3 vs neg p  001 moi 05 vs neg p  005 after 48 h of infection this difference in cd41a expression was also significant between moi 3 infected wells and the bpl inactivated virus control one way anova moi 3 vs neg p  0001 and moi 3 vs bpl p  0001 moi 05 vs neg p  005 taken together the data indicate that platelets bind to cultures incubated with puuv huvec incubated with bpl did show a trend to increased platelet cd41a expression figure 2 but this was not statistically significantwe measured vwf antigen in cell free supernatant and vwf expression on the surface of infected huvec increased vwf production may be a general inflammatory response of endothelial cells that could be evoked as a result of puuv infection however at the time points where platelet binding increased huvecs infected with puuv showed no alteration in vwf activity as determined by elisa in neither the supernatant nor the cell lysate data not shown compared to bpl or negative controlnext we looked whether the platelets could bind directly to puuv particles for this purpose we performed an in-house developed platelet pull down-assay using quiescent platelets to this end several experiments were conducted to demonstrate specificity of this binding figure 3 shows results of binding of platelets to virus-coated elisa plates figure 3a more platelets mannwhitney u p  00022 adhered to plates directly coated with puuv compared to plates coated with a virus control vsv which was cultured under the same conditions as puuvsubsequently to control if the binding of platelets was directly to the puuv particles and not due to another factor present in the veroe6 supernatant we made use of a sandwich elisa principle puuv was incubated on elisa plates with wells coated with a monoclonal igg2 specific for the glycoprotein of puuv or with a igg2 control antibody by this approach significantly more platelets bound to the wells where puuv was captured compared to wells with no puuv capture mannwhitney u p  00022 figure 3bto confirm direct binding between platelets and puuv platelets were captured to anti-cd41 coated elisa plates and incubated with virus followed by detection with a puuv specific antibody to control for binding between puuv detection antibody and captured platelets control wells were incubated with vsv puuv detection was significantly higher in the wells incubated with puuv compared to vsv mannwhitney u p  00043 figure 3c these experiments collectively suggest that platelets can specifically bind to puuvfinally we show in figure 3d that the binding of platelets to puuv particles could be blocked by addition of a blocking step with human serum from a recovered puuv case when wells coated with puuv were incubated with human serum with proven puuv neutralizing igg antibodies significantly less platelets adhered to the wells compared to wells incubated with a puuv negative human control serum figure 3d p  0001 the anti-cd41 expression in the wells with a blocking step was comparable to that of the negative control which consisted out of plates coated with 5 days old vero e6 virus free medium binding of the neutralizing igg antibodies was confirmed by incubation with a goat-anti human hrp labeled conjugate and subsequent tmb reactionto test the hypothesis whether increased thrombin generation observed in acute puuv patients is the result of increased tf expression on endothelial cells we incubated huvec infected with puuv at a moi of 3 or with a virus free 5 days old vero e6 medium control with a polyclonal anti-tf antibody by this approach we showed that tf expression was significantly increased with an almost twofold increase in od value 48 h post infection figure 4a mannwhitney u p  00047 cells infected with puuv also showed an increased tf concentration when the cell lysates of puuv infected wells were compared to the lysates of control wells figure 4b both mock and bpl subsequently we wanted to prove that the increase in tf expression on the endothelial cell surface was of biological significance and would led to increased thrombin generation thrombin generation was quantified directly on infected endothelial cells by incubating normal plasma on cells and initiating coagulation by the addition of calcium ions infected cells induced plasma clotting faster due to increased thrombin generation figures 4cd using a calibration curve with purified tf in the absence of endothelial cells we quantified huvec tf production after virus infection and after incubation with a virus free medium control tf concentration showed a statistically significant increase for moi 3 at 24 h compared to the negative control and the huvec infected with moi 05 one way anova p  001 and at 48 h post infection compared to the negative control one way anova p  0001 the moi 05 infection led to higher levels of tf on the huvec surface only after 48 h post infection one way anova p  005 when compared to mockimportant proteins in the regulation of fibrinolysis show close interactions with the pathogenic hantavirus receptor 3 integrin for instance vitronectin a stabilizer of pai-1 activity in plasma is largely regulated by this receptor mackow and gavrilovskaya 2009 florova et al 2013 to study potential changes in regulators of fibrinolysis we first measured pai-1 levels in the cell-free supernatant and supernatant of cell lysate from 24-well plates infected with puuv or control infections the total pai-1 antigen the combination of levels in the supernatant and cell lysate was significantly increased 48 h post infection kruskalwallis p  005 with moi 3 figure 5a subsequently we tested if in our model pai-1 would bind to vitronectin since this binding is associated with increasedprolonged pai-1 activity seiffert and loskutoff 1991 and if this interaction is altered during infection elisa plates coated with a monoclonal antibody against vitronectin incubated with supernatant from our experiments pooled control or from moi 3 infected wells followed by incubation with pai-1 antibody suggested formation of pai-1 vitronectin complexes due to an increase in od compared to incubation with pbs mean expression in medium 490 mod 100 vs 370 mod 70 p  002 if supernatants were tested separately puuv vs mock levels of pai-1 vitronectin complexes were increased after puuv infection mannwhitney u p  003 figure 5bthe present study addresses platelet binding to puuv infected cells and activation of secondary hemostasis after endothelial cell puuv infection with the lack of a valid and accessible animal model for old-world hantavirus infection we remain dependent on ex vivo cell culture models to address questions regarding virulence and pathogenesis vaheri et al 2013b taking into account the recently found association of puuv infection with cardiovascular disease connolly-andersen et al 2014 and hemorrhagic complications that may occur during infection the interaction between puuv and the coagulation system especially warrants further attention since puuv tends to rapidly lose virulence upon in vitro cell passages the use of low passaged isolates is of vital importance nemirov et al 2003 therefore we have put a lot of emphasis on obtaining low passage puuv isolates and optimisation of the hemostatic assays under the right biosafety regulations using primary cell culturesbased on hemostatic changes seen in several clinical studies most from northern europe we decided to study specific parts of the coagulation system in vitro we started by studying the effects of puuv infection on formation of a platelet plug the major event in primary hemostasis binding of platelets by puuv infected cells could explain thrombocytopenia in acute puuv patients since it would result in wasting or loss of platelets adhered to these cells gavrilovskaya et al 2010 laine et al 2011 especially if we make notice of the ability of hantaviruses to infect megakaryocytes and thereby lead to a decreased production of platelets in addition to the loss of platelets adhered to infected cells liang et al 2004 lutteke et al 2010 in our model it seems that puuv infection increases binding of platelets to the surface of huvec compared to control cells figure 2 here we assumed increased cd41a expression observed in the first experiments was the result of an increased number of platelets on the huvec theoretically increased cd41a detection could also be due to an increased expression of cd41a on platelets after 30 min incubation with infected huvec rather than an actual increase in platelet numbers while we cannot rule this out based on our experiments we blocked extrinsic platelet activation by prostaglandin treatment making platelet activation less likely furthermore in line with studies performed with more pathogenic hantaviruses gavrilovskaya et al 2010 we tested specific binding of platelets to puuv particles judged from results from the platelet pull down experiments figure 3 this seemed to be a specific binding between virus and platelets which could be reversed by the addition of puuv neutralizing antibodies in these experiments we controlled for aspecific binding of antibodies isotype control experiments factors present in the virus culture medium 5 days old veroe6 medium as a control and binding of platelet detection antibody directly to puuvwe expected the increased platelet binding to co-occur with increased vwf production as a general inflammatory response during infection however the observation that vwf concentration does not change during puuv infection further suggested a vwf-independent mechanism for platelet binding in hfrs results from earlier studies showed an increased vwf concentration in hospitalized puuv patients laine et al 2011 one should keep in mind that overall plasma vwf level in any patient represents the state of the total endothelial cell layer and not only that of infected cells as is the case in our model furthermore we are studying the acute response of endothelial cells in the first 48 h after infection a time point at which puuv patients are generally not considered to be hospitalized and tested the increase of vwf in all three conditions control bpl and puuv over time in our huvec model could be the result of an increased number of cells or a sign of in vitro stress and activation of the endothelial cells since it seems highly unlikely the cells still multiply after the formation of a full monolayer which is present at the time of infection we believe that also non-infected cells show a certain level of activation when in culturegavrilovskaya et al 2010 were the first to study the interaction of hantaviruses andes and hantaan with platelets and concluded that there was a specific binding of hantaan and andes virus particle particles to 3 integrins present on both endothelial cells and platelets interestingly our experiment showed a trend to increased number of platelets bound to the bpl-inactivated virus treated cultures suggesting active replication was unnecessary and inactivated virus bound to the cell surface might also bind to integrins present on platelets however this hypothesis is merely based on a statistical trend observed in wells with the cells incubated with bpl inactivated virus for the interpretation of our data one should take in mind that we made use of a moi 3 bpl at t  0 h and that the bpl inactivated virus will not replicate therefore at timepoint t  24 and t  48 the bpl control will most likely be comparable to the moi 05 infection it could very well be the case that when increasing the moi for the bpl infection a more comparable result to the moi 3 infection would be observedpuumala virus infections of huvec directly increased the expression of tf on the cell surface and in the cell lysate compared to controls this resulted in drastic activation of secondary hemostasis in our cell model during puuv infection data from a direct clotting assay on the cell monolayer gives interesting insights in the potential mechanism behind increased thrombin generation seen in acute puuv patients laine et al 2010 2014 a clear pro-coagulant state the result of an increased expression of tf on the surface of puuv infected cells resulted in enhanced thrombin generation increased thrombin generation decreased thrombin time overall increase in prothrombin fragments 1  2 antithrombin and protein c that laine et al 2010 2014 observed in acute puuv patients could very well be the result of direct infection of endothelial cells and concomitant increased production of tf whether increase in tf is a general defense response or if the virus actually benefits from tf as is seen in certain herpesvirus infections pryzdial et al 2014 remains unknown however excess of tf production during infection could lead to increased clotting and eventually consumptive coagulopathy or even dic a severe condition that is only seen in a small percentage of puuv patients laine et al 2010 but which could be one of the factors contributing to the hemorrhagic complications seen in hfrs especially since increased tf expression has been proven to play an important role in the pathogenesis of other viral hemorrhagic fevers like marburg and ebola geisbert et al 2003absince alterations in pai-1 levels are related to renal disturbances comparable to that seen in hantavirus disease gong et al 2007 malgorzewicz et al 2013 and functional polymorphisms in pai-1 were related to more severe disease in acute puuv patients laine et al 2012 we also studied pai-1 and regulators of pai-1 activity infection with puuv increases pai-1 production which would in vivo lead to decreased fibrinolysis the 3 integrin receptor plays an important role in pai-1vitronectin complex formation zhou et al 2003 increased 3 expression during puuv infection combined with competitive binding of hantavirus with vitronectin for 3 could hypothetically lead to further alterations in pai-1 half-life and stability the increased level of vitronectin-pai-1 complexes in the supernatant of puuv infected cells further strengthens this hypothesis considering that an increase in pai-1 and vitronectin could result in renal impairment and even cause a nephritis-like response pledges for further evaluation of interaction between 3 integrin pai-1 vitronectin and hantavirusesmg was the

research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interestfollowing the initial and seminal discovery of renin in 1898 by tigerstedt and bergman the ras now encompasses a complex network of enzymes peptides and receptors figure 12315162327 while many metallopeptidases cluster in small inter-related gene families eg the neprilysin nep family unusually no human homolog of the vasoactive zinc-peptidase ace angiotensin converting enzyme had been identified at the turn of the century almost simultaneously in 2000 2 independent approaches searching for such ace homologs revealed the existence of a close relative of the ace gene designated aceh2 or ace23
aceh was cloned from a human lymphoma cdna library and the identical ace2 from a human hf ventricular cdna library the latter emphasizing a potential role for ace2 in cardiovascular pathologies expression of the ace2 gene was initially established in the heart kidney and testis but subsequent studies have shown a much broader distribution including the upper airways lungs gut and liver figure 2a sequence comparison of ace and ace2 strongly suggested that ace2 like ace was an integral transmembrane protein and ectoenzyme with a transmembrane anchor close to the c-terminus type i membrane protein a close evolutionary relationship existed between the ace and ace2 genes and it was presumed that the 2 proteins would have similar substrate specificities and involvement in the rasas it turned out important differences occur particularly in the active site regions of the enzymes such that the 2 enzymes counterbalance rather than reinforce each others actions many subsequent studies over the next 20 years have revealed their inter-relationship respective roles in the ras and multiple physiological and pathological actions from vasoactive peptide metabolism importantly including not only ang ii but also apelin to intestinal amino acid transport affecting innate immunity to lung function and brain amyloid metabolism converting a43 to a42 a substrate for ace1428 another unexpected twist in ace2 biology was its identification in 2003 as the cell-surface receptor for the then newly identified sars-cov that led to 8000 cases of sars and almost 800 deaths5 and as the receptor for sars-cov-2 that is currently devastating many countries worldwide2930unlike the ace gene which is located on human chromosome 17 the 40kb ace2 gene is located on chromosome xp22 and contains 18 exons most of which resemble exons in the ace gene whereas somatic ace contains 2 active sites ace2 possesses only a single catalytic domain both ace and ace2 act as zinc metallopeptidases but of differing substrate specificities defining their distinct and counterbalancing roles in the ras whereas ace cleaves c-terminal dipeptide residues from susceptible substrates a peptidyl dipeptidase ace2 acts as a simple carboxypeptidase able to hydrolyze ang i forming ang 19 and ang ii to ang 17 figure 2b ace2 does not cleave bradykinin further distinguishing its specificity from that of ace while it is also insensitive to conventional ace inhibitors228 the c-terminal domain of ace2 which has no similarity with ace is a homolog of a renal protein collectrin which regulates the trafficking of amino acid transporters to the cell surface endowing ace2 with multiple and distinctive physiological functions it is the multiplicity of physiological roles that ace2 plays that has allowed it to be hijacked by sars-cov-2 as a receptor resulting in the covid-19 pandemic1516 structural studies have revealed the structures of both the sars-cov and much more recently the sars-cov-2 in complex with ace2 figure 2b3132 in the case of sars-cov-2 the major spike glycoprotein s1 binds to the n-terminal region of ace2 the knowledge of the biology and physiology of ace2 accumulated over the last 20 years since its discovery should provide a major stimulus to understanding some of the key steps in sars-cov-2 infection and its ultimate preventionon march 11 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of sars-cov-2 a global pandemic reporting community scale transmissions occurring in every continent outside antarctica since then the outbreak has escalated to well over one million cases and caused over 60 000 deaths worldwide by the start of april 2020 however before the emergence of sars-cov in 2002 coronaviruses were conventionally viewed as inconsequential pathogens circulating in nature throughout various host and intermediate species that occasionally infected humans causing only mild upper respiratory tract infections and symptoms of the common cold3335 as such to better understand the severity of global health risks posed by sars-cov-2 and optimize treatment for infected patients we must recognize the role of ace2 in sars-cov-2 pathogenesis in addition to respiratory involvement multiorgan dysfunction occurs in response to sars-cov-2 infections3638 while respiratory symptoms are predominant acute cardiac and kidney injuries arrhythmias gut and liver function abnormalities have all been documented in infected patients suggesting myocardial renal enteric and hepatic damage in covid-19 similarly sars-cov also resulted in systemic manifestations with damages to the heart gastrointestinal liver kidney and other tissues3940sars-cov-2 differs from the original sars-cov by 380 amino acid substitutions which translates to differences in five of the six vital amino acids in the receptor-binding domain between the viral spike s protein with surface expressed human ace241 viral s-proteins are well established as a significant determinant of host tropism and represents a key target for therapeutic and vaccine development additionally host cell proteases are important for sars-cov-2 entry and infection of cells as both s-proteins and ace2 are proteolytically modified during the process the binding affinity of sars-cov-2 with ace2 seems stronger than sars-cov with alterations in several amino acid residues allowing for enhanced hydrophobic interactions and salt bridge formations which may explain the considerably larger global influence of covid-19 than the initial sars1642 moreover sars-cov-2 has evolved to utilize a wide array of host proteases including cathepsin l cathepsin b trypsin factor x elastase furin and tmprss2 transmembrane protease serine 2 for s-protein priming and facilitating cell entry following receptor binding43 so far tmprss2 and cathepsin lb mediates s-protein priming of sars-cov-2 and camostat mesylate a serine protease inhibitor combined with cathepsin lb inhibitor e-64d blocked sars-cov-2 entry44 the entry of both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 into cells is facilitated by the interaction between viral s-protein with extracellular domains of the transmembrane ace2 proteins followed by subsequent downregulation of surface ace2 expression figure 351529 in a cohort of 12 covid-19 patients circulating ang ii levels were markedly elevated compared with healthy controls linearly correlated with viral load providing a direct link between tissue ace2 downregulation with systemic ras imbalance and facilitating the development of multiorgan damage from sars-cov-2 infections445 potential therapeutic strategies may include preventing the binding of human ace2 and sars-cov-2 by blocking the receptor-binding domain rbd of the viral s-protein in addition to this receptor-binding domain blocking strategy other possible treatment options may include localized use of ace2-derived peptides small molecule inhibitors ace2 antibody or single chain antibody fragment against ace2in postmortem autopsy heart tissues from 20 patients who succumbed to sars-cov 7 heart samples had detectable viral sars-cov genome which was characterized by increased myocardial fibrosis inflammation and reduced myocardial ace2 expression46 these patients also had a much more aggressive illness associated with earlier mortality additionally bilateral pleural effusions were frequently observed during autopsy of sars-cov patients further supporting the evidence of cardiac involvement individuals with preexisting diabetes mellitus hypertension and lung disease are at particular risk of covid-19 infection3747 and this is likely due to dysregulated ras that occurs in these conditions448 significance of the sars-cov-2 infection in the cardiovascular system is reflected through incidences of acute myocardial injury elevated high sensitivity troponin i levels andor new ecgechocardiogram abnormalities arrhythmias cardiac arrest sepsis septic shock viral myocarditis and hf elevated nt-probnp levels systolic dysfunction on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging4952 further abnormalities from laboratory tests including elevation in d-dimers reflective of increased thrombosis risk may lead to acute coronary syndrome and sustained increased inflammatory cytokines levels throughout the clinical course suggest ongoing systemic and tissue inflammation in patients with covid-19363747ubiquitous expression of ace2 throughout the luminal surface of the gastrointestinal tract and most prevalently in enterocytes may serve as a secondary site for enteric sars-cov-2 infection figure 2a leaky gastrointestinal conditions in experimental models of human disease can be ameliorated and worsened with either the gain or loss of ace2 respectively811 patients with covid-19 also suffer from gastrointestinal discomfort and diarrhea which may arise earlier than respiratory conditions concurrent with the detection of viral rna in feces as seen with previous coronavirus outbreaks38475356 moreover common comorbidities of cvd including diabetes mellitus and obesity are known to affect the integrity of the gastrointestinal-blood barrier and result in gut dysbiosis bacteremia and systemic inflammation figure 4 development of gastrointestinal leakage and gut dysbiosis have correspondingly been linked to the onset of ph through the gut-lung axis and is closely related to hyperactivation of the aceang iiat1r angiotensin ii type 1 receptor axis from ace2 loss2057 continued viral production by host enterocytes perpetuates this situation and deteriorates conditions in the gut-lung axis5455 evidence supports that sars-cov-2 infection potentially leads to degeneration of the gut-blood barrier leading to systemic spread of bacteria endotoxins and microbial metabolites likely affecting the hosts response to covid-19 infection and cumulating in multisystem dysfunction and septic shock373847 enteric involvement and associated worsening in patient outcomes were documented from the initial sars-cov outbreak in the early 2000s fecal viral rna was detected in up to 70 of patients with viral shedding from the gastrointestinal tract associated with a more aggressive clinical course5455 in a separate study sars-cov particles were detected within the cytoplasm and surface microvilli of apical enterocytes in the ileum and colon55 while in patients with covid-19 sars-cov-2 was detected in feces suggesting fecal-oral transmission58 as such the gastrointestinal tract of sars-cov and possibly sars-cov-2 patients acts as a staging ground for sustained viral replication concurrent with disruption of the enteric ace2 axis and adverse outcomes394754555960in addition to the direct impact of the virus on the microbiome the predisposing disease states such as diabetes mellitus61 and pulmonary disease have their own adverse effects on the gut microbiome6263 which may be worsened by sars-cov-2 infection ang ii-dependent hypertension in animal models64 and humans is associated with gut dysbiosis increased gut leakiness and gut wall pathology10636566 there is broad support for these observations in pulmonary diseases including ph copd and asthma6768 and in type 2 diabetes mellitus where dysbiosis characterized by decreased microbial richness and diversity altered representation of bacterial metabolic pathways and modifications in the composition of firmicutes f and bacteroidetes b6971 ace2 disruption in biomedical models has shown us that gut dysbiosis is quite prevalent and that this change in microbial profiles can alter systemic pathways exacerbating diabetes mellitus and hypertension we recently showed that ace2 deficiency magnifies diabetes mellitus-induced dysbiosis11 characterized by an increase in peptidoglycan-producing bacteria and loss of gut barrier integrity in ace2y-akita mice we also identified a new role of bone marrow cells in the gut in the ace2y-akita or akita mice the disrupted gut barrier was associated with reduced levels of circulating angiogenic cells hematopoietic cells with reparative function giving exogenous circulating angiogenic cells from wild-type mice corrected gut barrier dysfunction in ace2y-akita or akita mice thus decreased enteric ace2 expression from sars-cov-2 infection may similarly reduce circulating angiogenic cells and compromise the integrity of the endothelium and gut epithelium leading to dysbiosis further examination is required to validate this link and whether it is a direct or indirect effect of viral infection11tnf- tumor necrosis factor- is a cytokine implicated in chronic inflammation and its extracellular domain shedding and activation is driven by the membrane-bound protease coined tace tnf--converting enzyme also known as adam-17 a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 177273 adam-17 is a type i transmembrane protein belonging to the adamalysin subfamily of zn-dependent metalloproteases74 following the discovery that adam-17 cleaves tnf- the substrate specificity of the enzyme has expanded to include various cytokines and receptors many of which contribute to initiating and exacerbating inflammation7576 importantly adam-17 was also found to mediate proteolysis and ectodomain shedding of ace277 enhanced ace2 shedding resulting from ras overactivation and subsequent adam-17 upregulation drives pathogenesis in hf atrial fibrillation coronary artery disease and thoracic aortic aneurysm1137879 ang ii-mediated activation of at1r triggers a signaling cascade which culminates in the activation of p38 mapk mitogen-activated protein kinase and adam-17 phosphorylation by napdh oxidase 2-induced reactive oxygen species formation8081 phosphorylation enhances the catalytic activity of adam-17 thus increasing ace2 shedding resulting in loss of ace2 at the membrane and impaired conversion of ang ii into ang 17 leading to ras-mediated detrimental effects in a positive feedback cycle7782importantly depletion of ace2 at the cell surface is a critical pathological outcome of sars-cov-2 infection sars-cov-2 is endocytosed by cells in complex with ace2 thus the initial detrimental effects of viral infection begins with a loss of ace2-mediated tissue protection83 adam-17 activity is upregulated upon binding of sars-cov to ace2 and facilitates viral entry while knockdown of adam-17 by sirna severely attenuated sars-cov cellular entry84 the molecular mechanisms of sars-cov and another human coronavirus that only causes mild respiratory symptoms hnl63-cov were compared interestingly although hnl63-cov also utilizes ace2 as a receptor for cellular entry it does not induce adam-17 activation and ace2 ectodomain shedding8485 therefore this study elucidates the unique role of adam-17 mediated shedding of ace2 in sars-cov infectivity and may inform the disparity in severity between coronavirus subtypes furthermore loss of membrane ace2 promotes ang ii accumulation which also activates adam-17 activity thus perpetuating membrane shedding of ace2 ras overactivation and inflammation77the modulatory effects on the ang iiat1r and ang 17masr axes make ace2 a plausible target in preventing and treating chronic inflammation and inflammatory diseases as highlighted by the recent covid-19 pandemic29 patients with covid-19 develop pneumonia with acceleration of injury in susceptible patients to multiple organ failure3086 driven in part by an inflammatory cytokine storm and is a notable cause of death in patients who are critically ill3086 when the immune system is activated due to factors such as sars-cov-2 infection there is an imbalance of th17treg cell function and overactivation of immune cells which secrete a large number of proinflammatory cytokines178788 imbalance in the ras system and the loss of ace2 in patients with covid-19 are further contributing factors to tissue and systemic inflammation3086 lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury decreased expression of ace2 precipitated inflammatory injury and upregulated expression of renin ang ii ace and at1 receptors89 after injection of rhace2 lung function and pathological injury improved with attenuation of inflammation89 in addition rhace2 is beneficial and improves acute lung injury caused by sars-cov acid inhalation and sepsis171888ace2 knockout ko mice showed very severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ardsacute lung injury pathology increased vascular permeability increased pulmonary edema neutrophil accumulation and deterioration of lung function compared with normal wt control mice1887 ace deficiency partially rescued the severe phenotype of mice with a single mutation of ace2 in acute lung injury by further deletion of the ace gene17 suggesting that the balance of ace2ace levels is the key to lung injurylung protection during an inflammatory storm arbs at1r blockers induce ace2 ang 17 and mas expression in line with the reduction of proinflammatory cytokines and induction of il-10 an anti-inflammatory cytokine88 we showed that ace2 ko hypertensive mice exhibited enhancement of proinflammatory cytokines il-1 il6 tnf- and chemokine c-c motif ligand 5 while administration of rhace2 rescued ang ii-induced t-lymphocyte-mediated inflammation9091 blockade of mas receptor by d-ala7-ang 17 a-779 completely inhibited the ang 17 mediated anti-inflammatory effects while ave 0991 the agonist of ang 17 receptors mimicked the actions of ang1788discovery of ace2 resulted in a paradigm-changing concept in all aspects of the ras ace2 is a monocarboxypeptidase that converts ang i into a nonapeptide ang 19 and ang ii into a heptapeptide ang 17 figure 5a this distinct enzymatic pathway for degradation of ang i and ang ii negatively regulates ras activation and mitigates the deleterious actions mediated by ang ii and at1r1 this is of particular significance in pathological conditions where the ras is overstimulated ang 17 is a biologically active peptide whose vast array of effects are opposite to those attributed to ang ii9298 furthermore ace2 can antagonize ace-independent formation of ang ii such as from mast cell chymase1399 in 2003 an endogenous orphan receptor mas receptor masr was identified as the ang 17 receptor and a779 a masr antagonist was shown to inhibit the majority of ang 17 effects94100103 ang 19 has also shown beneficial biological effects via the at2r that result in cardioprotection104107 thus the ace2ang 17masr axis has emerged as a physiological antagonist that counter-regulates the activated ras93108112 the cardioprotective effects of ace2 taken together can be attributed to 1 degradation of ang i to ang 19 whereby limiting action of ace on its substrate 2 reducing ang ii detrimental effects through degradation of the peptide and 3 formation of ang 17 which exercises cardioprotective effects formation of ang 17 is an important mechanism of ace2 mediated protection as antagonism of ang 17 using a779 prevented beneficial effects of rhace2 in murine model of systolic dysfunction113 diminished ace2 activity results in activation of the ang iiat1r axis contributing to the increased progression of cvd elevated ace2 level and activity result in the formation of ang 19 and ang 17 leading to protection against cvd figure 5athe apelin family of peptides act through the apelin receptors mediating protection against cvd114115 the x-linked apln gene encodes a 77 amino acids prepro-apelin that is subsequently cleaved by endopeptidases to various bioactive peptides from 13 to 36 amino acids in length cvd including hf and hypertension is characterized by an apelin deficient state in both human myocardium and plasma116118 apelin ko mice exhibit increased infarct size and systolic dysfunction following coronary ligation and reduced myocardial contractility concomitant with increased susceptibility to hf in pressure-overload models119120 reduced myocardial ace2 mrna and ace2 protein levels in apelin ko mice which were rescued by infusion of apelin-13 suggest a crucial regulatory role of apelin in ace2 gene expression121 apelin signaling through the apelin receptors specifically increased ace2 promoter activity leading to an increase in ace2 mrna and protein121123 these effects are consistent with the ability of the pyr-apelin-13 peptide to negatively regulate ang ii-mediated superoxide production myocardial hypertrophy dysfunction and fibrosis123 and analogs of apelin-17 preventing abdominal aortic rupture in low-density lipoprotein receptor ko models induced by ang ii infusion124 however ace2 through its monocarboxypeptidase activity cleaves and inactivates bioactive apelin peptides apelin-13 and apelin-36 through a negative feedback mechanism in the heart and vasculature figure 5b28125 due to the short half-life of endogenous apelin peptides in the plasma synthetic apelin peptide analogs resistant to ace2 degradation and retaining their binding capability to endogenous apelin receptors elicit protection in the cardiovascular system are being explored as potential new therapies114124b0at1 is highly expressed in the intestines and kidneys with function in the absorption of neutral amino acids126 the ace2-b0at1 complex is assembled as a dimer of heterodimers with the collectrin-like domain of ace2 mediating homo-dimerization16 ace2 has a ras-independent function regulating intestinal amino acid homeostasis expression of antimicrobial peptides and the gut microbiome8 ace2 is necessary for the expression of the hartnup transporter in the intestine and the differential functional association of mutant b0at1 transporters with ace2 in the intestine regulates the phenotypic heterogeneity of human hartnup disorder126cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and a major public health concern heart disease is characterized by the activation of several signaling pathways associated with pathological hypertrophy and maladaptive ventricular remodeling in the heart ace2 is localized to cardiomyocytes cardiac fibroblasts epicardial adipose tissue and the coronary vascular endothelium77127128 ang 17masr is also present on cardiomyocytes cardiac fibroblasts and endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells100129131 genetic ace2 deletion resulted in exacerbation of ang ii-mediated cardiorenal fibrosis and oxidative stress in the heart and kidney of hypertensive mice while administration of rhace2 recombinant human ace2 remarkably rescued the ang ii-induced hypertension pathological hypertrophy oxidant injury and cardiac dysfunction9091various ace2 polymorphisms are linked to cvd132 post-mi remodeling and coronary artery disease are common causes of hf1133 notably mi increases ace2 mrna expression in human mice and rat hearts134135 whereas genetic ace2 deletion results in worsening of mi-induced cardiac dysfunction infarct size mmp matrix metalloproteinase2mmp9 activation and extracellular matrix disruption134135 loss of ace2 leads to increased neutrophilic infiltration in the infarct and peri-infarct regions resulting in upregulation of inflammatory cytokines interferon- il interleukin-6 and the chemokine mcp-1 monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 as well as increased phosphorylation of erk12 extracellular signal-regulated kinase 12 and jnk12 signaling pathways changes that were blocked with an arb ultimately resulting in improvement in myocardial function135 in contrast overexpression of ace2 and the action of ang 17 ameliorates mi-induced cardiac remodeling136137 importantly heterozygote loss of ace2 as seen in explanted human hearts from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy was sufficient to increase susceptibility to heart disease138hf with preserved ejection fraction is a proinflammatory state closely linked to obesity-related cardiac and microvascular dysfunction for which there are no approved therapies128139140 epicardial adipose tissue is a primary source of inflammatory cytokines that could have detrimental effects on the heart139 loss of ace2 increases macrophage polarization to proinflammatory m1-phenotype alternatively activated cd11c in epicardial adipose tissue from patients with hf with preserved ejection fraction with decreases in polarization to anti-inflammatory m2-phenotype macrophages and worsening of hf with preserved ejection fraction in response to diet-induced obesity139 importantly ang 17 decreased macrophage polarization in epicardial adipose tissue and preserved the cardiac function of obese ace2 ko mice128141 ang 17 has potent anti-inflammatory effects in adipose tissue of obese type 2 diabetic mice and protects against diabetic cardiomyopathy and nephropathy141143 the ace2ang 17 axis also promotes browning of adipose tissue leading to improved metabolic effects and weight loss which can confer further benefits to the cardiovascular system144145blockade of the deleterious arm of the ras has been the mainstay of the therapeutic management of hypertensive individuals an increase in ace2 and the vasoprotective axis of the ras by ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs clearly reinforces this view see section pharmacological antagonists of the ras and ace2 expression below furthermore increased ace2 expression protects against hypertension while ace2 deficiency exacerbates hypertension renal ace2 expression is inversely related to blood pressure in experimental models of hypertension25 in the spontaneously hypertensive rat and stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat renal ace2 mrna levels are reduced compared with normotensive wistar-kyoto rats25 these studies support the essential role of ace2 in maintaining healthy blood pressure lentiviral overexpression of ace2 results in increased expression of antihypertensive components of the ras and attenuates elevated blood pressure146147 pretreatment with rhace2 prevented hypertension induced by ang ii and decreased plasma ang ii while increasing plasma ang 17 levels148 ace2 and adam17 were selectively knocked down from all neurons ac-n which revealed a reduction of inhibitory inputs to ac-n presympathetic neurons relevant for blood pressure regulation mice with ace2 selectively knocked down from sim1 neurons in mice exhibited a blunted blood pressure elevation and preserved ace2 activity during the development of salt-sensitive hypertension14 the metalloproteinase adam17 is responsible for mediating ace2 shedding from the cell membrane-bound domain which can be promoted by ang ii and release of ace2 as a soluble form in plasma1477149 impairing brain ace2 compensatory activity and thus contributing to the development of neurogenic hypertension150 genetic ace2 deficiency is associated with the upregulation of putative mediators of atherogenesis and enhances responsiveness to proinflammatory stimuli suggestive of a key role of ace2 in suppressing vascular inflammation and atherosclerotic disease151 in addition ace2 inhibition blocks neuropeptide catestatin-mediated protective effects in the development of atherosclerosis in apoe mice fed a high-fat diet152the counter-regulatory role of the ace2ang 17masr axis of the ras has been well characterized in the progression of diabetic complications including cardiovascular and kidney disease1153154 support for the importance of ace2 in diabetes mellitus comes from its impact on diabetic complications wherein diabetes mellitus-induced vascular dysfunction is strongly associated with a shift in the ras axis toward the profibrotic proinflammatory arm of ras with a reduction in the protective arm figure 6 loss of the protective effects of the ras is related to the regulation of tissue and circulating levels of ang ii and their sequelae in the context of diabetes mellitus155156 alterations within the ras are considered pivotal for the development of both diabetic micro and macrovascular complications1157the blockade of the proinflammatory and profibrotic arms of the ras provides significant renoprotection in both experimental models of diabetes mellitus and in patients while the loss of ace2 worsens diabetic kidney injury158 rhace2 is therapeutic in an animal model of diabetic nephropathy153 and experimental alport syndrome159 ace inhibitors in t1d and angiotensin receptor blockade with losartan and irbesartan in t2d retard the progression of nephropathy160 in diabetic renal tubules ace2 gene expression is decreased by 50 which would reduce ang 17 formation and allow ang ii accumulation hence directly increasing the expression of tgf- and ctgf connective tissue growth factor leading to tubulointerstitial fibrosis161 ras blockade retards renal damage and ace inhibitor therapy as mentioned above resulting in a compensatory increase in ace2 leading to renoprotection91 therefore support for the loss of ace2 contributing to vascular complications in diabetes mellitus comes from strong clinical and experimental evidence1retinopathy the most common complication of diabetes mellitus and one of the leading causes of blindness in working-age adults is linked to activation of oxidative stress profibrotic and proinflammatory arm of the ras which can be effectively curtailed by the ace2ang 17 axis in experimental models162163 increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells skews hematopoiesis toward the generation of an increased number of myelo-monocytic cells164 target tissues of diabetic complications secrete ccl2 in response to high glucose-induced stress165 facilitating the homing of ccr2cells to these regions and promoting the development of vascular complications166171 in addition to an increase in myeloidosis diabetics with complications have reduced bone marrowderived vascular reparative cells and circulating angiogenic cells cd34cells11 levels of ace2 mrna were also a significant predictor of the presence of microvascular disease in diabetic patients172 diabetic individuals who remained free of retinopathy despite 40 years of poor glycemic control had higher mrna levels for genes of the vasoprotective axis ace2mas compared with age sex and glycemia-matched diabetics with retinopathy172 in dysfunctional cd34 cells from diabetic individuals activation of the protective arm of ras by exposing the cells to ang17 corrected their dysfunction by restoring bioavailable no and reducing reactive oxygen species ang17 gene modification of cd34 cells restored the in vivo vasoreparative function of these cells in a mouse retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury model172 moreover intraocular administration of aav-ace2 or ang17 reduced diabetes mellitusinduced retinal vascular leakage and inflammation thus preventing retinopathy163patients with diabetes mellitus have a dysregulated ras which may influence their vulnerability to sars-cov-2 guan et al examined 1099 individuals with confirmed covid 19 of these individuals 173 had severe disease and of this 162 were diabetics47 zhang et al studied 140 patients who were hospitalized due to the severity of their covid-19 infection of these individuals 12 had diabetes mellitus it is interesting to speculate why diabetics may be more at risk for sars-cov-2 infection than the general population and this may be due to the reduced ace2 levels that are typically observed in the vasculature of diabetic individuals and diabetic animal models173 indeed loss of ace2 was associated with marked gut dysbiosis which was further worsened in a model with type 1 diabetes mellitus11lung epithelial cells express high levels of ace2 which positively correlates with airway epithelial differentiation1719174 involvement of ace2 in ards which is triggered by multiple diseases including sars-cov and sars-cov-2 has been established in multiple animal models18175
ace2 ko mice exhibit severe pathology of ards1719 additional ace deficiency or treatment with ar1r blockers of ace2 ko mice rescues them from ards implicating the benefit of ace2 and the critical balance of the protective versus proinflammatory and fibrotic axes of the ras18 these findings are consistent with evidence of a beneficial effect of rhace2 on pulmonary blood flow and oxygenation in a pig model of lipopolysaccharide-induced ards176 age-related loss of ace2 in the lungs correlates with the increased mortality and worsened phenotype in elderly patients with covid-19174ace2 has been implicated in acute lung injury by inducing an imbalance in the ras evidence includes that in acute lung injury 1 a decrease in pulmonary ace2 and an increase in ang ii levels occurs 2 supplementation with ace2 or inhibition of ang ii improves outcomes and 3 a lack or decrease of pulmonary ace2 aggravates viral-induced acute lung injury ace2 is also involved in ph and fibrosis19 increasing ace2 activity using rhace2 reduced bleomycin-induced inflammation and fibrosis resulting in improved lung function and exercise capacity19 and the ace2 activator dize protects animals from ph and fibrosis177 moreover oral feeding of a bioencapsulated form of ace2 protects and arrests the progression of ph12 validation of this protective effect comes from a small human study that showed that ph is characterized by reduced ace2 activity and supplementation of these individuals with rhace2 improved pulmonary hemodynamics and reduced oxidative and inflammatory markers21 collectively these studies unequivocally establish the conceptual framework that ace2 is a central player in normal pulmonary function and its imbalance leads to pulmonary diseasespathological neurohormonal activation of the ras drives the development and progression of cvd current pharmacotherapies aim to achieve multilevel ras inhibition through distinct modes of action although ace2 is not the direct cellular target of these therapies ace2 gene transcription translation and ultimately catalytic activities are modified due to the intricate nature of the ras blocking the aceang iiat1r axis through limiting the formation and actions of ang ii potentiates the effects of ace2 as the endogenous ras counter-regulator the arbs consistently increased ace2 mrna expression protein levels and catalytic activities in the heart kidneys and thoracic aorta but the translation to protein levels and activity differs between experimental models and tissues for ace inhibitors table77178185 combination of lisinopril and losartan treatment in normotensive lewis rats abolished the increase in ace2 mrna levels observed individually but retained losartan induced rise in ace2 activity in the heart179 moreover lisinopril in normotensive lewis rats increased ace2 mrna without affecting ace2 activity in the heart but the opposite was observed in the kidneys179180 these findings could be attributed to tissue-specific regulation of ace2 as higher ace2 protein levels were reported in the heart but ace2 activity was higher in the kidneys of sprague-dawley rats adding to the complexity of the tissue ras186 in type 1 diabetic akita angiotensinogen-transgenic mice dual ras blockade with perindopril and losartan normalized disease-mediated reduction in kidney ace2 mrna expression and protein levels187 these findings suggest that the accumulation of ang ii in pathological conditions contributes to the modulatory effects of ras blockade on ace2ang ii can regulate ace2 expression through the at1r healthy hearts and kidneys are characterized by high levels of ace2 mrna and protein expression with moderate expression of ace191 ras overactivation in cvd increases at1r stimulation by ang ii promoting erk12 and p38 mapk signaling pathways to downregulate ace2 while upregulating ace expression191 activation of p38 mapk upregulates adam17 activity though posttranslational phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain results in shedding of surface ace2 in a positive feedback loop and could explain the observed effects of arbs in increasing ace2 protein levels and activity778081 mechanisms behind the augmentation of ace2 mrna levels by ace inhibitors and arbs require further characterization moreover mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists increased ace2 mrna expression and activity in samples from patients with chronic hf wild-type mice and rats to varying degrees among different tissues but not in the heart of a rat hypertensive disease model table188190 spironolactone a nonselective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist prevented the increase in both ace and at1r mrna levels and the associated increase in at1r density from aldosterone signaling in cardiomyocytes192193 activation of mineralocorticoid receptors also stimulates overlapping downstream signaling pathways with at1r including the erk12 and p38 mapk pathways mentioned before194195 blocking these signaling pathways contributes to the observed effect of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist on ace2 gene expression surface protein levels and activitypromoting the ace2ang 17mas signaling by rhace2 or the ang 17 receptors agonist ave 0991 can have salutary therapeutic effects in cvd and lung disease from diverse etiologies1 the ang 17 receptors agonist ave 0991 has been shown to exert cardiorenal and pulmonary protective effects88 and treatment with rhace2 improved the symptoms of acute lung injury cvd and kidney injury in various preclinical models17878890 maintaining ace2 levels in patients with or predisposed to common cvd states such as diabetes mellitus hypertension and obesity wards off the advancement of these comorbidities in instances where the patient contracts sars-cov-2 by maintaining a level of ace2ang17masr negative counter-regulationrhace2 functionally sequesters circulating viral particles to prevent s-protein interactions with endogenous ace2 while simultaneously regulating the systemic ras may provide therapeutic benefits in covid-19 and is moving into phase ii clinical trials in europe196 a potential limitation of rhace2 is the restricted penetrance and activity against tissue ras owning to its large molecular size pharmacological ras blockade agents arbs in particular are capable of modulating both systemic and tissue ras and simultaneously increasing ace2 expression and activity in experimental models the direct implications of ras inhibition in patients with covid-19 with hypertension remain elusive and clinical evidence is desperately needed to determine the relative benefits and risks associated with usage of these medications197 nonetheless introducing arbs to patients already infected by sars-cov-2 may be an effective therapeutic option in addressing the viral-mediated ras imbalance and is currently under investigation in several clinical trials wwwclinicaltrialgov number nct04312009 nct04311177 and nct04318418198200potential for ace2 as a therapy is also facilitated by using the probiotic species lactobacillus paracasei lp which can be engineered to express recombinant proteins mice treated with the recombinant lp expressing the secreted ace2 in fusion with the nontoxic subunit b of cholera toxin acts as a carrier to facilitate transmucosal transport showed increased ace2 activities in serum and tissues and reduced diabetic retinopathy201 these results provide proof of concept for using bioengineered probiotic species as live vectors for delivery of human ace2 with enhanced tissue bioavailability for treating diabetic complications but could potentially be repurposed for treating cvd and covid-19 infectionsince the discovery of ace2 in 2000 tremendous progress has been made in elucidating its biochemical actions and fundamental role in cvd and more recently as the sars-cov-2 receptor ace2 is a dominant mechanism for negative regulation of the ras by metabolizing ang ii into the beneficial peptide ang 17 and this important biochemical and physiological property is being harnessed as a potential therapy in patients with hf the activation of the ras axis due to binding of sars-cov-2 to ace2 leading to direct loss of ace2 and indirectly via proteolytic processing and shedding partly drives the systemic manifestations of covid-19 careful targeting of the ras axes is needed in these patients to optimize their clinical outcomes including the use of at1 receptor blockers arbwe acknowledge patients and their families for participating in our studieswe acknowledge

research plan training program 91849111 to j-c zhongnonein late december 2019 several clusters of pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology were reported in the city of wuhan peoples republic of china investigation of respiratory samples of these cases identified a novel coronavirus cov as the causative agent 1 2 nucleotide sequence analysis of the viral rna genome revealed it to be closely related to that of the betacoronavirus responsible for the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in asia pacific and canada in 20022003 from china the new virus which was designated sars-cov2 has rapidly spread throughout the world with a total of 5697334 confirmed cases and 355758 deaths as of 28 may 2020 3 these figures are likely a gross underestimation of the actual impact of sars-cov2 due to limited virological testing and underreporting the primary routes of sars-cov2 transmission are respiratory droplets and direct contact approximately 80 of sars-cov2 infections are relatively mild with flu-like symptoms or even asymptomatic some 15 of cases result in severe disease so-called covid-19 characterised by pneumonia and dyspnoea while 5 of sars-cov-2-infected individuals experience critical illness ie acute respiratory distress syndrome ards septic shock multiorgan failure and require intensive carelike the original sars-cov host cell penetration by sars-cov2 relies on the interaction of the viral spike s protein with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 4 ace2 is a monocarboxypeptidase present on the surface of a wide variety of different cell types including epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract cardiac fibroblasts cardiomyocytes endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells vsmcs 5 6 in the lungs ace2 expression is mainly found in alveolar macrophages and in the surfactant-producing type ii pneumocytes and to a lesser extent in bronchial and tracheal epithelial cells 5 ace2 is a paralogue of angiotensin-converting enzyme ace both these enzymes are zn2-dependent transmembrane proteins involved in the production of vasoactive peptides 7 8 however ace and ace2 generally have opposite effects thus functioning as counter-regulatory factors within the renin-angiotensin system rasace converts angiotensin i angiangiotensin-110 into angiotensin ii angiiangiotensin-18 fig 1 binding of angii to the angii type1 receptor at1r has pro-inflammatory pro-oxidative pro-apoptotic and pro-fibrotic effects increases vascular tone and leakage fig 1 and is involved in pathophysiology of many different tissues and organs 9 stimulation of at1r on the surface of vsmcs by angii results in the activation of signalling pathways that promote vsmc contraction excessive angii-at1r signalling also induces the proliferation migration and growth of vsmcs promotes vascular remodelling and contributes to initiation and progression of atherosclerosis by inducing endothelial dysfunction 9 activation of at1rs in cardiac myocytes induces cellular hypertrophy while binding of angii to at1rs on the surface of cardiac fibroblasts results in cardiac fibrosis by stimulating the synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins including collagen type i and iii and by inducing proliferation and migration of cardiac fibroblasts 9 unbalanced at1r signalling in the lungs is associated with airway inflammation bronchial hyper-responsiveness fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension angii is also an important driving force in the inflammatory cascade and alveolar epithelial injury associated with ards 10 11 apart from binding to at1r angii can also bind to the ang ii type2 receptor at2r fig 1 stimulation of this receptor has effects that are largely opposite to those induced by angii-at1r signalling under pathophysiological conditions angii-at1r signalling is generally dominant over angii-at2r signallingace2 can cleave angi to generate angiotensin-19 ang19 and angii to produce angiotensin-17 ang17 fig 1 the conversion of angii into ang17 by ace2 not only reduces detrimental angiiat1r signalling but also generates the ligand for the mas receptor masr activation of which opposes the effects of at1r stimulation by angii fig 1 recently ang17 was shown also to exert beneficial effects by binding to the at1r and inducing arrestin-biased signalling through this receptor 12 ang19 is another ace2 reaction product involved in counterbalancing angiiat1r signalling by stimulating at2r signalling fig 1the recognition of the adverse effects of unopposed angii-at1r signalling led to the development of ace inhibitors aceis and at1r blockers arbs as shown in fig 1 aceis inhibit the production of angi and thereby indirectly prevent harmful at1r signalling analysis of plasma vasoactive peptide levels has shown a moderate decrease in angii and a large increase in ang17 eg generated from angi by neprilysin following acei treatment 8 thus aceis not only suppress detrimental angii-at1r signalling but also promote beneficial ang17 signalling arbs on the other hand do not block angii production but selectively and competitively inhibit the binding of angii to at1r fig 1 the blood plasma of patients receiving arbs contains strongly elevated angii and moderately increased ang17 levels 8due to their well-established anti-hypertensive anti-oxidative anti-inflammatory anti-fibrotic and anti-hypertrophic effects aceis and arbs have found widespread use in clinical practice as a consequence a large percentage of cardiovascular patients including those suffering from systolic heart failure hfref receive aceis or arbs to lower their blood pressure by reducing systemic vascular resistance and to slow down adverse cardiac remodelling in europe aceis are part of the first-line treatment of asymptomatic hfref patients unless contraindicated or not tolerated 14 in the latter case aceis are commonly replaced by arbs in the united states either aceis or arbs are recommended in the first-line pharmacological treatment of hfref 15 the european society of cardiology guidelines recommend the use of at1r-neprilysin inhibitors arnis instead of aceis or arbs when patients remain symptomatic in spite of optimal treatment with aceisarbs beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers the guidelines of the american college of cardiology and american heart association recommend the prescription of arnis to chronic symptomatic nyha class ii and iii hfref patients who tolerate aceisarbs to further reduce morbidity and mortality the replacement of aceisarbs by arnis is supported by a recent meta-analysis showing that arnis are superior to aceis and arbs in mediating reverse cardiac remodelling in hfref patients 16by analogy to what happens with sars-cov it is widely assumed that infection of airway epithelial cells results in a strong reduction of ace2 expression at the plasma membrane but does not affect ace surface levels 17 in the same study the arb losartan attenuated sars-cov sprotein-induced lung injury in a mouse model moreover serum angii levels are significantly elevated in covid-19 patients and exhibit a linear positive correlation to viral load and lung injury as determined by oxygenation index 18 this led to the hypothesis hypothesis 1 that sars-cov-2-mediated downregulation of ace2 disturbs the balance between aceangiiat1r and ace2ang17masr signalling in the lungs and thereby contributes to the development of ards in covid-19 patients fig 2 if so aceis and arbs may have a beneficial effect on the course of covid-19 by reducing aceangiiat1r signalling and thereby restoring the local balance between the activities of the aceangiiat1r and ace2ang17masr axes fig 3 support for this idea comes from a study by henry et al showing favourable effects of acei treatment during hospitalisation of patients with non-coronaviral pneumonia 19 also several research groups have demonstrated that aceis and arbs can 1 attenuate the lung injury caused by experimental ards and 2 reduce pulmonary arterial hypertension 10 11a number of scientists 20 has raised the opposite idea hypothesis 2 that acei and arb pharmacotherapy may aggravate sars-cov-2-induced lung disease by increasing ace2 surface expression on airway epithelial cells fig 4 several animal studies have indicated an increase of ace2 expression following treatment with aceis or arbs although especially for aceis decreases or no alterations in ace2 expression have also been reported reviewed in 21 information on the effect of these anti-hypertensive drugs in humans is limited to the analysis of duodenal biopsies collectively the data show a more consistent upregulation of ace2 by arbs than by aces 21 in various tissues however whether ace2 expression is upregulated by either of these drugs in the primary target cells of sars-cov2 in human lungs is not yet knownthe hypotheses presented above are not mutually exclusive in patients that are on aceisarbs before infection with sars-cov2 aceiarb-mediated upregulation of ace2 in airway epithelium could increase the risk of becoming infected with sars-cov2 and may facilitate initial virus propagationspread in patients that receive aceisarbs once they are infected with sars-cov2 these drugs could mitigate the extent of lung injury by inhibiting detrimental angiiat1r signalling and hence restoring the balance with beneficial ang17masr signallingrecently a number of observational studies were performed to investigate the influence of acei and arb pharmacotherapy on sars-cov2 infections 2228 none of the studies showed use of these anti-hypertensivecardioprotective drugs to be associated with an increased risk of 1 sars-cov2 infection 2 severe covid-19 or 3 sars-cov-2-related in-hospital death conversely in the small-scale study 205 patients of bean and colleagues a lower rate of death or transfer to a critical care unit within 7 days was found in patients on an ace-inhibitor 22 likewise in the study of mehra and co-workers involving 8910 covid-19 patients the use of aceis was associated with better survival 25 moreover in the small-scale studies of meng et al 26 and zhang et al 28 favourable effects of aceisarbs on respectively severity of disease and all-cause mortality were observed although each of these studies arrives at the same conclusion namely that acearb pharmacotherapy is unlikely to be harmful for covid-19 patients and may even have beneficial effects small-scale studies have a high risk of chance associations and with observational studies there is always the possibility of confounding because of this and some other weaknesses eg use of different virological tests within one study lack of information about the continuation of acearb treatment during hospitalisation bias resulting from selective virological testing randomised controlled trials will be required to definitively answer the question whether ras inhibitors or other blood-pressure-lowering drugs eg arnis beta blockers calcium channel blockers thiazide diuretics are harmful to covid-19 patients ideally these trials should also investigate the effect of different combinations of anti-hypertensive drugs and the timing of anti-hypertensive drug administration on the course of covid-19 of special interest is the effect of arnis on covid-19 as these drugs cause a large rise in plasma angii levels but do not increase the concentration of ang17 in blood plasma 8apart from further exploring the possible benefit of chemical renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in covid-19 patients another promising approach might consist of the treatment of covid-19 with human recombinant soluble ace2 this biological drug could inhibit virus entry into host cells by competing with the binding of the s protein to membrane-bound ace2 and at the same time increase ang17 levels at the expense of angiithe reninangiotensin system ras plays a key role in maintaining blood pressure homeostasis as well as fluid and salt balance in mammals skeggs et al 1980 inagami 1994 weinberg et al 2000 turner  hooper 2002 abnormal activation of the ras has been associated with the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and renal diseases such as hypertension myocardial infarction and heart failure ferrario 1990 nicholls et al 1998 fleming et al 2006 the protease renin cleaves angiotensinogen to generate angiotensin ang i the angiotensin-converting enzyme ace is the critical protease the cleaves ang i to generate ang ii which is a key regulator of the ras and exerts biological functions through two g-protein-coupled receptors the ang ii receptor type 1 receptor at1r and ang ii receptor type 2 receptor at2r skeggs et al 1980 corvol et al 1995 although there exist alternative ang ii-generating enzymes such as cathepsins and chymase belova 2000 miyazaki  takai 2006 it has been thought that ace is the key and possibly sole enzyme in the regulation of ang ii production in the ras skeggs et al 1980 turner  hooper 2002in 2000 a homologue of ace angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 has been discovered donoghue et al 2000 tipnis et al 2000 accumulated evidences indicate that ace2 negatively regulates the activated reninangiotensin system by degrading ang ii to the heptapeptide ang 17 several studies support a counter-regulatory role for ang 17 by opposing many at1 receptor-mediated actions especially in vasoconstriction and cellular proliferation santos et al 2005 ferrario 2006 thus ang 17 has become a key component of the ras system due to its beneficial effects in the cardiovascular system in addition to its capacity to generate ang-17 ace2 is a multifunctional enzyme and its beneficial effects may be a result of its ability to act on other vasoactive peptides vickers et al 2002intriguingly peptidase-independent actions of ace2 have been recently elucidated in particular ace2 has been identified as an essential receptor for sars coronavirus infections as well as a protective molecule against lethal lung failure in sars li et al 2003 kuba et al 2005 interestingly sars receptor function of ace2 is independent of its catalytic activities for ang ii degradation whereas ace2-mediated ang ii degradation is still important for lung protection from sars pathogenesis kuba et al 2005 furthermore ace2 and its homolog collectrin have been identified as essential molecules required for expression of neutral amino acid transporters on the cell surface of epithelial cells collectrin might also have a role in insulin secretion in pancreatic -cells andor growth of islet cells in this review we will discuss the classical functions of ace2 in regulating the reninangiotensin system through its peptidase activity and its new peptidase-independent functionsace was termed a hypertensin-converting enzyme when it was initially isolated in 1956 skeggs et al 1980 the human ace gene located on chromosome 17 encodes a 180 kda protein with two homologous domains each domain has an active zinc-binding motif his-glu-x-x-his hexxh motif which is found in many peptidases skeggs et al 1980 soubrier et al 1988 fig 1
 ace is a type-i transmembrane glycoprotein which anchored to the plasma membrane through a single carboxy-terminal transmembrane domain in humans two distinct ace isoenzymes have been described an abundant somatic form found on the endothelial surface of the lungs and on brush-border membranes of kidneys intestine placenta and choroid plexus and the germinal form of ace found only in the testis turner and hooper 2002 both ace isoforms are membrane-bound protein and at the cell surface they function as ectoenzymes which hydrolyze circulating peptides ace can be cleaved from the cell surface and thereby act as a soluble enzyme however the biological significance of soluble ace remains unclearace2 consists of 805 amino acids and is type i transmembrane glycoprotein with a single extracellular catalytic domain the human ace2 gene has been cloned and mapped to the x chromosome crackower et al 2002 like ace ace2 has two domains the amino-terminal catalytic domain and the carboxy-terminal domain fig 1 the catalytic domain has one active site  the zinc metallo-peptidase domain  and shows 418 sequence identity with the amino domain of ace donoghue et al 2000 tipnis et al 2000 turner  hooper 2002 ace2s carboxy-terminal domain shows 48 sequence identity with collectrin zhang et al 2001 fig 1 a noncatalytic protein recently shown to have a critical role in amino acid re-absorption in the kidney danilczyk et al 2006 malakauskas et al 2007 verrey et al 2009 pancreatic beta cell proliferation akpinar et al 2005 and possibly insulin exocytosis fukui et al 2005ace and ace2 both belong to the m2 family clan ma of metalloproteases and have their active site domains exposed to the extracellular surface facilitating the metabolism of circulating peptides both ace and ace2 catalyze reactions by utilizing zinc coordinated by conserved histidines within the active site to facilitate nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl bond of the substrate by a water molecule forming a noncovalently bound intermediate in addition to the two histidines located within the hexxh motif a further glutamate residue is involved in coordinating the zinc ion this is located 23 amino acids c-terminally to the hexxh motif in both ace and ace2 donoghue et al 2000 tipnis et al 2000 structural analyses for native ace2 compared with inhibitor mln 4760-bound ace2 dales et al 2002 revealed a large hinge-bending motion in which the catalytic subdomains i and ii of the peptidase domain exhibit open-to-close transitions fig 2
 this movement is induced by binding of the inhibitor and repositions key residues for catalysis towler et al 2004despite the similarities ace and ace2 function differently ace releases a c-terminal dipeptide from its substrate dipeptidylpeptidase whereas ace2 cleaves a single amino acid monocarboxypeptidase donoghue et al 2000 tipnis et al 2000 ace2 catalyzes peptides with a substrate preference for hydrolysis between proline and a hydrophobic or basic c-terminal residue vickers et al 2002 while ace converts ang i to the potent vasoconstrictor ang ii corvol et al 1995 ace2 cleaves ang i to generate the presumably inactive ang 19 peptide donoghue et al 2000 tipnis et al 2000 which then can be converted to the vasodilator peptide ang 17 by ace or other peptidases donoghue et al 2000 importantly ace2 directly metabolizes ang ii to generate ang 17 with higher efficiency than converting ang i to ang 19 vickers et al 2002 the resolution of the ace2 crystal structure revealed that these substrate specificity differences are a result of the smaller binding pocket in ace2 due to arginine-273 making a salt-bridge with the c-terminus of the substrate whereas in ace this residue is substituted by a smaller glutamine residue towler et al 2004 although there were already known ang 17-forming enzymes such as neprilysin yamamoto et al 1992 prolyl endopeptidase 2426 nozaki et al 1992 and thimet oligopeptidase chappell et al 2000 the identification of ace2 has added further support to the biological significance of the ang 17 donoghue et al 2000 tipnis et al 2000 vickers et al 2002 this peptide has been shown to interact with the g-protein-coupled receptor mas to mediate its vasoprotective effects santos et al 2003 keidar et al 2007 raizada  ferreira 2007 alenina et al 2008 ace2 also acts on the c-terminus of the peptides apelin-13 and apelin-36 and cleaves an amino acid out from them with high catalytic efficiency in vitro vickers et al 2002 apelin is synthesized as 77 amino-acid preprohormone which is processed into the 36 amino acid peptide apelin-36 further proteolytic cleavage generates apelin-13 tatemoto et al 1998 lee et al 2006 systemic administration of apelin-13 prompts hypotension in rats and mice tatemoto et al 2001 ishida et al 2004 interestingly modification of the c-terminal residue of apelin-13 f13a lost its hypotensive action and further antagonized the effect of wild type apelin-13 lee et al 2005 implicating putative roles of ace2 in metabolism of apelin peptidesthe requirement of chloride ions for the hydrolysis of ang i by ace has long been recognized skeggs et al 1956 similarly ace2 activity is also regulated by chloride ions vickers et al 2002 however the presence of chloride ions increases the hydrolysis of ang i by ace2 but inhibits cleavage of the vasoconstrictor ang ii guy et al 2003 it has been proposed that chloride binding induces subtle changes in the conformation of the active site which either facilitate or hinder substrate binding ehlers and riordan 1991 an increase in cl above 100 mm which is the physiological concentration in human plasma increases ang i and decreases ang ii cleavage by ace2 and increases ang i cleavage by ace rushworth et al 2008 this would have the effect of increasing the localized concentration of the vasoconstrictor ang ii in the kidney where both ace and ace2 have high levels of expression and extracellular chloride ion levels fluctuatea broad range of ace inhibitors such as captopril and lisinopril does not affect the activity of ace2 donoghue et al 2000 tipnis et al 2000 whereas ace2 activity is inhibited by the dipeptide pro-phe guy et al 2003 and specific ace2 inhibitors such as the peptide analogues dx600 huang et al 2003 and mln 4760 ss-2-1-carboxy-2-3-35-dichlorobenzyl-3h-imidazol4-yl-ethylamino-4-methylpentanoicacid have been developed dales et al 2002 mln 4760 was the first rationally designed inhibitor of ace2 based on the c-terminal dipeptide of ang i his-leu and has high potency k

  044 nm and specificity a counter-regulatory axis of the ras by ace2 prompted researchers to investigate the impact of ace2 delivery on cardiovascular diseases in animal models katovich et al 2005 ace2 treatment by means of gene therapy or recombinant protein indeed improved hypertension atherosclerosis and kidney diseases diez-freire et al 2006 dong et al 2008 lovren et al 2008 oudit et al 2010 in silico conformation-based drug screening identified two compounds of ace2 activator a xanthenone and resorcinolnaphthalein that moderately enhance ace2 activity hernandez prada et al 2008 however it is not clear how specific these compounds arealthough ace2 functions as a peptidase to catalyze ang ii cleavage recent studies demonstrate that transmembrane domain of ace2 has also biological functions in 2003 the epidemics of sars threatened the world and ace2 was identified as a functional receptor for a causative pathogen the sars coronavirus fig 4
 li et al 2003 kuba et al 2005 cells expressing catalytic inactive mutants of ace2 are still permissive for sars-cov infection indicating that the peptidase actions of ace2 are not necessary for sars entry into host cells consistent with the biological result structural analyses demonstrated that sars spike protein contacts the tip of subdomain i of the ace2 catalytic domain but does not affect the subdomain ii nor occludes the peptidase active site fig 2 li et al 2005 upon ligation of sars-cov to ace2 the ectodomain of ace2 is cleaved while the transmembrane domain is internalized for further virus particle-host cell fusions fig 3 inoue et al 2007 haga et al 2008 wang et al 2008 thus although detailed mechanisms are still elusive the transmembrane domain of ace2 is implicated to the traffic of sars-cov-receptor complex from cell membrane to the cytoplasm in sars-cov infectionsexpression analyses for rat kidneys isolated collectrin as an upregulated gene in regenerating collecting ducts collectrin shares 478 identity with c-terminal end of ace2 however unlike ace2 collectrin lacks active carboxypeptidase catalytic domains fig 1 zhang et al 2001 the initial report documented that collectrin localized in the cytoplasm of collecting duct epithelial cells but further studies indicated the predominant localization of collectrin in brush borders of the proximal tubular epithelial cells danilczyk et al 2006 danilczyk et al also serendipitously identified collectrin as an essential regulator of neutral amino acid transporters by gene-targeting studies in mice excess amounts of neutral amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine appeared in the urine of collectrin knockout mice biochemical studies indicated that collectrin binds to b0at1 neutral amino acid transporters and plays critical roles for proper expression of these transporters on cell surface required for amino acid re-absorption in proximal tubules of the kidney danilczyk et al 2006 malakauskas et al 2007 despite its structural similarity ace2 does not bind to amino acid transporters in kidneys but in intestines where ace2 is highly expressed and amino acids are absorbed in the gut ace2 does bind to the b0at1 amino acid transporter and contributes to absorption of neutral amino acids camargo et al 2009 importantly the peptidase activity of ace2 is not necessary for pairing with the amino acid transporterace2 was originally cloned using a cdna library of human failing heart ventricle donoghue et al 2000 and ace2 mrna levels changing dynamically depending on the physiological and pathological conditions zisman et al 2003 kuba et al 2006 koitka et al 2008 oudit et al 2009 although transcriptional regulation of ace2 is still elusive accumulating evidences have indicated that inhibition of ras by ace inhibitors or at1 receptor blockers upregulates ace2 mrna expression ishiyama et al 2004 ferrario et al 2005 for instance downregulation of ace2 mrna levels in rat proteinuric renal injury model was reversed by pharmacological inhibition of the nf-b transcription factor which operates downstream of ang ii receptor and cytokine signaling takase et al 2005 inhibition of mineralcorticoids or aldosterone increased ace2 mrna in macrophages likely through suppression of oxidative stress which is associated with ang ii andor nf-b signaling keidar et al 2005 consistently interferon- and interleukin-4 downregulate expression of ace2 mrna levels in epithelial cells de lang et al 2006 thus inflammatory signals including ang ii cytokines and nf-b are likely to suppress ace2 transcriptionour early studies observed the upregulation of hypoxia-inducible genes in the hearts of ace2 knockout mice crackower et al 2002 tissue local hypoxia increases ace2 expression in human and rat myocardial infarction burrell et al 2005 although in another model of rat myocardial infarction changes in ace2 mrna levels were not observed ishiyama et al 2004 ace2 overexpression counteracts and inhibits hypoxia-induced collagen production by cardiac fibroblasts grobe et al 2007 in pulmonary smooth muscle cells subjected to hypoxia ace2 mrna levels increased during the early stages of hypoxia and decreased to near-baseline levels at the later stages after hif-1 accumulation zhang et al 2009 thus the regulation ace2 expression under hypoxia is still elusive and may be context or cellsorgan-dependent all-trans retinoic acid has also been shown to elevate ace2 mrna levels in spontaneously hypertensive rats zhong et al 2004 hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 hnf-1 tcf2 is a tissue-specific transcription factor whose mutation in humans leads to renal cysts genital malformations pancreas atrophy and maturity onset diabetes of the young mody5 in cell lines ace2 was identified as a direct target gene for hnf-1 but not hnf-1 tcf1 and there are multiple hnf-1 binding sites in ace2 promoter regions senkel et al 2005 the ace2 homologue collectrin located close to ace2 locus on the x chromosome is also a target gene for hnf-1 transcription factors hnf-1 in pancreatic  cells fukui et al 2005 and hnf-1 in kidney epithelial cells zhang et al 2007 thus one can speculate that ace2 and collectrin gene expression is coordinately regulated by hnf-1 transcription factorsace2 was identified as a sars receptor li et al 2003 and is has been reported that ace2 as an intact molecule andor its transmembrane domain are internalized together with sars-cov upon infection since endocytosis is essential for establishment of the virus entry blau  holmes 2001 inoue et al 2007 the internalization can take place even when recombinant sars spike protein the sars-cov surface ligand for receptor binding interacts with ace2 kuba et al 2005 wang et al 2008 clathrin-dependent and -independent entry of sars-cov into target cells has been proposed inoue et al 2007 wang et al 2008 however the role of the cytoplasmic tail of ace2 is controversial for instance deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of ace2 did not affect sars-cov entry inoue et al 2007 whereas it attenuated sars-cov entry in another study haga et al 2008 similar to ace parkin et al 2004 ace2 is subject to a juxtamembrane cleavage events shedding which releases the catalytically active ectodomain lambert et al 2005 the process can be stimulated by phorbol ester ionomycin endotoxin il-1 or tnf shedding is mediated by a promiscuous sheddase adam17 or tace tnf- converting enzyme fig 3 lambert et al 2005 jia et al 2009 and adam17-null cells are reduced in ace2 shedding iwata et al 2009 moreover calmodulin-binding sites were identified in the cytoplasmic tail of ace2 lambert et al 2008 and inhibition of calmodulin increased the release of the ace2 ectodomain to the culture supernatants lambert et al 2008 lai et al 2009 although the physiological role of ace2 ectodomain shedding remains elusive as roles for circulating ace2 and remnant c-terminal domain have yet to be identified shedding seems to be involved in sars-cov cellular entry and replication and an adam17 inhibitor suppresses sars-cov replication in vitro glowacka et al 2010
haga et al 2008the ace2 gene was mapped to a quantitative trait locus qtl on the x chromosome in three different rat models of hypertension these hypertensive rats show reduced ace2 transcripts and protein expression in heart and kidney crackower et al 2002 consistently transgenic ace2 overexpression in vessels of shrsp rats reduces blood pressure and improves endothelial function rentzsch et al 2008 and neuronal overexpression of ace2 also attenuates hypertension yamazato et al 2007 feng et al 2008 in humans several studies have shown a strong association of ace2 polymorphisms to hypertension in female chinese patients with metabolic syndrome zhong et al 2006 or essential hypertension yi et al 2006 fan et al 2007 niu et al 2007 thus together with biochemical data that ace2 degrades ang ii to generate ang 17 ace2 plays a profound role in controlling blood pressure however genetic inactivation of ace2 using homologous recombination results in no apparent alterations in blood pressure in basal levels crackower et al 2002 in another ace2 knockout mouse line blood pressure was significantly increased following ang ii infusions gurley et al 2006 this is a sharp contrast to spontaneous hypotension observed in ace knockout mice krege et al 1995 suggesting that in addition to the ang ii system ace2 might regulate blood pressure through other peptide systems such as bradykinin andor apelin nevertheless exogenous supplementation of ace2 by gene transfer decreased blood pressure in shr hypertensive rats rentzsch et al 2008 and recombinant ace2 treatment attenuated ang ii-induced hypertension specifically wysocki et al 2010 thus ace2 is a negative regulator of ras in blood pressure control in addition to hypertension ace2 gene delivery has also shown beneficial effects on atherosclerosis in animal models suggesting that ace2 confers endothelial protection dong et al 2008 lovren et al 2008the heart is a major organ which abundantly expresses ace2 and many literatures have shown its importance in heart failure ace2 null mice displayed impaired cardiac contractility which is associated with aging andor cardiac pressure overload in several different ace2 knockout mouse lines crackower et al 2002 yamamoto et al 2006 nakamura et al 2008 heart contractility impairment was correlated with elevated cardiac and plasma ang ii levels and double knockout mice of ace and ace2 genes or treatment with at1 receptor blockers reversed the cardiac phenotype in ace2 knockout mice crackower et al 2002 yamamoto et al 2006 nakamura et al 2008 similarly in myocardial infarction loss of ace2 accelerates maladaptive left ventricular remodeling kassiri et al 2009 mechanistically the age-dependent cardiomyopathy in ace2 knockout mice is likely mediated by ang ii-induced oxidative stress and inflammation through at1 receptor downstream pi3k phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase signaling oudit et al 2007 of note one study reported that their knockout mouse line did not show alterations in cardiac function although these mice were not investigated under conditions of cardiac like pressure overload gurley et al 2006 gurley  coffman 2008 however these differences were resolved and appear to be dependent on modifier genes in different mouse background oudit et al 2007 thus ace and ace2 balance ang ii levels and contribute to maintaining heart functions through at1 receptorin addition to counterbalancing ang ii with ace the involvement of ang 17 and apelin in the actions of ace2 on controlling heart function has been postulated increasing evidences have shown the beneficial effects of ang 17mas receptor axis in pathological settings of the heart treatment with ang 17 peptide has been shown to improve myocardial performance cardiac remodeling and even survival in rodent heart failure models including ischemiareperfusion injury myocardial infarction hypertension-induced cardiomyopathy ferreira et al 2001 santos et al 2004 the nonpeptide ave-0991 a selective ligand for mas receptor has actions similar to the cardioprotective effects of ang 17 peptide ferreira et al 2007 and knockout mice of mas receptor displayed a reduced heart contractility alenina et al 2008 although there are accumulating literatures on ace2-ang 17-mas axis most of them are correlative studies on ace2 relationships with ang 17-mas system we still miss direct evidence linking functional causal relationships between ace2 and ang 17-mas system for instance whether ang 17 peptide or mas agonist can rescue ace2 knockout mouse heart phenotypes is not even challenged a connection of ace2 and ang 17-mas system is still elusive in addition to ang ii ace2 also acts on the peptides apelin-13 and apelin-36 with high catalytic efficiency in vitro vickers et al 2002 apelin-13 and apelin-36 are overlapped c-terminus fragments of 77 amino-acid apelin preprohormone and are generated from it by proteolytic cleavage tatemoto et al 1998 lee et al 2006 although systemic administration of apelin peptides prompts hypotension in rats and mice tatemoto et al 2001 ishida et al 2004 apelin knockout mice and apj apelin receptor knockout mice both showed little alterations in blood pressure at baseline interestingly apelin knockout mice showed aging- or stress-associated cardiac contractility defects similar to the heart phenotype of ace2 knockout mice implicating a potential in vivo interaction of ace2 with apelin kuba et al 2007 nevertheless there are no direct evidences of in vivo catalysis of apelin peptides by ace2 and further studies are awaitedin humans ace2 gene polymorphisms associate with parameters of left ventricular hypertrophy in men lieb et al 2006 and soluble ace2 activity is increased in patients with myocardial dysfunction and correlates with disease severity epelman et al 2008 implicating physiological roles of ace2 in patients for therapeutic applications of ace2 using transgenic overexpression of ace2 in the hearts the phenotypes are controversial one study showed that cardiac overexpression of ace2 protects the heart from ischemia-induced heart failure der sarkissian et al 2008 whereas in the others overexpression of ace2 was not beneficial leading to fatal arrhythmia and severe fibrosis donoghue et al 2003 masson et al 2009 the latter harmful effects may be due to the artifacts of transgenic gene overexpression since utilizing recombinant ace2 protein for therapeutic models has been recently shown to be beneficial in various disease models oudit et al 2010 treml et al 2010 wysocki et al 2010 neuronal control of heart function by ace2 in brains has also been demonstrated injections of the ace2 inhibitor mln4760 into the nucleus tractus solitarii reduced the baroreceptor reflex for reflex bradycardia in rats diz et al 2008 xia  lazartigues 2008 suggesting a role for ace2 and ras in controlling baroreceptor reflexin kidney ace2 is abundantly expressed crackower et al 2002 and the activity of ace2 is even higher in the kidney cortex than in heart tissue wysocki et al 2006 ace2 has emerged as a protective molecule against kidney diseases in the context of negative regulation of the ras soler et al 2008 oudit et al 2009 for instance deletion of ace2 leads to late-onset nephrotic glomerulosclerosis spontaneously oudit et al 2006 and accelerates diabetic kidney injury in akita diabetic mice wong et al 2007 and in streptozocin-induced diabetic mice tikellis et al 2008 in line with these results pharmacological ablation of ace2 by mln-4760 resulted in increased albuminuria and glomerular pathology in the kidneys of dbdb diabetic mice and streptozocin-induced diabetic mice ye et al 2006 soler et al 2007 these phenotypes are at least in part dependent on ang ii signaling and can be rescued by at1 receptor blockade ye et al 2006 soler et al 2007 thus these data definitely indicate that ace2 is physiologically renoprotective in hypertensive shr rats with the onset of hypertension the tubular expression of ace2 in the kidneys is downregulated compared to control rats diabetic nephropathy in experimental models has been shown to alter both glomerular and tubular expressions of ace2 in a long-term diabetic rat model renal ace2 expression is decreased tikellis et al 2003 whereas there is an early increase in ace2 expression and activity in the kidneys of diabetic dbdb ye et al 2004 wysocki et al 2006 and akita wong et al 2007 mice the highest expression of the ace2 mrna found in renal proximal tubules was significantly reduced in the tubules from diabetic rats tikellis et al 2003 thus reduced ace2 expression might contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of kidney diseases tikellis et al 2003 mizuiri et al 2008 reich et al 2008 renal expression of ace2 may play a more profound role in controlling local ras rather than regulating systemic blood pressure therefore ace2 counterbalances ace function negatively regulates ang ii levels and thereby controls local kidney homeostasisacute respiratory distress syndrome ards is the most severe form of acute lung injury which affects approximately one million individuals worldwideyear and has a mortality rate of at least 3050 hudson et al 1995 ware 2006 ards can be triggered by multiple diseases such as sepsis aspiration trauma acute pancreatitis or pneumonias following infections with sars coronavirus or avian and human influenza viruses previous studies of ace insertiondeletion id polymorphism correlation with severity of ards in humans marshall et al 2002 jerng et al 2006 and ace inhibitor treatments in rodent ards models raiden et al 2002 have suggested that the ras could have a role in ardsacute lung injuryintriguingly despite its normal lung structures and functions ace2 knockout mice exhibited very severe pathology of ardsacute lung injury compared with wild type control mice imai et al 2005 enhanced vascular permeability increased lung edema neutrophil accumulation and worsened lung function at1 blocker treatment or additional ace gene deficiency on an ace2 knockout background rescues the severe phenotype of ace2 single mutant mice in acute lung injury imai et al 2005 importantly treatment with catalytically active but not enzymatically inactive recombinant ace2 protein improved the symptoms of acute lung injury in wild type mice as well as in ace2 knockout mice imai et al 2005 furthermore in a recent study of large animals in sepsis ards models recombinant ace2 protein significantly improved the respiratory failure and increased the oxygen levels of ards in pigs treml et al 2010 thus in animal models of acute lung injury ace ang ii and at1 receptor function as lung injury-promoting factors while the negative regulation of ang ii levels by ace2 protects from lung injury imai et al 2005 moreover in other lung injury models like bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension ace2 has recently been shown to protect from chronic lung injuries fibrosis and pulmonary vasoconstriction ferreira et al 2009 yamazato et al 2009 these results suggest that ace2 may serve as an entirely novel therapeutic for chronic lung diseases as well as acute lung injury and the efficacy of recombinant ace2 protein or at1 receptor blockers on lung diseases should be further tested in clinical settingsduring several months of 2003 a newly identified illness termed severe acute respiratory syndrome sars spread rapidly through the world international cooperative teams swiftly isolated a novel coronavirus as the sars pathogen sars-cov and determined the sars-cov genome sequence marra et al 2003 rota et al 2003 surprisingly ace2 was identified as a functional receptor in vitro by using co-immunoprecipitation techniques li et al 2003 and subsequently in a mouse sars infection model with ace2 knockout mice ace2 was indeed identified as the essential receptor for sars infections in vivo kuba et al 2005interaction of sars-cov with ace2 is initiated via trimers of the sars spike protein which extends into a hydrophobic pocket of ace2 catalytic domain li et al 2005 this ace2spike interaction leads to endocytosis of virus particles through internalization with ace2 induces the fusion of virus and host cells and establishes sars-cov infection however this process does not require nor affect the peptidase activity of ace2 since cells expressing enzymatically inactive ace2 can still be infected with the sars-cov and ace2 substrates are still accessible to the catalytic pocket of ace2 when the sars spike protein is bound furthermore in the structure of sars spike-bound ace2 the catalytically active site of ace2 was not blocked by the sars spike protein li et al 2005 therefore ace2 functions as a sars receptor independently of its peptidase activityone mystery of sars-cov is why in contrast to the other coronaviruses such infections trigger severe lung disease with such high mortality accumulating evidence indicates that severe sars infections are dependent on the burden of viral replication as well as on the immunopathologic consequences of the host response lau  peiris 2005 perlman  dandekar 2005 in addition to the aberrant activation of the immune system our own studies have implicated a direct involvement of ace2 in sars pathogenesis intriguingly both sars-cov infection and challenge with recombinant sars-spike protein triggered a marked downregulation of ace2 expression in lungs and in cell culture kuba et al 2005 thus sars-cov-infected or spike protein-treated mice resemble ace2 knockout mice similar to ace2 mutant mice spike-treated wild type mice show markedly more severe pathology in acute lung injury kuba et al 2005 therefore downregulation of the sars receptor ace2 expression by sars-cov infection activates the reninangiotensin system and contributes to pathogenesis of severe ardsacute lung injury in sarsone of the clinical features of sars patients is the progressive and rapid deterioration of lung function and the obvious loss of lung repair capacity after the viral load has declined peiris et al 2003 although many studies demonstrated that sars receptor ace2-expressing cells are alveolar type-1 or type-2 pneumocytes or vascular endothelial cells a couple of recent studies suggested that lung epithelial stemprogenitor cells are also important for sars infection mouse oct-4 lung epithelial progenitor cells which arise from in vitro cultures of enzyme-released cells from neonatal lung tissues express ace2 and are the target cells for sars-cov infection in vitro and support active virus replication leading to their own destruction ling et al 2006 detailed expression analyses for mouse lungs revealed the highest expression of ace2 in late embryonic days e185 which declines after birth wiener et al 2007 and further supporting a role for ace2 in progenitor cells in sars-infected human patient lungs cd34oct4 lung progenitor cells are also positive for sars-cov antigens using immunohistochemistry while mature pneumocytes appear to be negative for sars-cov antigens chen et al 2007 interestingly in rabbit atherosclerosis models co-localization of ace2 in cd34oct4 cells was also observed in the atherosclerotic plaques zulli et al 2006 however it should be noted that ace2 expression is downregulated by sars infection at the transcriptional and post-translational level glowacka et al 2010
inoue et al 2007 haga et al 2008 wang et al 2008 and therefore one would actually expect low ace2-immunoreactivity in sars-cov infected cells nevertheless these observations suggest a potential role of ace2 for lung stemprogenitor cells in addition to type-1type-2 pneumocytes in the continued destruction of lung tissues and apparent loss in the capacity for lung repair after sars-cov infections further studies are however requiredhomology searches have shown that ace2 is a chimeric protein that has emerged from the duplication of two genes homology with ace at the catalytic domain and homology with collectrin in the transmembrane c-terminal domain the collectrin gene gene name transmembrane protein 27 tmem27 is located in immediate proximity to the ace2 locus on the x chromosome and both genes share similar transcription factor binding sites collectrin was shown to be expressed in -cells of the pancreas under the transcriptional control of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 hnf1 and its function was implicated as insulin exocytosis or -cell proliferation akpinar et al 2005 fukui et al 2005 surprisingly using gene-targeting studies of collectrin the physiological in vivo function of collectrin turned out to be a critical binding partner for amino acid transporters collectrin physically associates with numerous apical amino acid transporters in the kidney and controls their expression and transport functions danilczyk et al 2006 as a consequence collectrin mutant mice exhibit a marked defect in re-absorption of amino acids in the proximal tubules of the kidneys biochemically collectrin binds to b0at1-family amino acid transporters and controls polarized expression of these transporters on the cell surface danilczyk et al 2006 malakauskas et al 2007due to the high homology at its transmembrane with collectrin ace2 was also anticipated to play a role in amino acid re-absorption in kidneys however this was not the case rather ace2 binds to the b0at1 amino acid transporter in the intestine but not in the kidney kowalczuk et al 2008 camargo et al 2009 in ace2 knockout mice luminal expression of b0at1 in the intestine is completely lost suggesting that ace2 is essential for expression of b0at1 in cell surface of the intestine camargo et al 2009 thus ace2 and collectrin are both binding partners for b0at1 and contribute to absorption of neutral amino acids in intestine and kidney respectively although reasons for tissue-specific bindings of b0at1 to ace2 or collectrin are unknown hartnup disorder is a hereditary familial disease characterized by a pellagra-like light-sensitive rash cerebellar ataxia emotional instability and amino aciduria baron et al 1956 gene mutations in the b0at1 slc6a19 neutral amino acid transporter were identified as one cause of hartnups disorder kleta et al 2004 seow et al 2004 despite crucial roles of ace2 and collectrin in expression of this amino acid transporter gene mutations of ace2 and collectrin have not been identified in hartnups disease among the human hartnup mutations of b0at1 the a69t and r240q missense mutants were shown in vitro defective for activation of transport function by ace2 and collectrin in in vitro xenopus oocyte expression system the b0at1 mutants alone show similar levels of amino acid uptake to wild-type one although the transport rates are low seow et al 2004 camargo et al 2009 however when the mutants were co-expressed with ace2 transport function was not activated by the binding partners while the co-expression of ace2 and b0at1 dramatically activates transport functions thus mutations in hartnup disorder patients interfering with the interaction between b0at1 and ace2 may explain the disease in some individuals on the other hand ace2 knockout mice were not reported for any phenotypes recapitulating hartnup disorder also in hartnup patients for instance a compound heterozygous for a69t and the original hartnup mutation ivs82t-g showed only seizures but not other symptoms like pellagra or ataxic gaits camargo et al 2009 therefore the physiological significance of this impaired activation of the mutants by ace2 is yet elusive and further analyses for the role of the mutations would be neededstudies of ace2 knockout mice and gene transfer or administration of recombinant ace2 protein have demonstrated that ace2 is an in vivo negative regulator of the both systemic and local effects of the ras systems through peptidase activity the carboxypeptidase activity of ace2 appears to limit the availability of ang ii generates counter-regulatory vasodilator peptides such as ang 17 and may even act on other peptide systems such as apelin and dynorphin importantly ace2 was also identified as a key sars receptor and plays a protective role in sars-mediated ards these findings are now providing the opportunity to develop a potential novel medicine for the treatment of ards an often lethal condition that can develop in emerging infectious lung diseases such as avian influenza h5n1 or the swine flu h1n1 during the course of studying ace2 function we also made an entirely unexpected finding ace2 and collectrin are essential for expression of amino acid transporters in the gut and kidney respectivelythe discovery and functional characterization of ace2 have shown that the ras system is far more complex and that this system is tightly connected to other peptide systems and even amino acid transport functions an understanding of such complexity and molecular crosstalks will not only broaden our knowledge on the evolution and biology of cardiovascular systems but will also offer a chance to develop new and refined therapeutic strategies for various diseasesthe covid-19 coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 infecting one million and killing more than 50000 people worldwide as of april 2 has fueled enormous interest in the mechanisms whereby this new coronavirus causes acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multiorgan failure the estimated 79 infection rate from undocumented cases in covid-19 patients li et al 2020 and the high lethality of the infections along with its enormous socio-economic impact emphasize the importance of fully understanding these mechanisms for developing effective treatment strategiesearly in 2020 reports of the full rna sequence of the sars-cov-2 virus highlighted its remarkable similarity with the sars-cov virus which was responsible for a global outbreak that killed 774 people in 2003 xu et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 as the processes whereby the sars-cov virus infects the lung cells had been already identified kuba et al 2005 and it was held that sars-cov-2 uses identical mechanisms these discoveries allowed an unprecedented acceleration of knowledgesince 2005 it was known that sars-cov uses the angiotensin converting enzyme ace2 as its receptor to infect cells ace-2 is highly expressed in the vascular endothelium kuba et al 2005 and also in the lungs particularly in endothelial and type 2 alveolar epithelial cells hamming et al 2004 the resemblances of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 include a 765 homology in the amino acid sequence of the spike s protein of the envelope that both viruses use to infect mammalian cells with a 4 amino acid residue difference the sars-cov and the sars-cov-2 s protein share an almost identical 3-d structure of the receptor binding domain xu et al 2020 and moreover binds to ace-2 with even higher affinity than sars-cov wrapp et al 2020 which may explain its virulence and predilection for the lungsupon binding to ace-2 both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 activate the transmembrane serine protease-2 tmprss2 which is highly expressed in the lungs through fusion of its envelope with the cell membrane the virus penetrates into the cells figure 1 panel a heurich et al 2014 hoffmann et al 2020 of note sars-cov-2 entry can be prevented by sars convalescent sera containing neutralizing antibodies or by tmprss2 inhibitors such as camostat hoffmann et al 2020 and nafamostat mesylate both approved in japan for clinical use for other indications yamamoto et al 2016 these seminal discoveries suggested several potential therapeutic strategies to prevent sars-cov-2 entry into pulmonary cells zhang et al 2020 figure 1 panel aare there similarities between ace-1 the target of aceis and ace-2 the target of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 this is obviously the essential question for physicians using aceis or angiotensin-receptor blockers arbs which are frequently prescribed in a multitude of patientsboth ace-1 and ace-2 cleave angiotensin peptides figure 1 panel b however they differ markedly ace-1 cleaves the dipeptide his-leu from angiotensin i thus generating angiotensin ang ii which causes vaso- and broncho-constriction increases vascular permeability inflammation and fibrosis and thereby promotes the development of ards and lung failure in patients infected with the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 yang et al 2015 figure 1 panel bcompelling evidence from animal models of ards lung fibrosis asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease indicate that these effects are essential for ards to develop and that both aceis and arbs block the disease-propagating effect of ang ii dhawale et al 2016 imai et al 2005 kaparianos and argyropoulou 2011ace-2 which is expressed more abundantly on the apical than the basolateral side of polarized alveolar epithelial cells jia et al 2005 shares only 42 amino acid sequence homology with ace-1 harmer et al 2002 it cleaves only one amino acid residue leu or phe from ang i and ang ii respectively to generate ang 1-9 and ang1-7 figure 1 panel b importantly ang1-7 counteracts the at1r-mediated aforementioned detrimental effects induced by ang ii in the lungs accordingly genetic deletion of ace-2 worsens experimental ards kuba et al 2005 while ang1-7 and aceis or arbs administration improve it imai et al 2005 wsten-van asperen et al 2011 thus blunting the ace-1ang iiat1r axis while enhancing the ace-1ang iiat2r the ace-2ang1-7-at2r or the ace-2ang1-7masr receptor axes figure 1 panel b likely protects from ards triggered by infectious pathogens including coronaviruses dhawale et al 2016 imai et al 2005 kaparianos and argyropoulou 2011 meng et al 2014after ace-2 was identified as the sars-cov-2 receptor hoffmann et al 2020 yan et al 2020 unexpectedly and almost immediately it was contended that treatment with aceis and arbs would be harmful for covid-19 patients this hypothesis was quickly spread in the public causing confusion and fear in patients taking these drugs who started asking themselves and their doctors if they should discontinue these medications and replace them with of antihypertensive drugs of other classesthe confusion caused in the medical community and the public was due to the publication of two commentaries containing simple hypotheses in the absence of supporting evidence in one commentary ace-2 was suggested to be secreted at higher amounts in patients with cardiovascular disease than in healthy individuals and in another it was also stated that ace-2 levels can be increased by the use of aceis zheng et al 2020 albeit no evidence of this occurring in the lungs exists these hypothetical phenomena were put forward to suggest and enhanced susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection and thus to warn patients about taking these drugscorrespondence to the lancet respiratory medicine suggested that patients with cardiac diseases as hypertension andor diabetes treated with ace-2-increasing drugs would be at higher risk for severe sars-cov-2 infection because treatment with aceis and arbs would raise ace-2 fang et al 2020 to support their contention the authors quoted a review article that however did not report such evidence li et al 2017 to the contrary a search of the literature revealed that no data that would support such notion exist in fact evidence of ace-2 upregulation applies to the heart likely as a compensatory phenomenon to underlying conditions for example myocardial infarction burrell et al 2005 ishiyama et al 2004 ocaranza et al 2006 rather than to the drug treatment per semoreover in neither commentary the authors considered the fact that increased plasma levels of ace-2 generated by delivering soluble forms of rhace-2 andor increasing shedding of ace-2 from the cell membrane can capture the s protein of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov in plasma thus preventing the virus from binding to lung cells two strategies that have been suggested to protect against sars-cov-2 infection of the lungs kruse 2020 zhang et al 2020 figure 1 panel anonetheless the publication of simple hypotheses unsubstantiated by any data spread so fast in public and news portals that scientific societies including the european society of hypertension esh the italian society of cardiology and the italian society of arterial hypertension were required to release statements to confirm that there is no evidence that aceis and arbs could jeopardize covid-19 patients and there is no need to recommend discontinuing treatment to date italy is the country with the highest number of sars-cov-2-positive individuals in the european union and the highest official number of deaths in the world on march 17th 2020 a joint statement of the presidents of the hfsaaccaha bozkurt et al 2020 followed by one of the european medicines agency 2020 and several experts opinion articles reported and affirmed that there is no evidence to support discontinuing aceis and arbs danser et al 2020 greene et al 2013 perico et al 2020 a notion also shared by the editors of the new england journal of medicine rubin et al 2020in our view these neutral recommendations could even be an understatement in fact in two large meta-analysis and a case-control study involving over 21000 patients in several high-risk categories of patients including stroke survivors shinohara and origasa 2012 in an asian population caldeira et al 2012 liu et al 2012 and also in patients with parkinsons disease wang et al 2015 aceis were superior to other antihypertensive agents in pneumonia preventionthe experimental data obtained for the sars-cov virus also show that these drugs can be protective rather than harmful which lead to the proposition of specifically enhancing the protective arm of the renin-angiotensin system as a novel therapeutic strategy for pulmonary diseases tan et al 2018 moreover abrupt withdrawal of raas inhibitors in high-risk patients including those who have stage 3 arterial hypertension heart failure or who had myocardial infarction may result in clinical instability and adverse health outcomes as pointed out recently vaduganathan et al 2020the at1r-mediated detrimental effects of ang ii were demonstrated in several models of ards sars-cov-induced acute respiratory failure imai et al 2005 kuba et al 2006 kuba et al 2005 moreover with its vasodilatory anti-inflammatory anti-proliferative and antifibrotic effects activation of the ace-2ang1-7at2r ace-2ang1-7masr pathways counterbalances the harmful effects of the ace-1ang iiat1r pathway on the lungs a reduced ratio of ace-1ace-2 has been documented in ards furthermore experimentally ards and lung fibrosis can be prevented by administration of ang1-7 cao et al 2019 or arbs wsten-van asperen et al 2011 indicating that ace-2 activation limits pulmonary disease progression this implies not only that aceis and arbs are unlikely to be detrimental in covid-19 patients but that they likely will be protective whether the same applies to drugs that block the mineralocorticoid receptor and antagonize aldosterone another downstream mediator in the ace-1ang iiat1r pathway remains unknownin endothelial and lung type 2 alveolar epithelial cells sars-cov-2 downregulates ace-2 kuba et al 2005 and thereby the ace-2ang1-7masr pathway imai et al 2008 this would also suggest that aceis and arbs can be beneficial by blunting the ace-1ang iiat1r pathway and counterbalancing the down-regulation of ace-2 figure 1 administration of recombinant soluble human ace-2 rhace-2 to capture sars-cov-2 in the bloodstream may prevent its binding to lung cells and enhance ace-2 activity in lung tissue figure 1 panel a which could be beneficial for covid-19 patients with ards possibly even at a late stage of the infection for patients in intensive care requiring assisted ventilation along these lines in 2017 a pilot trial in patients with ards conducted in ten us intensive care units supports the value of this strategy in that rhace-2 increased levels of both ang1-7 and alveolar surfactant protein d levels and tended to lower the concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 khan et al 2017in summary a disbalance between the ace-1-ang ii-at1r and the ace-1ang iiat2r and the ace-2-ang1-7-at2r and the ace-2ang1-7masr pathways contributes to the pathogenesis of ards and acute lung failure which likely is also relevant for covid-19 patients therefore it seems reasonable to conclude that rebalancing the system by blunting the deleterious effects of ang ii using aceis and arbs while enhancing the ace-2 axis is a valuable strategy to minimize the harmful effects of sars-cov-2 on the lungs in the majority of patients with cardiovascular diseases mainly hypertension heart failure or ischemic heart disease who are on aceis or arbs and at risk of becoming infected or have been infected by sars-cov-2 but do not need mechanical ventilation there is no evidence for deleterious effects of acei or arbs in fact discontinuing these life-saving medications potentially can be harmful
