molecular evolution and phylogenetic analysis of sars-cov-2 and hosts ace2 protein suggest malayan pangolin as intermediary host luciano lopes rodrigo giancarlo de mattos cardillo paulo paiva bandiera  an emergence of a novel coronavirus causative agent of covid19 named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 occurred due to cross-species transmission coronaviruses are a large family of viruses able to infect a great number of hosts entrance of sars-cov-2 depends on the surface s protein interaction with host ace2 protein and cleavage by tmprss2 ace2 could be a species-specific barrier that interferes with bat-to-human coronavirus cross-species transmission molecular analysis supported bats as natural hosts for sars-cov and involved them in mers-cov origin the genomic similarity between bat ratg13 cov strain and sars-cov-2 implicates bats in the origin of the new outbreak additionally there is a hypothesis for the zoonotic transmission based on contact with malayan pangolins by humans in huanan seafood market in wuhan china to investigate bats and pangolin as hosts in sars-cov-2 cross-species transmission we perform an evolutionary analysis combining viral and host phylogenies and divergence of ace2 and tmprss2 amino acid sequences between cov hosts phylogeny showed sars-like-cov-2 strains that infected pangolin and bats are close to sars-cov-2 in contrast to tmprss2 pangolin ace2 amino acid sequence has low evolutionary divergence compared with humans and is more divergent from bats comparing sars-cov with sars-cov-2 origins pangolin has yet lower ace2 evolutionary divergence with humans than civet-the main intermediary host of sars-cov thus pangolin has become an opportune host to intermediates bat-to-human sars-cov-2 jump and entry  transmission route was constructed based on contact with malayan pangolins manis javanica by visitors of huanan seafood market in wuhan china 10  the linkage with huanan market was done due to few cases of pneumonia in the city of wuhan associated with the sars-cov-2 11  today the involvement of the huanan market with covid19 origin seems controversial 12 13  however molecular epidemiologic studies also confirmed animal handlers as the earliest infected with sars-cov in 2002-2003 outbreaks 7  the presence of bats and bat products in food and traditional medicine markets occurs due persistent viral infection without clinical symptoms 14  contact between bats and wild animals may occur because bats live among a large number of different animal species that is also commercialized in animal markets giving opportunity to coronavirus transmission 7  furthermore other wild animals can be infected by coronavirus after eating partially digested fruits by bats that were spitted out and fall to the ground with residual bat saliva or part of insects discarded by infected bats 15  these routes allow viral infection by a diverse set of animals such as palm civets and malayan pangolins involved in sars-cov and sars-cov-2 origins respectively 7 10 15  in humans sars-cov and sars-cov-2 are rapidly spread by respiratory droplets airborne routes or direct contact 16  while cov related with cold is limited to upper respiratory tract infection sars-cov invades pneumocytes in the lower respiratory tract lungs 17 18  the first viral interaction with host cells occurs when receptor-binding domains rbds from viral spike or surface s protein attach ace2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 host receptor 6  expression of ace2 appears to be essential for sars-cov sars-cov-2 infection in airway epithelia 18 19  subsequently sars-covsars-cov-2 employ tmprss2 transmembrane protease serine 2 for cell host entry thanks to its cleavage activity 19  tmprss2 is known to cleave and activate the s protein of sars-cov 20 and also plays a role in the spread and immunopathology of sars-cov and mers-cov in the airways 21  receptor recognition for sars-cov is considered one of the main barriers between animal species and humans 22  high variation in the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 s proteins seems to be essential to lead animal-to-human transmission to human-to-human transmission 23  to investigate bats and pangolin as hosts in sars-cov-2 jump to human we performed evolutionary analysis based on viral and host molecular phylogenies and also evolutionary divergent pairwise analysis based on 87 amino acid sequences from cov s protein we inferred a maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis  fig 1  using phyml 33v software to phylogenetic tree inference and mega x to find the best substitution model supplementary table 1  rooted by cold-related 229e cov the phylogenetic tree formed three distinct clades clade 1 includes two main clusters clade 1a formed by sars-cov together with sars-like-cov isolated from bats and civets and clade 1b formed by sars-cov-2 together with sarslike-cov-2 isolated from bats and malayan pangolin clade 2 encompasses mers-cov strains interspersed with camel-covs and also includes some bat cov strains related with mers-cov pandemic sars-cov-2 strains clustered significantly close with ratg13 cov and pangolin cov strains see clade 1b according to the cov s protein analysis the phylogenetic tree revealed that the distance between sars-cov-2 and ratg13 cov is shorter than that between sars-cov-2 and pangolin cov then pangolin cov s protein is closest to s protein from sars-cov-2 behind bat ratg13 cov behind pangolin covs bat cov strains isolated in china in 2015 and 2017 are noted followed by a cluster with bat covs also identified in china during 2004-2014 clade 1b we reinforce the scenario that suggests that sars-cov-2 transmission chain began from bat and reached the human the diverse set of covs infecting bats frequently associated with fast-evolving cov s protein propriety might have favored the epidemic from animal to human the close position of sarslike-cov-2 isolated from pangolins indicates that this species has a potential role along the sars-cov-2 transmission chain clade 1 b pangolin cov strain isolated in march 2019 is very closer to ratg13 cov and to sars-cov-2 than sars-like-cov-2 from other pangolins isolated in 2017-2018 the occurrence of recombination between sars-like-covs from pangolin and bats or even convergent evolution must be considered as possible events for the sars-cov-2 origin phylogenetic tree showed that bat covs are strongly related with sars-cov sars-cov-2 and also with mers-cov deep evolutionary and adaptation between bats and viruses contribute to asymptomatic state but spreading coronavirus to humans 25 26  although bats are considered as natural hosts and reservoirs for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 camels may be the natural host of mers-cov 27  the close relation between camel cov with mers-cov clade 2 indicates camel as a direct source of mers-cov however the mers-cov ancestor might have circulated among bat species due to mers-like-cov persistence in bat populations mers-cov took a different evolutive way from sars-cov and sars-cov-2 in contrast to sars-cov and sars-cov-2 which use ace2 to invade the host mers-cov uses cd26 expressed by host mers-cov s protein likely only recognizes conserved cd26 sequences furthermore mers-cov s protein rbd sequence is considered more conserved comparing with sars-cov and sars-cov-2 s protein 8  despite the fast-evolving s protein capacity bat cov transmission to humans appears to be limited by a barrier then intermediary hosts might be necessary to overcome genetic barriers to favor the start of human coronavirus disease outbreaks host molecular repertoire used by coronavirus cycle and invasion including ace2 and tmprss2 proteins could be a species-specific barrier to coronavirus 22  ace2 appears to have slow evolutionary rates between vertebrates 28  thus to infer the host susceptibility we perform a phylogenetic analysis based on 23 ace2 amino acid sequences  fig 2a  including bats species humans primates felids canids murine and other ones all amino acids sequences were obtained by ncbi protein database wwwncbinlmnihgovprotein ace2 phylogenetic tree inferred by bayesian method was highly supported by posterior probability values see fig 2c  we also constructed a heat map based on pairwise divergence matrix to complement phylogenetic analysis best substitution models to perform phylogeny and pairwise divergence matrix were selected see supplementary table 1  according to our results the phylogenetic topology conserved homo sapiens closer to other primates in a monophyletic group with low divergent amino acid sequences within this group as expected bat species also composed a monophyletic group humans and bats are evolutionary divergent and phylogenetically distant shown by ace2 pairwise divergence matrix and tree malayan pangolin mt084071 sequence was translated from annotated coding region obtained from ncbi genbank

the optimal log likelihood 26256243 is shown bootstrap values calculated for 100 replications are shown next to the nodes of cladogram b initial trees for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying neighbor-join and bionj algorithms a discrete gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites 4 categories  g parameter  07168 the tree is drawn to scale with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site there were a total of 1494 positions in the final dataset phylogenetic analyses were conducted in phyml v33 24 and the trees were formatted with the figtree v131 software httptreebioedacuksoftwarefigtree respectively phylogenetic tree presented bats closer to a clade that includes pangolin and civet than humans are despite the phylogenetic position humans have lower evolutionary divergence in comparison with pangolin and civet than these animals have with bats we display the evolutionary divergence values in table 1  comparing humans with pangolincivet we found lower evolutionary divergence values with pangolin than with civet thus considering ace2 interaction as a host barrier that protects humans from zoonotic pathogens sars-cov-2 in bats may require some intermediate mammalian hosts to jump to humans to start the outbreak like civet was required for intermediary host to favor sars-cov origin we further inferred a bayesian phylogenetic tree based on tmprss2 amino acid sequences fig 2b  supported with high posterior probabilities values see fig 2d  this tree presented pangolin close to bats

evolutionary divergence between ace2 and tmprss2 sequences were based on the number of amino acid substitutions per site from between sequences analyses were conducted using the jtt matrixbased model by mega x software 30  and heat maps were performed by microsoft excel tm software molecular similarity of tmprss2 from sars-cov and sars-cov-2 susceptible hosts is suggestive that the molecule seems not to be an important barrier to emerging human coronaviruses probably the sars-cov-2 entry into host cells interaction with ace2 receptor appears to be the main challenge while most of sars-cov-2 phylogenetic studies are focusing in viral phylogenies we contributed with host analysis based on ace2 and tmprss2 in summary we report and conclude that sars-like-cov-2 strains infected pangolin and bats and are phylogenetically close to sars-cov-2 thus our phylogenetic analysis based on sars-cov-2 s protein supports the hypothesis of sars-cov-2 transmission chain began from bat had malayan pangolin as intermediary host and infected humans considering cov s protein as the key to invade host cell through host ace2 we explore this host molecule as base of analysis to understand the role of the hosts in the origin of sars-cov-2 ace2 sequence from pangolin has low evolutionary divergence compared with humans but is more divergent from bats taken together combined viral and host evolutive analysis corroborated the hypothesis of malayan pangolin as intermediary host in sars-cov-2 origin looking back through coronavirus outbreak histories wild animal chains appear to be necessary frequent jumps of bats virus produce potential infections or short transmission chains that resolve with no adaptation to sustained transmission 33  therefore repeated opportunities may promote zoonotic events resulting in coronavirus outbreaks for sars-cov there were broad evidences suggesting civet as the main intermediary host 7 34 35  our results also indicated civet as an important player in sars-cov origin civet might be infected by sars-like-cov and has intermediary ace2 divergence between humans and bats comparing sars-cov with sars-cov-2 origins pangolin ace2 amino acid sequence has yet lower evolutionary divergence with humans while civet ace2 sequence is more divergent compared with humans thus pangolin has become an opportune host to intermediates bat-to-human sars-cov-2 jump and entry differently from bats which are able to suppress viral replication pangolin is an amplifying host which allows the increase of viral load and probably favored sars-cov-2 jump to human host and human-to-human transmission subsequently the recurrent emergence of zoonotic disease outbreaks caused by coronavirus alerts once more for the implementation of strict rules to decrease or eliminate consumption and domestication or even the ban on wildlife markets authors contributions lrl made the conception of the work with gmc contribution lrl obtained and curated the

patientsserum sputum or throat-swab specimens from 19 patients with sars associated with 5 nosocomial infections and 1 laboratory-contamination incident were collected for the present study for each patient data on the date at onset of the disease and on possible sources of infection were gathered by trained interviewers table 1 we also downloaded for our phylogenetic-tree analyses 20 complete taiwanese sars-cov sequences from genbank for 10 of these sars-cov strains have been described elsewhere 11 
epidemiological investigationto track the origins of sars cases in taiwan we used sars-treatment reports written by physicians and submitted by their respective hospitals to taiwans cdc we also sent trained interviewers to all hospitals that reported nosocomial infections to gather additional assessment data we based our investigation on the who definition of sars 20 
analysis of sars-cov sequence variation and selection of variable regions for phylogenetic analysiscomplete nucleotide sequences from 20 sars-cov isolates available from genbank were aligned by the bioedit program 21 the sequence variations were analyzed by the simplot program httpsraymedsomjhmieduraysoftsimplot genomic sequences from civet-cat sars-cov strains sz-3 and sz-16 were used as standards for comparison 19 sequence-variationdistance plots were generated by use of an 800-bp window a 200-bp step and a jukes-cantor correction initially 4 variable regions sc18 sc22-23 sc27 and sc28 which contain snvs of different sars-cov genotypes 17 were combined for phylogenetic analysis because the resultant phylogenetic tree was not satisfactory we added another 2 variable regions sc10 and sc20 based on the sequence-variation plot figure 2 
comparison of conventional and proposed strategies for
phylogenetic analysisthree methodsneighbor joining nj fitch and wagner parsimony pars and maximum likelihood mlwere used for comparison of the conventional ie complete genome and proposed strategies the proposed strategy for phylogenetic analysis entailed the deletion of conserved domains and the combination of minimal variable regions the mega2 and phylip36 software packages were used to construct the phylogeny 2224 and 80 sars-cov sequences downloaded from the genbank database were used for the comparison a bootstrap analysis of 100 replicates was used to compare the robustness of the nj and pars trees generated by the conventional strategy versus that of the nj and pars trees generated by the proposed strategy 25 for the ml method the p value for branch length was calculated by use of the hidden markov model before the conventional and proposed strategies were compared 26 
rt-pcr and sequencingrna was extracted from serum sputum or throat-swab specimens by qiaamp viral-rna minikits qiagen rt-pcr primer pairs for the 6 sars-cov variable regions are listed in table 2 rt-pcr was performed in a single-tube reaction qiagen using primers from each region the pcr thermocycler program consisted of predenaturing for 4 min at 95c 35 cycles of denaturing for 30 s at 95c annealing for 30 s at 52c and initial extension at 68c for 3 min and final extension at 68c for 10 min the pcr product was gel-purified for dna sequencing by use of an abi prism 3700 dna analyzer applied biosystems for the laboratory-contamination case multiple primers 17 were used for complete genome sequencing superscript iii rt invitrogen was used for production of cdna and a race kit roche was used to amplify the 5 and 3 ends of cdna both strands of the pcr product were analyzed and the resultant sequences were assembled by use of the seqman ii software package version 50 lasergene 
analysis of the nucleotide-signature patterns of different waves of epidemic sars infectionto perform the analysis of nucleotide-signature patterns representative sars-cov strains with complete sequences were chosen from each wave of epidemic sars infection in taiwan in addition cases that were of unclear origin were also included in the analysis the nucleotide sequence of sars-cov strain urbani 16 was used as a prototype for the comparison 
development of a proposed strategy for phylogenetic analysis of sars-cov isolatespairwise comparisons were used to analyze sequence variations among 20 sars-cov isolates the results show that the 3 region of the viral genome had the highest sequence variation especially near the junction of replicase 1b and the spike genes figure 2 six variable regionssc10 sc18 sc20 sc22-sc23 sc27 and sc28were chosen for testing the proposed strategy for phylogenetic-tree analysis the total length of the sequences in these 6 regions was 5287 nt using 3 phylogenetic analytical methods we compared for 80 sars-cov isolates the topology and robustness of the phylogenetic tree generated by the proposed strategy which uses only these 6 regions versus the topology and robustness of the tree generated by the conventional strategy which uses the complete genome sequences as shown in figure 3 the topology of the nj tree generated by use of the complete genome sequence was almost identical to that of the nj tree generated by use of a combination of the 6 variable regions similar results were obtained for the pars trees and the ml trees data not shown to compare the robustness of trees generated by the proposed method versus that of trees generated by the conventional method we focused on the bootstrap values for 3 bifurcation nodes between sars-cov clusters node a between civet-cat sars-cov and human sars-cov node b between sars-cov subgroups a1 and a2 and node c between sars-cov subgroups a and b in the nj trees the bootstrap values for nodes a b and c were respectively 100 100 and 63 for the conventional method versus 96 83 and 66 for the proposed method figure 3 similar results were obtained for the pars trees generated by these 2 methods table 3 for the ml tree generated by the proposed method all p values for bifurcation nodes between different clusters were 01 for the ml trees generated by the conventional method the only node with a p value 01 occurred at the bifurcation node between civet-cat sars-cov and human sars-cov table 3 
phylogenetic analysis of sars-cov infections in taiwan the proposed method is useful for study of the molecular epidemiology of sars-cov strains both because of its compatibility and because it can obtain results by using fewer specimens in addition it is more economical and less time-consuming we applied this tool to better understand the entire complement of taiwanese sars-cov isolates including the 20 that had been published previously and the additional 19 identified in the present study epidemiological information nasopharyngeal aspirates and serum samples were collected from 18 patients with sars who were treated at 6 taiwanese hospitals table 1 the sars-cov from a laboratory worker patient scvj who contracted sars during december 2003 was sequenced and analyzed an nj tree was constructed and the results showed that all 39 taiwanese sars-cov isolates belonged to subgroup b and could be divided into 3 clustersb1 b2 and b3 integration of the results of the phylogenetic analyses and the epidemiological information figure 4 indicated that there were 5 waves of epidemic sars-cov infection in taiwan during 2003 the first wave during early march was composed of 1 imported case 2 cases of transmission between family members strain tw1 and 1 nosocomial infection strain tw3 in cluster b1 both sars-cov strain tw1 and sars-cov strain tw3 were clustered with other sars-cov strains linked to hotel m in hong kong 8 17 the second wave strain tw5 consisted of 4 taiwanese individuals who contracted the disease as they flew from hong kong to beijing 9 and who then carried it back to taiwan during mid-march the third wave which began in late march consisted of an infection that occurred on a train patient tw-hp1 a case of transmission between family members strain tc1 and multiple nosocomial infections all tw-hp patients and patients tw-gd1 tw-gd-3 and tw-gd4 in cluster b2 all the sars-cov isolates mentioned above clustered with the sars-cov isolates from amoy gardens strains cuhk-ag01 cuhk-ag02 and cuhk-ag03 27 with a bootstrap value of 71 the fourth wave which started during late april and ended in mid-june contained sars-cov isolates not only from hospitals jc kc ph gd patients tw-gd2 and tw-gd5 and ym but also from sporadic community outbreaks strains tw10 and tw11 and all of these sars-cov isolates belonged to cluster b3 with a bootstrap value of 71 the fifth wave occurred during early december and began with a laboratory-contamination case patient scvj it clustered with both hku-39849 a sars-cov strain used in the laboratory 14 and twc another strain from taiwan 12 sequence-variation rates for the strain from patient scvj versus strain twc and for the strain from patient scvj versus strain hku-39849 were respectively 001 329756 and 004 1229756 in addition a 24-nt deletion occurred at nucleotide position 2613226155 resulting in both a frameshift of open reading frame 4 and a deletion of 8 aa residues within the small-envelope glycoprotein as shown in figure 5 there were 27 snvs and 1 dinucleotide deletion among 14 sars-cov isolates 12 of the 27 snvs were nonsynonymous changes distinctive snvs were identified for each wave of epidemic sars infection in taiwanat nucleotide position 3165 for wave 1 at nucleotide positions 3852 11493 and 26477 for both wave 3 and wave 4 and at nucleotide positions 26203 and 27812 for wave 4 the nucleotide-signature pattern between the strain from patient scvj the laboratory-contamination case and strain twc consisted of 2 snvs at nucleotide position 1632526600 and 1 dinucleotide deletion at nucleotide position 2780827809 when for phylogenetic analysis we combined sequences from different variable regions of the sars-cov genome we assumed that no dual infection or recombination between the sars-cov subgroups had occurred because sars is an acute infectious disease the odds that it will be contracted from 2 subgroups are very low furthermore the strategy of combining different genomic regions for phylogenetic analysis has been used in molecular epidemiological investigations of the origins of hiv-2 in those studies the evolutionary history of a simian immunodeficiency virushiv-2 lineage was reconstructed by use of a combination of partial gag and env sequences the method increased the accuracy of the phylogenetic analysis 28 it is noteworthy that the simplot analysis demonstrated that the 3 region of the viral genome especially near the junction of replicase 1b and the spike genes encoding protein s had the greatest sequence variation figure 2 the s protein is considered to be the most important target for the humoral and cellular immune responses to sars-cov 15 16 the 3 algorithms most commonly used in molecular phylogenetic analyses are the nj ml and pars methods we used all 3 to obtain tree topologies in terms of robustness a bootstrap value of 70 is often cited as a cutoff for a reliable cluster 25 although the bootstrap values for nodes a and b in the nj and pars trees generated by the conventional method were higher than those in the nj and pars trees generated by the proposed method the difference was not statistically significant in contrast the bootstrap values for node c in the pars trees generated by the conventional and proposed methods were 56 and 67 respectively and the corrresponding bootstrap values in the nj trees were 63 and 66 this finding was confirmed by the ml trees the p value for node c in the tree generated by the conventional method was not statistically significant and that for node c in the tree generated by the proposed method was 01 accordingly the tree generated by the proposed method was more reliable also because the proposed method requires only 7 rt-pcr reactions to perform the analysis it is less time-consuming and more efficient than the conventional method to facilitate other laboratories future molecular epidemiological studies of outbreaks of sars we have made the nucleotide-sequencealignment file of 80 sars-cov reference strains available on our centers web site httpwwwymedutwaidsmolepi in the present study we used 39 taiwanese sars-cov isolates including 20 downloaded from the genbank database to trace the origin and the path of dissemination of sars-cov infections that occurred in taiwan during 2003 phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the taiwanese sars-cov strains were distributed in 3 clustersb1 b2 and b3which differ from clusters 13 reported by yeh et al 11 the latter clusters were not defined on the basis of a bootstrap value whereas we used a bootstrap value of 70 as the cutoff to define our clusters b1b3 therefore our cluster b1 contains both cluster 1 and cluster 2 of yeh et al and their cluster 3 was divided into 2 clustersb2 and b3in our study on the basis of the epidemiological data for the patients with sars who were considered in the present study it is clear that taiwan experienced 5 waves of epidemic sars infection during 2003 the first and second waves were in different phylogenetic clusters suggesting that they had different origins although both the second and the third waves were in the b2 cluster the sars-cov isolates in the third wave had their own nucleotide-signature pattern figure 5 neither the first wave nor the second wave led to serious outbreaks but the third waveoriginating with a resident of amoy gardens who visited taiwanled to 1 transmission on a train strain twc3 1 case of transmission between family members strain tc1 and nosocomial infections in at least 2 hospitals hp and gd in northern taiwan only 1 nucleotide difference between strains tc1 and twc3 was noted figure 5 in addition strain twc3 and an amoy gardens strain cuhk-ag01 shared an identical sequence even though the woman who was the source of the isolate of strain twc3 never left taiwan at any time during the epidemic an epidemiological investigation showed that the visitor from amoy gardens and this woman sat in different cars during the train ride because this is the first documented case in which there is molecular proof of transmission on a train it raises the question of why only 1 passenger contracted the infection because it has been reported that sars appears to be most infectious at 611 days after onset of illness and not during the first day of symptoms 29 we assumed that the visitor from amoy gardens was not highly infectious during the train ride even though he developed symptoms during the same evening that he traveled from taipei to taichung it is important to note that twc the sars-cov strain isolated from patient twc clustered with whu an isolate from wuhan city china in cluster 1 but did not cluster with either strain tc1 direct sequencing of a sample from patient twc or strain twc3 direct sequencing of a sample from patient tw-hp1 figures 3 and 4 in addition there was a 7-nt difference between twc and tc1 figure 5 if we assume that strain cuhk-ag01 represents the first-generation sars-cov in the transmission link then both strain tc1 and strain twc3 were the second-generation and twh was the third-generation according to the snv-based analysis figure 5 the number of nucleotide changes in the sars-cov genome per number of intermediate hosts was extremely low 1 nt changehost because it has also been shown that no or very limited nucleotide changes occur in sars-cov sequences from either cultures or primary clinical specimens 11 30 we can tentatively conclude that strain twc is a laboratory contaminant and did not originate from patient tc1 the origin of the fourth wave cluster b3 is still unknown the molecular epidemiological data suggest that it originated at hospital jc patient tw-jc2 and then spread to hospitals kc ph gd and ym as well as to others the epidemiological investigations also support this hypothesis tw-ph1 a patient with sars who was treated at hospital jc went to kaohsiung city and received treatment at hospital kc and after being treated at hospital kc table 1 went back to penghu island and was hospitalized in hospital ph where he transmitted the disease to other health-care workers as shown in figure 6 after combining the epidemiological data with the results of our phylogenetic-tree analysis we conclude that the fourth wave of epidemic sars infection progressed in 2 dissemination paths the first path was from hospital jc to hospital kc in kaohsiung and then to hospital ph on penghu island the second path was from hospital jc to hospital gd and then to hospital ym two cases associated with community outbreaks in taipei strains tw10 and tw11 also belong to this cluster with regard to the laboratory contamination the laboratory researcher said that he had used sars-cov strain hku-39849 for his experiment however our results indicate that the sequence in patient scvj is more closely related to that of strain twc figure 5 because the researcher claimed that he had not obtained strain twc from taiwans cdc and that he had used many clinical sars-cov strains besides hku-39849 we are continuing our investigation to confirm both 1 whether the virus that he had obtained from taiwans cdc was in fact strain hku-39849 or strain twc and 2 which sars-cov strain that he handled was the source of the laboratory contamination because 30 imported sars cases have been reported by taiwans cdc but have not yet been analyzed we plan to use the proposed tool to conduct further analyses in an attempt to identify their origins these contact histories will provide valuable information for the control of future sars infections the sars-cov nucleotide sequences 6 sequences for each of 18 strains identified during this research have been deposited in genbank accession numbers ay451856ay451963 the

moiz bootwalla alex ryutov ananthanarayanan govindarajan david ruble jennifer han timothy triche j jennifer dien bard jaclyn biegel a alexander judkins r xiaowu gai  effective response to the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic requires genomic resources and bioinformatics tools for genomic epidemiology and surveillance studies that involve characterizing full-length viral genomes identifying origins of infections determining the relatedness of viral infections performing phylogenetic analyses and monitoring the continuous evolution of the sars-cov-2 viral genomes the childrens hospital los angeles chla covid-19 analysis research database card httpscovid19cpmbiodevnet is a comprehensive genomic resource that provides access to full-length sars-cov-2 viral genomes and associated meta-data for over 30000 as of may 20 2020 isolates collected from global sequencing repositories and the sequencing performed at the center for personalized medicine cpm at chla reference phylogenetic trees of global and usa viral isolates were constructed and are periodically updated using selected high quality sars-cov-2 genome sequences these provide the baseline and analytical context for identifying the origin of a viral infection as well as the relatedness of sars-cov-2 genomes of interest a web-based and interactive phylogenetic tree browser supports flexible tree manipulation and advanced analysis based on keyword search while highlighting time series animation as well as subtree export for graphical representation or offline exploration a virus genome tracker accepts complete or partial sars-cov-2 genome sequence compares it against all available sequences in the database 30000 at time of writing detects and annotates the variants and places the new viral isolate within the global or usa phylogenetic contexts based upon variant profiles and haplotype comparisons in a few seconds the generated analysis can potentially aid in genomic surveillance to trace the transmission of any new infection using chla card we demonstrate the identification of a candidate outbreak point where 13 of 31 chla internal isolates may have originated we also discovered multiple indels of unknown clinical significance in the orf3a gene and revealed a number of usa-specific variants and haplotypes  coronavirus disease 2019  caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 continues to spread rapidly across the globe wu et al 2020 zhu et al 2020  sars-cov-2 is a ssrna virus that belongs to the genus betacoronavirus within the coronaviridae family which also includes sars-cov and mers-cov as of may 2020 at the time of writing there have been over 5 million confirmed cases globally over one third of the global cases are in the united states of america with the u s death toll exceeding 95000 since the emergence of widely available genomic sequencing rigorous genomic surveillance and contact tracing gire et al 2014  coupled with extensive testing have come to play critical roles in understanding disease transmission routes inferring outbreak points and taking informed measures in containing infections the department of pathology and laboratory medicine at childrens hospital los angeles chla launched the centers for disease control and prevention cdc rt-pcr assay for sars-cov-2 on march 13 th  a sars-cov-2 whole-genome sequencing research assay on march 26 and an anti-sars-cov-2 antibody igg test on april 10 th  2020 testing was conducted on a broad population including patients at chla and other institutions within the los angeles metropolitan area to better understand the spread of the covid-19 pandemic globally nationally and locally we sought to develop the necessary bioinformatics tools and resources to help guide effective infection control and prevention strategies at our hospital and across los angeles county there are multiple sars-cov-2 data repositories gisaid httpswwwgisaidorg elbe and buckland-merrett 2017 shu et al 2017 is the major repository for rapid sharing of covid-19 data across the globe gisaid stores sars-cov-2 genome sequences and associated clinical geographical and epidemiological data the ncbi virus httpswwwncbinlmnihgovlabsvirusvssi and the china national center for bioinformation 2019 ncov resource httpsbigdbigaccnncov zhao et al 2020 are other major resources across these repositories however meta-data and naming conventions are not standardized nor are the data consolidated to overcome this limitation the chla center for personalized medicine cpm created the covid-19 analysis research database card and has been continuously collecting consolidating and curating full-length sars-cov-2 data from across the world while there is a significant lack of covid-19sars-cov-2 genomic resources and bioinformatics tools in general nextstrain is an outstanding exception httpsnextstrainorgncov hadfield j et al 2018  it serves as a great resource for understanding how the covid-19 pandemic has been spreading globally nexstrain tools are visually appealing and highly interactive however despite its critical role in the epidemiological studies of covid-19 it lacks the functionality for analyzing user-supplied data nor does it allow for sophisticated interactive tree manipulation required by scientists for in-depth interrogation of likely infection patterns therefore to complement nextstrain and to serve the advanced needs of scientists we developed a highly interactive phylogenetic analysis platform the platform allows for flexible tree operations interactive displays of much larger trees stratified by various types of metadata and importantly provides for interrogation of likely origins of user submitted genome sequences which are useful in genomic surveillance the key to rapid genomic surveillance of a particular genome sequence is to precisely place it within the geographically complete and temporally up-to-date phylogenetic contexts combined with accurate clinical records and patient contact history this would aid in identifying the likely source of infection for this reason and assuming the viral sequence can be reliably determined using a next-generation sequencing method of choice by the users we focused on genome comparison variant calling variant annotation and variant profiling against the global virus isolate collection in order to identify the identical more ancestral or likely descendent isolates in order to reveal the potential route of transmission chla card can provide such an analysis taking only a few seconds per genome to generate and return results dynamically embedded in global usa and local phylogenetic trees that can be visualized and manipulated through the web interface system design and modules our ultimate goal is to develop a centralized genomic resource to provide sars-cov-2 full-length viral sequencing data analysis and reporting functions for both internal and external needs to accomplish these goals we needed to a assemble a comprehensive genomic database of full-length sars-cov-2 genome sequences collected from covid-19 samples worldwide b pre-compute baseline phylogenetic trees of published highquality sars-cov-2 sequences globally nationally and locally c build a web portal for interactive querying of sars-cov-2 sequences and associated meta-data d implement online bioinformatics tools for interactive phylogenetic analysis and visualization e develop a suite of bioinformatics tools for sars-cov-2 genome comparison variant calling and functional annotation f devise phylogenetic analysis tools to infer transmission patterns and to determine the origins of infections and g establish an application programming interface api that allows programmatic access to results in json format such that this resource can be integrated into other sars-cov-2 analytical pipelines seamlessly these represent components of our overall system design goal and constitute the modules of chla card the chla internal sars-cov-2 sequencing data were generated using the sars-cov-2 whole genome sequencing research assay established by the chla center for personalized medicine and the virology laboratory pandey et al in preparation  the major external resources of sars-cov-2 strains genome sequences and variants were gisaid genbank cncb and nextstrain data were downloaded in various formats depending on the exact implementations of these external resources the retrieved data were post-processed merged reformatted and loaded into a mysql database within this database a master table is created to store merged and normalized viral meta-data from these resources based upon a template that is compatible with nextstrains meta-data table this master table is continuously updated to ensure chla card provides the most up-to-date and comprehensive sars-cov-2 data to end users the viral genome sequences and metadata are cross-examined to identify and to remove duplicate entries present in multiple resources variant calls were generated either internally based on the genome sequences or downloaded directly from china national center or bioinformation cncb and were formatted by incorporating standard conventions functional annotations and virus information thus the compiled reference database consists of a comprehensive set of full-length sars-cov-2 genome sequences their variants relative to the sars-cov-2 reference sequence nc0455122 strains and associated meta-data currently as of 05202020 chla card contains data from 30000 sars-cov-2 strains over 30000 complete genome sequences and more than 7000 variants statistical and categorical analyses of these reported isolates and variants reveal some notable differences between the united states usa and non-usa isolates across genes and for different annotation classes figure 1  table s1  for missense variants the number is highest in orf1ab polyprotein 1191 variants were seen at least three times in 21535 non-usa isolates and 589 variants in 5915 usa isolates this is expected because this is a large gene 21290 base pairs or 711 of the virus genome figure 1  the shorter surface glycoprotein s gene which is only 3822 base pairs in length contains about 15 of the missense variants or 252 for non-us and 106 for usa isolates at a similar variant density as orf1ab it is noteworthy that envelope protein gene orf3as in-frame deletions and frameshift deletions are only identified in isolates from usa 12 australia 6 uk 5 china 5 and spain 2 but not in other countries there are recurrent deletions around base positions 26157-26161 including 7 frameshift deletions and 4 disruptive and 5 conservative inframe deletions from both usa and non-usa isolates the mutation and haplotype analysis using chla card revealed multiple interesting observations already the missense mutation frequencies are significantly higher than that of synonymous mutations in the same genes for example the numbers are 178 vs 81 22x in n gene and 252 vs 144 175x in s gene for the non-usa isolates figure 1  comprehensive haplotype profiling identified wide-spread country-and state-specific haplotypes which together involved about 292 of us isolates which points to the effectiveness of existing travel restriction policies and public health measures in controlling the transmission of sars-cov-2 shen et al in submission phylogenetic analysis and reference phylogenetic trees viral genome sequences are quality benchmarked by counting the missing bases the length deviation from the reference sequence nc0455122 and the quality scores if available when constructing different subsets of global or country-specific fasta datasets the demographic meta-data is used as an inclusion filter for the proper sequences the reference sequence nc0455122 is always included and mn996532 batyunnanratg132013 coronavirus sequence is included to serve as the outgroup to root the phylogenetic tree multiple sequence alignment msa was conducted with mafft version 7460 katoh et al 2002 katoh and toh 2008 using speed-oriented method fft-ns-i iterative refinement method two cycles optimized for large datasets the resulting msa files were visually examined all alignments with gaps over 3 bases or smaller gaps that resulted from inserted n missing bases are removed the 5-and 3-end bases are trimmed because they are often of lower quality the evolutionary history was inferred by using the maximum likelihood method and general time reversible model nei and kumar 2000 in mega x kumar et al 2018  initial trees for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying neighbor-joining and bionj algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the maximum composite likelihood mcl approach and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value all positions with over 2 alignment gaps missing data and ambiguous bases were excluded the trees with maximum likelihood were kept as the reference trees for visualization at the web portal these trees are periodically updated as new genome sequence data are acquired collection the chla card virus genome tracker provides 1 quick comparison of fasta sequences from complete or partial viral genomes to the reference nc0455122 genome for

of identical or similar variant profiles haplotype across the country or world or strains with additional private variants thus likely descendants in the evolutionary tree or strains with fewer variants but similar haplotype thus likely ancestral in the evolutionary tree these findings along with the geographic location the collection date and the patient contact history may aid in the tracing of transmission route the employed strategy is genome comparison followed by snp profiling where the query can be the viral sequence in fasta format variants in vcf format or just a free-style list the global sars-cov-2 isolate collection is matched by shared variant profile of input data the matched isolates are ranked and classified into 3 match levels 1 level 1 matches have identical match ratio 10 or minimal private variants match ratio 10 compared with the input isolate and thus could be identical haplotype 2 level 2 matches have more additional private variants than level 1 thus maybe the descendants and 3 level 3 matches have fewer variants and thus may be more ancestral the level 1 and 2 top-match isolates are visualized and automatically highlighted on the pre-built reference phylogenetic trees of either global or usa-specific isolates  angeles the chla cpm sequenced 31 viral isolates with its sars-cov-2 whole genome sequencing research assay pandey et al in preparation  we analyzed the complete genomes of these isolates by two strategies 1 virus genome tracker which placed these 31 genomes into the global isolate context in a few minutes and 2 a refining strategy that merged them onto the reference usa phylogenetic tree see figure 2  the virus genome tracker strategy using the consensus sequences correctly picked similar external isolates for refined phylogenetic analysis identical-variantlevel 1 matches epiisl415543  epiisl415544 figure 2  and descendentlevel 2 match epiisl424890  mt325610 merging these results onto the reference usa phylogenetic tree we could demonstrate that there is a branching point where 13 of 31 cases center around and make up 9 out of 13 branches from this point this point is in the middle of the transmission route inferred from traversing the phylogenetic tree below a large number of washington state samples among these cases were three members from the same household this provides a real case example as to how the virus genome tracker and the chla card facilitated the identification of similar isolates which can serve as the proxy to query isolates and to place them onto the prebuilt phylogenetic trees in just a few minutes customized urls to the reference trees are automatically generated by virus genome tracker for visualization and exploration  chla card is an integral part of the effort made by the chla department of pathology and laboratory medicine to assemble and to make widely available our strategy and tools for clinical testing genomic assays and bioinformatics expertise to address the covid-19 pandemic this genomic resource enables and empowers genomic epidemiology studies to understand the origin and spread of sars-cov-2 globally nationally and locally it also provides in-depth understanding of how the viral genome evolves as the disease spreads across the globe the virus genome tracker utilizes mummer for super-fast genome alignment and comparison which combined with the mysql database backend can return results within a few seconds 5 sec from a search against over 30000 virus isolates it supports both whole genome and partial genome sequences and is thus suitable for handling the consensus sequence data derived from various sequencing strategies furthermore we integrated the genomic variants with gene annotations and population-level data using the smooth scrolling and zooming capability of jbrowse genome browsing for user-friendly browsing and exploration to our knowledge there are no published online tools suitable for rapid typing of new sars-cov-2 virus isolates that provide similar functionalities as chla card which is empowered by rich viral sequences isolates geographic information and phylogenetic data the genome detective coronavirus typing tool cleemput et al 2020 is capable of online sequence but not variant analysis and has very limited sars-cov-2 data with no interactive phylogenetic analysis and visualization together this genomic resource provides users access to the covid-19 bioinformatics tools and a comprehensive database of viral genome sequences including multiple sequence alignments variants with functional annotations and population frequencies and precomputed phylogenetic trees all accessible through the website and the sars-cov-2 viral genome browser our pilot study using internal cases demonstrates our capability for generating the genomic epidemiology data required to aid in the development of clinical policies and decision making such as devising quarantine and containment strategies modifications to the algorithm and visualization tools employed for virus transmission inference and tracing are in progress to incorporate spatial-temporal-travel data a mobile version of the web

animal host and crossspecies analyses of sarscov2 xingguang li junjie zai qiang zhao qing nie yi li brian foley t antoine chaillon   on 11 february 2020 the international committee on taxonomy of viruses officially renamed the novel coronavirus ie previously 2019ncov responsible for the current outbreak of covid19 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 this was chosen based on analysis of the new coronaviruss evolutionary history and associated pathogen ie sarscov the virus which emerged in december 2019 in the chinese city of wuhan causes a respiratory illness called covid19 which can spread from person to person
1
 
2
 as of 21 february 2020 there have been 76 288 cases of sarscov2 confirmed in mainland china including 11 477 serious 2 345 deaths and 20 659 discharged as well as 68 cases in hong kong 10 in macao and 26 in taiwan more than 1300 cases have also been confirmed in at least 27 other countries on four continents world health organization who officials outlined their top research priorities for controlling the outbreak of the coronavirusassociated disease known as covid19 and highlighted the importance of developing candidate therapeutics and easytoapply diagnostics for identifying active asymptomatic and resolved infections of note the coronaviridae family not only includes sarscov2 but also sarscov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov and common cold viruses eg 229e oc43 nl63 and hku1
3
 the sarscov pathogen was responsible for 8 000 cases and 774 deaths in 37 countries during the 2002 to 2003 sars outbreak
4
 
5
 
6
 and the merscov pathogen was responsible for 2 494 cases and 858 deaths in 27 countries during the 2012 mers outbreak
7
 
8

 coronaviruses are known to circulate in mammals and birds previous studies revealed that both sarscov and merscov are zoonotic in origin originally coming from bats
9
 
10
 
11
 
12
 with sarscov spreading from bats to palm civets to humans
13
 
14
 
15
 and merscov spreading from bats to camels to humans
16
 
17
 recent research has also reported that the sarscov2 virus likely originated in bats a proposal based on the similarity of its genetic sequence to that of other known coronaviruses
18
 however like sarscov merscov and many other coronaviruses the sarscov2 virus may have been transmitted to humans by an intermediate animal host
19
 therefore the identity of the animal source of sarscov2 remains a key and urgent question furthermore to stem future outbreaks of this type and preventing the transmission of zoonotic diseases to humans should be a top research priority the existence of an intermediate animal host of sarscov2 between a probable bat reservoir and humans is still under investigation the discovery of a virus closely related to the newly emerged sarscov2 in a data set from pangolins sampled more than a year ago illustrates that the sampling of other mammals handled or consumed by humans could uncover even more closely related viruses
20

 during a press conference on 7 february 2020 two researchers shen yongyi and xiao lihua from the south china agricultural university in guangzhou identified the pangolin as a potential source of the sarscov2 virus based on genetic comparison of coronaviruses taken from pangolins and from humans infected during the recent outbreak by analyzing more than 1 000 metagenomic samples and using molecular biology testing they found that the positive rate of  coronavirus in pangolins was 70 and that the genome sequence of an isolated virus strain was 99 similar to that of the sarscov2 virus thus whether pangolins acted as a direct intermediate animal host of the sarscov2 virus is worth further investigation in the present study we performed analyses of the transmission dynamics and evolutionary history of the virus based on 70 genomes of sarscov2 strains sampled from australia n  4 belgium n  1 china hubei province n  19 guangdong province n  16 zhejiang province n  4 taiwan n  1 finland n  1 france n  4 germany n  1 japan n  1 korea n  1 singapore n  3 thailand n  2 united kingdom n  2 and united states n  10 with sampling dates between 24 december 2019 and 3 february 2020 we reanalyzed two of the 21 pangolin metagenome samples from previously published data
20
 and compared the amino acid sequences of the s protein of sarscov2 and sarsrelated coronaviruses these analyses should extend our understanding of the origins and dynamics crossspecies transmission and subsequent host adaptation of the sarscov2 outbreak in china and elsewhere as of 9 february 2020 73 genomes of sarscov2 strains obtained from humans have been released on gisaid httpgisaidorg

 the betacovwuhanipbcamswh022019 epiisl403931 betacovshenzhenszth0012020 epiisl406592 and betacovshenzhenszth0042020 epiisl406595 samples show evidence of sequencing artefacts due to the appearance of clustered spurious single nucleotide polymorphisms snps and were thus excluded from this study the final data set dataset70 included 70 genomes of sarscov2 strains from australia n  4 belgium n  1 china n  40 finland n  1 france n  4 germany n  1 japan n  1 korea n  1 singapore n  3 thailand n  2 uk n  2 and usa n  10 with sampling dates between 24 december 2019 and 3 february 2020 of the 40 samples collected from china 19 were from hubei province 16 were from guangdong province 4 were from zhejiang province and 1 was from taiwan table s1 to investigate the potential intermediate hosts of sarscov2 between originating animal and human hosts two samples srr10168377 and srr10168378 obtained from previously reported malayan pangolin manis javanica viral metagenomic sequencing data bio project prjna573298 were downloaded from the ncbi sra public database
20
 after assembly the srr10168377 and srr10168378 genomes were 16 999 and 6 392 bp in length respectively we defined another data set dataset6 composed of six genome sequences of coronavirus strains betacovwuhanhu12019 epiisl402125 was grouped as clade a one betacovbatyunnanratg132013 epiisl402131 and two batslcovzc45 mg772933 and batslcovzxc21 mg772934 sarsrelated coronaviruses were grouped as clade b and clade d respectively the two assembled genomes from srr10168377 and srr10168377 were grouped into clade c the two data sets dataset70 and dataset6 were aligned using mafft v7222
22
 and then manually curated using bioedit v725
23

 to assess the recombination of dataset70 we employed the pairwise homoplasy index phi to measure the similarity between closely linked sites using splitstree v4151
24
 the bestfit nucleotide substitution models for the two data sets were identified according to the bayesian information criterion bic method with 3 24 candidate models or 11 88 candidate models substitution schemes in jmodeltest v2110
25
 to evaluate the phylogenetic signals of dataset70 and dataset6 we performed likelihoodmapping analysis
26
 using treepuzzle v53
27
 with 25 000 to 175 000 randomly chosen quartets for the two data sets for dataset70 split network analysis was performed using kishinoyano85 distance transformation with the neighbornet method which can be loosely thought of as a hybrid between the neighborjoining nj and split decomposition methods implemented in treepuzzle v53 for dataset70 nj
28
 phylogenetic trees were constructed using the kimura 2parameter method
29
 implemented in mega v7026
30
 for dataset6 nj
28
 phylogenetic trees were constructed using the maximum composite likelihood mcl method
31
 and rate variation among sites was modeled with a gamma distribution shape parameter  4 in mega v7026
30
 for dataset70 maximumlikelihood ml phylogenies were reconstructed using the hasegawakishinoyano hky
29
 nucleotide substitution model in phyml v31
32
 for dataset6 ml phylogenies were reconstructed using the general time reversible
33
 nucleotide substitution model with gammadistributed rate variation among sites gtr  g model in phyml v31
32
 for all nj and ml phylogenies of the two data sets bootstrap support values were calculated with 1 000 replicates
34
 and trees were midpoint rooted for dataset70 regression analyses were used to determine the correlations among sampling dates and roottotip genetic divergences of the respective ml phylogenies with tempest v15
35
 we also estimated the evolutionary rate and time to the most recent common ancestor tmrca for dataset70 using ml dating in the treetime package
36

 to reconstruct the evolutionary history of sarscov2 bayesian inference through a markov chain monte carlo mcmc framework was implemented in beast v184
37
 with the beagle v212 library program
38
 used for computational enhancement we used two schemes to set the timescale prior for each data set that is constrained evolutionary rate method with a lognormal prior mean  10  103 substitutions per site per year 95 bayesian credible interval bci 1854  104 to 4  103 substitutions per site per year placed on the evolutionary rate parameter as per previous studies
39
 
40
 
41

 we divided dataset6 into four clades ie clade a clade b clade c and clade d with clade a designated as the query group dataset70 included 70 genomes of sarscov2 strains sampled from australia n  4 belgium n  1 china hubei province n  19 guangdong province n  16 zhejiang province n  4 taiwan n  1 finland n  1 france n  4 germany n  1 japan n  1 korea n  1 singapore n  3 thailand n  2 uk n  2 and usa n  10 with sampling dates between 24 december 2019 and 3 february 2020 table s1 the samples were primarily from china 5714 and hubei province 2714 the chinese province was acknowledged as the original epicenter of the sarscov2 outbreak for dataset70 and dataset6 hky and gtr  g were the models of bestfit respectively across the two different substitution schemes ie 24 and 88 candidate models according to the bic method and were thus used in subsequent likelihoodmapping and phylogenetic analyses for the two data sets the phi tests of dataset70 did not find statistically significant evidence of recombination p  10 likelihoodmapping analysis of dataset70 revealed that 697 of the quartets were distributed in the center of the triangle indicating a strong starlike topology signal reflecting a novel virus which may be due to exponential epidemic spread figure 1a likewise 259 of the quartets from dataset6 were distributed in the center of the triangle indicating a strong phylogenetic signal figure 1b the split network generated for dataset70 using the neighbornet method was highly unresolved and the phylogenetic relationship of dataset70 was probably best represented by a network rather than a tree figure 1c the existence of polytomies indicatedin contrast to that expected in a strictly bifurcating treean explosive starlike evolution of sarscov2 both the nj and ml phylogenetic analyses of sarscov2 dataset70 also showed starlike topologies in accordance with the likelihoodmapping results figures 2 and s1 the ml phylogenetic tree showed greater starlike topology than the nj phylogenetic tree indicating that the ml method was more reasonable for dataset70 roottotip regression analyses between genetic divergence and sampling date using the bestfitting root showed that dataset70 had a minor strong positive temporal signal r

 this result implies increasing genetic divergence of sarscov2 in human hosts figure 1a consistent with the findings of our earlier studies

 split network analysis for sarscov2 dataset70 using the neighbornet method was highly unresolved indicating an explosive starlike evolution of sarscov2 and recent and rapid humantohuman transmission figure 1c these results are consistent with the ml phylogenetic analyses which showed polytomy topology from dataset70 figure 2 however nj phylogenetic analyses showed a more bifurcating tree topology compared with the ml phylogenetic analyses figure s1 this is a good example showing the differences between nj and ml phylogenetic construction methods dataset70 had a minor strong positive temporal signal based on roottotip regression and ml dating analyses figures 3 and s2 with the estimated tmrca dates and evolutionary rates for sarscov2 found to be nearly identical using both analyses table 1 the estimated tmrca dates and evolutionary rates for sarscov2 were very similar across different clock models and coalescent tree priors using the tipdating method the estimated tmrca dates and evolutionary rates for sarscov2 were also very similar across different clock models using the constraineddating method but highly distinct across the different coalescent tree priors table 1 the tmrca estimated by the tipdating method was relatively narrower than that determined by the constraineddating method consistent with our previous studies

47
 bayesian analyses with the tipdating method using a strict clock as well as constant size coalescent tree prior indicated that sarscov2 is evolving at a rate of 124  103 substitutions per site per year table 1 in accordance with our prior research

 and similar to that found for other human coronaviruses

 our results also suggest that the virus originated on 24 november 2019 which is in further agreement with our earlier studies

 we identified eight phylogenetic clusters number of sequences 2 to 7 with posterior probabilities between 099 and 10 using bayesian inference figure 4 we also identified six transmission clusters number of sequences 2 to 23 when the genetic distance between the sarscov2 strains was 0001 substitutionssite figure 5 however our conclusions should be considered preliminary and explained with caution due to the limited number of sarscov2 genome sequences presented in this study as more genome sequences become available there may be stronger amonglineage rate variation over time as to warrant using a relaxed clock model but we anticipate that the evolutionary rates and tmrca dates will be broadly similar to those estimated here as the number of substitutions is still small it is tempting to speculate that sequencing errors could have a considerable impact on the evolutionary rate and tmrca date estimates we removed three sarscov2 genome sequences ie betacovwuhanipbcamswh022019 epiisl403931 betacovshenzhenszth0012020 epiisl406592 betacovshenzhenszth0042020 epiisl406595 with potential sequencing errors but these may have less impact on the above estimates when more substitutions of sarscov2 are accumulated over time we also expect that as more sarscov2 genome sequences become available the estimated 95 bcis of the evolutionary rates and tmrca dates will be narrower we found that the pangolincov virus from the two pangolin samples was clustered with the sarscov2 virus with 100 bootstrap support however betacovbatyunnanratg132013 was more similar to the sarscov2 virus than to the pangolin coronavirus and the human sarscov2 virus clade a showed a unique peptide prra insertion not found in the other three clades clade b clade c clade d this insertion constitutes an rrar motif in the spike protein at the junction of s1 and s2 junction in the human sarscov2 virus after considering the next amino acid r of the unique peptide prra figure s6 of note the highly favored motifs for furin cleavage are argxarglysarg rxrr or rxkr and the minimal motifs for furin cleavage can be rxxr
48
 we also note that some of the other coronaviruses have a furin motif in almost the same location in their spike proteins
49
 
50
 lentiviruses have an rkxr r arginine k lysine x any amino acid site between gp120 and gp41 cleaved by furin to convert gp160 into subunits

 therefore it is tempting to speculate that cleavage or lack of cleavage of the spike protein at this site could significantly impact host range and transmissibility taken together the pangolin coronavirus samples srr10168377 and srr10168378 were less similar to the sarscov2 virus than to the betacovbatyunnanratg132013 virus and did not have the rrar motif therefore we concluded that the human sarscov2 virus which is responsible for the current outbreak of covid19 did not come directly from pangolins however due to the limited viral metagenomic data obtained from pangolins we cannot exclude that other pangolins from china may contain coronaviruses that exhibit greater similarity to the sarscov2 virus in conclusion our results emphasize the importance of further epidemiological investigations genomic data surveillance and experimental studies of the role of the unique furin cleavage motif rrar of sarscov2 in the spike protein at the junctions of s1 and s2 such work could positively impact public health in terms of guiding prevention efforts to reduce sarscov2 transmission in real time and to stem future outbreaks of zoonotic diseases the authors declare that there are no conflict of interests xl conceived and designed the study and drafted the manuscript xl bf and ac analyzed the data xl qn jz qz yl bf and ac interpreted the data and provided critical comments all authors reviewed and approved the final manuscript  monophyletic relationship between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and group 2 coronaviruses guan zhu hsuan-wien chen   in the short amount of time since a novel coronavirus was identified as being the cause of the ongoing outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars around the world 1 several sars coronavirus cov isolates have been cloned and several complete genomic sequences have been determined 24 preliminary sequence analyses have indicated that sars cov is a new type of coronavirus that does not belong to any group of coronaviruses yet characterized 2 3 however the phylogenetic position and origin of sars cov remain elusive most reported phylogenetic analyses have been based on either individual proteins 2 3 5 short nucleotide sequences 1 or whole-genome similarity 6 although these analyses have not yielded conflicting results the phylogenetic relationship between sars cov and its relatives remained inconclusive whereas most reported phylogenetic trees have placed sars cov between group 2 covs and group 3 covs a few trees have indicated that there is a relationship between sars cov and group 3 covs 13 5 it is notable that both sars cov and infectious bronchitis virus ibv a group 3 cov form long branches in all reported phylogenetic trees because it implies that theremight have been a problem associated with a long-branch attraction lba artifact during the tree reconstructions 7 an lba artifact might be caused by limited taxa a small number of amino acid or nucleotide positions or highly variable regions of nucleotide sequences any of which could generate misleading phylogenetic information during the tree-reconstruction process to further define the phylogenetic relationship between sars cov and other coronaviruses we took advantage of recently published sars cov genome sequences and constructed a single large data set composed of 3364 well-aligned amino acid positions because the 7 proteins used to construct the data set appeared to have different long branches 13 5 the effect of an lba artifact in tree reconstruction should be minimized the aim of the present study was to apply reliable analytical methods to the construction of a robust hypothesis about the phylogeny of sars cov in relation to other coronaviruses

results the data set was composed of 7 concatenated protein sequences ie 3clpro pol hel s e m and n obtained from 7 coronavirus isolates and a partition-homogeneity test 14 revealed no significant incongruence between phylogenetic trees derived from different proteins the best trees were inferred from the data set by the ml bi and mp methods 811 all of which yielded the same tree topology and supported the hypothesis that the relationship between sars cov and group 2 covs is monophyletic figure 1 the statistical supporting values at all nodes were 100 by ml quartet-puzzling bi posterior-probability and mp bootstrapping analyses pairwise comparison of protein distances corrected by the ml method also showed that the intergroup distance between sars cov and group 2 covs was the shortest compared with those between sars cov and other coronaviruses table 1 the sars cov  group 2 covs clade was subsequently joined by ibv a group 3 cov the separation of sars cov and ibv was more evident in the trees resulting from the present study than in previously reported protein trees in which sars cov and ibv were either minimally separated by very short branches or artificially joined at deep branches 13 the hypothesis that the relationship between sars cov and group 2 covs is monophyletic was fully supported by the kh test in which the ml values of all the other 944 possible trees were shown to be significantly worse than that of the present best tree when a more conservative sh test was employed only 19 suboptimal trees did not show significant differences in their ml values compared with the tree shown in figure 1 among these 19 trees 13 supported the hypothesis that the relationship between sars cov and group 2 covs is monophyletic and only 6 either placed sars cov at the base of group 2 covsgroup 3 covs or identified it as a sister to group 3 covs therefore the sh test did not reject the best tree but rather implied that there are strong links between sars cov group 2 covs and group 3 covs in addition the hypothesis that the relationship between sars cov and group 2 covs is monophyletic is supported by a recently reported phylogenetic analysis using the replicase gene 15 
discussion despite the evidence supporting a monophyletic relationship between sars cov and group 2 covs the data currently available still support the preliminary conclusion that sars cov might be a new type of coronavirus ie group 4 the problem of the origin of sars cov cannot be resolved hereit may require the identification and sequencing of additional closely related coronaviruses from humans andor animals nonetheless the establishment of a solid phylogenetic relationship between sars cov and other coronaviruses may provide us with valuable information to use in the development of vaccines and therapeutics and may in the near future help shed light on the true origin of sars cov  a snapshot of sars-cov-2 genome availability up to april 2020 and its implications data analysis travis sanchez brianna chrisman sierra scott thiebes carla mavian simone marini mattia prosperi marco salemi   in december 2019 a novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was identified in wuhan china as the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease covid-19 as of may 2020 this virus had spread to more than 187 countries 12 common symptoms of infection include fever cough and shortness of breath while severe cases are characterized by advanced respiratory distress and pneumonia often resulting in death 3 it is still unknown how many infected people who present mild or no symptoms can spread the virus however a recent study showed that in wuhan roughly 60 of all infections were spread by asymptomatic people 4 this characteristic significantly thwarts the work of public health officials who are attempting to detect transmission clusters such as the ones identified in china 56 and singapore 7 through epidemiological contact tracing soon after the first epidemiological and genetic sequence data of sars-cov-2 were made available a glut of phylogeny-based analyses began to circulate in scientific papers as well as on social media discussing the origin and variants of the virus as well as the countries that may have fueled its spread 8-10 the implications of misunderstanding the real dynamics of the covid-19 pandemic are extremely dangerous ethnic or social discrimination resulting from unsupported assumptions on viral contagionwhich are often amplified by irresponsible uncontrollable communicationscan be highly damaging for people and countries although social media platforms are often vehicles for fake news and hype tremendous efforts are being made by the scientific community to provide free up-to-date information on ongoing studies as well as critical evaluations in particular the us-based nextstrain 11 team has been posting real-time updates on the tracing of the epidemic by molecular analyses several discussions and evidence-based debates on controversial hypotheses on the epidemic have ensued eg the number of untraced infections in the us the putative introduction of the virus to italy through germany 12 and the alleged lineage diversification in china 13 which was later criticized 14 another example is a recent study that identified three geographically separated variants of sars-cov-2 based on a phylogenetic network inferred from 160 full genomes available on march 3 2020 10 this work was widely covered by the news media 15 however it was also highly criticized by experts in the field for its inaccurate use of phylogenetic methods incorrect rooting of the phylogeny and significant sampling bias 16-18 an editorial published in science 19 also highlighted how unsupported or misleading claims circulating in forums social media and even peer-reviewed articles have resulted from substantial overinterpretation of the available data hence there is an urgent need to reframe the current debate in more rigorous scientific terms and quantitatively evaluate whether sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies currently exists or whether gaps need to be addressed here we present an in-depth longitudinal analysis of the phylogenetic information on sars-cov-2 genomes that became available between march and april 2020 to assess their reliability for molecular epidemiology studies the gisaid global initiative on sharing all influenza data database 20 was accessed on march 18 march 25 march 30 and april 24 2020 table s1 in multimedia appendix 1 and table s2 in multimedia appendix 2 our main analyses compared the march 30 data set with the april 24 data set after quality control of sequences that were not full genomes or contained extensive stretches of unknown nucleotides separate sequence alignments were generated using mafft alignment software 21 each sequence alignment included all sequences collected on a given date march 18 794 genome sequences from 35 countries march 25 1662 genome sequences from 42 countries march 30 2608 genome sequences from 55 countries and april 24 8992 genome sequences from 63 countries before carrying out any phylogeny-based analysis of virus evolution and spatiotemporal spread it is crucial to test the quality of the sequence data since uneven sampling the presence of phylogenetic noise and the absence of a temporal signal can affect the reliability of the results eg ancestral state reconstructions molecular clock calibrations 22 sars-cov-2 full genome alignments generated from sequences in gisaid 23 at different time points were analyzed as follows transitiontransversions vs genetic distance plots were generated using dambe6 24 the presence of phylogenetic signals satisfying resolved phylogenetic relationships among sequences was evaluated by likelihood mapping analysis 25 using iq-tree and allowing the software to search for all possible quartets using the best-fitting nucleotide substitution model 25 likelihood mapping analysis estimates the likelihood of each of possible tree topology for any group of four sequences quartet randomly chosen from an alignment and reports them inside an equilateral triangle the likelihood map where the corners represent distinct tree topologies and the center represents star-like trees quartets are considered to be resolved when the three likelihoods are significantly different ie a phylogenetic signal and most dots equally distributed in the corners indicate that the data are suitable for robust phylogeny inference quartets are considered to be unresolved or partially resolved when two or all three of the likelihood values are not significantly different ie phylogenetic noise and most dots distributed in the side or center areas indicate that the data may not be sufficient for robust phylogeny inference extensive simulation studies have shown that for sequences to be considered robust in terms of the phylogenetic signal the sidecenter areas of the likelihood mapping must include 40 of the unresolved quartets 26 maximum likelihood tree reconstruction was performed in iq-tree based on the best-fit model chosen according to the bayesian information criterion 2728 exploration of the temporal structure ie the presence of a molecular clock in the data was assessed by regression of divergence root-to-tip genetic distance vs sampling time using tempest 29 in this case the absence of a linear trend indicates that the data do not contain a temporal signal and that the data are not appropriate for phylogenetic inference using molecular clock models the recently developed transphylo software package was employed to estimate how many intermediates in the putative transmission chain connected each pair of viral sequences from two infected individuals using a transmission matrix 30 the transphylo r package was used to infer the transmission matrices of sars-cov-2 30 as of march 30 2020 we compared the number of full genomes sampled per country with the number of confirmed cases at the time of sampling as well as with the countrys total population figure 1 we obtained 2608 full genomes from 55 countries during the pandemic the number of full genomes with high coverage has been steeply increasing by considering countries with at least 25000 confirmed cases or 3 or more genomes in our set we found the spearman rank correlations between confirmed cases a proxy for sampling homogeneity and genomes per country to be fairly weak 047 on march 30 and 052 on april 24 however correlation could only be investigated with confirmed cases since not all affected countries have publicly reported the total number of coronavirus tests performed as of march 30 within the same country sequenced genomes were usually sampled from a few hotspots thus these data are not necessarily representative of the whole epidemic in that country sars-cov-2 full genome sequences available from patients in the united states the country with the highest number of confirmed cases were mainly sampled in washington state 66 during the early epidemic while less than one-third 32 available from the epicenter of the us epidemic the state of new york italy the country with the second highest number of confirmed cases uploaded 26 genomes 1 of which came from the marche region 4 from friuli venezia giulia 7 from abruzzo 9 from lazio and only 5 from lombardy which is the epicenter of the italian epidemic 31 table s1 as of march 30 2020 the top 10 contributors per number of genomes were the united states n612 iceland n343 uk n321 china n300 the netherlands n190 france n119 japan n83 canada n80 australia n64 spain n40 and belgium n46 notably some countries uploaded a high number of genomes despite having a relatively low number of cases eg georgia iceland senegal and the democractic republic of the congo as of april 24 2020 the top 10 contributors per number of genomes were the united states n2413 the united kingdom n1779 australia n891 iceland n533 the netherlands n514 china n449 belgium n329 denmark n250 france n217 and spain n159 table s2 in multimedia appendix 2 lack of resolution and uncertainty in the sars-cov-2 phylogenetic tree is to be expected considering that relatively little genetic diversity can be accumulated during the first 3 months of an epidemic even for an exponentially spreading and rapidly evolving rna virus overall the phylogenetic signal of the current data has been increasing with the number of genomes released the percentages of unresolved quartets detected in the sars-cov-2 full genome alignments on march 3 and march 10 were still too high to allow reliable inferences figure s1 in multimedia appendix 3 in other words this lack of phylogenetic signal likely resulted in overall unreliable topologies of any sars-cov-2 trees obtained using these data and even clades with high bootstrap values should be interpreted with extreme caution a preliminary maximum likelihood tree inferred from the full genome viral sequences available on march 3 2020 showed a well-supported cluster of european and asian sequences reported in figure s2 in multimedia appendix 3 which contained a subclade subclade a figure 2a including a sequence isolated in germany that appeared to be paraphyletic with strong bootstrap support to an italian sequence clustering in turn with sequences from finland mexico germany and switzerland based on this observation which is available on nextstrain a heated discussion circulated on social media about a transmission event from germany to italy followed by further spread from italy to other countries however in a new tree inferred just one week later when more than 135 new full genome sequences were made available on gisaid 23 the direct link between germany and italy in subclade a disappeared due to additional clustering of previously unsampled sequences from portugal brazil wales and the netherlands figure 2b in addition the likelihood that alternative tree topologies generated arbitrarily switching branches in the tree arrows in figure 2b implying different dissemination scenarios was not significantly different shimodaira-hasegawa test table 1 than the likelihood of the tree inferred from the real data in other words it is not possible with the present data to decide which branching pattern and therefore which phylogeographic reconstruction most likely represents actual dissemination routes among european countries as the number of available genome sequences is rapidly growing sars-cov-2 full genome data sets are steadily showing less than 40 unresolved quartets in the center 386 on march 18 figure s1c in multimedia appendix 3 323 on march 25 figure s1d in multimedia appendix 3 289 on march 30th figure s1e in multimedia appendix 3 and 276 on april 24 figure s1f in multimedia appendix 3 this indicates that the amount of phylogenetic information can now potentially be used to define phylogenetic relationships among strains by plotting the mean genetic distance of each sequence from the root of a phylogeny versus the sequence sampling time we can test for a significant linear correlation which is necessary to calibrate a reliable molecular clock 29 figure s3 in multimedia appendix 3 as expected in genomes obtained over a very short period of time approximately 3 months since the beginning of the outbreak the correlation in the current data is fairly weak table 1 reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships of the same european sub-clade a discussed above with the sequences available on march 18 2020 showed a much more complex snapshot of the spread of sars-cov-2 figure s4 in multimedia appendix 3 a closer look at subclade a reveals that even with more genomes available inference is biased by oversampling of some countries and undersampling of others figure s4 in multimedia appendix 3 moreover when estimating the number of intermediates in the putative transmission chain we found that numerous links among samples were still missing figure s5 in multimedia appendix 3 in such a scenario it is not advisable to extrapolate conclusions on the origin and dissemination of strains the phylogenetic signal is increasing in the global alignment however likelihood mapping per country using data from countries reporting the highest numbers of cases united states italy spain germany and france indicates that some local data sets lacked sufficient signals up to march 30 2020 figure s6 in multimedia appendix 3 in particular a lack of signal was found in sequence sets from italy 26 genomes 45 variant sites 02 of total sites in the genome 11 parsimony informative the united states 612 genomes 675 variant sites 23 of total

in multimedia appendix 3 contrastingly and unexpectedly countries with low numbers of genome sequences germany spain and france did show a phylogenetic signal figure s6 in multimedia appendix 3 the presence of a phylogenetic signal 40 unresolved quartets in the center was detected only for germany 27 genomes 34 variant sites 02 of total sites in the genome 15 parsimony informative with dsseldorf and north rhine westphalia being the highest contributing regions 12 and 11 genomes respectively spain 40 genomes 60 variant sites 02 of total sites in the genome 23 parsimony informative with madrid and comunidad valenciana being the highest contributing regions 18 and 10 genomes respectively and france 119 genomes 155 variant sites 05 of total sites in the genome 44 parsimony informative with auvergne-rhne-alpes hauts de france and bretagne being the highest contributing regions 42 30 and 13 genomes respectively despite the presence of a phylogenetic signal in these countries only the genomes from france also showed a temporal signal that would allow the calibration of a molecular clock and reframing of the phylogenetic and phylogeographic inferences in the spatiotemporal dimension figure s7 in multimedia appendix 3 on the other hand the transmission matrix for france indicates that considerable links are still missing due to unsampled infected individuals limiting the reliability of transmission cluster studies based on the sequence data figure s8 in multimedia appendix 3 when we looked almost a month later at the phylogenetic signals for the countries that reported the highest numbers of confirmed cases as of april 24 2020 we found that these countries showed sufficient phylogenetic signals figure s9 in multimedia appendix 3 however while france and germany also displayed sufficient temporal signals to allow in-depth molecular epidemiology studies at least in principle data sets from the united states 39-fold increase on april 24 with respect to march 30 the united kingdom 55-fold increase and spain 39-fold increase still showed weak or no temporal signals figure s10 in multimedia appendix 3 despite the substantial increases in the number of available sequences characterization of transmission events is fundamental to understand the dynamics of any infectious disease from a public health standpoint it is crucial to be able to trace transmissions at the local level within-country identification of active transmission clusters would open the way to more effective public health interventions the most optimal inference of transmission events would contain a combination of genetic and epidemiological data for a joint analysis indeed transmission investigations that have been performed to date have been based on contact-tracing epidemiological and clinical data 3334 bayesian analysis 35 which infers phylogenetic and phylogeographic patterns from a posterior distribution of trees can facilitate comparisons of different evolutionary scenarios aid retrieval of the correct topology and estimate an accurate evolutionary rate using relaxed clock methods 36 more genome sequences sampled at different time points and from diverse geographic areas are becoming available daily therefore in-depth bayesian phylodynamic and phylogeographic analyses of the covid-19 pandemic will soon be a viable option however it is important to consider the dramatic effects of inhomogeneous sampling lack of phylogenetic signal and missing data on phylogeographic reconstructions 37 published scientific data and media are currently easily accessible to a worldwide audience proper weighing of the information being shared is more important than ever in the first months of the epidemic many researchers rushed to study local dynamics and to publish their findings without assessing the bias in sampling or the presence of a phylogenetic or temporal signal as shown by our analysis as of march 2020 the united states and italy the two countries with the highest numbers of confirmed cases did not show sufficiently large or representative sampling this finding is extremely worrisome and raises questions regarding the generalizability of the results of studies investigating the origin of the introduction of sars-cov-2 in italy 812 or of the circulation of sars-cov-2 in the state of washington in early march 2020 9 rushed studies 1013 that are acclaimed by news media despite being criticized in the literature 16-18 and on social media 14 may do more harm than good to recapitulate the importance of examining phylogenetic information in available data before performing phylogenetic inferences that may lead to erroneous or unreliable conclusions we propose the use of a well-established phylogenetic checkpoint pipeline figure s11 in multimedia appendix 3 22 the first step that researchers must take before they complete their phylogenetic studies is determining whether the data set is biased in terms of the number of genomes per given location host source etc in the specific case of sars-cov-2 it would be advisable to calculate the correlations between the confirmed cases and genomes per country if this first step is completed the second step is to build a proper codon-based alignment while ensuring that the alignment is in frame this is extremely important when researchers study selective pressures the third step consists of assessing the presence of a sufficient phylogenetic signal and the absence of nucleotide substitution saturation which decreases the phylogenetic information contained in the sequences 38 the analysis can proceed to the fourth step determining the presence or absence of recombination only if the previous criteria are met recombination can impair the phylogenetic signal 3940 and this is another important checkpoint before inferring a phylogeny in this study we did not test for recombination for the sars-cov-2 data set as absence of recombination in the human lineage has previously been shown 41 however because coronaviruses are prone to recombination events this step should be performed as more sequences become available detecting the presence of a temporal signal is an additional step that must be performed before the inference of a phylogeny scaled in time without a correlation between genetic divergence and time it is not possible to calibrate a molecular clock and therefore to obtain a phylogeny scaled in time regardless of whether the method employed to date the phylogeny is bayesian 35 maximum likelihood 42 or least-squares dating 43 only when all these checkpoints have been considered and given proper weight should subsequent analyses be considered by choosing adequate phylogeny inference methods the genomic data set available on gisaid is rapidly growing thus a limitation of our study is that we can only provide a snapshot of the past and this may not reflect the most current situation we have already shown an increase in phylogenetic and temporal signals that may allow researchers to attempt to estimate the origin and spatiotemporal dissemination of sars-cov-2 as long as sampling bias is properly taken into account however it is important to reiterate that during the month of march 2020 we deem that the molecular epidemiology data and studies were not sufficiently solid to provide a scientifically sound analysis of sars-cov-2 spread thus we suggest that any conclusions drawn about existing lineages and the direction of viral spread that were based on the sequence data available up to march 30 2020 should be considered preliminary and hypothesis-generating at best the evolutionary dynamics of sars-cov-2 spread is revealing an unprecedented amount of information which is essential to make policy decisions the whole of humanity is threatened by the current pandemic and policymakers must adjust their mitigation measures while the pandemic itself is developing some of the urgent answers required lie in the timely availability of abundant high-quality genetic data not only from countries experiencing a high number of reported cases but also from countries that appear to be experiencing at least currently a lower number of infections  genome detective coronavirus typing tool for rapid identification and characterization of novel coronavirus genomes sara cleemput wim dumon vagner fonseca wasim abdool karim marta giovanetti luiz alcantara carlos koen deforche tulio de oliveira pier luigi martelli   we are currently faced with a potential global epidemic of a new coronavirus that has infected thousands of people in china and is spreading rapidly around the world in the end of january 2020 the who has declared it a global emergency who 2020 the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 first isolated in wuhan china has already caused more infections than the previous severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak of 2002 and 2003 the virus is a sars-related coronavirus sarsr-cov and it is genetically associated with sarsr-cov strains that infect bats in china lu et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 it causes severe respiratory illness which the who recently named covid-19 disease it has high fatality rate huang et al 2020 can be transmitted from person to person has infected over 70 000 individuals and has spread to over 30 countries in less than 2 months who 2020 this coronavirus outbreak has been unprecedented so too is the way that the scientific community has responded to it they have openly and rapidly shared genomic and clinical data as never seen before allowing research results to be released almost instantaneously this has helped the understanding of the transmission dynamics the development of rapid diagnostic and has informed public health response here we present a new contribution that can speed up this communal effort the genome detective coronavirus typing tool is a free-of-charge web-based bioinformatics pipeline that can accurately and quickly identify assemble and classify coronaviruses genomes the tool also identifies changes at nucleotides coding regions and proteins using a novel dynamic aligner to allow tracking new viral mutations fig 1 a reference dataset of previously published coronavirus whole-genome sequences wgs was compiled from the virus pathogen resource vipr database wwwviprbrcorg this dataset consisted of 386 wgs of nine important coronavirus species these included 132 sequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus sarsr-cov 121 sequences of beta coronavirus 97 sequences of middle east respiratory syndrome related coronavirus mersr-cov 19 sequences of human coronavirus hku1 9 sequences of murine hepatitis virus 4 of rousettus bat coronavirus hku9 3 of rat coronavirus and 1 wgs of tylonycteris bat coronavirus hku4 zariabatcoronavirus and longquan rl rat coronavirus to this reference dataset we added 47 whole genomes of the current coronavirus 2019 sars-cov-2 outbreak that originated in wuhan china in december 2019 the sars-cov-2 sequences were downloaded from the gisaid database httpswwwgisaidorg together with annotation of its original location collection date and originating and submitting laboratory the sars-cov-2 data generators are properly acknowledged in the acknowledgements section of this article and detailed information is provided in supplementary table s1 the 431 reference wgs were aligned with muscle edgar 2004 the alignment was manually edited until a codon alignment was attained in all coding sequences cds a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree 1000 bootstrap replicates were constructed in phyml guindon and gascuel 2003 lemoine et al 2018 and a bayesian tree using mrbayes ronquist and huelsenbeck 2003 were constructed the trees were visualized in figtree rambaut 2018 we selected 25 reference sequences that represent the diversity of each well-defined phylogenetic cluster with bootstrap support of 100 and posterior probability of 1 we identified five well-supported phylogenetic clusters with more than two sequences of sarsr-cov and used them to set up our automated phylogenetic classification tool cluster 1 included sars strains from the 2002 and 2003 asian outbreaks in our tool we named this cluster sars-cov outbreak 2000s but may rename it as sars-cov-1 if a new proposed naming system for sarsr-cov is adopted in the near future cluster 2 provisionally named as sars related cov includes seven sequences from bats which did not cause large human outbreaks cluster 3 named as bat sars-cov hku3 includes three wgs sampled from rhinolophus sinicus ie chinese rufous horseshoe bats cluster 4 bat sars-cov zxc21zc45 includes two sarsr-cov sampled from rhinolophus sinicus bats in zhoushan china cluster 5 virus named sars-cov-2 by the ictv committee and disease named covid-19 by the who includes three public sequences from the outbreak we identified this cluster with many sequences from gisaid but kept only three ones as these were the first genbank sequences the first whole genome of sars-cov-2 was kindly shared by prof yong-zhen zhang and colleagues in the virologicalorg website detailed information about the phylogenetic reference datasets is available in supplementary table s2 the phylogenetic reference dataset was used to create an automated coronavirus typing tool using the genome detective framework fonseca et al 2019 vilsker et al 2019 to determine the accuracy of this tool each of the 431 test wgs was considered for evaluation ie 384 reference sequences from vipr and 47 public sars-cov-2 sequences the sensitivity specificity and accuracy of our method were calculated for both species assignment and phylogenetic clustering of sarsr-cov sensitivity was computed by the formula tptpfn specificity by tntnfp and accuracy by tptntpfpfntn where tp  true positives fp  false positives tn  true negatives and fn  false negatives classifying query sequences in an automated fashion involves two steps the first step enables virus species assignments and the second which is restricted to sarsr-cov includes phylogenetic analysis the first classification analysis subjects a query sequence to blast and aga analysis aga is a novel alignment method for nucleic acid sequences against annotated genomes from ncbi refseq virus database aga deforche 2017 expands the optimal alignment algorithms of smith and waterman 1981 and gotoh 1982 based on an induction state with additional parameters the result is a more accurate aligner as it takes into account both nucleotide and protein scores and identifies all of the polymorphisms at nucleotide and amino acid levels in the second step a query sequence is aligned against the phylogenetic reference dataset using -add alignment option in the mafft software katoh and standley 2013 in addition a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree is constructed using the hky distance metric with gamma among-site rate variation with 1000 bootstrap replicates using paup swofford 2003 the query sequence is assigned to a particular phylogenetic cluster if it clusters monophyletically with that clade or a subset of it with bootstrap support 70 if the bootstrap support is 70 the genotype is reported to be unassigned the result of the phylogenetic and mutational analysis performed by aga is available in a detailed report this report contains an interactive phylogenetic tree and genome mapper supplementary fig s1 it also presents the virus species and cluster assignments and a detailed table that provides information about open reading frames orfs cds and proteins this table can be expanded to show nucleotide and amino acid mutations that differentiate a query sequence from their species refseq or from a sequence in the phylogenetic reference dataset all results can be exported to a variety of file formats xml csv excel nexus or fasta the genome detective coronavirus typing tool correctly classified all of the 175 sarsr-cov sequences at species level ie specificity sensitivity and accuracy of 100 furthermore all of the 47 sars-cov-2 wgs that were isolated in china n  36 usa n  5 france n  2 thailand n  2 japan n  1 and taiwan n  1 were correctly classified at phylogenetic cluster level as sars-cov-2 which may be renamed as sars-b in addition we classified with very high specificity sensitivity and accuracy ie 100 all of the 112 sars outbreak wgs of 2002 and 2003 we also achieved perfect classification ie specificity sensitivity and accuracy of 100 for all of beta coronavirus humancoronavirushku1 mers-cov rousettus bat coronavirus hku9 and tylonycterisbatcoronavirushku4 at species level for a detailed overview of assignment performance please refer to the supplementary table s3 our tool also allows detailed analysis of coding regions and proteins for each of the coronavirus species for example the analysis of the first released sars-cov-2 sequence the whhuman1china2019dec genbank mn908947 demonstrated at genome level the nucleotide nt identity was 790 to the reference strain of sarsr-cov accession nc0047183 and that the envelop small membrane protein protein e is the most similar protein in total 948 7377 of the amino acids were identical the four amino acid differences were located at positions 55 t55s 56 v56f 69 69deletion and 70 g70r the spike protein protein s which can be associated with virulence was 762 identical to the reference strain of sarsr-cov supplementary table s4a interestingly there were four amino acid insertions at position 237 a237f238inshrsy genome nt position 2220222203inscatagaagttat which is just upstream from a cleavage site there is also a four amino acid insertion prra at the spike protein at positions 681 to 684 this is at the junction of s1 and s2 and creates a new polybase cleavage site our tool also allows us to compare mutations with other-related sequences such as the pangolin bat ratg13 the bat sars-cov and sars sin940 figure 2 and supplementary table s2 the most diverse coding regions were the cds sars8a and sars8b in these two regions only 30 of the amino acids were identical sars8b protein was truncated early and its cds had four stop codons supplementary table s4a our coronavirus typing tool also allows a query sequence to be analyzed against a sequence in the phylogenetic reference dataset for example the whhuman1china2019dec genbank mn908947 the identity was 875 to the bat sequence batslcovzxc21 genbank mg772934 this was one of the bat-cov sequences that were most related to n2019-cov lu et al 2020 the envelop small membrane protein protein e was 100 identical supplementary table s4b when the sars-cov-2 isolated from france betacovfranceidf03732020 was analyzed with our tool and compared with the sars-cov-2 whhuman1china2019dec strain accession mn908947 this sequence was 999 identical and had only two nt mutations supplementary table s4c these two differences were located on positions 22551gt and 26016gt which caused three amino acid mutations e2 glycoprotein protein mutation v354f 22551gt sars3a protein mutations g250v 26016gt and sars3b protein mutations v110f 26016gt detailed in supplementary table s4c-ii the analysis of a wgs in fasta format takes approximately 60 s we developed and released the genome detective coronavirus typing tool as a free-of-charge resource in the third week of january 2020 in order to help the rapid characterization of covid-19 infections this tool allows the analysis of whole or partial viral genomes within minutes it accepts assembled genomes in fasta format or raw next-generation sequencing data in fastq format from illumina ion torrent pacbio or oxford nanopore technologies ont can be submitted to the genome detective virus tool vilsker et al 2019 to automatically assemble the consensus genome prior to executing the coronavirus typing tool user effort is minimal and a user can submit multiple fasta sequences at once the tool uses a novel and dynamic aligner aga to allow submitted sequences to be queried against reference genomes using both nucleotide and amino acid similarity scores this allows accurate identification of other coronavirus species and the tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally it also performs detailed analysis of the coding regions and proteins moreover it can easily be updated to add new phylogenetic clusters if new outbreaks arise or if the classification nomenclature changes the tool has been able to correctly classify all the recently released sars-cov-2 genomes as well as all the 20022003 sars outbreak sequences in conclusion the genome detective coronavirus typing tool is a web-based and user-friendly software application that allows the identification and characterization of novel coronavirus genomes  analysis of the hosts and transmission paths of sars-cov-2 in the covid-19 outbreak rui dong shaojun pei changchuan yin rong he lucy stephen yau s-t   coronaviruses covs are members of the subfamily coronavirinae in the family coronaviridae and the order nidovirales they can cause respiratory and intestinal infections in animals and humans 1 and are considered to be highly pathogenic to humans since the outbreak of sars severe acute respiratory syndrome in guangzhou china in 2003 2 another highly pathogenic coronavirus middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov emerged ten years after sars and caused hundreds of fatalities four other types of coronaviruses which can infect humans but only cause mild symptoms are hcov-229e hcov-hku1 hcov-nl63 and hcov-oc43 1 coronaviruses are divided into alpha-coronaviruses and beta-coronaviruses which may infect mammals gamma-coronaviruses and delta-coronaviruses which primarily infect birds among the six human coronaviruses hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 are alpha-coronaviruses while the other four hcovs are beta-coronaviruses the viruses were initially sorted into these genera based on serology but are now taxonomically classified by genomic phylogeny 23 in december 2019 a severe respiratory disease was reported in wuhan china and spread in many provinces radiating outwards now it has become a global pandemic which has already caused over 3 million confirmed cases and 235290 deaths in the globe chinese health authorities were the first to report the complete genome of sars-cov-2 in genbank nc045512 and annotated 11 open reading frames orfs 4 the genomic structure of coronavirus sars-cov-2 is shown in figure 1 which is similar to other beta-coronaviruses the 5-terminal two-thirds of the genome encodes replicase polyprotein 1ab pp1ab with a length of 21290 nt and contains 16 predicted non-structural proteins the 3 terminus encodes four structural proteins and other non-structural proteins including spike glycoprotein s orf3a envelope small membrane protein e membrane protein m orf6 orf7a orf7b orf8 nucleocapsid protein n and orf10 in order especially the spike s protein with the receptor-binding domain rbd is the primary determinant of viral tropism and is responsible for host receptor binding and membrane fusion 56 during the sars-cov infection s protein first binds to the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 and the ace2virus complex is then translocated to endosomes where the s protein is cleaved by the endosomal acid proteases cathepsin l to activate its fusion activity 7 therefore sars-cov-2 s protein may be the target of new sars-cov-2 vaccines 7 considering the epidemic nature sars-cov-2 in the covid-19 outbreak identifying the intermediate and original host of sars-cov-2 is crucial for preventing new large-scale infection and transmission of viruses coronaviruses can spread with direct or intermediate hosts such as avians bats bovines camels canines civets felines murines and porcines 2 pangolins are recently identified as possible hosts for coronaviruses 8 it is well acknowledged that controlling first-generation infection cases has more significant effects than later person-to-person transmission stage a series of policies such as locking down wuhan had been established by the chinese government with significant effects it is therefore of great importance to identify the correct host and to cut off the transmission from animals to humans as soon as possible bats were suggested as the natural reservoir hosts for sars-cov and most coronaviruses 91011 and subsequently the discovery of sars-related coronaviruses globally supports the connection between bats and coronaviruses among the intermediate hosts masked palm civets were first considered as the host of sars-cov 12 while later research revealed that the coronavirus strains found in civets were transmitted from other animals 13 on the other hand dromedary camels were considered highly related in the case of mers-cov 14 genomic phylogenetics provides insights on the evolution and classification of viruses and is especially important for tracking the origin of sars-cov-2 151617 based on alignment approaches current research only associated the sars-cov-2 strains with sars-covs therefore in this study we first apply an alignment-free approach named natural vector to compare 791 complete genomes of human coronaviruses and 95 sars-cov-2 strains collected since the outbreak in wuhan to construct phylogenetic analysis the analysis of protein sequences and structures of the viruses infers the relationship among coronaviruses as well the mutations in genomes can be an indicator of the further change in protein sequences while proteins serve as the functional units to proceed infection on animals or humans thus using both genome and protein information in the study could validate each other and provide us with a comprehensive understanding of the sars-cov-2 strains on the one hand the genomes include all the necessary information that a speciesvirus inherits and selecting a partial region would lead to a loss of information on the other hand proteins perform a variety of functions in almost the whole process of infection therefore in our work the phylogenetic study was based on the genomes data and the identification of host relies on both the results from genomes and proteins further our main study is to infer the intermediate host of sars-cov-2 based on the coronaviruses found in various animal hosts by calculating the distance between sars-cov-2 and coronavirus genomes found in animals we may elucidate the infection chain among animal hosts and finally to humans notably we also utilized the spike proteins data in the coronaviruses of various hosts theoretically it has been proved that the natural vector gives a true distance among dna or protein sequences other similar researches have also utilized the spike protein sequence to identify the host of sars-cov-2 previous studies suggested snakes being hosts depending on condo usages 18 however in a later work 19 this conclusion was refuted by showing that codon usage does not determine the hosts our work here considers each host source as a group and applies the hausdorff distance in mathematics to compare the coronaviruses from different hosts the transmission path we found here was another proof of pangolins as intermediate hosts firstly proposed by 8 the phylogeny study of coronavirus was based on the comparison between sars-cov-2 strains and known human coronaviruses the sars-cov-2 strains were downloaded from gisaid httpsplatformgisaidorgepi3frontend on 23 february 2020 which were collected from patients at the early stage of the outbreak in wuhan china 731 known human coronavirus complete genomes were downloaded from ncbi directly which consist of 29 hcov-229e strains 52 hcov-nl63 strains 34 hcov-hku1 strains 153 hcov-oc43 strains 214 sars-covs and 249 mers-covs the genomes from non-human hosts were filtered and excluded all sequences used in this research consisted of only four nucleotides a c g t without ambiguous n resulted from low sequencing accuracy we also selected 38 coronavirus genomes from recent and previous research to construct another phylogenetic tree with the accession numbers listed in the tree as well the host identification was also based on these 95 complete sars-cov-2 records from gisaid in addition we downloaded the animal coronaviruses from ncbi genbank our analysis covered the ten common animal hosts avian bat bovine camel canine civet feline porcine and pangolin the coronaviruses in three hosts bat camel and murine can be either alpha or beta types though coronaviruses found in canines were also claimed to contain both alpha and beta types we didnt find the reliable beta coronaviruses genomes from canines on ncbi genbank therefore we considered the covs in three hosts bat camel and murine as different groups giving 13 host sources as shown in the following sections two samples from pangolin were sequenced in guangxi province china in 2017 while the third was sequenced in guangdong province in 2019 these pangolin samples were smuggled into southern china according to a source 8 pangolin is a popular wild animal in the chinese market the covid-19 outbreak in wuhan this time was firstly located at a so-called seafood market but actually it was a live animal market because a variety of animals were for sale in this seafood market for a long time we collected 823 coronaviruses with other animal hosts on ncbi and 3 pangolin-covs from gisaid and compared these 826 records with the 95 sars-cov-2 strains for the research based on protein data the corresponding spike protein sequences of these 826 host-covs and 95 sars-cov-2 strains were downloaded from ncbi polyproteins of a coronavirus were processed by viral proteinases to yield mature proteins among them 3cl proteinase performs at least eleven proteolytic cleavages within the polyprotein 1ab pp1ab which was considered to be the drug target 20 the spike protein which is critical for sars-cov-2 infection and differs cov types is responsible for ace2 receptor binding and membrane fusion the spike protein sequence of betacovpangolinguangxip2v2017 was obtained in 8 five protein structures of human coronavirus 3cl proteinase and five structures of spike protein were downloaded from rcsb httpswwwrcsborg all the accession numbers of the datasets are shown in supplementary files s1 s2 and s3 many alignment-free methods have been proposed in recent years such as feature frequency profiles ffp 21 fourier-based method 222324 one important alignment-free method named natural vector nv 25 describes a nucleotide sequence by a 12-dimensional numerical vector based on the distribution of nucleotides the natural vector method has been successfully applied in the molecular evolution of bacteria and viruses 262728 given an arbitrary dnarna sequence its natural vector can be calculated instantaneously with little computational cost and the correspondence between the natural vector and the sequence is one-to-one this indicates that the key information hidden in the sequence can be extracted by the natural vector method here the key information refers to the information that can reflect the real evolutionary pattern and therefore the corresponding distances can represent the true phylogenetic relationship so we apply the natural vector approach to study the genetic relationships of coronaviruses on both genome data and protein data for a comprehensive understanding of sars-cov-2 strains let ss1s2sn be a dna sequence of length n where siacgt let ski be the location of the i-th occurrence of nucleotide k the distribution of a specific nucleotide k within a dna sequence can be described by three quantities nk the number of occurrences of nucleotide k within the sequence k the mean distance of nucleotide k from the first position
ki1nkskink d2k the second normalized central moment of the distribution of nucleotide k
d2ki1nkskik2nnk therefore the 12-dim natural vector nv of dna sequence can be defined as nancngntacgtd2ad2cd2gd2t by replacing four types of nucleotides to 20 amino acids siarndceqghilkmfpstwyv natural vector can be also applied to protein sequences then each dna or protein sequence is converted to a numerical unit thus using the nv representation we can efficiently perform mathematical analysis on dna sequences and further infer the relationship of the sequences through the corresponding natural vectors the biological distance between two sequences can be expressed as the euclidean distance between the two corresponding natural vectors in 12-dim space as applied on many datasets 25 therefore for a dataset of n sequences the relationship is here described as a nn pairwise distance matrix the pairwise distance matrix is a symmetric distance with all positive non-diagonal elements where element ij represents the distance from ith sequence to the jth diagonal elements are all zero because diagonal ii represents the distance from i to itself by defining the distance between two vectors we gave a reliable measurement of the similaritydissimilarity between two dna sequences based on the correspondence between a dna sequence and its nv in the host identification the distance between the coronaviruses from two hosts was measured by mathematical techniques as well here we first applied hausdorff distance to calculate the distance between two groups of coronaviruses with different hosts 29 in mathematics the hausdorff distance named after felix hausdorff 30 measures how far two subsets of a metric space are from each other it turns the set of all non-empty compact subsets of a metric space to form a metric space in its right let x and y be two non-empty subsets and the hausdorff distance dxy is defined as followsdxymaxsupxxinfyydxysupyyinfxxdxy the matlab code of calculating hausdorff distance can be downloaded from mathworks httpswwwmathworkscommatlabcentralfileexchange26738-hausdorff-distance hausdorff distance satisfies the three requirements of a real distance from the mathematical perspectivethe distance between two sets is always non-negative the distance is zero if and only if the two sets are exactly the samethe direction doesnt change the distance value ie dxydyxthe distance satisfies the triangular inequality ie dxydxzdzy for any x y and z another way to measure the distance between two sets is proposed here named center distance based on convex hulls after the transformation from sequences to vectors in euclidean space let anv1nv2nvn represent a point set of nvs of n protein sequences then the convex hull of a is defined as
cappi1ninvii1ni1i01in based on the definition above we can know that a convex hull is the smallest convex set containing the given point set for two sets of vectors each set can be depicted by its convex hull and the barycenter of each hull is considered as the representative of the hull therefore the euclidean distance between the two barycenters represents the average distance between two sets as well it is crucial to define a correct distance when studying the similarity between two groups of sequences we showed above that hausdorff distance is a mathematical distance which can reflect the biological distance among the sequences with different hosts after obtaining the pairwise distance matrix between sequences phylogenetic analysis was constructed firstly by constructing the evolutionary tree fastme is a distance-based phylogeny reconstruction program that works on distance matrices 31 fastme provides distance algorithms to infer phylogeny based on balanced minimum evolution which is the very principle of neighbor-joining nj algorithm it improves over nj by performing topological moves using fast sophisticated algorithms 323334 we applied bionj an improved version of nj based on a simple model of sequence data 35 to construct the tree and then adjusted the tree using figtree software httpsbeastcommunityfigtree the phylogenetic study visualized the distance matrix results by clustering the similar units together in the evolutionary tree we drew the natural graph of sars-cov-2 strains and coronaviruses groups with different animal hosts as well natural graph was first proposed in 2015 27 for a dataset of n units we first find the neighbor of each unit by searching for the smallest distance from each unit to any other units during this step we usually draw a blue arrow connecting each unit with its neighbor this gives the result of the first-level natural graph which also shows the closest relationships among all units several groups will be formed after this step and then we find the neighbor of each group by the smallest distance between groups the distance between group a and group b is defined as the smallest distance among all distances from any unit in group a to any unit in group b therefore by finding the closest neighbor of all units in several layers in most cases two layers are enough natural graph successfully classifies units into several groups in the first layer and also reveals the relationships between groups in further steps combining the results from phylogenetic study one can easily understand the relationship among units and also among groups of units all calculation in this project was performed using matlab r2018b on a computer with intelr core rm u7-5500u cpu 240ghz the phylogenetic tree based on the sars-cov-2 strains and 731 complete genomes of human coronaviruses hcovs is shown in figure 2 in which different colors represent different virus types we also selected 38 coronavirus genomes of interest to construct the phylogenetic tree in figure 3 both the results in figure 2 and figure 3 show that the sars-cov and mers-cov are under the same branch as the sister clade of this new sars-cov-2 the phylogeny indicates the close relationship between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 the branch of hcov-hku1 hcov-oc43 sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov is for beta-coronavirus while hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 are both alpha-coronaviruses protein analysis was also applied to these human coronaviruses we downloaded five crystal structures of 3cl proteinase and five crystal structures of spike protein from pdb bank then pairwise root-mean-square deviation rmsd of the structures and pairwise nv-distances of the corresponding protein sequences were calculated the results are shown in table 1 all the rmsd and nv-distance of 3cl proteinase and spike protein between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov are the smallest which concurs with the classification by the complete genomes although current sars-cov-2 is in a distinct clade to sars-cov previous drug study on sars-cov may have helpful implications for antiviral research the detailed phylogenetic tree of 95 records of sars-cov-2 strains is shown in figure 4 most of the confirmed cases had been identified in hubei province china and still most of the confirmed cases had been to hubei or related to someone in hubei guangdong province china on the other hand was the location of the outbreak of sars in 2003 and the fact that both provinces have a booming market for wild animals might contribute to the outbreak during this outbreak starting from december 2019 guangdong also has a high number of confirmed cases at the early stage of the pandemic though it is not geographically close to hubei hence we labeled the units in several colors in figure 4 based on the country of each patient from the results in figure 4 some sars-cov-2 strains from the same city or province are clustered together which indicates that the spread of sars-cov-2 was rapid compared to its variation speed therefore the current branches are mainly formed based on the movement of populations rather than the genome mutations this should be emphasized in the further determination of the geographical origin of sars-cov-2 these 95 records were all collected at a relatively early stage and data from afterward patients would reflect the spread of sars-cov-2 rather than the origin of sars-cov-2 strains variants within the same country tend to be clustered together in figure 4 such as all samples from japan this can be explained by the limited number of movement of populations between the corresponding country and china especially wuhan because of the long distance and also further policies of travel restrictions however within china mainly because of the tradition of returning home at the chinese spring festival in the first few days when the outbreak happened transportation was even more often than common days patients from the same province might be genetically distant from each other if they have different sources of infection patients possibly became infected during their stay in wuhan but showed no obvious symptoms during the incubation and after returning to home cityprovince had fever or dry cough that further confirmed to be covid-19 in this assumption the distance will mostly rely on their infection source in wuhan rather than the distance between their current locations where they were confirmed our main work is to identify the animal hosts of sars-cov-2 the host identification is of essential importance to the control of virus spread and to prevent another round of emergence outbreak the correct identification of host source or intermediate could lead to the effective policy to isolate humans and hosts therefore eliminating the risk of human exposure to new viruses and limiting further transmission during the sars epidemic in 2003 many patients were found to have had animal exposure especially during the early stage of the outbreak sars-cov and anti-sars-cov antibodies were found in masked palm civets and the animal handlers in a market place but civets are not commonly considered as the origin of sars-cov several independent groups have shown that bats are the most likely natural hosts for sars-cov or found more sarsr-covs in bats from china european african and southeast asian countries 133637383940414243444546474848 other animal origins of human coronaviruses include avian bovine camel canine feline murine porcine and pangolin 2 we collected the coronaviruses found in these animal hosts and compared them with sars-cov-2 strains to detect the similarity between the genome sequences bats camels and murines contain both alpha and beta coronaviruses thus they were considered as two different host groups all together there were 13 groups of coronaviruses found in animal hosts and each group was then compared to the sars-cov-2 group which included 95 sars-cov-2 strains the corresponding phylogenetic tree based on hausdorff distance is shown in figure 5 both the hausdorff distance and center distance between sars-cov-2 strains and host-cov groups are shown in table 2 both results show that the beta coronaviruses found in pangolins and civets are closely related to the sars-cov-2 group based on the genome divergences though both civets and camels were considered to be intermediate hosts for other coronaviruses the coronaviruses found in them are more distinct than the pangolin-covs group in table 2 based on the genome data only the coronaviruses found in four animal hosts pangolin civet canine and feline show closer relationship to sars-cov-2 than bat does the coronaviruses found in pangolins and civets are beta-coronaviruses while the other two are alpha-coronaviruses thus these four animals are possible intermediate hosts of sars-cov-2 but the analysis of the s protein can lead to more accurate results then we analyzed the spike proteins of sars-cov-2 and known coronaviruses found in these animal hosts receptor-binding domain rbd is located on the s protein and thus s protein is essential for infectivity the protein id of spike protein of sars-cov-2 is yp0097243901 the center distances between the spike protein of sars-cov-2 and the spike protein group of the coronaviruses of each host are shown in table 2 which clearly indicates the significant similarity between sars-cov-2 and pangolin-cov as well this result coincides with the genome analysis the results agreed with each other and we further constructed the natural graph in figure 6 using the hausdorff distance based on the coronaviruses genomes the blue arrows represent the first-level arrow after the first-level grouping all alpha-coronaviruses are clustered together and the beta coronaviruses form two clusters the green values are the corresponding hausdorff distance between the two groups the arrow from virus a to b means that among all viruses here b has the smallest distance from a the red thick arrows represent the second-level arrow presenting the relationship among clusters that were forms from the first-level natural graph in this case all units are connected together after two levels the natural graph shows that the most likely host is pangolin with the corresponding distance as 33389 assuming that bats are the natural reservoir of coronaviruses pangolin should be the intermediate host of sars-cov-2 besides in figure 6 the coronaviruses found on many other hosts such as civets canines and felines have a relatively smaller distance to sars-cov-2 compared with the distance from bat-covs to sars-cov-2 further protein analysis excludes the similarity between sars-cov-2 and coronaviruses found in civets canines and felines according to the last column in table 2 therefore combined with our results based on genomes and proteins the natural graph indicates that the most possible path of transmission should be from bats to pangolins to humans this transmission path is predicted from mathematical analysis rather than biological experiments and the determination of the natural reservoir and any intermediate host of sars-cov-2 requires further study and analysis sars-cov-2 has been spreading rapidly by human-to-human transmission and phylogenetic analysis of sars-cov-2 strengthens our understanding of its origin and transmission paths genetic relationship between sars-cov-2 and known coronaviruses provides insights into the host identification and protein analysis reveals the similarity more directly because proteins are the basic functional elements in the transmission and infection process from the phylogenetic analysis performed in this study we confirm that sars-cov-2 is most similar to sars-cov from a range of coronavirus sequences examined but also forms a distinct separate cluster thus sars-cov-2 should be classified as a new member of coronaviruses the seventh cov member that infects humans the host identification found the most possible transmission chain is from bats to pangolins to humans regarding this chain we should also pay attention to civets because the distance between civet-cov group and sars-cov-2 is also relatively small from genome comparison but a little larger than bat-covs though protein analysis the sequencing results from the current technology sometimes include many ambiguous letters such as n which would lead to inaccurate results in the transformation from dna sequences to a numerical vector though we have filtered out these sequences it also decreases the size of dataset it is possible that laboratories can get more sequences without these ambiguous letters and therefore the distances need to be modified which might bring back civets into our consideration besides although canine-cov is not in the same group with sars-cov-2 on the first level blue arrows shown in figure 6 the distance is within a comparable distance as 89311 feline-covs are listed 4th closest neighbor to sars-cov-2 group closer to canine-cov both canine-cov and feline-cov are alpha coronaviruses and the recombination between alpha and beta coronaviruses are also possible in the evolution of sars-cov-2 if so the close relationship between feline-cov and sars-cov-2 strains might be due to the second possible chain from felines to canines to humans this might be also another missing transmission path but more evidence from biology is required to reach this conclusion in general the limited number of the coronaviruses found in hosts especially for pangolins might be an issue the calculation of natural vector is of high computational efficiency thus once more sequencing experiments are performed and uploaded online by biological labs we can add them into the current dataset and the results would be even more persuasive meanwhile currently available protein data of sars-cov-2 are mainly the primary sequences which consist of 20 amino acids and if the structure of 11 proteins can be experimentally determined it is possible to use the yau-hausdorff distance to study the relationship between protein structures 49 moreover protein structures could be a powerful tool to detect protein-to-protein interaction and enhance our knowledge about the mechanics of sars-cov-2 therefore making it possible to develop medicines and vaccines for treating sars-cov-2 pathogens since the outbreak of sars-cov-2 globally more and more researchers have published their phylogenetic analysis using various techniques in 50 the author collected 86 complete or near-complete genomes of sars-cov-2 strains on gisaid and performed pair-wise nucleotide sequence alignment by clustalx2 the analysis revealed 93 mutations over the entire genomes of sars-cov-2 located on either coding or non-coding regions in contrast to our analysis of extracting the key information in the whole genome on the other hand liu et al and anderson et al have done research on the alignment of protein sequences from different sources 1951 and they concluded that other than pangolins snakes and turtles may also act as the potential intermediate hosts transmitting sars-cov-2 to humans the host identification would always be updated based on new findings on experimental data and we are also working on similar projects the most significant difference between this work and other research is that we consider the coronaviruses found in each animal host as a single group and study the relationship between groups using mathematical techniques the result in 52 coincided with our results that pangolins are the probable zoonotic origin of sars-cov-2 outbreak despite the similar conclusion their statement of the similarity between pangolin-cov and sars-cov-2 is 9102 is based on alignment in 53 the alignments of the spike surface glycoprotein receptor binding domain revealed four times more variations in the bat coronavirus ratg13 than in pangolin-cov compared with sars-cov-2 suggesting the pangolin as a missing link in the transmission of sars-cov-2 from bats to human our approach provides a well-defined measurement of the distance between two groups of sequences and both genomic and protein data suggested that pangolins are the most likely intermediate host of sars-cov-2 some other research 56 focused on the phylogenetic analysis of spike protein data as well which also provided insight into the study of the interaction with antiviral drugs  phylogenetic and recombination analysis of coronavirus hku1 a novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia p woo c y s lau k p y huang h-w tsoi k-h chan k-y yuen  phylogenetic trees constructed using predicted amino acid sequences of putative proteins of coronavirus hku1 cov-hku1 revealed that cov-hku1 formed a distinct branch among group 2 coronaviruses of the 14 trees from p65 to nsp10 nine showed that cov-hku1 was clustered with murine hepatitis virus from nsp11 the topologies of the trees changed dramatically for the eight trees from nsp11 to n seven showed that the cov-hku1 branch was the first branch the codon usage patterns of cov-hku1 differed significantly from those in other group 2 coronaviruses split decomposition analysis revealed that recombination events had occurred between cov-hku1 and other coronaviruses  these authors contributed equally to the manuscript  it has been estimated that coronaviruses human coronaviruses 229e hcov-229e and oc43 hcov-oc43 cause about 5-30 of respiratory tract infections in late 2002 and 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars caused by sars coronavirus sars-cov has resulted in more than 750 deaths 12 15 16 17 22 23 24  in early 2004 a novel coronavirus associated with respiratory tract infections human coronavirus nl63 hcov-nl63 was discovered 3 20  as a result of a unique mechanism of viral replication coronaviruses have a high frequency of recombination 9 10 13 14  coronaviruses were divided into three groups with hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 being group 1 coronaviruses and hcov-oc43 a group 2 coronavirus respectively 11  for sars-cov it was initially proposed that sars-cov constituted a distinct group of coronavirus 15 17  however after more extensive phylogenetic analysis it was discovered that sars-cov probably represents a distant relative of group 2 coronaviruses 2 18  further in silico analysis also predicted that sars-cov could be a product of recombination between mammalian and avian coronaviruses 19  recently we have described the discovery of a novel coronavirus associated with pneumonia

and nucleocapsid n cov-hku1 is a member of group 2 coronaviruses however the origin of cov-hku1 is still unknown in this study we performed a detailed phylogenetic analysis of cov-hku1 possible recombination events were predicted and the origin of cov-hku1 discussed the predicted amino acid aa sequences of p65 conserved portions of nsp1 papain-like protease 1 pl1 pro  appr-1-p processing enzyme family a1pp papain-like protease 2 pl2 pro  hydrophobic domain 1 hd1 and hydrophobic domain 2 hd2 nsp2-7 nsp9-13 he s e m and n were extracted from the cov-hku1 genome sequence genbank accession no ay597011 21  the corresponding aa sequences of murine hepatitis virus mhv hcov-oc43 bovine coronavirus bcov porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus phev rat sialodacryoadenitis coronavirus sdav and puffinosis virus pv were extracted from complete genome sequences of mhv genbank accession noaf201929 hcov-oc43 genbank accession no ay585229 and bcov genbank accession no nc 003045 and sequences of phev sdav and pv available in genbank the aa sequence of he of mhv was extracted from mhv strain jhm genbank accession no baa00661 because the he gene in mhv genbank accession no af201929 stopped prematurely after the 97th aa phylogenetic tree construction was performed using neighbour joining method with clustalx 183 the corresponding aa sequences of hcov-229e were used as outgroups except for p65 and he because these were not available in the genome of hcov-229e for p65 and he the corresponding aa sequences in sars-cov and influenza c virus were used as the outgroups respectively phylogenetic trees were not constructed for p28 and the predicted hypothetical protein of orf4 and orf8 in cov-hku1 because no aa sequences that can be used as the appropriate outgroups can be found the amino-terminal 800 aa residues of the s proteins in various group 1 coronaviruses porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev hcov-nl63 and hcov-229e various group 2

cysteine residues in the various peptides were compared correspondence analysis was used to compare the codon usage pattern variation in the different genes among group 2 coronaviruses in a multidimensional space 5  all available sequences of orf 1ab he s m and n of mhv hcov-oc43 bcov phev sdav pv and sars-cov were downloaded from the genbank  table 1  analysis of codon usage in these sequences and the corresponding ones in cov-hku1 was performed using codonw httpwwwmolbioloxacukcu with each gene represented as a 59 dimensional vector representing the 59 possible sense codons aug the only codon for methionine ugg the only codon for tryptophan and the three stop codons were excluded the orf for e was excluded because the length of the gene was too short to delineate the importance of recombination on the evolution of cov-hku1 split decomposition analysis was performed deduced aa sequences of group 1 2 and 3 coronaviruses and sars-cov available in genbank that were homologous to 3cl pro  pol helicase he s orf4 e m and n in cov-hku1 21  were retrieved split decomposition analysis was performed with splitstree version 32 7 using hamming correction and is presented with the same edge length the genome organizations of cov-hku1 and other group 2 coronaviruses were shown in fig 1a  phylogenetic trees using predicted aa sequences of putative proteins and polypeptides of cov-hku1 and other group 2 coronaviruses were constructed fig 1b  the putative proteins and polypeptides included p65 conserved portions of nsp1 pl1 pro  a1pp pl2 pro  hd1 and hd2 nsp2-7 nsp9-13 he s e m and n all trees revealed that cov-hku1 formed a distinct branch among group 2 coronaviruses interestingly of the 14 trees of p65 to nsp10 nine 64 p65 hd1 hd2 nsp3 nsp4 nsp6 nsp7 nsp9 and nsp10 showed that cov-hku1 was clustered with mhv fig 1b  however for the eight trees of nsp11 to n seven 88 showed that the cov-hku1 branch appeared as the first branch among group 2 coronaviruses fig 1b  comparison of the cysteine residues in the n-terminal 800 aa residues of s in cov-hku1 and those in the different groups of coronaviruses revealed that almost all the conserved cysteine residues in group 2 coronaviruses were present in cov-hku1 fig 2a  supporting that cov-hku1 is a member of group 2 coronaviruses the number of orf 1ab he s m and n sequences in the group 2 coronaviruses used for correspondence analysis is shown in table 1  the results of the for orf 1ab he s and m the scores on axis 1 in group 2 coronaviruses other than cov-hku1 were clustered between 016 and 028 and those in cov-hku1 were clustered between 040 and 024 fig 2b  for n the scores on axis 1 in group 2 coronaviruses other than cov-hku1 were clustered between 048 and 057 and that in cov-hku1 was at 011 fig 2b  these indicated that the codon usage patterns in the genes in cov-hku1 differed significantly from those in other group 2 coronaviruses split decomposition analysis revealed that recombination events had occurred between cov-hku1 and other group 2 coronaviruses in 3cl pro  pol helicase he s orf4 e and m fig 3  no evidence of recombination was shown between the n of cov-hku1 and those of other group 2 coronaviruses cov-hku1 is a distinct member of group 2 coronaviruses it was confirmed by both phylogenetic analysis of 22 protein coding regions fig 1b and analysis of the conserved cysteine residues in the amino-terminal of the s proteins fig 2a that cov-hku1 is a group 2 coronavirus furthermore phylogenetic analysis of the 22 protein coding regions revealed that there were 10-54 aa differences between a particular protein coding region in cov-hku1 and the corresponding region in the most closely related sequence indicating that cov-hku1 is distinct from the other group 2 coronaviruses this fact was further supported by results of correspondence analysis of codon usage fig 2b  recombination events were common among cov-hku1 and other group 2 coronaviruses coronaviruses have high frequency of homologous rna recombination which has been observed in both tissue culture 10 14 and experimentally infected animals 8  in split tree analysis recombination events would result in reticulations instead of simple branching structures as shown in fig 3  recombination was particularly frequent in cov-hku1 and mhv as compared to other group 2 coronaviruses such as bcov and hcov-oc43 the particular high recombination frequency in mhv 1 is in line with evidence of a lot of interstrain recombination as shown by the high number of reticulations in various orfs of the different mhv strains fig 3  complete genome sequencing of additional cov-hku1 and further split tree analysis would shed light on whether cov-hku1 behaves more like mhv or bcov and hcov-oc43 cov-hku1 may have originated from a major recombination event and numerous minor recombination events among group 2 coronaviruses in feline coronavirus the site of recombination has been pinpointed to a region of about 50 nucleotides in the m gene by multiple alignment 6 as for recombination between different strains of mhv in vitro studies have shown both variable sites and rates of recombination with the s gene have a frequency three fold that of the polymerase gene 4 14  in cov-hku1 nine of the 14 phylogenetic trees constructed using deduced aa sequences of p65 to nsp10 showed that cov-hku1 was clustered with mhv fig 1b  interestingly the topologies of the phylogenetic trees changed dramatically from nsp11 for the eight trees from nsp11 to n seven revealed that the cov-hku1 branch appeared as the first branch among the group 2 coronaviruses fig 1b p  001 by chi-square test a logical explanation was that a major recombination event has taken place in the region between nsp10 and nsp11 when cov-hku1 first appeared however this recombination event was not evident in multiple alignment performed at the junction between nsp10 and nsp11 data not shown this is because although cov-hku1 is more clustered with mhv from p65 to nsp10 the difference in phylogenetic distances between cov-hku1 and mhv and those between cov-hku1 and bcovhcov-oc43 is not marked fig 1b  in contrast to what was observed in feline coronavirus 6  furthermore bootscanning analysis in the whole genome did not reveal any putative recombination break point data not shown we speculate that this could be due to numerous minor recombination events between p65 and nsp10 such as between p65 and nsp1-pl1 pro  between nsp1-pl2 pro and nsp1-hd1 between nsp4 and nsp5 and between nsp5 and nsp6 this has resulted in cov-hku1 being clustered with mhv in only nine of the 14 phylogenetic trees constructed using deduced aa from p65 to nsp10 but four of the 14 trees with the cov-hku1 branch being the first branch among the group 2 coronaviruses  coronavirus phylogeny based on a geometric approach wen-xin zheng ling-ling chen hong-yu ou feng gao chun-ting zhang   the outbreak of atypical pneumonia referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars was first identified in guangdong province china and spread to several countries later drosten et al 2003 ksiazek et al 2003 lee et al 2003 peiris et al 2003 poutanen et al 2003 tsang et al 2003 a novel coronavirus was isolated and found to be the cause of sars although sars has been under control some scattering cases infected by sars-covs were reported no effective drugs are currently available to cure this disease gaining insight into the phylogenetic relationships among coronaviruses would be helpful to discover drugs and develop vaccines against the virus the sars-coronavirus is a new member of the order nidovirales family coronaviridae and genus coronavirus they consist of a diverse group of large enveloped positive-stranded rna viruses that cause respiratory and enteric diseases in humans and other animals rota et al 2003 excluding sars-covs coronaviruses can be divided into three groups according to serotypes group i and group ii contain mammalian viruses while group ii coronaviruses contain a hemagglutinin esterase gene homologous to that of influenza c virus lai and holmes 2001 group iii contains only avian viruses previous work showed that sars-covs are not closely related to any of the previously characterized coronaviruses and form a distinct group group iv within the genus coronavirus marra et al 2003 rota et al 2003 an intuitive method is proposed to infer the phylogenetic relationships of coronaviruses in this article historically cork et al proposed a three-dimensional representation of genomic sequences called the w-curve wu et al 1993 since then the w-curve has been used to analyze genomic sequences and study the phylogeny of bacteria cork 2003 cork et al 2002 cork and toguem 2002 instead of the sequence alignment we adopt a geometric method based on the z-curve of the whole genome the z-curve is a three-dimensional space curve constituting the unique representation of a given dna sequence in the sense that each can be reconstructed given the other zhang and zhang 1991 zhang and zhang 1994 based on the z-curve method a coronavirus-specific gene-finding system zcurvecov has been developed chen et al 2003 and the software is especially suitable for gene recognition in sars-cov genomes the system is further improved by taking the prediction of cleavage sites of viral proteinases in polyproteins into consideration gao et al 2003 here we use the differences between the three-dimensional space curves as the foundation to derive the phylogeny of coronaviruses the key problems are what parameters should be used to describe a curve and how to determine evolutionary distances among organisms based on a group of curves in this paper we use a series of parameters such as the geometric center and the covariance matrix to reflect the center position and the distribution pattern of a curve respectively the result shows that sars-covs form an independent group which is consistent with previous analyses the 24 complete coronavirus genomes used in this paper were downloaded from genbank of which 12 are sars-covs and 12 are from other groups of coronaviruses the name accession number abbreviation and genome length for the 24 genomes are listed in table 1
 according to the existing taxonomic groups sequences 13 belong to group i and sequences 411 are members of group ii while sequence 12 is the only representative of group iii refer to table 1 for details the z-curve is a three-dimensional curve that constitutes a unique representation of a given dna sequence in the sense that each can be uniquely reconstructed given the other zhang and zhang 1991 zhang and zhang 1994 the resulting curve has a zigzag shape hence the name z-curve the z-curve is briefly presented as follows consider a dna sequence read from the 5 to the 3-end with n bases beginning from the first base inspect the sequence one base at a time in the nth step where n

 repeating this procedure for all the three groups we obtain three real m
  
m symmetric matrices these matrices are then translated into angles whose elements are as follows11ijkarccoscosijkij12mkxyz
 the sum of ijk over k for given i j can be used to reflect the trend information of the eigenvectors involved12ijijxijyijzij12m
 consequently two sets of parameters are obtained the first reflects the difference of center positions represented by the euclid distance between the geometric centers the second indicates the difference of the trends of the z-curves represented by the related eigenvectors the overall distance d

ij is obtained and used to reflect the evolutionary distance between the species i and j the clustering tree is constructed using the upgma method in phylip package httpevolutiongeneticswashingtoneduphyliphtml the final phylogenetic tree is drawn using the drawgram program in the phylip package the branch lengths are not scaled according to the distances and only the topology of the tree is concerned as mentioned above one of the advantages of the z-curve is its intuitiveness the feature of a genome can be viewed intuitively regardless of how long the genome is therefore global and local compositional features of a genome can be grasped quickly in a perceivable form zhang et al 2003 to give an intuitive comprehension of the difference among the three-dimensional curves we take sars-cov strains tor2 bj01 and bcov as examples tor2 and bj01 are sars-covs and bcov belongs to another group of coronaviruses from the coordinates and the trends in figs 1ac we can see that the z-curves of tor2 and bj01 are almost the same while that of bcov is significantly different from both of them indicating that the former two have close phylogenetic relationship whereas the relationships between the former two and the latter are more distant similarity of related z-curves implies close evolutionary relationship of the organisms involved zhang et al 2003 and vice versa this constitutes the basis of the current algorithm the z-curve is approximately described by the geometric center and eigenvectors which indicate its center position and the trends respectively fig 1d in fig 1d the three arrows represent the three eigenvectors and the point from which they start is the geometric center the three eigenvectors of a certain genome can be divided into three groups according to their relationships with the axes refer to fig 2 the trends of z-curves carry a part of the information used to construct the phylogenetic tree and some interesting results can be revealed by this figure it can be seen from fig 2b that the vectors in the y group which have the greatest projections on the positive y-axis are coplanar perfectly they are almost in the xy plane as can be seen from the plot the 24 vectors are almost superposed with each other as a single vector the phenomenon can also be seen from the data in table 2 all of the absolute value of cyzii12m are smaller than 00059 that is to say they all have very small projections on the z-axis and are constrained into the xy plane the vectors in the x group and z group represented with black and grey arrows respectively in fig 2b are also coplanar in the xz plane though their coplanarity is not as good as that of the y group as mentioned above there are three groups of coronaviruses group i includes hcov-229e tgev and pedv and group ii contains bcov bcovl bcovm bcovq mhv mhv2 mhvm mhvp etc all the viruses in these two groups are mammalian viruses group iii contains only avian viruses of which only the genome of ibv has been completely sequenced many researchers have analyzed the phylogenetic relationships among coronavirus genomes based on the 3c-like proteinase polymerase the structural proteins s e m and n respectively marra et al 2003 rota et al 2003 their results indicated that sars-covs are not closely related to any of the previously characterized coronaviruses and form a distinct group group iv within the genus coronavirus marra et al 2003 rota et al 2003 as shown in fig 3
 four groups of coronaviruses can be seen from the phylogram the sars-covs appear to cluster together and form a separate branch which can be distinguished easily from other three groups of coronaviruses ibv belonging to group iii is situated at an independent branch whereas the tgev pedv and hcov-229e which belong to group i tend to cluster together in another branch the group ii coronaviruses including bcov bcovl bcovm bcovq mhv mhv2 mhvm and mhvp tend to cluster together first group i and group ii which are all mammalian viruses cluster together forming a bigger group second this group joins group iii which contains only avian viruses to form a much bigger group finally sars-covs join them and result in the phylogenetic tree shown in fig 3 the resulting monophyletic clusters agree perfectly with the established taxonomic groups to validate the current method a set of random sequences were used as a control we generated 100 random sequences meeting the requirements in the method each time a phylogenetic analysis was done using 25 sequences including one random sequence and the 24 genomes consequently 100 phylogenetic trees were obtained ninety-eight out of the 100 trees showed that the random sequence formed a distinct group without disturbing the other four groups only two of the random sequences disturbed the four groups suggesting that the current method is solid with respect to the situation that a random sequence is added almost all of the previous analyses revealed that sars-covs form a distinct group different from the other three groups of coronaviruses however the question that how sars-covs emerged suddenly still remains open rota et al and marra et al performed phylogenetic analysis based on sequence alignments using different genes the results indicated that sars-covs belong to a new group but the original group that sars-covs were derived from could not be determined rota et al 2003 the detection of sars-cov-like viruses in himalayan palm civets and other small animals in live retail market indicates a rout of interspecies transmission although the natural reservoir is unknown virus infection was also detected in humans working at the same market all the animal isolates retain a special 29-nucleotide fragment which is not found in most human isolates guan et al 2003 stavrinides and guttman made phylogenetic analysis on the sars virus replicase surface spike matrix and nucleocapsid proteins the results support a mammalian-like origin for the replicase protein an avian-like origin for the matrix and nucleocapsid proteins and a mammalianavian mosaic origin for the host-determining spike protein they proposed that a recombination event between mammalian-like and avian-like parent viruses within the s gene might have taken place stavrinides and guttman 2004 however the phylogenetic inference based on genome contents tends to locate the recombinant outside of related genomes such as seen in fig 3 therefore we emphasize that it is very unlikely to trace back the evolutionary history such as the recombination event using the method presented the present method reflects the global characters of genomes because the whole genome is taken into consideration the phylogenetic tree fig 3 reveals that the sars-covs have undergone an independent evolution path after the divergence from the other coronaviruses as can be seen from fig 3 the distance between the sars-covs and all the others is the greatest we supposed that the precursor of sars-cov may have existed in some hosts and developed separately for many years grigoriev found that the mutational patterns in sars-cov genome were strikingly different from the other coronaviruses in terms of mutation rates grigoriev 2004 phylogenetic analysis based on codon usage pattern suggested that sars-cov was diverged far from all the three known groups of coronavirus gu et al 2004 the overall level of similarity between sars-covs and the other coronaviruses is low rota et al 2003 we suppose that this is due to different evolution paths the isolation of sars-cov-like virus in himalayan palm civets indicates a route of interspecies transmission we hypothesize that some events such as the nucleotide deletion or mutation in some important genes of the precursor may have resulted in the change of host range due to the lack of morphological features and frequent gene exchanges it is highly valuable to develop methods of molecular phylogeny for viruses now phylogenetic analysis based on sequence alignments is well developed sequence alignments are always based on some special genes or some conserved fragments saitou 1996 such analysis can be done at both the amino acid level and the nucleotide level to overcome the biases caused by individual genes or genome segments it is valuable to develop methods of molecular phylogenetic analysis based on whole genome sequences being different from the sequence alignment method the current method is a geometric approach which is based on measuring the differences of z-curves of whole genomes including coding and non-coding sequences there is no need to search for similar sequences probably the most remarkable advantages of the present method is its simplicity and intuitiveness the increasing availability of complete genomes has cast doubt instead of adding details to the phylogenetic tree qi et al 2004 phylogenetic analysis based on sequence alignments is usually done on the most conservative part of a gene these fragments are usually coding sequences especially the sequences coding for catalytic sites or the core of proteins because they tend to be more evolutionarily conserved it was said by a virologist that people could not simply assume that a virus can be represented by its polymerase httpwwwncbinlmnihgovictv a virus must be viewed as a whole non-coding sequences also play an important role in the virus so do the less conserved genes in addition analyses based on different genes may lead to different results consequently by using complete genomes one can avoid choosing which genes to be aligned therefore methods that are based on the whole genome are likely to be more objective recently a k-string composition approach was proposed to analyze prokaryote phylogeny based on the whole proteome and satisfactory results were obtained qi et al 2004 however such analysis must rely on the annotation information in contrast the complete genome sequence is the only input of the current method neither the annotation information nor any adjustable parameters are needed it is noteworthy that the current method is performed automatically without any human intervention the z-curve which serves as the foundation of the present method is a powerful tool to study the complete genome sequence the z-curve contains all the information that the corresponding dna sequence carries many characteristics of a genome with biological meaning can be observed from the corresponding z-curve such as the replication origins and genomic islands for some bacterial and archaeal genomes zhang et al 2003 we can inspect a genome in an intuitive way regardless of the gene content and gene order even though the sequences are of different lengths if the z-curves of two species show similar pattern even though the genomes have different lengths one may infer that they are evolutionarily close organisms and vice versa in this paper we use the geometric center and the eigenvectors to describe the pattern approximately although this is only a rough approximation it represents just an attempt to apply the z-curve method to the phylogenetic analysis and the results obtained agree well with previous analyses this method is aimed to analyze the phylogeny of the genomes which have close phylogenetic relationships phylogenetics analysis is based on the differences among the three-dimensional z-curves in this paper the 24 genomes under study all belong to the same genus coronavirus additionally the differences of length among genomes are not very large if the genomes under study have much farther phylogenetic relationships and the differences in length are considerably large the present method may not work consequently cautions must be taken when using the present method to study the phylogeny of organisms with far evolutionary distances in addition unlike the estimation based on comparison of orthologous genes the z-curve approach is also sensitive to genome rearrangements a single large-scale inversion can change the form of z-curve drastically therefore the method presented here is considerably limited in the cases of genome rearrangements in addition as mentioned above the three-dimensional z-curve is approximately depicted by a few parameters such as the geometric center and the associated three eigenvectors consequently information contained in the z-curve is lost considerably in so doing it is reasonable to suppose that the more information is extracted from the z-curve the more accurate result can be gained therefore the current method can be improved if new and more effective algorithms are proposed to extract information contained in the z-curves in summary although the present method has some advantages it is still in its premature stage the method may not be applied to some general cases therefore the applications of it are considerably limited at present a geometric approach to infer phylogenetic relationships based on the z-curves of complete genomes is proposed in this article phylogenetic analysis of the 24 coronaviruses shows that sars-covs belong to a new cluster named group iv and this result is consistent with those of previous analyses the method has much room to be improved because of the possibility to extract information from the whole genome instead of some individual genes although having some limitations the current whole-genome-based geometric approach represents a new direction to infer phylogenetic relationships of organisms in the post-genome era however the method is still in its premature stage and its applications are considerably limited at present  title a snapshot of sars-cov-2 genome availability up to 30 th march 2020 and its implications running head analytic hurdles of available sars-cov-2 genomes carla mavian simone marini mattia prosperi marco salemi  although genome sequences of sars-cov-2 are growing daily and contain sufficient phylogenetic information country-specific data still present severe limitations and should be interpreted with caution the sars-cov-2 pandemic has been growing exponentially affecting nearly 900 thousand people and causing enormous distress to economies and societies worldwide a plethora of analyses based on viral sequences has already been published in scientific journals as well as through non-peer reviewed channels to investigate sars-cov-2 genetic heterogeneity and spatiotemporal dissemination we examined full genome sequences currently available to assess the presence of sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies in countries with the highest toll of confirmed cases although number of-available full-genomes is growing daily and the full dataset contains sufficient phylogenetic information that would allow reliable inference of phylogenetic relationships country-specific sars-cov-2 datasets still present severe limitations studies assessing within country spread or transmission clusters should be considered preliminary at best or hypothesis generating hence the need for continuing concerted efforts to increase number and quality of the sequences required for robust tracing of the epidemic  in december 2019 a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 was identified in wuhan china as the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019  which by march 2020 has already spread across more than 80 countries 1  common symptoms of infection include fever cough and shortness of breath while severe cases are characterized by advanced respiratory distress and pneumonia often resulting in death 2  it is still unknown what proportion of infected people that only present mild or no symptoms are spreading the virus a recent study showed that in wuhan whom roughly 60 of all infections were spread by asymptomatic subjects 3  this characteristic significantly thwarts the job of public health officials who are trying to detect transmission clusters few transmission clusters have been identified in china recently through epidemiological contact tracing however because of the ongoing nature of the outbreak it is even more complicated if not impossible to detect transmission clusters using genetic data soon after the first epidemiological and sars-cov-2 genetic sequence data were made available a glut of phylogeny-based analyses began to circulate discussing in scientific papers as well as social media countries that might have been fueling the spread the implications of misunderstanding the real dynamic of the covid-19 pandemic are extremely dangerous ethnic or social discrimination resulting from unsupported assumptions on viral contagion -often amplified by irresponsible uncontrollable communications -can be highly damaging for people and countries in particular the us-based nextstrain 4 team has been posting real-time updates on the epidemic tracing by molecular analyses despite social media are often vehicle for fake news and boast news hype it is also worth noting the tremendous effort of the scientific community to provide free up-to-date information on ongoing studies as well as critical evaluations several discussions and evidence-based debates on controversial hypotheses on the epidemic have ensued -such as the number of untraced infections in the us the putative virus introduction in italy through germany and the alleged lineage diversification in china 5 later criticized 6  recently an editorial published on science 7 has also highlighted how unsupported or misleading claims circulating in forums social media and even peer-reviewed articles have been led by a substantial over interpretation of the available data hence the urgency to reframe the current debate in more rigorous scientific terms and quantitatively evaluate whether sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies currently exists or which gaps need to be addressed we explored the characteristics of few datasets through time and assess phylogenetic signal to understand whether we this data is useful of not before carrying out any phylogeny-based analysis of virus evolution and spatiotemporal spread it is crucial to test the quality of sequence data since uneven sampling presence of phylogenetic noise and absence of temporal signal can affect reliability of the results eg ancestral state reconstructions molecular clock calibrations 8  sars-cov-2 full genome sequences were obatained from gisaid httpswwwgisaidorg 9 at different timepoints as of march 30 th  we compared the number of full genomes sampled per country with the number of confirmed cases at the time of sampling as well as the countrys total population figure 1  we obtained 2608 full genomes from 55 countries  figure 1  during the past month the number of genomes has steeply been increasing march 3 rd  169 genome sequences from 22 countries march 10 th  331 genome sequences from 29 countries march 18 th  794 genome sequences from 35 countries 045 march 25 th  1662 genome sequences from 42 countries we found spearman rank correlation between confirmed cases and genomes per country to be 049 on march 30 th  and we considered it as a proxy for sampling homogeneity however correlation could only be investigated with confirmed cases again as proxy since not all affected countries have made publicly available the total number of coronavirus testing performed moreover even within the same country sequenced genomes were usually sampled from few hotspots not necessarily representative of the whole epidemic in that country it is worrisome that as of march 30 th 2020 the two top countries in terms of confirmed cases do not show sufficiently large and representative sampling sars-cov-2 full genome sequences available from patients in the us the country with the highest number of confirmed cases have mainly been sampled in washington state 66 during the early epidemic while less than one third 32 are available from the epicenter of the us epidemic the state of new york italy the second country per confirmed cases uploaded 26 genomes of which one from the marche region four from friuli venezia giulia seven from abruzzo nine from lazio and only five from lombardy which is epicenter of the italian epidemic table s1  lack of resolution and uncertainty in the sars-cov-2 phylogenetic tree is to be expected considering that relatively little genetic diversity can be accumulated during the first three months of an epidemic even for an exponentially spreading and fast-evolving rna virus assessment of phylogenetic signal in the dataset was carried out using likelihood mapping analysis 11  which estimates the likelihood of each of possible tree topology for any group of four sequences quartet randomly chosen from an alignment and reports them inside an equilateral triangle the likelihood map where the corners represent distinct tree topologies and the center star-like trees quartets are considered resolved when the three likelihoods are significantly different phylogenetic signal most dots equally distributed in the corners ie data are suitable for robust phylogeny inference unresolved or partially resolved when all three likelihood values or two of them are not significantly different phylogenetic noise most dots in sides or center areas ie data may not be sufficient for robust phylogeny inference extensive simulation studies have shown that for sequences to be considered robust in terms of phylogenetic signal sidecenter areas of the likelihood mapping must include 40 of the unresolved quartets 12  overall phylogenetic signal in the present data has been increasing with number of genomes been released percentage of unresolved quartets detected in the sars-cov-2 full genomes alignment on march 3 rd and 10 th was still too high to allow reliable inferences  figure s1  in other words such a lack of phylogenetic signal has likely resulted in overall unreliable topology of any sars-cov-2 tree obtained using those data and even clades with high bootstrap values should have been interpreted with extreme caution the effect of inhomogeneous sampling lack of phylogenetic signal and missing data on phylogeography reconstructions like the ones recently rushed through news and social media to claim specific dissemination routes of sars-cov-2 among countries can be quite dramatic an instructive example is the putative introduction of sars-cov-2 in italy from germany a preliminary maximum likelihood ml tree inferred from the full genome viral sequences available on march 3 rd 2020 showed a well-supported cluster of european and asian sequences reported in figure s2  which contained a subclade subclade a figure 2a  including a sequence isolated in germany that appears to be paraphyletic with strong bootstrap support to an italian sequence clustering in turn with sequences from finland mexico germany and switzerland based on this observation which was available on nextstrain a heated discussion circulated on social media about a transmission event from germany to italy followed by further spread from italy the other countries however in a new tree inferred just one week later when more than 135 new full genome sequences were made available on gisaid 9  the direct link between germany and italy in subclade a disappeared due to the additional clustering of previously unsampled sequences from portugal brazil wales and netherland figure 2b  in addition likelihoods of alternative tree topologies generated arbitrarily switching branches in the tree arrows in figure   2b  implying different dissemination scenarios were not significantly different shimodaira- hasgawa test table s2  than the likelihood of the tree inferred from the real data in other words it is not possible with present data to decide which branching pattern and therefore phylogeographic reconstruction is the one most likely representing actual dissemination routes among european countries available genome sequences are rapidly growing sars-cov-2 full genome dataset is now showing less than 40 of unresolved quartets in the center 386 unresolved quartets on march 18 th 794 genome sequences  figure s1c  and 323 on march 25 th 1660 genome sequences  figure s1d  this indicates that the amount of phylogenetic information is now potentially usable to define phylogenetic relationships among strains plotting mean genetic distance of each sequence from the root of a phylogeny versus the sequence sampling time allows to testing for significant linear correlation which is necessary for the calibration of a reliable molecular clock 13  figure s3  as expected in genomes obtained over a very short period of time  three months since the beginning of the outbreak correlation in the current data is fairly week table   s3  however bayesian analysis 14  which infers phylogenetic and phylogeographic patterns from a posterior distribution of trees might facilitate comparisons about different evolutionary scenarios help in retrieving the correct topology and estimate an accurate evolutionary rate using relaxed clock methods 15  reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships of the same european subclade a discussed above with sequence available on march 18 th 2020 showed a much more complex snapshot of sars-cov-2 spreading  figure s4  taking a closer look at the sublade a reveals that even with more genomes available inference is bias by over-sampling of some countries and under-sampling of others  figure s4  yet even with more genomes available inference is bias by over-sampling of some countries and under-sampling of others  figure s4  recently methods were developed to estimate for each pair of viral sequences from two infected individuals how many intermediates there are in the putative transmission chain connecting them using a transmission matrix 16  the analysis of sars-cov-2 genomes shows that numerous links among samples are still missing  figure s5  in such a scenario it is not advisable to extrapolate conclusions on the origin and dissemination of strains phylogenetic signal is increasing in the global alignment yet likelihood mapping per country using data from countries reporting highest number of cases -usa italy spain germany and france -indicate that some local datasets lack sufficient signal  figure s6 neither china nor us showed phylogenetic signal despite the high number of genome sequences available  figure s6  on the contrary and unexpectedly countries with low number of genome sequences did show presence of phylogenetic signal germany spain and france  figure s6  despite the presence of phylogenetic signal in these countries only genomes form france also show temporal signal that would allow for calibration of a molecular clock and re-framing phylogenetic and phylogeography inferences in spatiotemporal dimension on the other hand the transmission matrix for france indicates that considerable links are still missing due to unsampled infected individuals limiting the reliability of transmission cluster studies based on sequence data  figure s8  as more genome sequences sampled at different time points and from diverse geographic areas are daily becoming available in depth bayesian phylodynamic and phylogeography analyses of the covid-19 pandemic may soon be a viable option as long new data do not increase phylogenetic and temporal signal results will remain highly questionable characterization of transmission events is fundamental to understand the dynamics of any infectious disease from a public health standpoint being able to trace transmission at the local level is crucial within country identification of active transmission clusters would open the way to more effective public health measures the most optimal inference of transmission events would have a combination of genetic and epidemiological data for a joint analysis however it is not possible at the moment to identify transmission clusters within regions counties or cities solely on genetic data since micro-scale genetic data is not yet available indeed transmission investigations that have been performed so far have been based on contact-tracing epidemiological and clinical data 17 18  published scientific data and media are nowadays easily accessible to a worldwide audience properly weighing the information being shared is important more than ever we deem that current molecular epidemiology data are not solid enough to provide a scientifically sound analysis of sars-cov-2 spread despite overall increasing of phylogenetic and temporal signal we suggest that any conclusion drawn at present about existing lineages and direction of viral spread based on phylogenetic analysis of sars-cov-2 sequence data should be considered at the very best preliminary and hypothesis-generating the evolutionary dynamics of sars-cov-2 spread is unveiling an unprecedented amount of information essential to make policy decisions the whole of humanity is threatened by the current pandemic and policy makers need to adjust their mitigation measures while the pandemic itself is developing some of the urgent answers required lie in the timely availability of abundant high quality genetic data not only from countries experiencing a high number of reported cases but also from others that seem to be experiencing at least for now a lower number of infections gisaid was accessed on march 30 th 2020 table s1  after quality control of sequences that  transitiontransversions vs genetic distance plot were calculated using dambe6 19  evaluation of the presence of phylogenetic signal satisfying resolved phylogenetic relationships among sequences was carried out with iq-tree allowing the software to search for all possible quartets using the best-fitting nucleotide substitution model 11  ml tree reconstruction was performed in iq-tree based on the best-fit model chosen according to bayesian information criterion bic 20 21  exploration of temporal structure ie presence of molecular clock in the data was assessed by regression of divergence -root-to-tip genetic distance-against sampling time using tempest 13  in this case absence of a linear trend indicates that the data does not contain temporal signal and that the data is not appropriate for phylogenetic inference using molecular clock models transphylo r package was used to infer transmission matrices of sars-cov-2 16  ms is supported in part by the

svetoslav slavov nanev  the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 is an international public health emergency until now the intermediate host and mechanisms of interspecies jump of this virus are unknown phylogenetic analysis of all available bat coronavirus cov complete genomes was performed in order to analyze the relationships between bat cov and sars-cov-2 in order to suggest a possible intermediate host another phylogenetic reconstruction of cov genomes obtained from animals which were hypothetically commercialized in the chinese markets was also carried out moreover mutation analysis was executed to suggest genomic regions which may have permitted the adaptation of sars-cov-2 to the human host the phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that sars-cov-2 formed a cluster with the bat cov isolate ratg13 possible cov interspecies jumps among bat isolates were also observed the phylogenetic tree reconstructed from cov strains belonging to different animals demonstrated that sars-cov-2 bat ratg13 and pangolin cov genomes formed a monophyletic cluster demonstrating that pangolins may be suggested as sars-cov-2 intermediate hosts three aa substitutions localized in the s1 portion of the s gene were observed some of which have been correlated to structural modifications of the s protein which may facilitate sars-cov-2 tropism to human cells this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved accepted article our analysis shows the tight relationship between sars-cov-2 and bat sars-like strains it also hypothesizes that pangolins might have been possible intermediate hosts of the infection some of the observed aa substitutions in the s binding protein may serve as possible adaptation mutations in humans but more studies are needed to elucidate their function  currently the world is facing the largest cov pandemic caused by sars-cov-2 with millions of cases throughout the world the disease caused by sars-cov-2 covid-19 ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory failure 5  in the early infection phases anti-sars cov igg and igm are produced within a period of approximately 13 days after symptom onset 6  the infection can be controlled by timely detection of sars-cov-2 rna in patients similar to sars-cov sars-cov-2 can be treated by population isolation and antiviral and symptomatic treatments all of them with varying levels of success 7  many efforts for more this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved effective sars-cov-2 treatment are in progress now including compounds targeting viral products that have an essential function especially the viral main protease 89  one of the most intriguing questions is related to the origin of sars-cov-2 and its interspecies jump to the human population the first cases of unknown causes of pneumonia originated from the huanan seafood and animal market in the city of wuhan hubei province china 7  so far the mechanism of interspecies jump of sars-cov-2 has not been fully understood although malayan pangolins manis javanica have been suggested as possible intermediate hosts due to the high similarity of pangolin and sars-cov-2 genomes 710 while bats are regarded as the original source of the infection 11  the aim of our study was to analyze the available data of complete zoonotic cov genomes in regards to sars-cov-2 in order to examine possible relationships interspecies evolution and suggest a possible intermediate host of sars-cov-2 furthermore knowing the importance of viral proteins for viral cycle and host adaptation we have investigated the s gene which is responsible for viral adsorption and probably participates in the host shifts we also obtained information of the geographic origin of the host year of virus detectionisolation and the type of the infected host species name or genus all of this information was represented on the tree branches we used the following keyword combinations for the search of complete bat cov genomes in the genbank for construction of the dataset the first applied criterion was if the genome was complete but we also added other characteristics including the geographic origin of the host year of virus detectionisolation and the type of the infected host species name or genus all of this information was represented on the tree branches the sequences of animal cov were not directly obtained from chinese markets but from this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved we used the following keyword combinations for the search of complete animal cov genomes in the genbank i murinecoronaviruscompletegenome ii camelcoronaviruscompletegenome iii deercoronaviruscompletegenome the sequence dataset was aligned using maftt v7450 software 12 sequences identified as duplicates in the phylogenetic reconstruction were excluded for visualization of the tree and for its editing we used the figtree v 14 software 15  we opted for division of the datasets into two groups and consequently into two different phylogenetic trees due to the following reasons i the phylogenetic tree which included cov complete genomes isolated from bats aimed at investigating bat cov diversity in relation to the bat genera as well as the evolutionary behavior including interspecies jumps which can increase the spread of certain cov isolates and ii the phylogenetic tree which included cov obtained from animal candidates which could hypothetically be commercialized in the chinese markets was reconstructed in order to suggest a possible intermediate host for sars-cov-2 which could have served as a source for viral introduction into the human population initially in order to evaluate the impact of the evolutionary pressure for virus-host adaptation we performed similarity analysis using the brig software v 095 blast ring image generator 16 comparing the bat cov isolate ratg13 obtained accepted article from rhinolophus affinis mn996532 and the first sequenced human strain of sars-cov-2 wuhan-hu-1 mn908947 in this analysis we obtain a circular graph that verifies similarity between the human and bat strains and attempts to outline areas with significant mutation coverage consequently the exact localization of the mutations in high resolution was shown using the pipmaker program 17 finally we used the predictprotein software 21 to predict aspects of protein structure and function interspecies jumps were suspected in almost all of the clusters of the phylogenetic tree however these events probably occurred in a different manner we observed that some cases such as cov jumps from hipposideros to rousettus occurred in a clade where there were only cov genomes obtained from hipposideros the same event occurred for pipistrellus cov isolates located among rhinolophus and rousettus cov isolates see the grey lines in figure 1  however we can consider as interspecies jumps the presence of cov strains with high genetic similarity isolated from evolutionary divergent bat genera as in the cases of pipistrellus cov isolates with high genetic similarity to cov obtained from hypsugo bats and myotis cov isolates with high genetic similarity to cov strains isolated from rhinolophus bats  figure 1  on the other hand we observed that the clusters i ii and iii  figure 1 this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved the analysis of the possible mutations of sars-cov-2 wuhan-hu-1 strain in comparison to zoonotic bat sequence ratg13 revealed the existence of 1141 single nucleotide polymorphisms snps with 96 identity between the two sequences as was suspected most of the identified mutations were located in the s spike gene which encompasses positions between 21563 bp to 25384 bp genbank accession number mn908947 therefore we focused our analyses on the spike s-protein portion with both its subregions s1s2 and the junction region where we found 30 prra localized in the junction region of the s1s1 subunits composing the s protein after carrying out the analyzes using brig software we found a similarity rate of 96 between ratg13 and sars-cov-2 wuhan isolate however the mutations which were present in the human strain were randomly distributed along the s gene and not concentrated in a specific location which did not permit their graphical representation the performed study reveals the phylogenetic relationships between sars-cov-2 and cov genomes obtained from bats from different parts of the world moreover we the performed mutation analysis demonstrated several aa changes which were localized in the s region of the sars-cov-2 genome compared to ratg13 bat strain the aa insertion at position 680 prra is already described in the literature and is located at the s1-s2 junction of the s protein and is a polybasic cleavage site leading to generation of the binding s1 and fusion s2 subunits 26  the generation of the furin subunit can be an important adaptation factor for sars-cov-2 replication in humans moreover more r in the s1-s2 cleavage site can enhance the cleavage of s1 and s2 subunits with the removal of the structural constraints and as a consequence the insert peptide s2 is exposed and can be inserted into the host cell membrane the sars-cov-2 is a major world health emergency which has led to breakdowns in the health systems of the affected countries therefore detailed studies of the origins   evolutionary origins of the sars-cov-2 sarbecovirus lineage responsible for the covid-19 pandemic maciej boni f philippe lemey xiaowei jiang tommy tsan yuk lam blair perry todd castoe andrew rambaut david robertson l  there are outstanding evolutionary questions on the recent emergence of coronavirus in hubei province that caused the covid-19 pandemic including 1 the relationship of the new virus to the sars-related coronaviruses 2 the role of bats as a reservoir species 3 the potential role of other mammals in the emergence event and 4 the role of recombination in viral emergence here we address these questions and find that the sarbecoviruses -the viral subgenus responsible for the emergence of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 -exhibit frequent recombination but the sars-cov-2 lineage itself is not a recombinant of any viruses detected to date in order to employ phylogenetic methods to date the divergence events between sars-cov-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir recombinant regions of a 68-genome sarbecovirus alignment were removed with three independent methods bayesian evolutionary rate and divergence date estimates were consistent for all three recombination-free alignments and robust to two different prior specifications based on hcov-oc43 and mers-cov evolutionary rates divergence dates between sars-cov-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir were estimated as 1948 95 hpd 1879 -1999  1969 95 hpd 1930-2000 and 1982 95 hpd 1948 -2009  despite intensified characterization of sarbecoviruses since sars the lineage giving rise to sars-cov-2 has been circulating unnoticed for decades in bats and been transmitted to other hosts such as pangolins the occurrence of a third significant coronavirus emergence in 17 years together with the high prevalence and virus diversity in bats implies that these viruses are likely to cross species boundaries again  25 the betacoronavirus sars-cov-2 is a member of the sarbecovirus subgenus which shows frequent recombination in its evolutionary history we characterize the extent of this genetic exchange and identify non-recombining regions of the sarbecovirus genome using three independent methods to remove the effects of recombination using these non-recombining genome regions and prior information on coronavirus evolutionary rates we obtain estimates from three approaches that the most likely divergence date of sars-cov-2 from its most closely related available bat sequences ranges from 1948 to 1982  ratg13 is the closest available bat virus to sars-cov-2 a sub-lineage of these bat viruses is able to infect humans two sister lineages of the ratg13sars-cov-2 lineage infect malayan pangolins  the sarbecoviruses show a pattern of deep recombination events indicating that there are high levels of co-infection in horseshoe bats and that the viral pool can generate novel allele combinations and substantial genetic diversity the sarbecoviruses are efficient explorers of phenotype space  the sars-cov-2 lineage is not a recent recombinant at least not involving any of the bat or pangolin viruses sampled to date  non-recombinant regions of the sarbecoviruses can be identified allowing for phylogenetic inference and dating to be performed we constructed three such regions using different methods  we estimate that ratg13 and sars-cov-2 diverged 40 to 70 years ago there is a diverse unsampled reservoir of generalist viruses established in horseshoe bats  while an intermediate host responsible for the zoonotic event cannot be ruled out the relevant evolution for spillover to humans very likely occurred in horseshoe bats  25  in december 2019 a cluster of pneumonia cases epidemiologically linked to an open-air wet market in city of wuhan hubei province china zhou et al 2020b led local health officials to issue an epidemiological alert to the chinese center for disease control and prevention china cdc and the world health organizations who china country office in early january the etiological agent of the pneumonia cases was found to be a coronavirus world health organization 2020a  subsequently named sars-cov-2 by an international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv study group gorbalenya et al 2020  also named hcov-19 by wu et al 2020b  the first available sequence data placed this novel human pathogen in the sarbecovirus subgenus of coronaviridae lu et al 2020  the same sub-genus as the sars virus that caused a global outbreak of nearly 8000 cases in 2002 2003  by mid-january the virus was spreading widely inside hubei province and by early march sars-cov-2 reached pandemic status world health organization 2020b  in outbreaks of zoonotic pathogens identification of the infection source is crucial as this may allow health authorities to separate human populations from the wild-life or domestic-animal reservoirs posing the zoonotic risk stegeman et al 2004 yu et al 2013  if controlling an outbreak in its early stages is not possible -as was the case for the covid-19 epidemic in hubei province -identification of origins and point sources is nevertheless important for containment purposes in other provinces and prevention of future outbreaks when the first genome sequence of sars-cov-2 wuhan-hu-1 was released on january 10 2020 on virologicalorg by a consortium led by yong-zhen zhang it enabled the immediate analyses of its ancestry across a large region of its genome corresponding approximately to orf1b  it did not cluster with any of the known bat coronaviruses indicating that recombination likely played a role in the evolutionary history of these viruses lu et al 2020 wu et al 2020b  subsequently a bat sarbecovirus -ratg13 sampled from a rhinolophus affinis horseshoe bat in 2013 in yunnan province -was reported that clusters with sars-cov-2 in almost all genomic regions with approximately 96 genome sequence identity zhou et al 2020b  zhou et al 2020b concluded from the genetic proximity of sars-cov-2 to a bat virus that a bat origin for the current covid-19 outbreak is probable recent evidence has also identified pangolins as potential intermediate species for sars-cov-2 emergence or as a potential reservoir species themselves lam et al 2020 xiao et al 2020  unlike other viruses that have emerged in the past two decades coronaviruses are highly recombinogenic forni et al 2017 hon et al 2008 lam et al 2018  influenza viruses reassort webster et al 1992 but they do not undergo homologous recombination within rna segments boni et al 2008 boni et al  2010  meaning that origins questions for influenza outbreaks can always be reduced to origins questions for each of influenzas eight rna segments for coronaviruses however recombination means that small genomic sub-regions can have independent origins identifiable if sufficient sampling has been done in the animal reservoirs that support the endemic circulation coinfection and recombination that appear to be common here we analyse the evolutionary history of sars-cov-2 using available genomic data on sarbecoviruses we demonstrate that the sarbecoviruses circulating in horseshoe bats have complex recombination histories 5  25 permitting generation of novel viral variants as reported by others he et al 2014 hon et al 2008 hu et al 2017 li et al 2020b lin et al 2017 wang et al 2017 yuan et al 2010 zhou et al 2020a  interestingly despite the lineage leading to sars-cov-2 acquiring residues in its spike s proteins receptorbinding domain rbd permitting use of human ace2 wan et al 2020 and being closer to the pangolin virus than ratg13 in this region lam et al 2020  -a signal that suggests recombination -the divergence patterns in the s protein show no evidence of recombination between sars-cov-2 and known sarbecoviruses our results indicate the presence of a single lineage circulating in bats with properties that allowed it to infect human cells as previously described for the bat sarbecoviruses related to the first sars-cov lineage ge et al 2013 menachery et al 2015 menachery et al  2016  to gauge the length of time this lineage has circulated in bats we estimate the time to most recent common ancestor tmrca of sars-cov-2 and ratg13 we use three bioinformatic approaches to remove the effects of recombination and we combine these approaches to identify putative non-recombinant regions that can be used for reliable phylogenetic reconstruction and dating collectively our analyses point to bats being the primary reservoir for the sars-cov-2 lineage while it is possible that pangolins may have acted as an intermediate species facilitating transmission to humans the evidence is consistent with the virus having evolved in bats resulting in bat sarbecoviruses that can replicate in the upper respiratory tract of both humans and pangolins zhang and holmes 2020 zhou et al 2020a  of the 68 sequences in the aligned sarbecovirus sequence set 67 show evidence of mosaicism indicating involvement in homologous recombination either directly with identifiable parentals or in their deeper shared evolutionary history ie due to shared ancestral recombination events all dunn-sidak corrected p  4  10 -4  3seq lam et al 2018  this is evidence for numerous recombination events occurring in the evolutionary history of the sarbecoviruses  however identifying all past events and their temporal order eden et al 2013 is challenging figure 1 top shows the distribution of all identified breakpoints using 3seqs exhaustive triplet search by the number of candidate recombinant sequences supporting them the histogram allows for the identification of non-recombining regions by revealing regions with no breakpoints sorting these breakpoint-free regions bfrs by length results in two segments longer than 5kb an orf1a sub-region spanning nucleotides 3625-9150 and the first half of orf1b spanning nucleotides 13291-19628 eight other bfrs longer than 500nt were identified of the nine breakpoints defining these ten bfrs four showed phylogenetic incongruence pi signals with bootstrap support higher than 80 adopting previously published criteria on using a combination of mosaic and pisignals to show evidence of past recombination events boni et al 2010  all four of these breakpoints were also identified with the tree-based recombination detection method gard kosakovsky pond et al 2006  the extent of the sarbecoviruses recombination history can be demonstrated by five phylogenetic trees inferred from bfrs or concatenated adjacent bfrs figure 1 bottom  bfrs were concatenated if no 6  25 phylogenetic incongruence signal could be identified between them when viewing the last 7kb of the genome a clade of viruses from northeast ne china appears to cluster with sequences from south-central sc chinese provinces but when inspecting trees from different parts of orf1ab the ne china clade is phylogenetically separated from the sc china clade individual sequences such as rpshaanxi2011 guangxi gx2013 and two sequences from zhejiang province covzxc21covzc45 as previously shown zhou et al 2020a  show strong phylogenetic recombination signals as they fall on different evolutionary lineages with bootstrap support  80 depending what region of the genome is being examined despite this high frequency of recombination among bat viruses the block-like nature of the genome permits retrieval of a clean sub-alignment for phylogenetic analysis conservatively we can combine three 2kb bfrs identified above into a putative non-recombining region 1 nrr1 after removing five sequences that appear to be recombinants and two small sub-regions of the longer region nucleotides 13291-19628 alternatively combining 3seq-inferred breakpoints with gard-inferred breakpoints and the necessity of pi-signals for inferring recombination we can use the 99kb region spanning nucleotides 11885-21753 nrr2 as a putative non-recombining region this approach is conservative in identifying breakpoints but not conservative in identifying non-recombining regions using a third consensus-based approach for identifying recombinant regions in individual sequences -with six different recombination detection methods in rdp5 martin et al 2015 -gives a putative recombination-free alignment that we call non-recombinant alignment 3 nra3 see methods figure 2  with phylogenies reconstructed for two major sub-regions of nrr1 as the sars-cov-2 s protein has been implicated in past recombination events or possibly convergent evolution lam et al 2020  we specifically investigated several sub-regions of the s proteinthe n-terminal domain of s1 the c-terminal domain of s1 the variable loop region of the c-terminal domain and s2 the variable loop region in sars-cov-2 shows closer identity to the 2019 pangolin coronavirus sequence than to the ratg13 bat virus supported by phylogenetic inference figure 3  on first examination this would suggest that that sars-cov-2 is a recombinant of an ancestor of pangolin-2019 and ratg13 however on closer inspection the relative divergences in the phylogenetic tree figure 3  bottom show that sars-cov-2 is unlikely to have acquired the variable loop from an ancestor of pangolin-2019 as these two sequences are approximately 10 divergent throughout the entire s protein excluding the ntd it is ratg13 that is divergent in the variable loop region and is the likely product of recombination acquiring a divergent 7  25 variable loop from an as yet unsampled bat sarbecovirus this is notable because the variable loop region contains the six key contact residues in the receptor binding domain rbd that give sars-cov-2 its ace2 binding specificity wan et al 2020  these residues are also in the 2019 pangolin coronavirus sequence the most parsimonious explanation for these shared residues is a single bat virus lineage including the common ancestor of sars-cov-2 ratg13 and pangolin guangdong 2019 has the ace2 specific residues rather than the sars-cov-2 being recombinant this provides compelling support for the sars-cov-2 lineage being the consequence of a direct or nearly-direct zoonotic jump from bats because the key ace2 binding residues were present in viruses circulating in bats using the most conservative approach to identifying a non-recombinant genomic region nrr1 sars-cov-2 forms a sister lineage with ratg13 with genetically related cousin lineages of coronavirus sampled in pangolins in guangdong and guangxi provinces  figure 2  given that these pangolin viruses are ancestral to the progenitor of the ratg13sars-cov-2 lineage it is more likely that they are also picking up viruses from bats while pangolins could be acting as intermediate hosts for bat viruses to get into humansthey develop severe respiratory disease lie et al 2019 and commonly come into contact with people as they are trafficked in large numbers for consumption and use in chinese medicine -pangolin infection is not a requirement for bat viruses to cross into humans phylogenies of sub-regions of nrr1 depict an appreciable degree of spatial structuring of the sarbecoviruses population across different regions  figure 2  one cluster consists of viruses from provinces in southcentral sc china guangxi yunnan guizhou as well as one sequence from sichuan province the major cluster in its sister lineage is almost exclusively occupied by viruses from provinces in northeast ne and central china hubei shaanxi shanxi henan hebei zheijang and jilin showing two trimmed segments to yield region a nt 13291-14932 15405-17162 18009-19628  region b spans nucleotides 3625-9150 and region c spans 9261-11795 to avoid artefacts due to recombination we focused on the non-recombining regions nrr1 nrr2 and the recombination-masked alignment nra3 for inferring time-measured evolutionary histories visual exploration using tempest indicates there is no evidence for temporal signal in these data sets  figure s1  this is not surprising for diverse viral populations with relatively deep evolutionary histories in such cases even moderate rate variation among long deep phylogenetic branches will significantly impact expected root-to-tip divergences over a sampling time range that represents only a small fraction of the evolutionary history trova et al 2015  however formal testing using marginal likelihood estimation duchene et al 2019 does not reject the absence of temporal signal in all three data sets table s1  albeit without strong support in favor of temporal signal log bayes factor support of 3 10 and 3 for nrr1 nrr2 and nra3 respectively in the absence of a strong temporal signal we sought to identify a suitable prior rate distribution to calibrate the time-measured trees by examining several coronaviruses sampled through time including hcov-oc43 mers-cov and sars-cov virus genomes these data sets were subjected to the same recombination masking approach as nra3 and were characterized by a strong temporal signal figure 4  but also by markedly different evolutionary rates specifically using a formal bayesian approach suchard et al 2018 see methods we estimate a fast evolutionary rate 000169 substsiteyr 95 highest posterior density we infer time-measured evolutionary histories using a bayesian phylogenetic approach while incorporating rate priors based on the mean mers-cov and hcov-oc43 rates and with standard deviations that allow for more uncertainty than the empirical estimates for both viruses see methods using both prior distributions this results in six highly similar posterior rate estimates for nrr1 nrr2 and nra3 centered around 000055 substsiteyr the fact that these estimates lie in between the mers-cov and hcov-oc43 14  25 rate is consistent with the intermediate sampling time range of about 18 years  figure 5  the consistency of the posterior rates for the different prior means also implies that the data do contribute to the evolutionary rate estimate despite the fact that a temporal signal was visually not apparent  figure s1  below we report divergence time estimates based on the hcov-oc43-centred rate priors but also summarize similar corresponding estimates for the mers-cov-centred rate priors in supplementary figure s3  are in general agreement with estimates using nrr2 and nra3 which result in divergence times of 1982 19482009 and 1948 1879-1999  respectively for sars-cov-2 and estimates of 1952 1906 1989 and 1970 1932-1996  respectively for the divergence time of sars-cov from its closest known bat ancestor the sars-cov divergence times are somewhat earlier than previously estimated dates hon et al 2008 as previous estimates were obtained using a collection of sars-cov genomes from human and civet hosts as well as a few closely related bat genomes which implies that the evolutionary rates were predominantly informed by the short-term sars outbreak scale and likely biased upwards for the time scale under investigation indeed the rates reported by these studies are in line with the short-term sars rates we estimate  figure 4  the estimated divergence times for the pangolin virus most closely related to sars-cov-2ratg13 range from 1851 1730 1958 to 1877 1746 1986  indicating that these pangolin lineages were acquired from bat viruses divergent to those that gave rise to sars-cov-2 current sampling of pangolins does not implicate them as an intermediate host identifying the origins of an emerging pathogen can be critical during the early stages of an outbreak as it may allow for containment measures to be precisely targeted at a stage when the number of daily new infections is still low early detection via genomics and sequencing was not possible during se asias initial outbreaks of avian influenza h5n1 1997 2003 2004 ge et al 2013 menachery et al 2015 menachery et al  2016  appropriate measures should have been in place for outbreaks of novel coronaviruses the key to successful surveillance is that we know which human-adapted viral phenotypes to look for holmes et al 2018  the key difficulty in inferring reliable evolutionary histories for coronaviruses is that their high recombination rate graham and baric 2010 su et al 2016 violates the assumption of standard phylogenetic approaches because different parts of the genome will have different origins in order to begin characterizing any ancestral relationships for sars-cov-2 non-recombinant regions of the genome must be identified so that reliable phylogenetic reconstruction and dating can be performed evolutionary rate estimation can be profoundly affected by the presence of recombination schierup and hein 1999  as there is no single accepted method of inferring breakpoints and identifying clean sub-regions with high certainty we implemented several approaches to identifying three classic statistical signals of recombination mosaicism 16  25 green boxplots show the tmrca estimate for the ratg13sars-cov-2 lineage and its most closely related pangolin lineage guangdong 2020 transparent boxes of the interquartile range width and with the same colours are superimposed to highlight the overlap between the estimates in supplementary figure s3  we compare these divergence time estimates to those obtained using the mers-cov-centred rate priors for nrr1 nrr2 and nra3 phylogenetic incongruence and excessive homoplasy posada et al 2002  our most conservative approach attempted to ensure that putative non-recombining regions had no mosaic or phylogenetic incongruence signals a second approach was conservative with respect to breakpoint identification while a third approach attempted to minimize the number of regions removed while still minimizing signals of mosaicism and homoplasy the origins we present in figure 5 nrr1 are conservative in the sense that nrr1 is more likely to be non-recombinant than nrr2 or nra3 as the estimated rates and divergence dates were highly similar in the three data sets analyzed we conclude that our estimates are robust to the method of identifying the genomes non-recombinant regions due to the absence of temporal signal in the sarbecovirus data sets we used informative prior distributions on the evolutionary rate to estimate divergence dates we show that such prior calibration information can be obtained from other coronaviruses sars-cov mers-cov and hcov-oc43 but their rates vary with the time scale of sample collection in the presence of time-dependent rate variation a widely observed phenomenon for viruses duchene et al 2014 aiewsakun and katzourakis 2016 membrebe et al 2019  the slower rates appear more appropriate for sarbecoviruses that currently encompass a sampling time range of about 18 years we therefore centered the prior rate distributions on the mean hcov-oc43 and mers-cov rate but permitted the distributions a greater variance than the empirical rate estimates for these lineages this approach resulted in similar posterior rates despite the different prior means implying that the sarbecovirus data do inform the rate estimate even though root-to-top temporal signal was not apparent the relatively fast evolutionary rate means that it is most appropriate to estimate shallow nodes in the sarbecovirus evolutionary history including the divergence times of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 from their most closely related bat viruses accurately estimating deeper nodes would require adequately accommodating time-dependent rate variation while such models have recently been made available we lack the information to calibrate the rate decline through time eg through internal node calibrations membrebe et al 2019  as a proxy it would be possible to model the long-term purifying selection dynamics as a major source of time-dependent rates rates duchene et al 2014 aiewsakun and katzourakis 2016 membrebe et al 2019  but this is beyond the scope of the current study the assumption of long-term purifying selection would imply that coronaviruses are at endemic equilibrium with their natural host species horseshoe bats to which they are presumably well-adapted although there is currently little evidence supporting or contradicting strong positive selection in the sarbecovirus lineage if multiple host species were to be identified that are able to support endemic viral transmission then the positive selection that would be associated with new species adaptations would need to be considered when inferring evolutionary rate variation through time of importance for future emergence events is the appreciation that sars-cov-2 has emerged from the same horseshoe bat subgenus that harbours sars-like coronaviruses another similarity between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 is their divergence time 40-70 years ago from currently known extant bat-virus lineages  figure 5  this long divergence period indicates there are unsampled viruses circulating in horseshoe bats that have zoonotic potential  while there is clear involvement of other mammalian species -specifically pangolins for sars-cov-2 -as a plausible conduit for transmission to humans there 18  25 is no evidence pangolins are facilitating adaptation to humans a hypothesis of snakes as intermediate hosts of sars-cov-2 was posited during the early epidemic phase ji et al 2020  but we found no evidence of this anderson 2020 robertson 2020  see supplementary section 3 with horseshoe bats currently the most plausible source for sars-cov-2 it is important to consider that sarbecoviruses circulate in a variety of horseshoe bat species with often widely overlapping species ranges wong et al 2019  yet the viral population is largely spatially structured according to provinces in the south and southeast on one lineage and provinces in the center east and northeast on another figure 2  this boundary appears to be rarely crossed two exceptions can be seen in the relatively close relationship of viruses from hong kong bats to viruses from zheijang with two of the latter covzc45 and covzxc21 identified as recombinants and a recombinant virus from sichuan for which part of the genome region b of sc2018 in figure 2  clusters with viruses from provinces in the center east and northeast of china sars-cov-2 and ratg13 are also exceptions as they were sampled from hubei and yunnan respectively the fact that they are geographically relatively distant is in agreement with their somewhat distant tmrca because the spatial structure suggests that migration between their locations may be uncommon from this perspective it may be useful to perform surveillance for more closely related virus to sars-cov-2 along the gradient from yunnan to hubei it is clear from our analysis that viruses closely related to sars-cov-2 have been circulating in horseshoe bats for many decades the substantial unsampled diversity on the sars-cov-2ratg13 lineage suggests that there is a major clade of bat sarbecoviruses with generalist properties -with respect to their ability to infect a range of mammalian cells -that facilitated its jump to humans and may do so again although the human ace2-compatible receptor binding domain was very likely to have been present in a bat sarbecovirus lineage that ultimately lead to sars-cov-2 this rbd sequence has thus far only been found in a few pangolin viruses furthermore the other key feature thought to be instrumental to sars-cov-2s ability to infect humans -a polybasic cleavage site insertion in the spike protein -has been seen in another close bat relative of the sars-cov-2 virus  however the sequence is different and it is likely an independent event the existing diversity and dynamic process of recombination amongst lineages in the bat reservoir demonstrate how difficult it will be to identify viruses with potential to cause significant human outbreaks before they emerge this underscores the need for a global network of real-time human disease surveillance systems like that which identified the unusual cluster of pneumonia in wuhan in december 2019 and the rapid deployment of functional studies and genomic tools for pathogen identification and characterization sarbecovirus data complete genome sequence data were downloaded from genbank and vipir accession numbers available in supplementary section 4 sequences were aligned by maftt katoh et al 2009  with a final alignment length of 30927 and used in the analyses below hcov-oc43 we compiled a data set including 27 human coronavirus oc43 virus genomes and 10 related animal virus genomes 6 bovine 3 white-tailed deer and one canine virus the canine viral genome was excluded from the bayesian phylogenetic analyses because temporal signal analyses see below indicated that it was an outlier mers-cov we extracted a similar number n  35 of genomes from a mers-cov data set analysed by dudas et al 2018 using the phylogenetic diversity analyser tool chernomor et al 2015  sars-cov we compiled a set of 69 sars-cov genomes including 58 genomes sampled from human and 11 sampled from civets and raccoon dogs this data set comprises an updated version of the one used in hon et al 2008  as coronaviruses are known to be highly recombinant we used three different approaches to identify nonrecombinant regions to be used in our bayesian time-calibrated phylogenetic inference first we took an approach that relies on identifying mosaic regions via 3seq that are also supported by phylogenetic incongruence pi signals boni et al 2010  as 3seq is the most powerful the mosaic methods boni et al 2007  we used 3seq to identify the best supported breakpoint history for each potential child recombinant sequence in the data set a single 3seq run on the genome alignment resulted in 67 out of 68 sequences supporting some recombination in the past with multiple candidate breakpoint ranges listed for each putative recombinant then we a collected all breakpoints into a single set b complemented this set to generate a set of non-breakpoints c grouped the non-breakpoints into contiguous breakpoint-free regions bfrs and d sorted these regions by length a phylogenetic tree -using raxml v828 stamatakis 2014 stamatakis  2006  gtr model 100 bootstrap replicates -was inferred for each bfr longer than 500nt we considered both 1 the possibility that bfrs could be combined into larger non-recombinant regions and 2 section 5 region d and shorter bfrs were not further included into a combined putative non-recombinant regions regions a b and c were further examined for mosaic signals by 3seq all showed signs of mosaicism in region a we removed sub-region a1 nt positions 3872-4716 within region a and sub-region a4 nt 1642-2113 as both of these showed pi-signals with other sub-regions of region a after removal of a1 and a4 we named the new region a in addition sequences nc014470 bulgaria 2008 covzxc21 covzc45 and dq412042 hubei-yichang needed to be removed to maintain a clean non-recombinant signal in a region b showed no pi-signals within the region except one including sequence sc2018 sichuan thus this sequence was also removed from the set region c showed no pi-signals within it combining regions a b and c and removing the five mentioned sequences gives us putative nonrecombining region 1 or nrr1 as an alignment of 63 sequences second we wanted to construct non-recombinant regions where our approach to breakpoint identification was as conservative as possible in this approach we considered a breakpoint supported only if it had three types of statistical support from 1 mosaic signals identified by 3seq 2 pi-signals identified by building trees around 3seqs breakpoints 3 the gard algorithm kosakovsky pond et al 2006 which identifies breakpoints by identifying pi-signals across proposed breakpoints since 3seq identified 10 bfrs longer than 500nt we used gards inference on 10 11 and 12 breakpoints a reduced sequence set of 25 sequences chosen to capture the breadth of diversity in the sarbecoviruses obvious recombinants not involving the sars-cov-2 lineage were also excluded was used as gard is computationally intensive gard identified eight breakpoints that were also within 50nt of breakpoints identified by 3seq pi-signals were identified with bootstrap support 80 for seven of these eight breakpoints positions 1684 3046 9237 11885 21753 22773 and 24628  using these breakpoints the longest putative non-recombining segment nt 11885-21753 is 99kb long and we call this region nrr2 because this approach to breakpoint identification is conservative the approach to identifying non-recombinant regions is not conservative our third approach involved identifying breakpoints and masking minor recombinant regions with gaps which are treated as unobserved characters in probabilistic phylogenetic approaches specifically we used a combination of six methods implemented in rdp5 rdp geneconv maxchi bootscan sisscan and 3seq and considered recombination signals detected by more than two methods for breakpoint identification except for specifying that sequences are linear all settings were kept to their defaults based on the identified breakpoints in each genome only the major non-recombinant region is kept in each genome while other regions are masked to evaluate the performance procedure we confirmed that the recombination masking resulted in i a significantly different outcome of the phi-test bruen et al 2006  ii a removal of well-supported bootstrap value 95 incompatible splits in neighbor-nets bryant and moulton 2004  and iii a near-complete reduction of mosaic signal as identified by 3seq if the latter still identified nonnegligible recombination signal we removed additional genomes that were identified as the major contributors to the remaining signal this produced non-recombining alignment nra3 which included 63 of the 68 genomes we focused on these three non-recombining regionsalignments for divergence time estimation this avoids inappropriately modelling evolutionary processes with recombination on strictly bifurcating trees which can result in different artefacts such as homoplasies that inflate branch lengths and result in apparently longer evolutionary divergence times in order to examine temporal signal in the sequenced data we plotted root-totip divergence against sampling time using tempest based on a maximum likelihood tree the latter was reconstructed using iqtree nguyen et al 2014  under a general-time reversible gtr model with a discrete gamma distribution to model among-site rate variation time-measured phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using a bayesian approach implemented in beast suchard et al 2018  when the genomic data included both coding and noncoding regions we used a single gtr substitution model for concatenated coding genes we partitioned the alignment by codon positions and specified an independent gtr model for each partition with a separate gamma model to accommodate among-site rate variation we used an uncorrelated relaxed clock model with a lognormal distribution for all data sets except for the low-diversity sars data for which we specified a strict molecular clock model for the hcov-oc43 mers-cov and sars data sets we specified flexible skygrid coalescent tree priors in the absence of any reasonable prior knowledge on the tmrca of the sarbecovirus data sets which is required for the grid specification in a skygrid model we specified a simpler constant size population prior as informative rate priors for the analysis of the sarbecovirus data sets we used two different normal prior distributions one with a mean of 000078 and a standard deviation of 00003 and one with a mean of 000024 and standard deviation of 00001 these means are based on the mean rates estimated for mers-cov and hcov-oc43 respectively while the standard deviations are set ten times larger than the empirical standard deviations to allow more prior uncertainty and avoid strong bias  supplementary fig 2  in our analyses of the sarbecovirus data sets we incorporated the uncertainty of the sampling dates when exact dates were not available to estimate nonsynonymous over synonymous rate ratios for the concatenated coding genes we used the empirical bayes renaissance counting procedure

coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 jiao-mei huang syed sajid jan xiaobin wei yi 1 wan songying ouyang  the recent global outbreak of viral pneumonia designated as coronavirus disease 2019 by coronavirus sars-cov-2 has threatened global public health and urged to investigate its source whole genome analysis of sars-cov-2 revealed 96 genomic similarity with bat cov ratg13 and clustered together in phylogenetic tree furthermore ratg13 also showed 9743 spike protein similarity with sars-cov-2 suggesting that ratg13 is the closest strain however rbd and key amino acid residues supposed to be crucial for human-to-human and cross-species transmission are homologues between sars-cov-2 and pangolin covs these results from our analysis suggest that sars-cov-2 is a recombinant virus of bat and pangolin covs moreover this study also reports mutations in coding regions of 125 sars-cov-2 genomes signifying its aptitude for evolution in short our findings propose that homologous recombination has been occurred between bat and pangolin covs that triggered cross-species transmission and emergence of sars-cov-2 and during the ongoing outbreak sars-cov-2 is still evolving for its adaptability  the family coronaviridae is comprised of large enveloped single stranded and positivesense rna viruses that can infect a wide range of animals including humans guan et al 2003  the viruses are further classified into four genera alpha beta gamma and delta coronavirus king et al 2012  so far all coronaviruses covs identified in human belong to the genera alpha and beta among them betacovs are of particular importance different novel strains of highly infectious betacovs have been emerged in human populations in the past two decades that have caused severe health concern all over the world severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov was first recognized in 2003 causing a global outbreak zhong 2004 peiris et al 2004 cherry 2004  it was followed by another pandemic event in 2012 by a novel strain of coronavirus designated as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov lu et al 2013  both covs were zoonotic pathogens and evolved in animals bats in the genus rhinolophus are natural reservoir of coronaviruses worldwide and it is presumed that both sars-cov and mers-cov have been transmitted to human through some intermediate mammalian hosts li et al 2005a bolles et al 2011 al-tawfiq and memish 2014  recently emergence of another pandemic termed as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by world health organization who caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has been reported zhu et al 2020  to date more than 174000 people are infected and over 6600 death tolls having transmission clusters worldwide including china italy south korea iran japan usa france spain germany and several other countries causing alarming global health concern the large trimeric spike glycoprotein s located on the surface of covs is crucial for viral infection and pathogenesis which is further subdivided into n-terminal s1 subunit and c-terminal s2 domain the s1 subunit is specialized in recognizing receptors on host cell comprising of two separate domains located at n-and c-terminal which can fold independently and facilitate receptor engagement masters 2006  receptor-binding domains rbds of most covs are located on s1 c-terminus and enable attachment to its host receptor li et al 2005b  the host specificity of virus particle is determined by amino acid sequence of rbd and is usually dissimilar among different covs therefore rbd is a core determinant for tissue tropism and host range of covs this article presents sars-cov-2 phylogenetic trees comparison and analysis of genome spike protein and rbd amino acid sequences of different covs deducing source and etiology of covid-19 and evolutionary relationship among sars-cov-2 in human to determine the evolutionary relationship of the sars-cov-2 phylogenetic analysis was performed on whole genomic sequences of different covs from various hosts the maximum-likelihood ml phylogenetic tree is shown in figure 1  which illustrates four main groups representing four genera of covs alpha beta gamma and delta in the phylogenetic tree strains of sars-cov-2 red colored are cluster together and belong to the genera betacoronavirus among beta-covs sars-cov civet sars cov bat sars-like covs batratg13 cov and sars-covs-2 clustered together forming a discrete clade from mers-covs the clade is further divided into two branches and one of the branches comprises all sars-cov-2 strains clustered together with batyunnanratg13 cov forming a monophyletic group batyunnanratg13 exhibited 96 genomic similarity with sars-cov-2 this specifies that sars-cov-2 is closely related to batyunnanratg13 cov the ml phylogenetic tree demonstrates that covs from bat source are found in the inner joint or neighboring clade of sars-cov-2 this indicates that bats covs particularly batyunnanratg13 are the source of sars-cov-2 and they are emerged and transmitted from bats to humans through some recombination and transformation events in intermediate host to explore the emergence of sars-cov-2 in humans we investigated covs s-protein and its rbd as they are responsible for determining the host range  table 1  the s-protein amino acid sequence identity between sars-cov-2 and related beta-covs showed that batyunnanratg13 shares highest similarity of 9743 however the amino acid sequence identity of rbd of sars-cov-2 with batyunnanratg13 is 8957 on the other hand beta-covs from pangolin sources pangolinguandong12019 and pangolinguangdonglung08 revealed highest rbd amino acid sequence identity of 9668 and 9608 respectively with sars-cov-2 these indication shows the existence of homologous recombination events within the s-protein gene between bat and pangolin covs similarity plot analysis of covs genome sequences from bat pangolin and human also indicated a possible recombination within s-protein of sars-covs-19  figure s1  the amino acid residues change in s-protein of sars-cov-2 was further analyzed with sars-cov pangolin and bat covs including pangolinguandong12019 pangolinguangdonglung08 and batyunnanratg13 figure 2  regardless of low homology between sars-cov-2 wuhan-hu-1mn908947 and sars-cov sarsaar07630 they had many homologues areas in s-protein the five key amino acid residues of s-protein at positions 442472 479480 and 487 of sars-covs are described to be at the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ace2 receptor complex interface and supposed to be crucial for human to human and cross-species transmission li et al 2005b wu et al 2012  figure 2b and table s1 describe that all key amino acid residues of rbd except two positions are completely homologues between sars-cov-2 wuhan-hu-1mn908947 and pangolin covs pangolinguandong12019 and pangolinguangdonglung08 supporting our postulation of recombination event in s-protein gene even though all five crucial amino acid residues of sars-cov-2 for binding to ace2 are different from sars-cov their hydrophobicity and polarity are similar having same s-protein structural confirmation and identical rbd 3-d structure xu et al 2020  in addition six critical key residues in mers-cov rbd binding to its receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 are all different in sars-cov and sars-cov-2 related coronavirus figure 2a  we also investigated some of the important evolutionary and phylogenetic aspects of sars- table 2  among different orfs of sars-cov-2 orf1a was most variable segment with total number of 44 dissimilar amino acid substitutions it was followed by spike segment s orf with 13 amino acid residue substitutions however orf6 and orf7b are the most conserved regions without amino acid changes in addition orf10 e m and orf7a have tended to be more conserved with only one or two amino acid substitutions with the global spread of sars-cov-2 its amino acid sequence is also significantly varied figure 3  usually rna viruses have high rate of genetic mutations which leads to evolution and provide them with increased adaptability lin et al 2019  to further explore sars-cov-2 evolution in human we have performed phylogenetic analysis based on the aforementioned sars-cov-2 in correspondence with their amino acid substitution  one hundred and twenty-five newly sequenced sars-cov-2 complete genomes were obtained from global initiative on sharing all influenza data epiflutm database gisaid epiflu tm  and genbank closely related beta-covs genomes sequences from different hosts were also collected and analyzed together with sars-cov-2 open reading frames orfs of covs genomes were predicted using orffinder v043 with default parameters ignoring nested orfs raw pair-end reads of pangolin dataset sample srr10168377 obtained from ncbi were filtered with bbmapsh v3879 by removing adaptors trimming low quality reads from both sides quality value  20 and reads length less than 50 nt were ignored host reference genome pangolin manjav10 gcf0016851351 contaminant reads were removed by bowtie2 v2351 13  pangolin cov genome fragments were assembled via megahit v129 li et al 2015  the sequences of covs were aligned using multiple sequence alignment mafft v7450 katoh et al 2019  aligned sequences were visualized with jalview v2103 waterhouse et al 2009  poorly aligned regions and gaps were removed by trimal v14rev22 capellagutirrez et al 2009  maximum likelihood ml phylogenetic trees of whole genome sequences were constructed in iq-tree v1612 nguyen et al 2015  support for inferred relationships in the phylogenetic tree was assessed by bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates and the best-fit substitution model was determined by iq-tree model test to be involved in recombination similarity scores between genomic sequences were generated by simplot v351 lole et al 1999  red color highlights interaction positions of sars-cov-2 and pangolin covs with different amino acids residues  interaction of the spike protein rbd from sars-cov-2 with ace2 similarity with sars-cov hot-spot analysis and effect of the receptor polymorphism houcemeddine othman zied bouslama jean-tristan brandenburg jorge da rocha yosr hamdi kais ghedira najet srairi-abid scott hazelhurst  the spread of covid-19 caused by the sars-cov-2 outbreak has been growing since its first identification in december 2019 the publishing of the first sars-cov-2 genome made a valuable source of data to study the details about its phylogeny evolution and interaction with the host protein-protein binding assays have confirmed that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is more likely to be the cell receptor through which the virus invades the host cell in the present work we provide an insight into the interaction of the viral spike receptor binding domain rbd from different coronavirus isolates with host ace2 protein by calculating the  binding energy score between rbd and ace2 we highlighted the putative jump in the affinity from a progenitor form of sars-cov-2 to the current virus responsible for covid-19 outbreak our result was consistent with previously reported phylogenetic analysis and corroborates the opinion that the interface segment of the spike protein rbd might be acquired by sars-cov-2 via a complex evolutionary process rather than a progressive accumulation of mutations we also highlighted the relevance of q493 and p499 amino acid residues of sars-cov-2 rbd for binding to human ace2 and maintaining the stability of the interface moreover we show from the structural analysis that it is unlikely for the interface residues to be the result of genetic engineering finally we studied the impact of eight different variants located at the interaction surface of ace2 on the complex formation with sars-cov-2 rbd we found that none of them is likely to disrupt the interaction with the viral rbd of sars-cov-2 key words covid-19 ace2 viral spike receptor binding domain 1 homology-based protein-protein docking variants the coronavirus sars-cov-2 previously known as ncov -19 has been 4 associated with the recent epidemic of acute respiratory distress syndrome 5 2 recent studies have suggested that the virus binds to the ace2 receptor 6 on the surface of the host cell using spike proteins and explored the binary 7 interaction of these two partners 8 23  in this work we focused our 8 analysis on the interface residues to get insight into four main subjects 1 9 the architecture of the spike protein interface and whether its evolution in 10 many isolates supports an increase in affinity toward the ace2 receptor 11 2 how the affinity of sars-cov-2-rbd and sars-cov-rbd toward 12 different ace2 homologous proteins from different species is dictated by a 13 divergent interface sequences 3  a comparison of the interaction hotspots 14 between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 and finally 4 whether any of the 15 studied ace2 variants may show a different binding property compared to 16 the reference allele to tackle these questions we used multi-scale modelling 17 approaches in combination with sequence and phylogenetic analysis with discrete gamma distribution g with 5 rate categories for the 57 rbd sequences the best substitution model for maximum likelihood ml 58 calculation was selected using a model selection tool implemented on mega 59 6 software based on the lowest bic score therefore the wag model 20 60 using a discrete gamma distribution g with 5 rate categories has been 61 selected phylogenetic trees were generated using a ml method in mega 6 the 63 consistency of the topology for the rbd sequences was assessed using a 64 bootstrap method with 1000 replicates the resulting phylogenetic tree 65 was edited with itol 9 the co-crystal structure of the spike protein of sars-cov complexed 69 to human-civet chimeric receptor ace2 was solved at 3 of resolution 70 pdb code 3scl we used this structure as a template to build the 71 complex of spike protein from different virus isolates with the human ace2 72 protein uniprot sequence q9byf1 the template sequences of the ligand 73 spike protein and the receptor ace2 were aligned locally with the 74 target sequences using the program water from the emboss package 12  75 modeller version 922 14 was then used to predict the complex model of 76 each spike protein with the ace2 using a slow refining protocol for each 77 model we generated ten conformers from which we selected the model with 78 the best dope score 15  to calculate the binding energy scores we used prodigy server 22  80 mm-gbsa method implemented in the hawkdock server 19 and foldx5 81 3  the contribution of each amino acid in protein partners was calculated 82 hawkdock server different 3d structures of human ace2 hace2 83 each comprising one of the identified variants were modeled using the 84 buildmodel module of foldx5 because it is more adapted to predict the 85 effect of punctual variations of amino acids we used dynamut at this stage 86 of analysis 13 87 24 flexibility analysis 88 we ran a protocol to simulate the spike rbd fluctuation of sars-cov-2 89 and sars-cov using the standalone program cabs-flex version 0914 7  90 three replicates of the simulation with different seeds were conducted using 91 a temperature value of 14 dimensionless value related to the physical 92 temperature the protein backbone was kept fully flexible and the number 93 of the monte carlo cycles was set to 100 94 3 results sequence and phylogenetic analysis 96 phylogenetic analysis of the different rbd sequences revealed two well 97 supported clades clade 1 includes rm1 isolate bat-sl-covzc45 and 98 bat-sl-covzxc21 these three isolates are closely related to sars-cov-2 99 as revealed by the phylogenetic tree constructed from the entire genome 100  figure 1a  clade 2 includes sars-cov-2 ratg13 sz16 zs-c wiv16 101 ma15 and sars-cov-sino1-11 isolates  figure 1a  sars-cov-2 and 102 ratg13 sequences are the closest to the common ancestor of this clade 103 the exact tree topology is reproduced when we used only the rbd segment 104 corresponding to the interface residues with hace2 this is a linear 105 sequence spanning from residue n481 to n501 in sars-cov-2 to investigate whether the interface of the spike protein isolate evolves 115 by increasing the affinity toward the ace2 receptor in the final host we 116 predicted the interaction models of the envelope anchored spike protein sp 117 from several clinically relevant coronavirus isolates with hace2 receptor 118 pdb files for the complexes are listed in supplementary materials 1 the 119 construction of the complex applies a comparative-based approach that uses 120 a template structure in which both partners ligand and receptor are closely 121 related to those in the target system respectively in our study we only 122 modeled the interaction of the rbd which was shown to be implicated in the 123 physical interaction with ace2  figure 2a  the lowest sequence identity 124 of the modeled spike proteins as well as those of any of the orthologous 125 ace2 sequences human civet bat pig rat chicken and snake do not fall 126 below 63 toward their respective templates at such values of sequence 127 identities it is expected that the template and the target complexes share 128 the same binding mode 6  we calculated the binding energy scores of the rbd from different virus 132 isolates interacting with hace2  figure 2b  all three methods used 133 for the calculation are in agreement that rbds from bat-sl-covzc45 134 bat-sl-covzxc21 and rm1 show the worst energy scores while the 135 binding energy score falls in the boundary limit of the incertitude margin for 136 prodigy calculation section 2 supplementary material 2 the differences 137 in the scores calculated by foldx and mm-gbsa are not therefore we 138 consider that such differences in energies compared to sars-cov-2 are 139 consistent between the three methods except for foldx the affinity is 140 predicted to be more favorable for rbd from sars-cov-2 compared to 141 sars-cov however mm-gbsa only marginally discriminates between 142 the two values mm-gbsa allowed us to assign the contribution of each amino acid in 162 the interface with hace2 in the binding energy score we conducted this 163 analysis using both sequences of the sars-cov-2 wuhan-hu-1  figure 3a  164 and the sino1-11 sars-cov  figure 3b isolates residues f486 y489 165 q493 g496 t500 and n501 of sars-cov-2 rbd forming the hotspots of 166 the interface with hace2 protein were investigated we only consider values 167  1 or  1 kcalmol to ignore the effect due to the thermal fluctuation 168 all these amino acids form three patches of interaction spread along the 169 linear interface segment  figure 3c  two from the n and c termini and one 170 central t500 establishes two hydrogen bonds using its side and main chains 171 with y41 and n330 of hace2 n501 forms another hydrogen bond with 172 ace2 residue k353 buried within the interface on the other hand sars-173 cov rbd interface contains five residues  figure 3d  l473 y476 y485 174 t487 and t488 corresponding to the equivalent hotspot residues of rbd 175 from sars-cov-2 f487 y490 g497 t501 and n502 therefore q493 as 176 a hotspot amino acid is specific to sars-cov-2 interface the equivalent 177 residue n480 in sars-cov only shows a non-significant contribution of 178 018 kcalmol the similarity matrix analysis was conducted to assess the divergence of 180 the interaction interface of rbds qualitatively ie the specific set of residues 181 implicated in the interaction with ace2 and quantity ie the contribution 182 of each residue in the binding energy score the similarity matrix was 183 calculated from free energy decomposition of interface residues of rbds 184 from sars-cov-2 and sars-cov in complex with ace2 orthologous 185 and reported as a network representation  figure 3e and figure 1 and 186 2 in supplementary materials 2 we noticed the existence of densely 187 interconnected edges involving all the protein-protein complexes for sars-188 cov-2 and sars-cov except those involving ace2 from sus scrofa and 189 rattus norvegicus complexes involving the rbd of sars-cov-2 show less 190 intrinsic similarity compared to rbd of sars-cov however similarity 191 scores tend to be uniform in the group involving ace2 from human civet 192 dog bat snake and chicken the complex including hace2 does not seem 193 to diverge from the rest of the members of the sars-cov-2 group such as 194 the case of sus scrofa and rattus norvegicus 196 sequence analysis and the visual inspection of rbdhace2 complex might 197 reflect the substitution of p499 in sars-cov-2 rbd as a form of adaptation 198 toward a better affinity with the receptor in order to further investigate 199 its role we performed a flexibility analysis using a reference structure 200 sars-cov-2 rbd containing p499 and an in silico mutated form p499t 201 a residue found in sars-cov and most of the clade 2 our results show 202 that the mutation caused a significant decrease in stability for nine residues 203 of the interface corresponding to segment 482-491  figure 3f  indeed the 204 rmsf variability per amino acid for this sequence increases compared to 205 the reference structure a total of eight variants of hace2 that map to the interaction surface 209 are described in the gnomad database  figure 4a  all these variants are 210 rare table 1  and mostly found in european non-finnish and african 211 populations considering both the enthalpy ddg and the vibrational 212 entropy in our calculation dds we found no significant changes  1 or 213  1 kcalmol in neither the folding energy of the complex  figure 4b  nor 214 the interaction energy of the protein-protein partners  figure 4c  since the covid-2019 outbreak several milestone papers have been published 217 to examine the particularity of sars-cov-2 spike protein and its putative 218 interaction with ace2 as a receptor 21  in the current study we focused 219 our analysis on the interface segments of sars-cov-2 spike rbd interacting 220 with ace2 from different species by estimating interaction energy profiles 221 we have studied the effect of eight variants of ace2 in order to detect 222 polymorphisms that may increase or decrease virulence in the host our 223 results showed that if ace2 is the only route for the infection in humans 224 variants interacting physically with rbd are not likely to disrupt the 225 formation of the complex and would have a marginal effect on the affinity 226 therefore it is unlikely that any form of resistance to the virus related to 227 the ace2 gene exists however this analysis merits to be investigated in 228 depth in different ethnic groups for a better assessment of the contribution 229 of genetic variability in host-pathogen interaction the similar values of binding energy scores with different ace2 ortho-231 logues suggest that the ability of binding to different ace2 orthologous is 232 preserved in many species either for sars-cov-2 or sars-cov therefore 233 the transition to the zoonotic form is trivial if that depends only on ace2 234 as the primary route to the infection in both the intermediate and the 235 final host however we know that such a process is very complex since it 236 requires many protein-protein interactions to acquire the specific capacity 237 of infecting and replicating in the host cells 18  consequently it makes 238 sense to assume that many other types of receptors or co-receptors may 239 be critical to determine the capacity of crossing the species barrier this 240 has been already suggested for sars-cov 1 and similarly sars-cov-2 241 may show the same feature moreover our results show that the significant 242 overlap of glycosylation sites with the protein-protein interface implies a 243 likely interaction of sars-cov-2 progenitors with receptors other than 244 ace2 finally recent transcriptomic profiling has suggested the possibility 245 of multiple route infections via the interaction of many human receptors 246 for sars-cov-2 11 whole-genome phylogenetic analysis of the different isolates included in 248 this study is consistent with previous works that place the wuhan-hu-1 249 isolate close to bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 isolates 10 17 250 within the betacoronavirus genus the use of rbd sequences however 251 places the virus in a clade that comprises sars-cov related homologs 252 including isolates from bat and civet the clade swapping as seen in 253 figure 1a  seems also to occur for ratg13 and rm1 isolated from bat this 254 is expected as the use of different phylogenetic markers may considerably 255 affect the topology of the tree however the significant divergence in 256 the interfaces segments as a key molecular element contributing to the 257 determination of the tree topology has driven our work toward studying 258 their impact on the interaction with hace2 the binding of the spike 259 glycoprotein to ace2 receptor requires a certain level of affinity in the 260 case where the rbd evolves from an ancestral form closer to that of bat-sl-261 covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 we expected a decrease of the binding 262 energy scores through the evolution process following incremental changes in 263 the rbd in such a scenario we presume that there are other intermediary 264 forms of coronavirus that describe such variation of the binding energy 265 score to reach a level where the pathogen can infect humans with high 266 affinity toward hace2 on the other hand our results show that the 267 binding energy score and the interface sequence of sars-cov-2 rbd are 268 closer to sars-cov related isolates either from human or other species 269 therefore a recombination event involving the spike protein that might 270 have occurred between sars-cov and an ancestral form of the current 271 sars-cov-2 virus might be also possible this will allow for the virus to 272 acquire a minimum set of residues for the interaction with hace2 the 273 recombination in the spike protein gene has been previously suggested 274 by wei et al in their phylogenetic analysis 4  thereafter incremental 275 changes in the binding interface segment will occur in order to reach a 276 better affinity toward the receptor one of these changes may involve p499 277 residue which substitution to threonine seems to drastically destabilize the 278 interface segment and has a distant effect moreover the decomposition 279 of the interaction energy showed that 5 out of 6 hotspot amino acids in 280 sars-cov-2 have their equivalent in sars-cov including n501 contrary 281 to what wan et al 17 have stated the single mutation n501t does not 282 seem to enhance the affinity rather the residue q493 might be responsible 283 for such higher affinity due to a better satisfaction of the van der waals 284 by the longer polar side chain of asparagine indeed when we made the 285 same analysis while mutating q493 to n493 the favorable contribution 286 decreases from -255 kcalmol to a non significant value of -001 kcalmol 287 thus supporting our claim no major divergence of the interaction interface of sars-cov-2 rbd 289 with hace2 was noticed from the similarity matrix analysis this suggests 290 that the molecular elements required for the binding with the receptor might 291 also be involved in the interaction with other orthologous forms of ace2 292 and that these elements are not optimized specifically for the human form 293 therefore it is unlikely that the interface of rbd from sars-cov-2 is a 294 result of human intervention via genetic engineering aiming to increase the 295 affinity toward ace2 for example residue e484 contributes unfavorably 296 to the binding energy with 224 kcalmol due to an electrostatic repulsion 297 with e75 from hace2 this residue is an apparent choice for engineering 298 a protein-protein complex with high affinity by substituting e484 with a 299 polar residue it is however noteworthy that the lesser homogeneity of the 300 nodes of sars-cov-2 group in comparison to sars-cov may suggest 301 a higher tolerance for the mutation of the new virus which would allow 302 it to cross the species barrier more easily and to efficiently optimize the 303 interaction in the host being understanding about his absence and for not being able to bring him 312 the marshmallow candy because of the covid-19 outbreak   insights into molecular evolution recombination of pandemic

cause of 20 covid-19 disease here we assessed sars-cov2 from the kingdom of saudi arabia alongside 21 sequences of sars-cov bat sars-like covs and mers-cov the latter currently detected in this 22 author summary 44 the emergence and subsequent pandemic of sars-cov-2 is a unique challenge to countries all 45 over the world including saudi arabia where cases of the related mers are still being reported 46 saudi sars-cov-2 sequences were found to be likely of the same or similar origin in our analysis 47 sars-cov-2 were more closely related to bat sars-like covs rather than to mers-cov which 48 originated in saudi arabia or sars-cov confirming other phylogenetic efforts on this pathogen 49 recombination and positive selection analysis further suggest that bat coronaviruses may be at 50 the origin of sars-cov-2 sequences the data shown here give hints on the origin of this virus 51 and may inform efforts on transmissibility host adaptation and other biological aspects of this 52 virus 53 54 157  region phylogenetic analysis natural selection investigation and genome recombination analysis 23 were performed our analysis showed that all saudi sars-cov-2 sequences are of the same origin 24 and closer proximity to bat sars-like covs followed by sars-covs however quite distant to 25 mers-cov moreover genome recombination analysis revealed two recombination events 26 between sars-cov-2 and bat sars-like covs this was further assessed by s gene recombination 27 analysis these recombination events may be relevant to the emergence of this novel virus 28 moreover positive selection pressure was detected between sars-cov-2 bat sl-cov isolates 29 and human sars-cov isolates however the highest positive selection occurred between sars- 30 cov-2 isolates and 2 bat-sl-cov isolates bat-sl-rsshc014 and bat-sl-covzc45 this further 31 indicates that sars-cov-2 isolates were adaptively evolved from bat sars-like isolates and that 32 a virus with originating from bats triggered this pandemic this study thuds sheds further light on 33 the origin of this virus 16 17  structurally s is composed of two functional subunits essential for 79 binding to the host cell receptor s1 subunit and virus-host cell fusion s2 subunit 18  the s1 breakpoints existed in a single sequence the sequence region between the breakpoints was 130 denoted the minor region triggered by the minor parent while the remaining part is called the 131 major region provoked by the major parent as a consequence neighbor-joining phylogenetic 132 trees were generated to display the probable topological shifts of specific sequences 133 phylogenetic discrepancy is revealed by a putative recombinant whose distance in the phylogeny 134 is obviously close to a single parent whilst far from another for each sequence segment 27  since both recombination events appeared in the s gene region sequences of s genes of the 13 234 covs were extracted for multiple alignment using clustalw followed by finding the best 235 substitution model to be implemented in the phylogenetic analysis gtr and tn93 models were 236 the best fitting owing to achieving the least bic of 5128985 and 5132549 respectively 237 consequently the phylogenetic tree was constructed using tn93 model and although it was 238 constructed using the nj method fig 4  and the obtained tree was consistent with the tree next a molecular clock analysis was carried out using the ml method to examine if the s gene of 294 the 13 isolates used in the current study have the same evolutionary rate throughout the tree it 295 was found that the strains are not evolving at similar rate indicated by rejection of the null 296 hypothesis of equal evolutionary rate throughout the tree at a 5 significance level p  297 0000e000

 prameet sheth m  affiliations  the emergence and global spread of sars-cov-2 has had profound social and economic consequences and has shed light on the importance of continued and additional investment in global health and infectious disease surveillance identifying changes in viral genomes provides key insights into viral diversity how viruses spread within populations and viral strategies for evasion of host immune systems here we report twenty-five sars-cov-2 genome sequences collected from some of the first covid-19 cases in eastern ontario canada march 18-30 2020 the reported genomes belong to the s-clade n2 and g-clade n23 of sars-cov-2 and contain 45 polymorphic sites including one shared missense and three unique synonymous variants in the gene encoding the spike protein a phylogenetic analysis enabled the tracing of viral origin and potential transmission into and within canada there may be as many as sixteen unique infection events represented in these samples including at least three that were likely introduced from europe and seven from the usa in addition four separate genomes are each shared by multiple patients suggesting a common origin or community spread even during this early stage of infection these results demonstrate how molecular epidemiology and evolutionary phylogenetics can help local health units track origins and vectors of spread for emerging diseases like sars-cov-2 earlier detection and screening in this way could improve the effectiveness of regional public health interventions to prevent future pandemics  the past two decades have seen the emergence of three novel betacoronaviruses that have been associated with outbreaks in the human population including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in 2002 1  middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov in 2012 2  and sars-cov-2 in 2019 3 4  all three coronaviruses appear to have originated from bats and likely were transmitted to humans by zoonotic transmission possibly through an intermediate vertebrate vector 5 6  corona virus disease -2019 covid-19 is the infectious disease caused by the sars-cov-2 the first confirmed case dates to december 8 2019 in a patient from wuhan city in the hubei province of china 7  the virus quickly spread through wuhan and neighbouring parts of hubei province despite rapid and aggressive public health interventions 8  the following months led to global spread of the virus and was officially classified as a pandemic by the who on march 11 2020  the spread of sars-cov-2 has had devastating consequence to human health with over 912 million documented cases and 473797 deaths as of june 24 2020 including 101637 confirmed cases and 8436 deaths in canada who situation report number 156 sars-cov-2 is a spherical enveloped particle positive-sense single stranded rna genome that is 299 kb in length 3 9  genome organization of sars-cov-2 has the characteristic gene order 5replicase orf1ab spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n-3 6  coronavirus s proteins bind the host receptor enabling viral entry to the cell and have demonstrated the highest sequence variability in the viral genome 10  the s protein in both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 interact with the hosts angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 11  however the spike protein in sars-cov-2 has 10-to 20-fold higher binding affinity than sars-cov 12  the complete sars-cov-2 genome was published on jan 12 2020 from a patient in wuhan china 3  the collaborative effort of many labs around the world have now published the genomes of many sars-cov-2 genomes including 53992 in gisaid wwwgisaidorg 24438 in ncbi wwwncbinlmnihgov and 7989 in vipr wwwviprbrcorg as of june 24 2020 allelic differences with biased geographic distribution have been observed between three major sars-cov-2 clades likely the consequence of founder effects 13  superclade i a superset of vclade defined in gisaid epicov portal 14   has limited variability with respect to the reference genome and has been described in the majority of isolates in asia 13  superclade ii s-clade has two characteristic variants at c3037t and t28144c 13 and includes most viral isolates from the usa especially the west coast 13 15  superclade iii g-clade has four characteristic variants at c241t c3037t c14408t and a23403g 13  and includes most viral isolates from europe and many on the east coast of the usa 13 15  the a23403g mutation results in a d614g substitution in the s protein which may result in increased fitness as this viral strain is rapidly and repeatedly replacing other forms of the virus around the globe 16  this mutation is also embedded in an immunological epitope which elicited antibody production in patients during the 2003 sars-cov epidemic 17  and may mediate antibody escape making individuals susceptible to a second infection of covid-19 16  databases containing tens of thousands of sars-cov-2 genomes provide an unprecedented opportunity to reconstruct the establishment and spread of the virus in specific locales we demonstrate the ability to trace the origin and community spread of sars-cov-2 using sequence data from twenty-five viral genomes isolated from some of first cases of covid-19 in the eastern region of the province of ontario canada this knowledge may improve the effectiveness of public health interventions to prevent future pandemics sample collection nasopharyngeal np swabs were collected in viral transport media from symptomatic patients being tested for sars-cov-2 at kingston health sciences center khsc and the surrounding hospitals extraction of total rna from viral transport media was performed using the maxwell rsc whole blood rnadna kit promega corporation madison wi on the maxwell rsc 16 automated nucleic acid extractor each sample was tested for the presence of sars-cov-2 using a laboratory developed multiplex real-time pcr assay targeting the envelope e and rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp genes 18 on the viia7 real-time pcr system sars-cov-2 genome sequencing the extracted nucleic acids from covid-19 positive cases were anonymized and shared with queens genomics lab at ongwanada q-glo rna from each sample 5 l was reverse transcribed to complimentary dna using the superscript vilo cdna synthesis kit on a simpliamp thermal cycler libraries were

consensus sequence and covid19annotatesnpeff to annotate variants vcf files generated by torrent suite variant caller were filtered to remove eleven variants with read depth less than 1000 and quality score less than 400 filtered variants were used for sample clustering with the maximum likelihood tree 19 in molecular evolutionary genetics analysis mega software 20 21  phylogenetic analysis a data analysis pipeline using molecular phylogenetics was developed to reconstruct infection origins and spread utilizing two main assumptions first identical sequences are identical by descentthat is the same variants are unlikely to have evolved independently second new mutations accrue at an average rate of 1 base pair bp every 7 to 21 days this is based on an average of 24225 bp substitutions per year in the nextstrain analysis 22 of the gisaid 1423 database briefly the viral genome sequenced from each patient was used as the query sequence in a blast 24 search against a local reference containing 25132 sars cov-2 genomes from the gisaid database accessed may 15 2020 only highly similar sequences with no more than two mismatches were retained from the database reducing the number of reference genomes from 25132 to 1251 many references were identical genomes isolated in separate individuals which were collapsed to 72 unique reference sequences a reference sequence from wuhan wuhan-hu12019 was added to root the phylogenetic tree fifty-nine of these 72 reference sequences shared the same common ancestor but differed by one or two substitutions or otherwise formed derived groups that were not informative to reconstructing the ancestry of the sample genomes these extraneous tips were removed leaving only the patient-derived genomes and 13 unique and informative ancestral sequences phylogenies were built using the ape v53 package in r using the maximum likelihood approach implemented in the optimpml function with 100 bootstrap iterations the ggtree v201 and ggplot2 v321 packages in r were used to generate tree visualizations sample demographics including age and biological sex are shown in table 1  at time of analysis thirty-two sars-cov-2 samples from local cases of covid-19 were made available however seven samples did not pass quality control insufficient viral load or low sequencing coverage and were excluded from further analysis for the remaining twenty-five samples an average of 13 million mapped reads per sample was generated with an average of 8175 mean read depth and 9606 uniform coverage supplementary table 1  twenty-one samples have 100 coverage of the genome and four samples have greater than 994 coverage samples 19 and 21 had the lowest uniformity in coverage which resulted in several gaps in the consensus sequence so these two sequences were removed from phylogenetic analysis most viral genomes contained between six to eight variants when compared with the nc0455122 reference genome with greater number of variants reported in sample 41 10 variants and sample 36 12 variants the most common nucleotide substitution is from cysteine to thymine 2545 variants followed by guanine to thymine 745 variants and adenine to guanine 445 all the shared variants are homozygous variants except for heterozygous snp in the orf1ab gene of samples 11 and 30 c9994a we see an additional four heterozygous variants in three samples that are unique to that sample supplementary table 2  finally we observe one shared missense variant g25217t and three unique synonymous variants c24382t t24982c c25357t in the gene encoding the s protein clustering of the 25 viral sequences within the maximum likelihood tree fig 1a is driven by variants that are shared between samples  fig 1b and branch length is driven by unique variants carried by each sample supplementary table 2  the samples formed two large clades including two samples that carry two mutations that correspond to the s-clade c8782t and t28144c and twenty-three samples that carry four mutations reported in the g-clade c241t c3037t c14408t and a23403g within the g-clade we see smaller clusters that correspond to cluster 2 samples 17 18 24 25 26 37 38 39 and 42 cluster 5 samples 1 10 and 12 and cluster 9 samples 2 4 11 16 29 30 34 35 36 and 41 reported by korber et al 16  phylogenetic analysis using local patient sars-cov-2 genomes were matched with blast to reference sequences published in the gisaid database this resulted in 13 ancestral genomes relevant to retracing the origins and spread of local covid-19 cases fig 2  sample 23 belongs to the s-clade of sars-cov-2 and is derived from the ancestral genome shared by reference 1 samples sharing this genome are almost exclusively from north america and predominately from the usa supplementary table 3  samples 1 10 and 12 belong to the gclade cluster 1 this clade contains ancestral reference genomes 16 39 46 68 69 and 70 reported all over the world but over-represented in europe especially the uk and spain reported travel history supports european origin in these three samples  table 2  the other nineteen samples in the g-clade cluster 2 are derived from several ancestral sequences 3 14 53 57 67 72 which are predominantly from north american usa patients reported travel history supports an american origin of infection for patients 34 and 41 who reported visiting the usa before being diagnosed with the virus  table 2  within the g-clade 2 samples we observed four clusters of two or more samples with the same viral genome indicating a common source of infection fig 2 table 2  we analyzed twenty-five sars-cov-2 genomes from cases of covid-19 within the eastern region of the province of ontario canada these samples included most of the first cases in the region and therefore infection was assumed to have occurred during international travel or while in proximity to an individual who had recently travelled genome variation among these samples has important implications for the pathology and epidemiology of this disease as discussed below a major concern with novel viruses is mutation rates and how novel mutations will affect virulence vaccine development and reinfection 15 16 17 25 26  of primary significance are mutations in the s protein because the spike protein defines viral host range and is often the target of neutralizing antibodies 27 28  this project identified three novel unique mutations in the coding region of the s protein however all three are predicted to be synonymous and likely will not affect viral virulence or epitopes a fourth polymorphic site at c25217t occurs in four samples 2 4 34  and 16 is a missense variant resulting in a glycine to cysteine substitution at the 1219 th residue of the s protein in silico modeling or functional validation studies may describe the impact of this mutation on the function of the transmembrane domain this project identified five heterozygous variants c360t c9729a g10818t g17325t c18136t four of these heterozygous variants were unique to one sample and had alternate allele frequencies ranging from 25-39 suggesting an emerging viral mutation that occurred since infection of the host however one heterozygous variant c9729a was shared between two samples samples 11 and 30 and had an alternate allele frequency of 058 and 059 indicating that these two individuals likely have superinfection of two sars-cov-2 strains 29  clustering of shared mutations identified two samples 21 and 23 that belong to the sclade of virus and characterized by two polymorphic sites at c8782t and c28144t 13  the presence of three additional polymorphic sites at c17747t a17858g and c18060t exclusively present in north america 26 support a north american origin for these two samples furthermore phylogenetic analysis identified potential ancestral samples for sample 23 that were predominately isolated in the usa the other twenty-three samples share four shared polymorphic sites at c3037t c14408t a23404g and a23403g and belong to the g-clade of viruses 13  within the g-clade we observe two distinct clusters g-clade 1 which appears european in origin and g-clade 2 which appears to originate in the usa reported travel history supports our phylogenetics analysis for european origin for the g-clade 1 as sample 1 reported recent travel to portugal sample 10 travelled to ireland and sample 12 to spain similarly reported travel history supports north american origin for the g-clade 2 as sample 34 reported recent travel to florida usa and sample 41 reported recent travel to arizona usa these correlations between phylogenetic origin and reported travel history indicates how viral genome sequencing can successfully trace the origin of sars-cov-2 infections into canada interestingly we observed several clusters of samples that shared the same viral sequence indicating that these samples either had a shared source of infection or a result of community transfer chart review demonstrated that samples 24 25 and 26 did not travel outside of canada they are contacts of each other and share the same sars-cov-2 strain demonstrating community transfer in eastern ontario was likely even during the early stages of infection similarly samples 17 38 39 and 42 all share the same viral strain but the connection between these individuals is unknown identification of the common thread among these patients or other clusters of cases could help to identify major sourcespathways of infection infection in sample 34 is likely attributed to their travel to the usa table 2  however samples 4 and 34 share the same viral strain and sample 4 tested positive for covid-19 five days earlier than sample 34 a connection between sample 4 and 34 is unknown as are the travel details of sample 34 but these observations raise the possibility that infection in sample 34 may not be related to their travel to the usa these results demonstrate how sample clustering and phylogenetic analysis based on viral genome sequencing may assist and prioritize case and contact tracing to further monitor and contain the spread of the virus there were several limitations in using genomics to trace viral origin and path of transmission of sars-cov-2 first in the early stages of the pandemic most countries were only screening and testing international travelers who displayed symptoms this allowed asymptomatic carriers to go undetected masking potential sources of infection as a result gaps exist in the databases reporting sars-cov-2 genomes masking the true sources of infection however the rapid publication of genome sequences from around the world can help to offset this limitation by identifying geographical clusters and specific genomic variants that are shared across regions the relatively high mutation rate helps to distinguish primary and secondary infections in the span of one to two weeks a second limitation is a lack of detailed travel and interaction histories for patients due to differences in reporting and data collection among collection sites and agencies rigorous adherence to standardized data collection protocols like whos guidance for contact tracing in the context of covid-19 coupled with genomics data as described here may facilitate effective contact tracing that is required to break the chains of viral transmission a final limitation is that sequencing sars-cov-2 in covid-19 cases with low viral load was problematic due to lack of rna input for library construction as seen by the number of excluded samples and those with low coverage uniformity samples 19 and 21 however this will become less limiting over time as high-throughput sequencing devices continue to improve in sensitivity and throughput in summary this is the first description of sars-cov-2 genomes in covid-19 positive cases in eastern ontario these are many of the first detected cases in eastern ontario and infection was believed to be foreign in origin and the result of international travel or proximity to an individual who had travelled this analysis illustrates that many of the infections originated from our geographical neighbour the usa but other sources of infection include several countries in europe we also observed community transfer in cases that did not travel out of the country these results demonstrate how molecular epidemiology and evolutionary phylogenetics can help local health units to track origins and vectors of spread for emerging diseases like sars-cov-2 earlier detection and screening and alternative modes for contact tracing may improve the effectiveness of regional public health interventions to prevent future pandemics table 2  summary of viral origin of first covid-19 cases into the eastern

phylodynamic phylogeography phylogenetic clusters lockdown measures first reported in early december 2019 in the province of hubei china covid-19 coronavirus disease 2019 is caused by a new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 that has since rapidly spread around the world 1 2  causing an enormous public health and social-economic impact 3 4  since the early days of the pandemic there has been an important mobilisation of the scientific community to understand its epidemiology and help providing a real-time response to this end research teams around the world have massively sequenced and publicly released dozens of thousands of viral genome sequences to study the origin of the virus 5 6  and to trace its spread at global country or community-level scales 7 8 9  in this context a platform like nexstrain 10  already widely used and recognised by the academic community and beyond has quickly become a reference to follow the travel history of sars-cov-2 lineages in the context of the covid-19 pandemic the volume of genomic data available presents a unique opportunity to gain valuable real-time insights into the dispersal dynamics of the virus yet the number of available viral genomes is increasing every day leading to substantial computational challenges while bayesian phylogeographic inference represents the gold standard for inferring the dispersal history of viral lineages 11  these methods are computationally intensive and will fail to provide useful results in an acceptable amount of time to tackle this practical limitation we here describe and apply an analytical pipeline that is a compromise between fast and rigorous analytical steps in practice we propose to take advantage of the rapid time-scaled phylogenetic tree inference process used by the online nextstrain platform 10  specifically we aim to use the resulting time-scaled tree as a fixed empirical tree along which we infer the ancestral locations with the discrete 12 and spatially-explicit 13 phylogeographic models implemented in the software package beast 110 14  in belgium there are two main different laboratories from the university of leuven and the university of lige involved in sequencing sars-cov-2 genomes extracted from confirmed covid-19 positive patients to date some genomes n58 have also been sequenced at the university of ghent but for which metadata about the geographic origin are unavailable as of june 10 2020 a total of 740 genomes have been sequenced by these research teams and deposited on the gisaid global initiative on sharing all influenza data 15  database in the present study we exploit this comprehensive data set to unravel the dispersal history and dynamics of sars-cov-2 viral lineages in belgium in particular our objective is to investigate the evolution of the circulation dynamics through time and assess the impact of lockdown measures on spatial transmission specifically we aim to use phylogeographic approaches to look at the belgian epidemic at two different levels i the importance of introduction events into the country and ii viral lineages circulating at the nationwide level on june 10 2020 we downloaded all belgian sars-cov-2 sequences n740 available on gisaid as well as non-belgian sequences 4309 originated from 126 different countries and used in nextstrain to represent the overall dispersal history of the virus we generated a time-scaled phylogenetic tree using a rapid maximum likelihood approach 16 and subsequently ran a preliminary discrete phylogeographic analysis along this tree to identify internal nodes and descending clades that likely correspond to distinct introductions into the belgian territory  fig 1 s2  we inferred a minimum number of 331 introduction events 95 hpd interval  315-344 when compared to the number of sequences sampled in belgium n740 this number illustrates the relative importance of external introductions in establishing transmission chains in the country introduction events resulted in distinct clades or clusters linking varying numbers of sampled sequences fig 1  however many clusters only consisted of one sampled sequence according to the time-scaled phylogenetic tree and discrete phylogeographic reconstruction fig s1  some of these introduction events could have occurred before the return of a cluster is here defined as a phylogenetic clade likely corresponding to a distinct introduction into the study area belgium we delineated these clusters by performing a simplistic discrete phylogeographic reconstruction along the time-scaled phylogenetic tree while only considering two potential ancestral locations belgium and non-belgium we identified a minimum number of 331 lineage introductions 95 hpd interval  315-344 which gives the relative importance of external introductions considering the number of sequences currently sampled in belgium 740 on the tree lineages circulating in belgium are highlighted in green and green nodes correspond to the most ancestral node of each belgian cluster see also figure s1 for a non-circular visualisation of the same tree besides the tree we also report the distribution of cluster sizes number of sampled sequences in each cluster as well as the number of sequences sampled through time belgian residents from carnival holidays around march 1 2020 which was considered as the major entry point of transmission chains in belgium to analyse the circulation dynamics of viral lineages within the country we then performed spatially-explicit phylogeographic inference along the previously identified belgian clades  fig 2a  our reconstructions reveal the occurrence of long-distance dispersal events both before fig 2b  and during fig 2c  the lockdown by placing phylogenetic branches in a geographical context spatially-explicit phylogeographic inference allows treating those branches as conditionally independent movement vectors 17  here we looked at these movement vectors to assess how the dispersal dynamics of lineages was impacted by the national lockdown of which the main measures were implemented on march 18 2020 firstly we investigated if the lockdown was associated with a change in lineage dispersal velocity we estimated a substantially higher dispersal velocity before the lockdown 54 kmday 95 hpd 50-61 compared to during the lockdown 24 kmday 95 hpd 23-25 this trend is further confirmed when focusing on the province of lige for which we have a particularly dense sampling in that province we estimated a lineage dispersal velocity of 28 kmday 95 hpd 22-36 before the lockdown and of 11 kmday 95 hpd 10-12 during the lockdown however the evolution of the dispersal velocity through time is less straightforward to interpret fig 3  while the lineage dispersal velocity was globally higher at the early phase of the belgian epidemic which corresponds to the week following the returns from carnival holidays it then seemed to drop just before the beginning of the lockdown before increasing again to reach a plateau in the second half of april our estimates indicate that the lineage dispersal velocity drops again however this result may be an artefact associated with the notably lower number of phylogenetic branches currently inferred during that period fig 3  secondly we further investigated the impact of the lockdown on the dispersal events among provinces our analyses indicate that amongprovinces dispersal events tended to decrease during the epidemic fig 3  such dispersal events were more frequent at the beginning of the epidemic and then progressively decreased until reaching a plateau at the beginning of the lockdown again the relatively limited number of phylogenetic branches currently inferred from mid-april does not really allow to interpret the fluctuations of the proportion of among-provinces dispersal events during that period our preliminary phylogeographic investigation reveals the important contribution of external introduction events for the establishment of the sars-cov-2 epidemic in belgium this highlights that transmission chains circulating in belgium were not established by a relatively restricted number of isolated infectious cases eg people returning from skiing holidays in northern italy on the contrary we identify a large number of distinct clades given the number of analysed sequences sampled in belgium this overall observation is in line with our spatially-explicit phylogeographic analyses uncover the spatiotemporal distribution of belgian sars-cov-2 clusters indicating a relatively low impact of the lockdown on both the dispersal velocity of viral lineages and on the frequency of long-distance dispersal events this contrasts with preliminary results suggesting a lower lineage dispersal velocity during the lockdown period results not shown however these previous results were based on a substantially lower number of sequences sampled during the lockdown period our latest results highlight that while the national lockdown had an overall impact on the virus transmission ie reducing its reproductive number to a value below one 19  it does not necessarily decrease the velocity at which the virus can travel or its ability to disperse over long distances this finding might be important to consider in the context of potential upcoming lockdowns especially if more localised while the country now enters a phase of progressive easing of lockdown measures it will be informative to keep monitoring lineage dispersal across the country increased dispersal velocity or more frequent long-distance dispersal events could point to an uptick in virus circulation applying the present phylodynamic pipeline in a real-time perspective does not come without risk as new sequences can sometimes be associated with spurious nucleotide changes that could be associated with sequencing or assembling errors directly starting from inference results kept up to date by a database like gisaid allows for fast analytical processing but also relies on newly deposited data that could sometimes carry potential errors to remedy such potentially challenging situations our proposed pipeline could be extended with a sequence data resource component that makes uses of expert knowledge regarding a particular virus the glue 20 software package allows new sequences to be systematically checked for potential issues and could hence be an efficient tool to safely work with frequently updated sars-cov-2 sequencing data such a cov-glue resource is currently being developed httpcov-gluecvrglaacukhome while we acknowledge that a fully integrated analysis ie an analysis where the phylogenetic tree and ancestral locations are jointly inferred would be preferable fixing an empirical time-scaled tree represents a good compromise to rapidly gain insights into the dispersal history and dynamics of sars-cov-2 lineages indeed the number of genomes available as well as the number of different sampling locations to consider in the analysis would lead to a joint analysis requiring weeks of run-time in a bayesian phylogenetic software package like beast to illustrate the computational demands of such approach we ran a classic bayesian phylogenetic analysis on a smaller sars-cov-2 data set 2795 genomic sequences using beast 110 data not shown this analysis required over 150 hours to obtain enough samples from the joint posterior while using the latest gpu accelerated implementations 21 on 15 parallel runs with a combined chain length of over 22x10 9 states and an average runtime of 09 hours per million states the significant computational demands required make this approach impractical when speed is critical on the other hand we here use a maximum likelihood method implemented in the program treetime 16 to infer a time-scaled phylogenetic tree in a short amount of time 3 hours for the data set analysed here given the present urgent situation we have deliberately assumed a time-scaled maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree as a fair estimate of the true time-scaled phylogenetic tree our analytical workflow has the potential to be rapidly applied to study the dispersal history and dynamics of sars-cov-2 lineages in other restricted or even much broader study areas we believe that spatially-explicit reconstruction can be a valuable tool for highlighting specific patterns related to the circulation of the virus or assessing the impact of intervention measures while new viral genomes are sequenced and released daily a limitation could paradoxically arise from the non-accessibility of associated metadata indeed without sufficiently precise data about the geographic origin of each genome it is not feasible to perform a spatially-explicit phylogeographic inference in the same way that viral genomes are deposited in databases like gisaid metadata should also be made available to enable comprehensive epidemiological investigations with a similar approach as we presented here inference of a time-scaled phylogenetic tree to infer our time-scaled phylogenetic tree we selected all non-belgian sequences in the nextstrain analysis along with all available belgian sequences in gisaid to be included in our analysis as of june 10 th  2020 once we knew which were the accessions of interest we downloaded the latest whole genome alignment from gisaid and removed all non-relevant sequences we then cleaned the alignment by manually trimming the 5 and 3 untranslated regions refseq nc0455122 and gap-only sites to obtain a maximum-likelihood phylogeny we ran iq-tree 203 22 under a general time reversible 23 gtr model of nucleotide substitution with empirical base frequencies and four free rate 24 site categories this model configuration was selected as the best gtr model using iq-trees modelfinder tool the tree was then inspected for outlier sequences using tempest 25 153 and once the outliers were removed time-calibrated using treetime 07420 to replicate the nextstrain workflow as closely as possible we specified a clock rate of 8x10 -4 in treetime and removed samples that deviate more than four interquartile ranges from the root-to-tip regression preliminary discrete phylogeographic analysis we performed a preliminary phylogeographic analysis using the discrete diffusion model 12 implemented in the software package beast 110 14  the objective of this first analysis was to identify independent introduction events of sars-cov-2 lineages into belgium to this end we used our time-scaled phylogenetic tree as a fixed empirical tree and only considered two possible ancestral locations belgium and non-belgium bayesian inference through markov chain monte carlo mcmc was run on this empirical tree for 10 6 generations and sampled every 1000 generations mcmc convergence and mixing properties were inspected using the program tracer 17 26 to ensure that effective sample size ess values associated with estimated parameters were all 200 after having discarded 10 of sampled trees as burn-in a maximum clade credibility mcc tree was obtained using treeannotator 110 14  we used the resulting mcc tree to delineate belgian clusters here defined as phylogenetic clades corresponding to independent introduction events in belgium continuous and post hoc phylogeographic analyses we used the continuous diffusion model 13 available in beast 110 14 to perform a spatially-explicit or continuous phylogeographic reconstruction of the dispersal history of sars-cov-2 lineages in belgium we employed a relaxed random walk rrw diffusion model to generate a posterior distribution of trees whose internal nodes are associated with geographic coordinates 13  specifically we used a cauchy distribution to model the among-branch heterogeneity in diffusion velocity we performed a distinct continuous phylogeographic reconstruction for each belgian clade identified by the initial discrete phylogeographic inference again fixing a time-scaled subtree as an empirical tree as phylogeographic inference under the continuous diffusion model does not allow identical sampling coordinates assigned to the tips of the tree we avoided assigning sampling coordinates using the centroid point of each administrative area of origin for a given sampled sequence we instead retrieved geographic coordinates from a point randomly sampled within its municipality of origin which is the maximal level of spatial precision in available metadata this approach avoids using the common jitter option that adds a restricted amount of noise to duplicated sampling coordinates using such a jitter could be problematic because it can move sampling coordinates to administrative areas neighbouring their actual administrative area of origin 27  furthermore the administrative areas considered here are municipalities and are rather small there are currently 581 municipalities in belgium the clade-specific continuous phylogeographic reconstructions were only based on belgian tip nodes for which the municipality of origin was known ie 639 out of 740 genomic sequences furthermore we only performed a continuous phylogeographic inference for belgian clades linking a minimum of three tip nodes with a known sampling location municipality each markov chain was run for 10 6 generations and sampled every 1000 generations as with the discrete phylogeographic inference mcmc convergencemixing properties were assessed with tracer and mcc trees one per clade were obtained with treeannotator after discarding 10 of sampled trees as burn-in we then used functions available in the r package seraphim 28 29 to extract spatiotemporal information embedded within the same 1000 posterior trees and visualise the continuous phylogeographic reconstructions we also used seraphim to estimate the following weighted lineage dispersal velocity and we verified the robustness of our estimates through a subsampling procedure consisting of re-computing the weighted dispersal velocity after having randomly discarded 25 of branches in each of the 1000 posterior trees the weighted lineage dispersal velocity is defined as follows where d i and t i are the geographic distance travelled great-circle distance in km and the time elapsed in days on each phylogeny branch respectively  phylogenetic analysis of sars-cov-2 genomes in turkey ogn adebal aylin brcan defne rc burak lek zeynep kilin berkay seluk berk turhan   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 has emerged in wuhan li et al 2020 spread across continents and eventually resulted in the covid-19 pandemic although there are significant differences between the current and previously known sars-cov genomes the reason behind its pandemic behaviour is still unclear genome sequences around the world were revealed and deposited into public databases such as gisaid shu and mccauley 2017 with those genomic datasets it is possible in fact crucial to reveal the evolutionary events of sars-cov-2 to understand the types of the circulating genomes as well as in which parts of the genome differ across these types the sars-cov-2 virus is homologous to sars-cov and its closer versions were characterized in bats and pangolins li et al 2020 the virus has been under a strong purifying selection li et al 2020 with the isolates obtained so far the sequences of sars-cov-2 genomes showed more than 999 percent identity indicating a recent shift to the human species tang et al 2020 yet there are unambiguous evolutionary clusters in the genome pool various studies use snp tang et al 2020 or entropy zhao et al 2020 based methods to identify evolving virus types to reveal genomic regions responsible for transmission and evolution tang et al identified s and l types among 103 sars-cov-2 genomes based on 2 snps at orf1ab and orf8 regions which encode replicasetranscriptase and atf6 respectively tang et al 2020 the entropy-based approach generated informative subtype markers from 17 informative positions to cluster evolving virus genomes zhao et al 2020 another study defined a competitive subtype based on the d614g mutation in the spike protein which facilitates binding to ace2 to receptor on the host cell surface bhattacharyya et al 2020 although whether there is any effect of d614g substitution on the transmissibility is inconclusive van dorp et al 2020 this mutation has been 1 of the landmarks for major groupings of the virus family  in this work we used publicly available sars-cov-2 genome datasets we aligned the sequences of more than 15000 whole genomes and built a phylogenetic tree with the maximum likelihood method we clustered the genomes based on their clade distribution in the phylogenetic tree identified their genomic characteristics and linked them with the previous studies we further analysed clusters mutations and transmission patterns of the genomes from turkey the entire sars-cov-2 genome sequences along with their metadata were retrieved from the gisaid database table s1 shu and mccauley 2017 we retrieved the initial batch of genomes 3228 from gisaid on 02042020 we used augur toolkit to align whole genome sequences using mafft algorithm --reorder --anysymbolnomemsave katoh and standley 2016 the sars-cov2 isolate wuhan-hu-1 genome genbank nc0455122 was used as a reference genome to trim the sequence and remove insertions in the genomes since the initial batch the new sequences in gisaid were periodically added to the preexisting multiple sequence alignment --existing-alignment the final multiple sequence alignment msa contained 15501 genomes that were available on may 1st 2020 in the metadata file some genomes lacked month and day information and contained the year of the sample collection date the genomes with incomplete metadata were filtered out and the filtered msa consisted of 15277 sequences maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was built with iq-tree with the following options -nt auto on a 112-core server -m gtr -fast augur was used to estimate the molecular clock through timetree sagulenko et al 2018 for the sample epi-isl-428718 we additionally built a separate maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree by using iq-tree multicore version 161 with ultra-fast bootstrapping option and 1000 bootstraps the subtree consisting of turkey isolates table 1 were retrieved from the master time-resolved tree by removing the rest of the genomes with the pruning method from ete3 toolkit huerta-cepas et al 2016 the tree was visualized in figtree v144 u1d3c and rerooted by selecting epiisl428718 as an outgroup the branch lengths of epi-isl-417413 and epi-isl-428713 samples were shortened for better visualization ggtree yu et al 2017 package in r was used to generate the tree and corresponding clusters we generated phylo-clusters with treecluster balaban et al 2019 which is specifically designed to group viral genomes the tool supports different clustering options and we used the default option max clade which identifies clusters based on 2 parameters -t and -s these parameters define the threshold that two leaf nodes can be distant from each other and assign a minimum support value that connects the two leaf nodes or clades respectively for this analysis we only used the distance threshold the max clade algorithm requires leaves to form a clade and satisfy the distance threshold the number of clusters that can be generated using a phylogenetic tree depends on the pair wise leaf distance cutoff we manually searched for a meaningful cutoff for the number of phylo-clusters and phylo-subgroups based on their similarity with the previously reported clusters see below we used the -t parameter as 00084 and 000463 for phylo-clusters and phylo-subclusters respectively after retrieving the groupings from treecluster we eliminated clusters containing less than 100 sequences except a subcluster with 99 sequences we categorized those clusters having less than 100 sequences as not clustered as a result we obtained 4 primary clusters and seventeen subclusters ls types of the sars-cov-2 genomes were previously defined based on the nucleotides at 8782nd and 28144th positions tang et al 2020  we categorized tc and ct haplotypes s and l type respectively in the cases both these positions correspond to a gap the sequences as well as all other cases were classified as unknown 614 gd clustering was applied based on the amino acid at the 614th position of the spike protein jaimes et al 2020 combinations of the nucleotides at positions 241 1059 3037 8782 11083 14408 14805 17747 17858 18060 23403 25563 26144 28144 28881 28882 28883 determined the subtypes for barcode clustering sequences that belong to the 10 major subtypes with more than 100 sequences which constitute 86 percent of all sequences were labelled with their respective 17 nucleotides zhao et al 2020 all other sequences were categorized as unknown for barcode classification six major clusters morais jnior et al 2020 were assigned by the previously determined 12 positions 3037 8782 11083 14408 17747 17858 18060 23403 28144 28881 28882 28883 the lineages were assigned using the proposed nomenclature by rambaut et al through pangolin covid-19 lineage assigner web server rambaut et al 2020 sequences that cannot be assigned to any group were categorized as unknown for each classification scheme we rooted the maximum-likelihood tree for distance calculations by selecting samples that belong to bats and pangolin as an outgroup namely epi-isl-412976 epi-isl-412977 and epi-isl-412860 we measured the distance from leaf to root for every leaf node that is present in the phylogenetic tree with the ete3 toolkit huerta-cepas et al 2016 mutations for each position relative to the reference genome genbank nc0455122 were catalogued in a table with a custom script a table of all the mutations of selected sequences was created and ordered according to the phylogenetic tree of the corresponding genomes table s2 mutations that do not correspond to a nucleotide such as a gap or n were labeled as gap or n the other mutations were marked as nongap for variations that do not correspond to gap or n respective nucleotides in the reference genome were obtained and added to the table the gff file of the reference genome gcf0098588952 was extracted from ncbi genome database open reading frame orf information of each mutation was retrieved from the gff file and added to the table positions that are not in the range of any orf were labelled as noncoding region codon information and position of each mutation in the reference genome were retrieved according to their respective orf start positions and frame in this process reported frameshifts in orf1ab dos ramos et al 2004 kelly and dinman 2020 and the overlap between orf7a 3 and 7b 5 ends were taken into account coding information was used to assign amino acid substitution information to the variations eventually the variants were categorized as nonsynonymous synonymous and noncoding regions the maximum-likelihood phylodynamic analysis was performed with treetime sagulenko et al 2018 to estimate likely times of whole-genome sequences of sars-cov-2 by computing confidence intervals of node dates and reconstruct phylogenetic tree into the time-resolved tree the slope of the root-to-tip regression was set to 00008 to avoid inaccurate inferences of substitution rates with this model we eliminated the variation of rapid changes in clock rates by integration along branches standard deviation of the fixed clock rate estimate was set to 00004 the coalescent likelihood was performed with the skyline strimmer and pybus 2001model to optimize branch lengths and dates of ancestral nodes and infer the evolutionary history of population size the marginal maximum likelihood assignment was used to assign internal nodes to their most likely dates clock rates were filtered by removing tips that deviate more than four interquartile ranges from the root-to-tip versus time regression jc69 model was used as general time-reversible gtr substitution models to calculate transition probability matrix actual substitution rate matrix and equilibrium frequencies of given attributes of sequences the distribution of subleading migration states and entropies were recorded for each location through augur trait module sampling bias correction was set to 25 closest child-parent pairs that do not go beyond their given locations were identified and evaluated as transmissions using auspice hadfield et al 2018 the first covid-19 case in turkey was reported on march 10th 2020 later than the reported earliest incidents in asian and european countries since then the number of cases increased dramatically we used all the genomes available in the gisaid database as of may 1st 2020 and built a phylogenetic tree after we filtered out the samples with incomplete date or location information the total number of samples we eventually used was 15277 the phylogenetic tree was built with the maximum likelihood method and a time-resolved tree was generated figure 1 to verify the accuracy of the phylogenetic tree as well as to assess the distribution of well-characterized genomic features we mapped several classification schemes on the tree i sl type tang et al 2020 ii d614g type bhattacharyya et al 2020 iii barcodes zhao et al 2020 iv six major clusters morais jnior et al 2020 although the methodologies of the clustering attempts were different between these studies in general the previously established groups were in line with our phylogenetic tree besides the already established clustering methods we classified the clades based on the phylogenetic tree only there are 2 levels of clustering we termed phylo-clusters and phylo-subclusters small clusters were not taken into account see methods the phylogenetic map of the virus genomes clearly shows the 2 major s and l type clades as the ancestral clade s-type is seen as limited in the number of genomes twenty-nine of the 30 isolates in turkey were classified in the l-type group the samples from turkey are dispersed throughout the phylogenetic tree figure 1 the 30 samples are classified in 3 out of 4 different phylo-clusters and one remained unclassified the dispersed groups suggested multiple independent introductions to the country seven of the 30 genomes encode aspartic acid d at the 614th position of the spike protein the remaining 23 genomes encode glycine g in the same position the d614g mutation is hypothesized to dominate because it enables smoother transmission of the virus bhattacharyya et al 2020 however this correlation might simply be a founder effect which is basically the loss or gain of genetic information when large population arises from a single individual one of the genomes isolated in turkey epi-isl-428718 clustered together with the early subtypes of the virus this isolate contains t at the position 8782 which is a characteristic of the s-type however it has t at the position 28144 which coincides with the l-type therefore we characterized this sample as neither s- nor l-type in the phylogenetic tree this genome is placed between s and l strains which suggests a transitioning genome from s to l strain figure 2 the number of variant nucleotides between this sample and root is lower relative to other turkey samples phylogenetic placement in the earliest cluster which is closer to the root suggests that the lineage of epi-isl-428718 entered turkey as one of the earliest genomes by the time this sample was isolated in turkey the l-strain had started to spread in europe primarily in italy although the isolation date of this early sample is one week later than the first reported case the existence of an ancestral genome sequence suggests an earlier introduction of sars-cov-2 to turkey turkey has genome samples from at least 3 of the 4 major clusters by taking the transitioning genome into account samples of turkey are genuinely scattered in the phylogenetic tree based on the groupings applied we analyzed the relative abundances of the clusters in turkey and other countries figure 3a the most samples of turkey belong to cluster 4 iran denmark and france are also enriched in cluster 4 most european countries are enriched in cluster 3 although turkey has cluster 3 genomes the fraction of them is lower compared to european countries with the available genome sequences the overallcluster profile of turkey does not resemble any country the divergence of the samples from to tree root was calculated for each subcluster the subclusters observed in turkey were analyzed along with the other countries figure 3b the divergence rates are comparable in general however within the same subclusters 4 and 8 virus genomes collected in turkey have averagely more diverged than their relatives in other countries the isolated genomes assigned to subcluster 4 and 8 show higher divergence rates in turkey compared to the others in the same cluster p-values 000001 and 0006 respectively one-tailed t-test between turkey and the rest  we used the turkey isolates 30 to analyze their mutational patterns and their corresponding clusters from the master tree we pruned all the leaves except for the samples of interest we rooted the subtree at the transitioning sample we aligned the assigned clusters and all the mutations relative to the reference genome figure 4 illustrating a correlation between the mutation pattern and the phylogenetic tree clades observation of no recurrence of a mutationshows that the multiple mutations are the results of founder effects in total 55 unique mutations were detected 2 and 20 of which are noncoding and synonymous respectively thirty-three unique amino acid substitutions were detected table 2 twenty-three out of 30 genomes we analyzed have the 614g mutation the d614g mutation seems to have mutated with the 2 synonymous mutations in orf1ab figure 4 besides 614g 3 more amino acid substitutions were identified in the spike protein table 2 g206a t951i g227s s911f a1420v a3995f in orf1a and v772i t1238i in spike protein v66l in orf5 and s54l in orf8 were found to be specific to some isolates in turkey table 2 the most abundant amino acid substitutions 2330 are p314l orf1b and d614g spike which are dispersed worldwide and not specifically enriched in turkey orf1a v378i and orf9 s194l are found in 7 and 6 of the 30 isolates respectively and show high frequency 15 folds with respect to general in turkey the mutational landscape represents the natural classifications of major groupings and subclusters these mutational footprints can be used to identify the clusters of the future genomes the combinations of mutations can be used as barcodes to group upcoming virus genomes efficiently without a need for establishing evolutionary associations across lineages which is a computationally expensive procedure considering the accumulating genomic data  the number of mutations since december 2019 indicates that the sars-cov-2 genome mutates twice a month on average genome sequencing reveals mutations and enables a better understanding of the epidemiology by revealing the patterns of virus transmission the time-resolved phylogenetic distributions of the genomes collected in turkey suggested multiple independent sources of introduction figure 5a out of the 30 genomes analyzed in this work the earliest introduction seems to have originated from china other international imports include the us australia and europe probably from the uk there is a connection between saudi arabia and the 2 cities in turkey based on the model this association is reciprocal the europe-based introductions are observed with the genomes isolated in stanbul within turkey a transmission hub appears to be ankara figure 5b the isolates in 5 cities are associated with genomes collected in ankara figure 5c we have published a web application powered by auspice sarscov2adebalilaborglatest we employed the front-end package auspice that nextstrain uses hadfield et al 2018 with increasing number of virus strains not far from now it will be infeasible to display the entire phylogenetic tree even in modern browsers nextstrain handles this problem by grouping the datasets based on the continents as the aim of this platform is to trace the spread of virus genomes associated with turkey we will use representatives in the phylogenetic tree the representative sequences will cover all the subtypes the genomes of the samples collected in turkey and their neighboring sequences will be kept in the tree with this approach the web application will always contain the genome data from turkey and necessary information of the subtypes with the representative sequences an additional dimension we added to the application is that it enables to trace virus across the cities of turkey this approach is applicable to create a comprehensive platform for migration analysis for any country or region of choice there are 2 most abundant lineages of isolates in turkey subclusters 4 and 8 if the 30 samples unbiasedly represent the overall distribution of the strains in turkey subclusters 4 and 8 might comprise approximately 80 of the genomes in the country the high divergence of the samples in these subclusters in turkey relative to their equivalents in other countries figure 3b possibly suggests either or both of the 2 scenarios i the viruses dominantly circulating in turkey were introduced to the country later than other countries or ii this subcluster has been circulating in turkey at a relatively higher rate than other countries and because of that it is more likely to select the more diverged isolates by random sampling much more genomes should be sequenced and analyzed to gain more insight into virus evolution it is essential to continuously follow up on the upcoming mutations when new samples are added to gisaid database  the phylogenetic analysis of the circulating genomes in a country is necessary to identify the specific groups and their unique mutational patterns the success of the covid-19 diagnosis test kits antibody tests and protein-targeting drugs possibly depend on genomic variations for antibody tests if a mutation affects protein recognition the sensitivity of the test might drastically reduce therefore mutation profiles of the isolates abundantly circulating in the country should be taken into account to modify these tests as international travels are limited viral genome profiles of the countries differ from each other which is known as bottleneck effect if international transmissions are kept being restricted distinct cluster profiles might establish therefore each country might need to develop their specific tests targeting the abundant genomes circulating in local we must note that sample distribution is not in line with the case distribution across turkish cities due to this sampling bias as well as the low number of genomes the spread history is undoubtedly incomplete for instance only 3 of the 30 samples were collected in stanbul which hosts approximately 60 of the covid-19 cases it is highly probable that stanbul will be revealed as the central hub when additional genomes are sequenced moreover there was no sample from zmir 3rd largest city it should also be noted that the lack of a sufficient number of genomes could have resulted in indirect associations between the cities more genomes are needed to complement this study with confidence the spread of the virus is traced by the personal declarations and travel history of the infected people as sars-cov-2 genomes spread they leave foot prints behind mutations allowing us to trace them it is feasible to complement the conventional approach with genome sequencing in an unbiased way implemented feature of city-based tracing of the virus should be useful for authorities to take necessary measures to prevent spread this approach will be automated with a standard pipeline we aim to eliminate the technical limitations because of the size

full-length sars-cov sequences evidence for phylogenetic discordance in three genomic regions g magiorkinis e magiorkinis d paraskevis a vandamme m m van ranst v moulton a hatzakis   the recent epidemic outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome known as sars was first reported in the guangdong province of china late in 2002 and since then several thousand cases have been reported worldwide mainly in hong kong vietnam and canada ksiazek et al 2003 poutanen et al 2003  analysis of the full-length genomic sequence of the causative agent of sars marra et al 2003 rota et al 2003 established that this agent was a unique coronavirus sars-cov that displayed no obvious similarity to any other members of the coronavirus genus coronaviruses order nidovirales family coronaviridae genus coronavirus have the longest genome 27000-31000 nucleotides amongst all rna viruses they comprise a highly divergent group of rna-viruses that cause a variety of respiratory and enteric diseases in humans and many animal hosts previously available sequences of coronaviruses have been classified according to phylogenetic analysis into three main groups marra et al 2003 rota et al 2003  the newly identified sequence of the sars-cov was not found to cluster within any existing coronavirus group thus suggesting the existence of an additional lineage fourth group within the coronavirus genus poutanen et al 2003 rota et al 2003  the origin of the sars-cov still remains unclear although data from hong kong researchers indicate that the sars-cov virus is almost identical to viruses infecting civet cats  genetic recombination has been detected between different murine coronaviruses fu and baric 1992  thus to determine whether recombination has occurred between sars-cov and any members of the three main coronaviruses groups an in-depth analysis was undertaken of the evolutionary relationships between the sars-cov genome and representative sequences from all members of the coronaviruses genus available currently amino acid sequence alignments were obtained using the clustal w program v 181 thompson et al 1994 and subsequently edited manually for the major gene products orf1ab spike m and n proteins to exclude ambiguous parts of the alignment more specifically x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 and e genomic regions were excluded since a reliable alignment could not be obtained for

previously paraskevis et al 2003  using the wag model whelan and goldman 2001 as implemented in the mrbayes program huelsenbeck and ronquist 2001  in particular within a sliding window of a specified length bayesian inference was carried out to determine the support of every clade within a given phylogenetic tree and these support values were plotted along the alignment as described previously paraskevis et al 2003  marginal posterior probabilities between sars-cov and sequences of coronaviruses groups i-iii were plotted throughout the concatenated alignment posterior probabilities were estimated for a sliding window of 120 amino acids moving in steps of 20 amino acids metropolis coupled markov chains monte carlo mcmcmc analysis was run for 50000 generations sampling every 100 steps and burn-in was set to 5000 steps mcmcmc had been checked previously so as to confirm that it had reached equilibrium up to this number of generations in different parts of the alignment thus suggesting that 5000 generations could be used as a fixed burnin throughout the alignment phylogenetic trees were then constructed for every piece of the alignment with evidence of phylogenetic discordance using the maximum likelihood ml and bayesian inference with wag whelan and goldman 2001 and mv muller and vingron 2000 substitution models which have been constructed by distantly related amino acid sequences and a g-distributed rates heterogeneity among sites as implemented in the tree-puzzle parallel version 50 schmidt et al 2002 and mrbayes respectively a likelihood mapping analysis was also carried out as implemented in the tree-puzzle program to investigate the levels of phylogenetic signal in each separate region examined exploratory phylogenetic analyses in the spike m and n genomic regions including additional partially available coronavirus sequences revealed that fulllength strains are representative and can be used for the exploration of phylogenetic analysis within the coronaviridae family along the full-genome bayesian scanning and subsequent phylogenetic analysis revealed that the sars-cov sequence was related more closely to group ii than the other two groups in most of its genome eg at the region spanning amino acid positions 4309-5612 in reference to the murine hepatitis virus orf1ab gene fig 1  this clustering was supported by high quartet puzzling support values and high posterior probabilities under various substitution models thus suggesting that 80 of the sars-cov genomic sequence is related more closely to coronaviruses group ii than any other members of this family likelihood mapping results revealed that all these regions contained enough phylogenetic information data not shown intriguingly clustering of the sars-cov within group ii coronaviruses was not supported significantly in regions spanning amino acid positions 3937-4309 920-1240 5612-5734 2480-2600 6159-6284 3000-3120 positions in reference to the murine hepatitis virus orf1ab are indicated with their respective positions in reference to the alignment in the parentheses fig 2  in all cases sars-cov was more closely related to group i whereas group iigroup iii-sars-covgroup i nodes were separated by very small distances likelihood mapping in the above regions revealed that they contain sufficient phylogenetic signal thus according to the results of phylogenetic analysis it is suggested that sars-cov provides a separate lineage in these three genomic regions fig 2  moreover in region spanning amino acid positions 4373-4540 1300-1440 bayesian inference suggested a significant cluster between group iii and sars-cov whereas this finding was not supported by the ml method however according to likelihood mapping analysis the phylogenetic signal is very limited in this region thus we cannot reliably infer the evolutionary relationships in this region similarly in a small fragment at the 5 0 of m gene amino acid positions 15-104 4540-4620 with reference to the m protein of the murine hepatitis virus showed a similar topology to the previous fragment whereas given the discrepancy between bayesian and ml methods it cannot be deduced that sars-cov is related more closely to group iii according to the bayesian full-genomic scanning and phylogenetic analyses based on the ml and bayesian methods evidence is provided that the sars-cov for the largest part of the genome is related more closely to group ii than to any other member of the coronaviruses sequences the clustering between sars-cov and group ii is close to the root and probably reflects the evolutionary relationship between the parental sequences from which sars-cov originated and group ii moreover it was found that in three distinct genomic regions aa positions 3937-4309 5612-5734 6159-6284 sars-cov shows no apparent similarity with any of the coronavirus groups characterized previously these findings provide a new insight in addition to previous studies where sars-cov using the neighbor joining method for phylogenetic tree reconstruction was found not to be related significantly to any of the three coronavirus groups or was separated by a short internal branch from group i and iii  moreover three recent analyses indicated that sars cov was related more closely to group ii in partial genomic regions rest and mindell 2003 snijder et al 2003  on the other hand several analyses have noted that though sars cov is close to group ii it has a recombinant origin rest and mindell 2003 stavrinides and guttman 2004  but these analyses were based only on partial genomic regions and did not include an exploratory analysis using a sliding window approach rest and mindell 2003 stavrinides and guttman 2004  evidence is provided that even though sars-cov in the majority of its genomic regions is closer related to coronavirus group ii phylogenetic discordance in three partial genomic regions suggests a distinct clustering with respect to group ii this could be a result of ancient recombination events altered adaptive evolution in different lineages or a combination of both we do not want to speculate which of these explanations is correct since it is not easy to discriminate with certainty between these two factors  discovery and genetic analysis of novel coronaviruses in least horseshoe bats in southwestern china lihua wang shihong fu yuxi cao hailin zhang yun feng weihong yang kai nie xuejun ma guodong liang   the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars that emerged in china in 20022003 is one of the most significant public health events leading to a global epidemic in the twenty-first century1 sars caused more than 8000 human cases with 774 deaths1 2 3 sars coronavirus sars-cov is the etiologic agent of sars4 5 6 since then several outbreaks including avian influenza ebola and middle east respiratory syndrome have emerged from animal populations causing considerable disease and mortality7 investigations regarding the direct progenitor and natural reservoirs of sars-covs have demonstrated that bats are the natural reservoir for several viruses that are closely related genetically to sars-cov known as bat sars-like covs8 9 bat sars-like covs are thought to be the precursors of sars-cov however their genomes are not identical to those of sars-cov10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 the main differences between bat sars-like covs and sars-covs are found in the third non-structural protein nsp3 spike protein s open reading frame orf-3 and orf-8 regions which exhibit the lowest nucleotide nt and amino-acid aa identities among different parts of the genome8 10 19 particularly in the receptor-binding domain rbd of s protein which is responsible for human infection via binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 bat sars-like covs share only low sequence identity and contain a 19-aa deletion compared with sars-covs19 20 21 these differences indicate that the known bat sars-like covs are not the immediate progenitors of sars-covs21 22 recently two bat sars-like covs rs3367 and lyra11 from chinese horseshoe bats family rhinolophidae were shown to be more closely related to sars-cov than any previously identified bat sars-like cov moreover these covs contain rbds similar to that in the sars-cov s protein for binding to ace2 suggesting that they can cause direct human infection without an intermediate host23 24 however it remains unknown whether bat sars-like covs that are even closer to sars-cov exist identification of the immediate progenitors of sars-covs and their bat hosts will not only shed light on the animal source of sars-covs but might also have implications in the formulation of strategies to prevent the re-emergence of sars-like covs in human here we report the genetic and evolutionary characteristics of covs identified from least horseshoe bats collected in yunnan province china in addition the whole-genome sequence of one

species in the genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus were included in the alignment phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were performed by the maximum likelihood method using the mega v6 software with the neighbor-joining algorithm and a bootstrap value of 1000 to detect possible recombination between sars-covs and sars-like covs the full-length genomic

the recombination detection program rdp version 4 with maxchi and chimera methods using 06 and 005 fractions of variable sites per window respectively25 26 the potential recombination events suggested by rdp were investigated further by similarity plot and bootscan analyses using the simplot v351 software26 27 28 maximum likelihood trees of genomic regions generated by breakpoints were constructed to investigate the phylogenetic origin of parental regions the full genome of f46 and amplicon sequences generated in this study were deposited in genbank under accession numbers ku973686 to ku973692 the accession numbers of other sequences from genbank used in this study are indicated in the tables and figure legends we collected ten rhinolophus luctus ten r affinis and ten r pusillus at tengchong ten r affinis ten r pusillus and ten myotis daubentonii at mangshi and six fruit bats at wanding a total of 66 urine and fecal specimens from the bats representing various local bat species table 1 were collected using plastic sheeting laid in the bat cages in the morning seven fecal specimens collected from r pusillus at tengchong and mangshi were identified with positive bands using nested rt-pcr and were sequenced the 405-nt partial rna-dependent rdrp gene sequences corresponding to nt 15 23415 638 of the genome of bat strain rp32004 dq071615 were aligned with those derived from representatives of the three established cov genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus phylogenetic analysis revealed that seven sequences derived from least horseshoe bats were distributed in different clades of the phylogenetic tree f23 is grouped in one clade of sars-covs and separated from other sars-like covs sl-covs f46 is grouped in one clade with strain rs3367 and rsshc014 which were more closely related to sars-covs than to other sl-covs f21 f22 and f29 are clustered with other sl-covs f41 was grouped with the alphacoronaviruses -covs f24 was located in an independent branch this finding demonstrates great phylogenetic diversity and the viruses were distributed in relatively separated branches figure 1 rt-pcr-positive virus isolated from fecal samples was used to inoculate bhk-21 and tb1lu cell lines no obvious viral cytopathic effect was observed after four continuous passages identification of virus isolates was accomplished by rna extraction and rt-pcr amplification after three freezethaw cycles in one to four generations of inoculated bhk-21 and tb1lu cells pcr amplification of sample f46 was positive after the first generation of virus propagation in both cell types but negative in the second through fourth generations after inoculation indicating that f46 did not propagate well in generations 24 of successive cell passages pcr amplification of other samples in the first through fourth generations of inoculation showed no positive results suggesting that isolation of potential viruses in these samples failed at the inoculation step in these two cell lines pcr sequence analysis of the first generation revealed identical sequences with that of the original f46 strain f46 rna was extracted from the cell supernatant after one passage in tb1lu cells whole-genome sequencing was performed using the ion torrent pgm next generation sequencer life technologies south san francisco ca usa and 16-fold coverage was generated according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer a total of 754 mb of data with 397 895 reads 168249 bp was obtained the clc genomics workbench was used for sequencing data analysis assembly resulted in 450 contigs with lengths from 192 to 3500 bp following blast and mapping analyses we obtained 145 viral reads 2003217 bp related to covs de novo assembly of these sequence reads generated the complete sequences of f46 and no regions had notably lower coverage the full length of the f46 genome is 29 699 nt excluding the poly a tail with a gc content of 412 its genome organization and coding potential appear similar to sars-cov sz3 with the exception of orf 4 which is absent from f46 but present in sz3 table 2 the full genome of f46 shared 917 to 918 nt identity with those of sars-covs f46 orfs were compared with human sars-cov tor2 civet sars-cov sz3 and five bat sars-like covs lyra11 rs3367 rf1 cp and rp3 table 2 and the results indicate that f46 is closely related to sars-covs phylogenetic analysis based on the whole genome of f46 and representatives of three established coronavirus genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus including the humancivet and bat sars-like covs demonstrated that f46 clusters with bat sars-like covs figure 2b the location of f46 in the phylogenetic tree is between lyra11 and rs3367 but they are distributed in relatively separate clades f46 likely represents an intermediate between lyra11 and rs3367 in the evolutionary pathway further verification of this finding is presented below in the recombination analysis the spike s proteins of covs are responsible for receptor-binding and host species adaptation and their genes constitute one of the most variable regions within cov genomes similar to counterparts in other sars-covs or sars-like covs the s gene of f46 exhibited wide variation sharing 763765 aa identity with sars-covs and 765835 aa identity with bat sars-like covs table 2 spike protein is post-translationally cleaved into s1 and s2 subunits the s1 domain of sars-cov s protein mediates virus binding with ace2 the functional receptor for sars-cov on susceptible cells the rbd of s1 mediates receptor binding of the virus to host cells and determines the host spectrum29 30 rbd aa sequence comparisons among f46 humancivet viruses and bat sars-like covs revealed that f46 shares 761 to 765 identity with humancivet sars-covs and 765 to 835 identity with bat sars-like covs the s2 domain of f46 exhibited less diversity between f46 and other bat sars-like covs or sars-covs s2 domain of f46 shares 945 to 950 aa identity with humancivet sars-covs and 937 to 983 aa identity with bat sars-like covs f46 has three aa deletions 432436 aa 457460 aa and 464472 aa compared with humancivet covs and bat sars-like covs lyra11 and rs3367 of the five key aa residues 442 472 479 487 and 491 involved in human ace2 receptor recognition and enhancement of receptor binding three mutations y442s n479s and t487v were observed in f46 compared with sars-covs figures 2a and 331 32 covs commonly undergo rna recombination between strains at high frequency to understand the evolutionary origin and identify the recombination events of f46 we conducted a recombination analysis using rdp and available genome sequences of humancivet and bat sars-like covs four breakpoints were detected in the f46 genome with strong p-values 1030 supported by similarity plot and bootscan analyses figures 4b and 4c the breakpoints generated recombination of fragment a covering 18 and 848 nts a total of 8 and 848 nt including the 5-utr and partial orf 1a and fragment b covering 21 684 to 23 271 nt a total of 1587 nt including a partial orf of the spike gene both similarity plots and bootscan analyses revealed that f46 was highly phylogenetically related to sl-cov lyra11 in the first 9000 nt of the genome downstream of the first 9000 nt of the genome f46 shared similar sequence similarity to sars-cov bj01 and sl-cov rs3367 phylogenetic analysis using the major and minor parental regions showed that f46 is grouped in the sl-covs and close to sl-cov lyra11figures 4d and 4e these results indicate that f46 could be a new recombinant virus from sars-like covs or sars-covs sars and middle east respiratory syndrome-cov are two novel covs discovered in recent years that cause considerable disease and mortality1 2 5 33 34 the origin of the viruses and the extent of their involvement in both human and animal populations remain hot topics33 34 35 36 37 it is believed that middle east respiratory syndrome-cov like many other covs originated in bats33 34 this hypothesis proved to be true with sars based on several studies35 36 37 38 recent metagenomics studies have identified sequences of closely related sars-like viruses circulating in chinese bat populations that may pose a future threat references in 2005 two independent studies identified sars-like covs from bats20 33 since then additional sars-like covs in various bat species have been reported24 25 among them horseshoe bats rhinolophus are the main reservoir to harbor genetically diverse sars-like covs10 11 13 15 17 19 20 23 24 25 several of these sars-like covs such as rs3367 and lyra1 appear to be most closely related to sars-covs and the gap-filling viruses between bat sars-like covs and human sars-covs23 24 in this study several covs belonging to the groups of sars-like covs and -covs were detected in samples from least horseshoe bats r pusillus samples from other bat species r luctus r affinis m daubentonii and fruit bat were negative for these viruses further confirming that the least horseshoe bat is a prominent natural reservoir or mixer of genetically diverse alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus species and plays a pivotal role in the evolution and dissemination of these viruses although we failed to isolate infectious virus from the collected samples we obtained the complete genome sequence of f46 from the tb1lu cell line culture after one passage the s protein rbd of f46 possesses identifying features typical of those belonging to bat sars-like covs namely three deletions and mutations within the key residues required for binding ace2 figures 2a and 331 32 predicting from these features f46 should be incapable of infecting humans directly phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that f46 is placed in one clade with strain rs3367 and rsshc014 which were more closely related to sars-covs than to other sl-covs figure 1 and particularly between lyra11 and rs3367 figure 2 f46 likely represents an intermediate between lyra11 and rs3367 to understand the evolutionary pathway of f46 we conducted recombination analysis using available genome sequences of humancivet and bat sars-like covs a total of four breakpoints were detected in the f46 genome with strong p-values 1030 the results showed that f46 is a recombinant from rs3367 lyra11 and bj01 lineages in conclusion horseshoe bats carry genetically diverse sars-like covs owing to the high likelihood of recombination among bat covs additional bat sars-like covs are likely to be identified in the future to better predict and prevent the next emergence of disease caused by covs of bat origin it is necessary to maintain long-term surveillance of bat covs  interaction of the spike protein rbd from sars-cov-2 with ace2 similarity with sars-cov hot-spot analysis and effect of the receptor polymorphism houcemeddine othman zied bouslama jean-tristan brandenburg jorge da rocha yosr hamdi kais ghedira najet srairi-abid scott hazelhurst   the coronavirus sars-cov-2 previously known as ncov-19 has been associated with the recent epidemic of acute respiratory distress syndrome 2 recent studies have suggested that the virus binds to the ace2 receptor on the surface of the host cell using spike proteins and explored the binary interaction of these two partners 823 in this work we focused our analysis on the interface residues to get insight into four main subjects 1 the architecture of the spike protein interface and whether its evolution in many isolates supports an increase in affinity toward the ace2 receptor 2 how the affinity of sars-cov-2-rbd and sars-cov-rbd toward different ace2 homologous proteins from different species is dictated by a divergent interface sequences 3 a comparison of the interaction hotspots between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 and finally 4 whether any of the studied ace2 variants may show a different binding property compared to the reference allele to tackle these questions we used multi-scale modelling approaches in combination with sequence and phylogenetic analysis full genome sequences of 10 coronaviruses isolates were retrieved from ncbi genbank corresponding to the following accession numbers ay4852771 sars coronavirus sino1-11 fj8829571 sars coronavirus ma15 mg7729331 bat sars-like coronavirus isolate

rattus norvegicus were also computed and retrieved human variants of the ace2 gene were collected from the gnomad database only variants that map to the protein coding region and belonging to the interface of interaction with the rbd of the spike protein were retained for further analyses mafft 7450 was used to align the whole genome sequences and the protein sequences of viral rbds 5 supplementary materials 1 prediction of the n-glycosylation sites was made for all studied ace2 sequences using netnglyc server httpswwwcbsdtudkservicesnetnglyc for the genome comparison we selected the best site model based on lowest bayesian information criterion bic calculated using model selection tool implemented in mega 6 software 16 the general time reversible gtr model was chosen as the best fitting model for nucleotide substitution with discrete gamma distribution g with 5 rate categories for the rbd sequences the best substitution model for maximum likelihood ml calculation was selected using a model selection tool implemented on mega 6 software based on the lowest bic score therefore the wag model 20 using a discrete gamma distribution g with 5 rate categories has been selected phylogenetic trees were generated using a ml method in mega 6 the consistency of the topology for the rbd sequences was assessed using a bootstrap method with 1000 replicates the resulting phylogenetic tree was edited with itol 9 the co-crystal structure of the spike protein of sars-cov complexed to human-civet chimeric receptor ace2 was solved at 3 of resolution pdb code 3scl we used this structure as a template to build the complex of spike protein from different virus isolates with the human ace2 protein uniprot sequence q9byf1 the template sequences of the ligand spike protein and the receptor ace2 were aligned locally with the target sequences using the program water from the emboss package 12 modeller version 922 14 was then used to predict the complex model of each spike protein with the ace2 using a slow refining protocol for each model we generated ten conformers from which we selected the model with the best dope score 15 to calculate the binding energy scores we used prodigy server 22 mm-gbsa method implemented in the hawkdock server 19 and foldx5 3 the contribution of each amino acid in protein partners was calculated hawkdock server different 3d structures of human ace2 hace2 each comprising one of the identified variants were modeled using the buildmodel module of foldx5 because it is more adapted to predict the effect of punctual variations of amino acids we used dynamut at this stage of analysis 13 we ran a protocol to simulate the spike rbd fluctuation of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov using the standalone program cabs-flex version 0914 7 three replicates of the simulation with different seeds were conducted using a temperature value of 14 dimensionless value related to the physical temperature the protein backbone was kept fully flexible and the number of the monte carlo cycles was set to 100 phylogenetic analysis of the different rbd sequences revealed two well supported clades clade 1 includes rm1 isolate bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 these three isolates are closely related to sars-cov-2 as revealed by the phylogenetic tree constructed from the entire genome fig 1
a clade 2 includes sars-cov-2 ratg13 sz16 zs-c wiv16 ma15 and sars-cov-sino1-11 isolates fig 1a sars-cov-2 and ratg13 sequences are the closest to the common ancestor of this clade the exact tree topology is reproduced when we used only the rbd segment corresponding to the interface residues with hace2 this is a linear sequence spanning from residue n481 to n501 in sars-cov-2 multiple sequence alignment showed that the interface segment of sars-cov-2 shares higher similarity to sequences from clade 2 fig 1b however we noticed that s494 q498 and p499 are exclusively similar to their equivalent amino acids in sequences from clade 1 sars-cov-2 interface sequence is closely related to ratg13 sequence isolated from rhinolophus affinis bat to investigate whether the interface of the spike protein isolate evolves by increasing the affinity toward the ace2 receptor in the final host we predicted the interaction models of the envelope anchored spike protein sp from several clinically relevant coronavirus isolates with hace2 receptor pdb files for the complexes are listed in supplementary materials 1 the construction of the complex applies a comparative-based approach that uses a template structure in which both partners ligand and receptor are closely related to those in the target system respectively in our study we only modeled the interaction of the rbd which was shown to be implicated in the physical interaction with ace2 fig 2
a the lowest sequence identity of the modeled spike proteins as well as those of any of the orthologous ace2 sequences human civet bat pig rat chicken and snake do not fall below 63 toward their respective templates at such values of sequence identities it is expected that the template and the target complexes share the same binding mode 6 we calculated the binding energy scores of the rbd from different virus isolates interacting with hace2 fig 2b all three methods used for the calculation are in agreement that rbds from bat-sl-covzc45 bat-sl-covzxc21 and rm1 show the worst energy scores while the binding energy score falls in the boundary limit of the incertitude margin for prodigy calculation section 2 supplementary material 2 the differences in the scores calculated by foldx and mm-gbsa are not therefore we consider that such differences in energies compared to sars-cov-2 are consistent between the three methods except for foldx the affinity is predicted to be more favorable for rbd from sars-cov-2 compared to sars-cov however mm-gbsa only marginally discriminates between the two values to investigate the tendency of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov to interact with different orthologous forms of ace2 we analysed the divergence in their respective interacting surfaces we have also mapped the putative glycosylation sites that overlap with the interface with rbd overall the binding energy scores are similar between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov considering the estimation of error for each method variances are more important for the calculations made by foldx and although of different formalism mm-gbsa and prodigy scores are relatively in agreement compared to hace2 only the canidae form shows better energy scores both in prodigy and mm-gbsa for sars-cov-2 moreover we found that putative glycosylation sites overlap significantly with rbd interaction in snake rat and bat forms section 3 supplementary data 2the docking also shows that key residues of rbd sars-cov-2 tend to interact with conserved residues on ace2 fig 3
 supplementary data 2 residues 3653 in hace2 which can explain the similar values of energy scores mm-gbsa allowed us to assign the contribution of each amino acid in the interface with hace2 in the binding energy score we conducted this analysis using both sequences of the sars-cov-2 wuhan-hu-1 fig 3a and the sino1-11 sars-cov fig 3b isolates residues f486 y489 q493 g496 t500 and n501 of sars-cov-2 rbd forming the hotspots of the interface with hace2 protein were investigated we only consider values 1 or 1 kcalmol to ignore the effect due to the thermal fluctuation all these amino acids form three patches of interaction spread along the linear interface segment fig 3c two from the n and c termini and one central t500 establishes two hydrogen bonds using its side and main chains with y41 and n330 of hace2 n501 forms another hydrogen bond with ace2 residue k353 buried within the interface on the other hand sars-cov rbd interface contains five residues fig 3d l473 y476 y485 t487 and t488 corresponding to the equivalent hotspot residues of rbd from sars-cov-2 f487 y490 g497 t501 and n502 therefore q493 as a hotspot amino acid is specific to sars-cov-2 interface the equivalent residue n480 in sars-cov only shows a non-significant contribution of 018 kcalmol the similarity matrix analysis was conducted to assess the divergence of the interaction interface of rbds qualitatively ie the specific set of residues implicated in the interaction with ace2 and quantity ie the contribution of each residue in the binding energy score the similarity matrix was calculated from free energy decomposition of interface residues of rbds from sars-cov-2 and sars-cov in complex with ace2 orthologous and reported as a network representation figs 3e fig 1 fig 2 in supplementary materials 2 we noticed the existence of densely interconnected edges involving all the protein-protein complexes for sars-cov-2 and sars-cov except those involving ace2 from sus scrofa and rattus norvegicus complexes involving the rbd of sars-cov-2 show less intrinsic similarity compared to rbd of sars-cov however similarity scores tend to be uniform in the group involving ace2 from human civet dog bat snake and chicken the complex including hace2 does not seem to diverge from the rest of the members of the sars-cov-2 group such as the case of sus scrofa and rattus norvegicus sequence analysis and the visual inspection of rbdhace2 complex might reflect the substitution of p499 in sars-cov-2 rbd as a form of adaptation toward a better affinity with the receptor in order to further investigate its role we performed a flexibility analysis using a reference structure sars-cov-2 rbd containing p499 and an in silico mutated form p499t a residue found in sars-cov and most of the clade 2 our results show that the mutation caused a significant decrease in stability for nine residues of the interface corresponding to segment 482491 fig 3f indeed the rmsf variability per amino acid for this sequence increases compared to the reference structure a total of eight variants of hace2 that map to the interaction surface are described in the gnomad database fig 4
a all these variants are rare table 1
 and mostly found in european non-finnish and african populations considering both the enthalpy ddg and the vibrational entropy in our calculation dds we found no significant changes 1 or 1 kcalmol in neither the folding energy of the complex fig 4b nor the interaction energy of the protein-protein partners fig 4c since the covid-2019 outbreak several milestone papers have been published to examine the particularity of sars-cov-2 spike protein and its putative interaction with ace2 as a receptor 21 in the current study we focused our analysis on the interface segments of sars-cov-2 spike rbd interacting with ace2 from different species by estimating interaction energy profiles we have studied the effect of eight variants of ace2 in order to detect polymorphisms that may increase or decrease virulence in the host our results showed that if ace2 is the only route for the infection in humans variants interacting physically with rbd are not likely to disrupt the formation of the complex and would have a marginal effect on the affinity therefore it is unlikely that any form of resistance to the virus related to the ace2 gene exists however this analysis merits to be investigated in depth in different ethnic groups for a better assessment of the contribution of genetic variability in host-pathogen interaction the similar values of binding energy scores with different ace2 orthologues suggest that the ability of binding to different ace2 orthologous is preserved in many species either for sars-cov-2 or sars-cov therefore the transition to the zoonotic form is trivial if that depends only on ace2 as the primary route to the infection in both the intermediate and the final host however we know that such a process is very complex since it requires many protein-protein interactions to acquire the specific capacity of infecting and replicating in the host cells 18 consequently it makes sense to assume that many other types of receptors or co-receptors may be critical to determine the capacity of crossing the species barrier this has been already suggested for sars-cov 1 and similarly sars-cov-2 may show the same feature moreover our results show that the significant overlap of glycosylation sites with the protein-protein interface implies a likely interaction of sars-cov-2 progenitors with receptors other than ace2 finally recent transcriptomic profiling has suggested the possibility of multiple route infections via the interaction of many human receptors for sars-cov-2 11 whole-genome phylogenetic analysis of the different isolates included in this study is consistent with previous works that place the wuhan-hu-1 isolate close to bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 isolates 1017 within the betacoronavirus genus the use of rbd sequences however places the virus in a clade that comprises sars-cov related homologs including isolates from bat and civet the clade swapping as seen in fig 1a seems also to occur for ratg13 and rm1 isolated from bat this is expected as the use of different phylogenetic markers may considerably affect the topology of the tree however the significant divergence in the interfaces segments as a key molecular element contributing to the determination of the tree topology has driven our work toward studying their impact on the interaction with hace2 the binding of the spike glycoprotein to ace2 receptor requires a certain level of affinity in the case where the rbd evolves from an ancestral form closer to that of bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 we expected a decrease of the binding energy scores through the evolution process following incremental changes in the rbd in such a scenario we presume that there are other intermediary forms of coronavirus that describe such variation of the binding energy score to reach a level where the pathogen can infect humans with high affinity toward hace2 on the other hand our results show that the binding energy score and the interface sequence of sars-cov-2 rbd are closer to sars-cov related isolates either from human or other species therefore a recombination event involving the spike protein that might have occurred between sars-cov and an ancestral form of the current sars-cov-2 virus might be also possible this will allow for the virus to acquire a minimum set of residues for the interaction with hace2 the recombination in the spike protein gene has been previously suggested by wei et al in their phylogenetic analysis 4 thereafter incremental changes in the binding interface segment will occur in order to reach a better affinity toward the receptor one of these changes may involve p499 residue which substitution to threonine seems to drastically destabilize the interface segment and has a distant effect moreover the decomposition of the interaction energy showed that 5 out of 6 hotspot amino acids in sars-cov-2 have their equivalent in sars-cov including n501 contrary to what wan et al 17 have stated the single mutation n501t does not seem to enhance the affinity rather the residue q493 might be responsible for such higher affinity due to a better satisfaction of the van der waals by the longer polar side chain of asparagine indeed when we made the same analysis while mutating q493 to n493 the favorable contribution decreases from 255 kcalmol to a non significant value of 001 kcalmol thus supporting our claim no major divergence of the interaction interface of sars-cov-2 rbd with hace2 was noticed from the similarity matrix analysis this suggests that the molecular elements required for the binding with the receptor might also be involved in the interaction with other orthologous forms of ace2 and that these elements are not optimized specifically for the human form therefore it is unlikely that the interface of rbd from sars-cov-2 is a result of human intervention via genetic engineering aiming to increase the affinity toward ace2 for example residue e484 contributes unfavorably to the binding energy with 224 kcalmol due to an electrostatic repulsion with e75 from hace2 this residue is an apparent choice for engineering a protein-protein complex with high affinity by substituting e484 with a polar residue it is however noteworthy that the lesser homogeneity of the nodes of sars-cov-2 group in comparison to sars-cov may suggest a higher tolerance for the mutation of the new virus which would allow it to cross the species barrier more easily and to efficiently optimize the interaction in the host no conflicts of interest  emergence of sars-cov-2 through recombination and strong purifying selection short title recombination and origin of sars-cov-2 one sentence summary extensive recombination and strong purifying selection among coronaviruses from different hosts facilitate the emergence of sars-cov-2 xiaojun li elena giorgi e   honnayakanahalli marichann brian foley chuan xiao xiang-peng kong yue chen bette korber feng gao  covid-19 has become a global pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 understanding the origins of sars-cov-2 is critical for deterring future zoonosis and for drug discovery and vaccine development we show evidence of strong purifying selection around the receptor binding motif rbm in the spike gene and in other genes among bat pangolin and human coronaviruses indicating similar strong evolutionary constraints in different host species we also demonstrate that sars-cov-2s entire rbm was introduced through recombination with coronaviruses from pangolins possibly a critical step in the evolution of sars-cov-2s ability to infect humans similar purifying selection in different host species and frequent recombination among coronaviruses suggest a common evolutionary mechanism that could lead to new emerging human coronaviruses  the severe respiratory disease covid-19 was first noticed in late december 2019 1  it rapidly became epidemic in china devastating public health and finance by mid-march covid-19 had spread to 150 countries and infected over 150000 people 2  on march 11 2020  the world health organization who officially declared it a pandemic a complete genome sequence of the etiological agent of covid-19 3 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 4 identified it as a new member of the genus betacoronavirus which include a diverse reservoir of coronaviruses covs isolated from bats 5-7 while genetically distinct from the betacoronaviruses that cause sars and mers in humans 8 9  sars-cov-2 shares the highest level of genetic similarity 963 with cov ratg13 sampled from a bat in yunnan in 2013 8  recently cov sequences closely related to sars-cov-2 were obtained from confiscated malaya pangolins in two separate studies 10 11  pangolin sars-like covs pansl-cov form two distinct clades corresponding to their collection location pansl-covgd from guangdong gd province in china and are genetically more similar to sars-cov-2 912 than pansl-covgx from guangxi gx province 854 understanding the origin of sars-cov-2 may help resolve strategies to deter future crossspecies transmissions and to establish appropriate animal models viral sequences nearly identical to sars and mers viruses were found in civets and domestic camels respectively 12 13  demonstrating that they originated from zoonotic transmissions with intermediate host species between the bat reservoirs and humans-a common pattern leading to cov zoonosis 5 viruses nearly identical to sars-cov- 2 have not yet been found in this paper we demonstrate through localized genomic analysis a complex pattern of evolutionary recombination between covs from distinct host species and cross-species infections that likely originated sars-cov-2 phylogenetic analysis of 43 complete genome sequences from three clades sars-covs and batsl-covs sars-cov-2 batsl-covs and pansl-covs and two divergent batsl-covs within the sarbecovirus group 9 confirms that ratg13 is overall the closest sequence to sars-cov-2 fig s1 it is followed by pansl-covgd viruses next and then pansl-covgx among the bat-cov sequences in clade 2  fig s1  zxc21 and zc45 sampled from bats in 2005 in zhoushan zhejiang china are the most divergent with the exception of the beginning of the orf1a gene region 1 fig 1a  all other batsl-cov and sars-cov sequences form a separate clade 3 while clade 1 comprises btky72 and bm48-31 the two most divergent batsl-cov sequences in the sarbecovirus group  fig s1  recombination in the first sars-cov-2 sequence wuhan-hu-1 with other divergent covs has been previously observed 3  here to better understand the role of recombination in the origin of sars-cov-2 among these genetically similar covs we compare wuhan-hu-1 to six representative batsl-covs one sars-cov and the two pansl-covgd sequences using simplot analysis 14  ratg13 has the highest similarity across the genome 8 with two notable exceptions where a switch occurs  fig 1a  in phylogenetic reconstructions sars-cov-2 clusters closer to zxc21 and zc45 than ratg13 at the beginning of the orf1a gene region 1 fig 1b  and as reported 10 15  to a pansl-covgd in region 2 figs 1c and s2 which spans the receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 binding site in the spike s glycoprotein gene comparing wuhan-hu-1 to pansl-covgd and ratg13 as representative of distinct host-species branches in the evolutionary history of sars-cov-2 using the recombination detection tool rip 16 we find significant recombination breakpoints before and after the ace2 binding site  fig s2a  suggesting that sars-cov-2 carries a history of cross-species recombination between the bat and the pangolin covs pansl-cov sequences are generally more similar to sars-cov-2 than cov sequences other than ratg13 and zxc21 but are more divergent from sars-cov-2 at two regions in particular the beginning of the orf1b gene and the highly divergent n terminus of the s gene regions 3 and 4 respectively fig 1a  within-region phylogenetic reconstructions show that pansl-cov sequences become as divergent as btky72 and bm48-31 in region 3  fig 1d  while less divergent in region 4 where pansl-covgd clusters with zxc21 and zc45 fig   1e  together these observations suggest ancestral cross-species recombination between pangolin and bat covs in the evolution of sars-cov-2 at the orf1a and s genes furthermore the discordant phylogenetic clustering at various regions of the genome among clade 2 covs also supports extensive recombination among these viruses isolated from bats and pangolins the sars-cov-2 s glycoprotein mediates viral entry into host cells and therefore represents a prime target for drug and vaccine development 17 18  while sars-cov-2 sequences share the greatest overall genetic similarity with ratg13 this is no longer the case in parts of the s gene specifically amino acid sequences of the receptor binding motif rbm in the c terminal of the s1 subunit are nearly identical to those in two pansl-covgd viruses with only one amino acid difference q498h-although the rbm region has not been fully sequenced in one of guangdong pangolin virus pansl-covgdp2s  fig 2a  pangolin covs from guangxi are much more divergent phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequences of this region shows three distinct clusters of sars-cov sars-cov-2 and bat-cov only viruses respectively  fig 2b  interestingly while sars-cov and sars-cov-2 viruses use ace2 for viral entry all covs in the third cluster have a 5-aa deletion and a 13-14-aa deletion in rbm  fig 2a  although both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 use the human ace2 as their receptors 8 20 they show a high level of genetic divergence figs 1 and s1 however structures of the s1 unit of the s protein from both viruses are highly similar 21 22 23  with the exception of a loop not proximal to the binding site that bends differently  fig 2c  this suggests that viral entry through binding of ace2 is structurally constrained to maintain the correct conformation among 17 distinct amino acids between sars-cov-2 and ratg13  fig 2a  five contact sites are different likely impacting ratg13s binding to ace2  fig 2d and table s1  the single amino acid difference q or h at position 498 between sars-cov-2 and pansl-covgd is at the edge of the ace2 contact interface neither q or h at this position form hydrogen bonds with ace2 residues  fig 2e  thus a functional rbm nearly identical to the one in sars-cov-2 is naturally present in pansl-covgd viruses the very distinctive ratg13 rbm suggests that this virus is unlikely to infect human cells and that the acquisition of a complete functional rbm by a ratg13-like cov through a recombination event with a pansl-covgd-like virus enabled it to use ace2 for human infection three small insertions are identical in sars-cov-2 and ratg13 but not found in other covs in the sarbecovirus group 24  the ratg13 sequence was sampled in 2013 years before sars-cov-2 was first identified it is unlikely that both sars-cov-2 and ratg13 independently acquired identical insertions at three different locations in the s gene thus it is plausible that an ratg13-like virus served as a progenitor to generate sars-cov-2 by gaining a complete human ace2 binding rbm from pansl-covgd-like viruses through recombination genetic divergence at the nucleic acid level between wuhan-hu-1 and pansl-covgd viruses is significantly reduced from 139  fig 1e  to 14 at the amino acid level  fig 2b  in the rbm region indicating recombination between ratg13-like covs and pansl-covgd-like covs furthermore sars-cov-2 has a unique furin cleavage site insertion prra not found in any other covs in the sarbecovirus group 24 although similar motifs are also found in mers and more divergent bat covs 25 fig s3  this prra motif makes the s1s2 cleavage in sars-cov-2 much more efficiently than in sars-cov and may expand its tropism andor enhance its transmissibility 23  a recent study of bat covs in yunnan china identified a three-amino acid insertion paa at the same site 26  although it is not known if this paa motif can function like the prra motif the presence of a similar insertion at the same site indicates that such insertion may already be present in the wild bat covs the more efficient cleavage of s1 and s2 units of the spike glycoprotein 25 and efficient binding to ace2 by sars-cov-2 22 27 may have allowed sars-cov-2 to jump to humans leading to the rapid spread of sars-cov-2 in china and the rest of the world recombination from pansl-covgd at the rbm and at the unique furin cleavage site insertion prompted us to examine the sars-cov-2 sequences within these regions amino acid sequences from sars-cov-2 ratg13 and all pansl-cov viruses are identical or nearly identical before between and after the rbm and the furin cleavage site while all other covs are very distinctive  fig 3a and s3  the average of all pairwise dnds ratios w among sars-cov-2 ratg13 and pansl-cov viruses at the 3-end of the s gene after the furin cleavage site is 0013 compared to w 005 in the s region preceding the furin cleavage site and to w 004 after the site for all other covs the much lower w value at the 3-end of the s gene among the sars-cov-2 ratg13 and pansl-cov viruses indicates that this region is under strong purifying selection within these sequences  fig 3a  a plot of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions relative to wuhan-hu-1 highlights the regional differences across the region before and after the rbm and the furin cleavage site  fig 3a  the 3 end of the region is highly conserved among the sars-cov-2 ratg13 and pansl-cov viruses group a while far more nonsynonymous mutations are observed in the rest of the cov sequences group b the shift in selective pressure in the 3 -end of the gene among these related viruses versus other covs begins near codon 368  fig 3b  and such a shift was not evident among other compared covs  fig 3b-d  we observe similar patterns of purifying selection pressure in other parts of the genome including the e and m genes as well as the partial orf1a and orf1b genes  fig 4  interestingly the purifying selection pressure varies among different viruses depending on which genes are analyzed the broadest group includes sars-cov-2 ratg13 all pansl-cov and the two bat covs zxc21 and zc45 for both e and m genes figs 4 and s5 the second group includes sars-cov-2 ratg13 and all pansl-cov only for the 3 end of the s gene the narrowest selection group only contains sars-cov-2 ratg13 and pangolin covs from guangdong for the partial regions of orf1a and orf1b figs 4 and s6 consistently low  values and strong purifying selection pressure on sars-cov-2 ratg13 and pansl-covgd viruses suggest that these complete and partial genes are under similar functionalstructural constraints among the different host species in two extreme cases amino acid sequences of the e gene and the 3 end of orf1a are identical among the compared cov sequences although genetic distances are quite large among these viruses at the nucleic acid level such evolutionary constraints across viral genomes especially at functional domains in the s gene which plays an important role in cross-species transmission 5 17 coupled with frequent recombination may facilitate cross-species transmissions between ratg13-like bat andor pansl-covgd-like viruses previous studies using more limited sequence sets found that sars-covs originated through multiple recombination events between different bat-covs 10 17 19 28 29  our phylogenetic analyses of individual genes show that sars-cov sequences tend to cluster with yn2018b rs9401 rs7327 wiv16 and rs4231 group a for some genes and rf4092 yn2013 anlong-112 and gx2013 group b for others  fig s7  simplot analysis using both groups of batsl-covs and the closely related bat cov ynlf-34c 29 shows that sars-cov gz02 shifts in similarity across different bat sl-covs at various regions of the genome fig 5a  in particular phylogenetic reconstruction of the beginning of orf1a region 1 confirms that sars-covs cluster with ynlf-34c 29  and this region is distinctive comparing to all other covs  fig 5b  ynlf-34c is more divergent from sars-cov than other bat-cov viruses before and after this region confirming the previously reported complex recombinant nature of ynlf-34c 29  fig  5a  at the end of the s gene region 2 sars-covs cluster with group a covs forming a highly divergent clade  fig 5c  in region 3 orf8 sars-covs and group b covs together with ynlf-34c form a very divergent and distinctive cluster  fig 5d  to further explore the recombinant nature of sars-covs we compared gz02 to representative bat cov sequences using the rip recombination detection tool 16  we identified four significant breakpoints at 99 confidence between the two parental lineages  fig s8a  further supported by phylogenetic analysis  fig s8b-s8d  in addition the two aforementioned groups of bat covs shown in light brown and light blue in the trees show similar cluster changes across the five recombinant regions suggesting multiple events of historic recombination among bat sl-covs these results demonstrate that sars-cov shares a recombinant history with at least three different groups of bat-covs and confirms the major role of recombination in the evolution of these viruses of the bat sl-covs that contributed to the recombinant origin of sars-cov only group a viruses bind to ace2 group b bat sl-covs do not infect human cells 5 19 and have two deletions in the rbm figs 1e and 2a the short deletion between residues 445 and 449 and in particular the loss of y449 which forms three hydrogen bonds with ace2 will significantly affect the overall structure of the rbm figs 2f and 2e the region encompassing the large deletion between residues 473 and 486 contains the loop structure that accounts for the major differences between the s protein of sars-cov and sars-cov-2  fig 2c  this deletion causes the loss of contact site f486 and affects the conserved residue f498s hydrophobic interaction with residue m82 on ace2 fig 2f  these two deletions will render rbm in those covs incapable to bind human ace2 therefore recombination may play a role in enabling cross-species transmission in sars-covs through the acquisition of an s gene type that can efficiently bind to the human ace2 receptor orf8 is one of the highly variable genes in coronaviruses 5 17 29 and its function has not yet been elucidated 5 17 30  breakpoints within this region show that recombination occurred at the beginning and the end of orf8  fig s9  where nucleic acid sequences are nearly identical among both sars-covs and group b bat covs moreover all compared viruses form three highly distinct clusters  fig 5d  suggesting that the orf8 gene may be biologically constrained and evolves through modular recombination the third recombination region at the beginning of orf1a is where sars-cov-2 also recombined with other bat covs region 1 fig 1a  this region is highly variable 5 17 and recombination within this part of the genome was also found in many other covs suggesting that it may be a recombination hotspot and may factor into cross-species transmission there are three important aspects to betacoronavirus evolution that should be carefully considered in phylogenetic reconstructions among more distant coronaviruses first there is extensive recombination among all of these viruses 10 17 19 28 29 figs 1 and 5 making standard phylogenetic reconstructions based on full genomes problematic as different regions of the genome have distinct ancestral relationships second between more distant sequences synonymous substitutions are often fully saturated which can confound analyses of selective pressure and add noise to phylogenetic analysis finally there are different selective pressures at work in different lineages which is worth consideration interpreting trees the currently sampled pangolin covs are too divergent from sars-cov-2 for them to be sars-cov-2 progenitors but it is noteworthy that these sequences contain an rbm that can most likely bind to human ace2 while ratg13 is the most closely related cov sequence to sars-cov-2 it has a distinctive rbm which is not expected to bind to human ace2 sars-cov-2 has a nearly identical rbm to the one found in the pangolin covs from guangdong thus it is plausible that ratg13-like bat-cov viruses may have obtained the rbm sequence binding to human ace2 through recombination with pansl-covgd-like viruses we hypothesize that this andor other ancestral recombination events between viruses infecting bats and pangolins may have had a key role in the evolution of the strain that lead to the introduction of sars-cov-2 into humans all three human covs sars mers and sars-2 are the result of recombination among covs recombination in all three viruses involved the s gene likely a precondition to zoonosis that enabled efficient binding to human receptors 5 17 extensive recombination among bat coronaviruses and strong purifying selection pressure among viruses from humans bats and pangolin may allow such closely related viruses ready jump between species and adapt to the new hosts many bat covs have been found able to bind to human ace2 and replication in human cells 10 19 31 32 33  serological evidence has revealed that additional otherwise undetected spillovers have occurred in people in china living in proximity to wild bat populations 34  continuous surveillance of coronaviruses in their natural hosts and in humans will be key to rapid control of new coronavirus outbreaks so far efforts have failed to find the original pathway of sars-cov-2 into humans by identifying a coronavirus that is nearly identical to sars-cov-2 as those found for sars and mers in civets and domestic camels respectively 12 13  however if the new sars-cov-2 strain did not cause widespread infections in its natural or intermediate hosts such a strain may never be identified the close proximity of animals of different species in a wet market setting may increase the potential for cross-species spillover infections by enabling recombination between more distant coronaviruses and the emergence of recombinants with novel phenotypes while the direct reservoir of sars-cov-2 is still being sought one thing is clear reducing or eliminating direct human contact with wild animals is critical to preventing new coronavirus zoonosis in the future   an analysis of sars-cov-2 using vireport miranda song niema moshiri  the ongoing outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has resulted in millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths given the current lack of treatments or vaccines available it may be useful to trace the evolution and spread of the virus to better develop methods of preventative intervention in this study we analyzed over 4000 full genome sequences of human sars-cov-2 using novel tool vireport 13  an automated workflow for performing phylogenetic analyses on viral sequences and generating comprehensive molecular epidemiological reports the complete vireport output can be found at httpsgithubcom mirandajsongvireport-sars-cov-2  coronaviruses are a group of rna viruses that cause various diseases in humans other mammals and birds in the last two decades there have been three documented strains of coronavirus that have caused major epidemics in humans these include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in 2002 middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012 and most recently a novel coronavirus referred to as covid-19 or sars-cov-2 that emerged in wuhan china in december 2019 as of june 2020 there have been over 8 million confirmed cases of sars-cov-2 globally 3  the rapid spread of sars-cov-2 has demonstrated the need to understand how the virus spreads and for measures of epidemic intervention such as stay-at-home orders and social distancing to gain insight into disease transmission and origins phylogenetic analyses are often performed using bioinformatics methods to quantify and visualize the relatedness of viral sequences a typical workflow for phylogenetic analysis and reconstruction involves four main steps 1 data acquisition 2 sequence alignment 3 phylogenetic inference and 4 tree visualization 6  acquiring data involves identifying homologous nucleotide or protein sequences that are representative of the point of interest whether that be a specific gene or species or something else this step may involve additional preprocessing eg filtering by length or sample type to ensure that the sequences are valid and that the inferred tree will provide meaningful results there are many public databases that provide viral and other sequences and accompanying metadata including ncbi ncbinlmnihgov gisaid gisaidorg and vipr viprbrcorg multiple sequence alignment msa refers to the alignment of related biological sequences of similar length the output of which may be used to infer more specific evolutionary relationships given the classification of msa computation as an np-complete problem there are many existing algorithms that solve this problem 1  examples include mafft 7  muscle 5  and viralmsa 15  all of which are implemented in vireport along with others phylogenetic inference is the reconstruction of evolutionary trees by grouping individual elements based on shared ancestry estimation of phylogenetic trees can be performed through various methods such as bayesian inference and maximum likelihood 6  which have spawned tools such as beast 4 and raxml 17  respectively the resulting phylogenies can be input into online tree visualization tools for further examination while there exist various tools that seek to automate this process such as mega5 18 and phylogenyfr 2  vireport is robust in its integration of modules that allows for the user to select their desired tool for each stage in the workflow furthermore vireport includes options for rooting and dating the inferred phylogeny calculating pairwise distances ancestral sequence reconstruction and transmission clustering all of which provide additional information beyond the tree itself  vireport was used to preprocess the data perform the msa and phylogenetic inference steps and produce the input tree files for tree visualization for this study sequences were retrieved from the ncbi virus database which hosts data from genbank nucleotide sequences were selected for using the sars-cov-2 virus specification and by filtering out sequences under 26000 bases as to only include full genome sequences 22  sequence metadata was also compiled specifically that regarding the coun-try of origin and the collection date multiple sequence alignment was performed using viralmsa 15 utilizing minimap2 10 and the reference sequence with accession id nc 045512 defined as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate wuhan-hu-1 and dated december 2019 pairwise sequence distances were calculated using the tn93 tool from hiv-trace 8 fasttree 2 16 was used to infer a maximum-likelihood phylogeny under the general time-reversible model 19 using a gamma20-based likelihood the phylogeny was minvarrooted using fastroot 11 and dated using lsd2 20  pairwise phylogenetic distances were calculated using treeswift 14  the phylogenies were visualized using itol 9 and icytree 21  comparison of the visualization of the vireport output and the figure from this study 23 shows that the results are very similar despite the two analyses having used different tools viralmsa and iq-tree for vireport muscle and raxml for the article 23  as the overall clades are nearly identical both analyses indicate that while sars-cov mers and sars-cov-2 fall into distinct clades sars-cov-2 is more closely related to sars-cov as both fall under the subgenus sarbecovirus whereas mers falls under a different subgenus merbecovirus additionally sars-cov-2 is most closely related to a sars-like coronavirus found in bats we can see from the histogram above that the peak of the sample distribution falls around late march 2020 sequences were also grouped by geographical location as shown below we can see from the distribution that nearly 40 countries were represented in the dataset with the five highest sequence counts from the us australia hong kong germany and china incidentally as of june 2020 the top five countries in terms of total number of confirmed cases are the us brazil russia india and the united kingdom 3  while there does not seem to be significant correlation between sequence counts and confirmed cases which could be the result of sampling bias it is notable that the us has the highest counts for both metrics the following maximum-likelihood phylogeny was inferred with an average pairwise phylogenetic distance of 0000381 and a standard deviation of 0000208 the maximum pairwise phylogenetic distance ie tree diameter was 000505 which describes the distance between the two least closely related sequences given the large number of sequences included it is evidently difficult to visualize the specific relationships between sequences in the tree these individual relationships can be visualized by inputting the rooted tree file to itol but the tree is too large to include in this report the pairwise phylogenetic distances were also used for transmission clustering using treen93 12  which resulted in 736 clusters and 2535 singletons the average cluster size was 2853 with a standard deviation of 20284 and cluster sizes ranged from 2-30  some considerations of the limitations of this analysis include the dataset used given that there are well over 8 million confirmed cases of sars-cov-2 in the world as of june 2020 but the sample only included around 4500 sequences the sample is evidently a very small subset that may not be representative of current events both in geographical distribution and time for example the uk has the fifth most cases in the world 3 but is not listed as one of the categories represented by the sample as the viral sequence database updates with new sequences or sequences from other sources are pooled together the analysis may become more representative future directions for this work include additional analysis of the generated statistics a topic of interest is how the sequences are distributed by date for each country as this may be indicative of how successful policies in place are in terms of managing the ongoing epidemic another topic is exploring the distribution of pairwise distances over time which may lead to conclusions regarding the mutation rate of the sars-cov-2 virus with regard to vireport additional work is being done to analyze potential differences in results based on which tools are selected at each step all genome sequences are available at ncbi virus the complete vireport output

receptor natural reservoir tropism and therapeuticvaccine target veljko veljkovic jlia vergara-alert joaquim segals slobodan paessler   fears are mounting worldwide over the cross-border spread of the new coronavirus denoted as sars-cov-2 that originated in wuhan the largest city in central china after its spread to many countries around the world the newly emerging pathogen belongs to the same virus family as the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome and middle east respiratory syndrome coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov respectively the world health organization who has
recently published surveillance recommendations for a possible large epidemic or even pandemic pandemic declared on march 11
th 2020 of the novel coronavirus and it has issued guidelines for hospitals across the world however many questions about sars-cov-2 remain unanswered i what is the origin andor natural reservoir of the virus ii is it easily transmitted from human to human and iii what are the potential diagnostic therapeutic and vaccine targets currently only nucleotide sequences of eight human sars-cov-2 isolates are available without any additional information about biological properties of the virus beyond the morphological confirmation of the virion using electronic microscopy this is likely not enough information to answer the important abovementioned questions the informational spectrum method ism a virtual spectroscopy method for analysis of proteins is based on the fundamental electronic properties of amino acids and requires only nucleotide sequence availability to investigate proteins
1 for this reason ism was previously used for analysis of novel viruses for which little or no information were available
2
5 here the sars-cov-2 was analyzed with ism to identify its possible origin and natural host as well as putative therapeutic and vaccine targets the s1 surface protein sequences from the first 8 human sars-cov-2 deposited in the publicly available
gisaid database assessed on january 19 2020 were analyzed by ism the studied sequences were betacovwuhanivdc-hb-042020 betacovwuhanivdc-hb-012019 betacovwuhanivdc-hb-052019 betacovwuhanipbcams-wh-012019 betacovwuhanwiv042019 betacovwuhan-hu-12019 betacovnonthaburi612020 and betacovnonthaburi742020 in the phylogenetic analysis different amino acid sequences of other coronaviruses were also included i s1 proteins from the following viruses avp78042 avpvp78031 ay304486 ay559093 jx163927 yn2018b ky417146 used already by other authors in the study of the phylogenetic relationship between sars-cov-2 and nearest bat and sars-like covs

2 according to this approach sequences protein or dna are transformed into signals by assignment of numerical values of each element amino acid or nucleotide these values correspond to electron-ion interaction potential
6 determining electronic properties of amino acidnucleotides which are essential for their intermolecular interactions the signal obtained is then decomposed in a periodical function by the fourier transformation the result is a series of frequencies and their amplitudes the obtained frequencies correspond to the distribution of structural motifs primary structure with defined physico-chemical characteristics responsible for the biological function of the putative protein corresponding to the analyzed sequence when comparing proteins that share same biological or biochemical function the technique allows detection of codefrequency pairs that are specific for their common biological properties the method is insensitive to the location of the motifs and therefore does not require previous alignment of the sequences in addition this is the only method that allows immediate functional analysis the phylogenetic tree of s1 proteins from coronaviruses was generated with the ism-based phylogenetic algorithm istree previously described in detail elsewhere
7 in the presented analysis we calculated the distance matrix with the amplitude on the frequency f0257 as the distance measure between sequences in order to compare informational similarity between sars-cov-2 sars-cov mers-cov and bat sars-like cov the cross-spectra cs of s1 proteins from these viruses were calculated
figure 1a shows the cs of sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov these cs contain only one dominant peak corresponding to the frequency f0257
figure 1b displays the cs of s1 proteins from sars-cov-2 and bat sars-like cov amplitudes in these latter cs are significantly lower than in those cs presented in
figure 1a these results show that i s1 proteins from sars-cov-2 sars-cov mers-cov and bat sars-like cov encode common information which is represented with the frequency f0257 and ii s1 proteins from sars-cov-2 are remarkable more informationally similar with s1 from sars-cov and mers-cov than with s1 from bat sars-like cov this suggests that biological properties of sars-cov-2 are apparently more similar to sars-cov and mers-cov than to bat sars-like cov to confirm this conclusion the ism-base phylogenetic tree for s1 proteins was calculated 
figure 2 in this calculation the amplitude on the frequency f0257 was used as the distance measure as observed in
figure 2 all analyzed sars-cov-2 s1 amino acid sequences are grouped with sars-cov and mers-cov and separated from bat sars-like cov this indicates that sars-cov-2 are more phylogenetically similar to sars-cov and mers-cov than to bat sars-like cov this result differs from those obtained with the homology-based phylogenetic analysis which showed that sars-cov-2 are closely related to bat sars-like cov 
httpsplatformgisaidorgepi3frontendlightbox1296857287 it has been previously shown that the dominant frequency in the informational spectrum of viral envelope proteins corresponds to interaction between the virus and its receptor
2
3
7
8 the ism analysis showed that the frequency component f0257 is present in the cs of s1 sars-cov and its receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2
9 but not in the cs of s1 mers-cov and its main receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4
10 of note is that both receptors ace2 and dpp4 are expressed in airway epithelia presence of f0257 in the informational spectrum of mers-cov 
figure 1 suggests also possible interaction between this virus and the ace2 the dominant peak on the frequency f0257 in the cs of s1 from sars-cov and mers-cov and ace2 supports this possibility 
figure 3 although this has not been formally proved for mers-cov
11 as it is shown in
figure 1a the frequency f0257 is also present in the informational spectrum of the sars-cov-2 suggesting that ace2 might be the receptor for this novel coronavirus too this prediction was subsequently confirmed by functional studies in vitro
12 calculation of the cs for s1 protein from the sars-cov-2 and all ace2 sequences available at the uniprot database revealed that the highest amplitudes on the frequency f0257 correspond to ace2 from civet and chicken this result indicates that these species can be included as potential candidates for the natural reservoir of the sars-cov-2 however it is possible that sars-cov-2 viruses use very different receptors in the natural hosts and not only the ace2 as it is the putative case in humans an experimental study performed on chicken however indicated lack of susceptibility of this species to the novel virus
13 civets so far have not been tested but the indicated study confirmed susceptibility of domestic cat to sars-cov-2 finally the s1 amino acid sequence from the sars-cov-2 was scanned to look for the domain that gives the highest contribution to the information represented by the frequency f0257 
figure 4a this analysis revealed domain 266330 numbering concerns the maturated protein is essential for interaction of sars-cov-2 with ace2 of note is the striking homology between these domains of s1 proteins from sars-cov-2 and sars-cov but not from mers-cov for which ace2 is not the main receptor 
figure 4b further s1 spike proteins from sars-cov 
table 1 and sars-cov-2 
table 2 were compared the cs of s1 proteins from sars-cov 
figure 5a and sars-cov-2 
figure 5b were assessed principal information encoded in s1 proteins from sars-cov and sars-cov-2 is represented with two different frequencies f0222 and f0478 respectively this result indicates some potential differences in the virus-host interaction of these two viruses although they apparently use the same receptor ace2 to identify the host proteins involved in the attachment andor internalization of the sars-cov-2 the uniprot database 
httpswwwuniprotorg was screened by ism for human proteins with the dominant peak on the frequency f0478 the list of human proteins that have a dominant peak in is at the frequency f0478 are given in
table 3 according to the is criterion these proteins are potential candidate interactors with the sars-cov-2 s1 protein further literature data mining was performed to identify which proteins presented in
table 3 might be involved in the processes of infection with human coronaviruses this analysis revealed that the actin protein plays an important role in the early entry events during human coronavirus infections
14 actin proteins were selected as the best candidate interactors for the sars-cov-2 among the host proteins that are characterized with frequency f0478
figure 5c shows that cs of actins from different mammalian species 
table 4 contains the dominant peak on f0478 suggesting that actin probably encodes the conserved information important for their biological function the data mining of the pubmed database 
wwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed also showed that actin protein plays an important role in the rapid virus cell-to-cell spread and dissemination of infection
15 additionally the actin filament reorganization is a key step in lung inflammation induced by systemic inflammatory responses caused by infectious agents
16 these findings indicate that interaction between actin proteins and the s1 could be involved in the infection and pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 in consequence the possibility to interfere on this interaction might represent a valid hypothesis for development of promising prevention and therapeutic strategies interestingly further data mining revealed that ibuprofen fda approved drug with excellent safety record attenuates interleukin-1-induced inflammation as well as actin reorganization
17 actin was also found to be the primary component by which ibuprofen can bind to the tissue in different organs
18 this suggests that ibuprofen might impact the sars-cov-2-induced disease by indirect interaction with actin proteins previously ibuprofen was predicted as a candidate entry inhibitor for ebola virus using the same
in silico approach
19 and this prediction was confirmed experimentally at a later time point
20
21 these results prompt the possibility to experimentally test the effects of ibuprofen on sars-cov-2 infection under
in vitro and
in vivo conditions 
in silico methods are considered very important tools to generate first hypotheses and identify first drug candidates against newly discovered agents like in the case of sars-cov-2 especially in the short-term ism a technology based on electronic biology allowed identifying potential importance of human actin proteins for viral infectiondissemination as well as one fda approved drug that may have an indirect antiviral activity within weeks of the initial outbreak however additional experiments are required to confirm our initial findings in conclusion results of the presented
in silico analysis suggest the following i the newly emerging sars-cov-2 is highly related to sars-cov and to a lesser degree mers-cov and ace2 is a likely receptor of it ii civets and poultry are potential candidates for the natural reservoir of the sars-cov-2 iii human actin proteins possibly participate in attachmentinternalisation of sars-cov-2 iv drugs which interact with actin proteins eg ibuprofen should be investigated as possible therapeutics for treatment of sars-cov-2 infection and v domain 266-330 of s1 protein from the sars-cov-2 represents promising therapeutic andor vaccine target further research on these issues are needed including the development of reverse genetics and animal models to study the biology of sars-cov-2 due to the fast evolving of scientific knowledge on sars-cov-2 the first prediction has been already confirmed while the chicken as potential candidate as intermediate host has not been supported importantly link between ibuprofenactin interactions and viral entry remains an exciting path for future therapeutic investigations sequence data of the viruses were obtained from the

2 firstly isolated the virus from in vitro tissue culture and subsequently yielded a 646-bp genomic fragment by rt-pcr using degenerate primers which showed more than 50 homology to the rna polymerase gene of bovine coronavirus bcv and murine hepatitis virus mhv the use of gene chip further confirmed the coronavirus as a possible cause of sars 11 soon after the identification of the sars-cov laboratories started to investigate the phylogenetic relationship between the virus and the other members of the same family through extensive comparison of their genome sequences in mid-april 2003 the british columbia cancer agency bcca genome science center in canada 12 the center of disease control in the united states 13 and the university of hong kong 14 announced at nearly the same time that the complete genome sequence of the sars-cov had been isolated in the corresponding areas 15 the results of independent sequencing of the sars-cov genome all indicated that it was a polyadenylated genomic rna of 297 kb in length comparative analysis of the genome with other coronaviruses suggested that the virus genome was very similar to previously characterized coronaviruses with the order starting from the n-terminal replicase r spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n gene where there are few accessory genes or motifs spanning between the structural genes and at the 3 utr untranslated region which may not be necessary for viral replication 12 the replicase gene with two open reading frames orf 1a and 1b covering more than two thirds of the genome is predicted to encode only two proteinases 12 13 14 that regulate both the replication of the positive-stranded genomic rna and the subsequent transcription of a nested set of eight subgenomic sg mrnas table 1 ref 16 which is a common transcription strategy adopted by coronavirus members 17 18 19 20 21 the 5 utr of the sars-cov genome was characterized by 5 rapid amplification of cdna ends 5 race ref 14 and northern blot assay 13 16 22 these procedures elucidated the leader sequence and the transcription regulatory sequence trs the leader sequence found in the viral sg mrna transcripts is at least 72 nucleotides long through the alignment of the leader sequence at the 5 end of the eight sg mrnas there is a minimal consensus trs namely 5-acgaac-3 which participates in the discontinuous synthesis of sg mrnas as a signaling sequence the degree of sequence variance flanking the trs showed no clear relationship with the abundance of the sg mrnas 22 a highly conserved s2m motif with 32 nucleotides was also identified in the 3 region of the genome which had also been described in avian infectious bronchitis virus aibv ref 12 14 the replicase gene of the sars-cov encodes for at least two proteins as a consequence of the proteolytic processing of the large polyprotein orf 1a and 1b ref 16 the translation of segment 1b of such polyprotein is interrupted by the 1 ribosomal frame shifting by a putative slippery sequence and a putative pseudoknot structure 16 two functional domainspapain-like cysteine proteinase pl2pro and 3c-like cysteine proteinase 3clpro were identified experimentally and were responsible for the proteolytic processing of the polyprotein into 16 subunits 16 22 23 a 375-aa sars-cov unique domain was identified upstream of the pl2pro domain which is unparalleled in any other known coronaviruses 16 in addition seven more putative regions encoding rna processing enzymes were identified namely rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp rna helicase hel poly u-specific endoribonuclease xendou 30-to-50 exonuclease exon s-adenosylmethionine-dependent ribose 20-o-methyltransferase 20-o-mt adenosine diphosphate-ribose 100-phosphatase adrp and a cyclic phosphodiesterase cpd ref 16 the translation of two polyproteins from orf 1a and 1b starts the genome expression the two proteinases pcl2pro and 3clpro are then coupled with the proteolytic processing of the two polyproteins into 16 units pcl2pro is responsible for the n-proximal cleavage and 3clpro is responsible for the c-proximal cleavage the helicase is then released atpase activity and dna duplex-unwinding activity were demonstrated by purified helicase indicating that the protein has rna polymerase activity 16 24 together with the m protein the spike protein is believed to be incorporated into the viral envelope before the mature virion is released 17 initial analysis of the 1255-aa peplomer protein of the virus reveals the possible existence of a signal peptide that would likely be cleaved between residues 13 and 14 12 the whole structure is predicted to contain a receptor-binding unit s1 in the n-terminus 14 25 26 27 and a transmembrane unit s2 in the c-terminus 13 14 25 27 molecular modeling of the s1 and s2 subunits of the spike glycoprotein 26 28 suggested that the former unit is consisted of mainly anti-parallel -sheets with dispersed  and  regions in addition to the three domains identified in the s2 unit the confidence level of the predicted molecular models was strengthened by the good correlation between predicted accessibility and hydropathy profiles and by the correct locations of the no-glycosylation sites and most of the disulfide bridges whether the experimentally determined n-glycosylated sites from purified spike protein treated by tryptic digest together with pngase followed by time-of-flight tof mass spectrometry 29 are correctly located in the proposed model remains to be clarified in the aspect of biological activities receptors for the binding of the sars-cov remain mysterious as comparative genomics did not point out any significant similarity with the s1 domain of other human coronaviruses implying that these viruses are using different receptors for cell entry 12 subsequently angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 was demonstrated to be a functional receptor for the sars-cov in vitro synctia was observed in cell culture expressing ace2 and the sars-cov s1 domain which could be inhibited by anti-ace2 antibody 30 fine mapping on the n-terminal unit of the spike protein indicates that the receptor-binding domain is probably located between the residues 303 and 537 31 the sequence of the gene product from orf 3a shows no homology to any known proteins 12 14 signal peptide or a cleaved site is likely to be present in the protein except three predicted transmembrane domains 12 the exact function of the protein is yet to be determined though the c-terminal of the protein may be involved in atp-binding properties 12 the envelope protein of the sars-cov is thought to be the component of the virus envelope topology prediction suggested that the e protein is a type ii membrane protein with the c-terminus hydrophilic domain exposed on the virion surface comparative protein sequence analysis suggested the sars-cov e protein resembles the protein connected with mhv 12 32 33 the matrix glycoprotein is not likely to be cleaved 12 and contains three putative transmembrane domains 12 13 14 its hydrophilic domain is believed to interact with the nucleocapsid protein and is located inside the virus particle 12 linear epitope mapping of the m protein using synthetic peptides revealed that amino acid residues 2137-2158 interacted with sars patient sera by elisa assay implying the potential capability of the m protein to induce immune response 34 35 like orf 3a sequence homology search yielded no significant result for any existing proteins but the existence of a cleavage site between residues 15 and 16 and a transmembrane helix were predicted for orf 7a it is a putative type i membrane protein 12 the n gene sequence showed high homology with the nucleocapsid protein of other coronaviruses a putative short lysine-rich nuclear localization signal ktfpptepkkdkkkktdeaq was identified 12 a potential and well-conserved rna interaction domain was also identified at the middle region of the gene in which its basic nature may assist its role 12 14 the n protein was reported to activate the ap-1 signal transduction pathway indicating that the protein may play a role in the regulation of the host cell cycle 36 apart from the possible role in pathogenicity n gene was also believed to be the most abundant antigen in the host during the course of infection making it an excellent candidate for diagnostic purposes the linear epitopes of the protein have been mapped 35 37 38 and the possibility of using these antigenic peptides or recombinant proteins in the diagnosis was discussed the phylogenetic relationship by the comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the replicase gene and four structural genes s e m n with other coronaviruses was described 12 13 14 the conclusions drawn by the different research groups were similar with the observation that sars-cov itself forms a distinct clusterthe fourth group of coronaviridae a notion supported by the high bootstrap values above 90 as a result it has been concluded that the sars-cov is phylogenetically equidistant from all other known coronaviruses moreover no detectable recombination event was concluded in the similarity plot on the whole genome alignment with other coronaviruses 14 the above findings suggest that the sars-cov is neither a mutant nor a recombinant of existing coronaviruses and that the possibility of such a virus emerging as a product of genetic engineering can be excluded as it is unlikely to generate an infectious coronavirus with 50 of its genome different from the existing coronaviruses 9 snijder et al
22 conducted an extensive phylogenetic analysis concerning the replicase gene of the sars-cov by using torovirus as an outgroup these authors criticized the phylogram construction based on different sars-cov proteins as unconvincing and suggested the possibility that the sars-cov can be clustered into an existing group as the structural and other accessory genes can either be gained or lost throughout the evolutionary process and in view of their low level of conservation the author decided to target the replicase gene to perform the phylogenetic analysis for this reason the phylogenetic relationship was reconstructed through a rooted tree the construction of the phylogram was done with the fused replicase gene with manual adjustment and exclusion of poorly conserved region the resulting tree reveals that the gene was mostly related to group 2 coronaviruses and was assigned as a subgroup 2b the author further pointed out that the sars-cov contains homologues of domains that are unique for group 2 coronaviruses in the region of nsp1 and nsp3 pl2pro in addition to the differences in the sequence and arrangements of the 3-located orfs and the lack of antigenic cross-reactivity do not contradict their conclusion as such a phenomenon was also observed in group 1 coronaviruses using bayesian phylogenic inference approach a recombination break point within the sars-cov rdrp was identified at protein sequence level 39 phylogenetic analysis on the 5 end of the domain indicated that it might originate from the common ancestor of all existing coronaviruses while the same analysis on the 3 end gave another tree topology that suggests a sister relationship with group 3 avian coronaviruses these results suggested that a recombination event occurred between the common ancestor of the sars-cov and that of other coronaviruses or alternatively that the 5 fragment of the sars-cov diverged before the one between or within other known coronaviruses and the 3 fragment diverged more recently 39 based on the antigenic cross reactivity and genome characteristics existing coronaviruses are generally classified into three subgroups 40 all coronaviruses share a very similar organization in their functional and structural genes but the arrangement of the so-called non-essential genes is remarkably different among the subgroups group 1 coronaviruses are mainly characterized by the presence of orfs following the n gene group 2 coronaviruses have two additional orfs non-structural protein 2 ns2 and he gene located between orf 1b and the s gene only group 3 species have orfs located between the m and n gene and a conserved stem-loop motif s2m at their 3 utr figure 1 accessory orfs are found between the s and e genes in all of the subgroups however these accessory orfs within the s-e intergenic region do not seem to be homologous between the subgroups though they are conserved within subgroups the rate of evolution of these accessory genes is obviously higher than that of the essential genes which provides an alternative to access the phylogeny of the coronavirus family based on the confirmed orfs of the sars-cov described above a comparison of all homologous accessory and essential orfs of known coronaviruses with the novel sars-cov is shown in figure 1 from the results it does not seem that the coding regions are a consequence of a newly occurring recombination event between any of the existing known coronaviruses similar to the conclusion made by holmes 9 interestingly the sars-cov genome has a very similar organization to that of group 3 avian coronaviruses ibv and tcv with the presence of three orfs within the m-n intergenic region two orfs spanning between the s and e genes 65 and a stem-loop motif s2m in 3 utr the presence of s2m and the finding that the 3 fragment of sars-cov rdrp clustered into group 3 in the phylogenetic analysis 39 suggest that the avian coronaviruses and the sars-cov might share a common ancestor which gained the s2m from a single rna horizontal transfer event from a non-related virus family as the astroviruses did 39 66 another possibility that a common coronavirus ancestor had once gained the motif but subsequently lost it except the group 3 and sars-cov cannot of course be excluded pairwise sequence homology search among the accessory orfs at the s-e intergenic region of the sars-cov and all other coronaviruses shows no significant sequence homology 12 13 14 but they are homologous within subgroups the orf 5a5b of group 3 coronaviruses and orfs 6-8 of the sars-cov are in a homologous location but they do not have any significant sequence homology the above results imply that although the sars-cov and group 3 coronaviruses have a very similar genome organization they might have acquired these accessory genes from several rna recombination events with different hosts or viral sources it is observed that the accessory orfs are group-specific but are usually truncated to a different extent within a subgroup figure 1 another interesting observation is the genetic diversity at the s-e intergenic region usually two or three group-specific orfs are found within this region of each subgroup but only one confirmed orf orf 3 is found in this region of the sars-cov genome 12 13 14 16 22 the diversity mainly due to truncation and deletion of these s-e intergenic orfs within the subgroups is higher than that of other accessory orfs their sequence divergence implies their common ancestors might have acquired these orfs by rna recombination which is a common phenomenon in large rna viruses 67 68 rather than evolved from mutations of a single ancestral rna sequence segment 9 typical examples are the acquirement of the he gene from influenza c 69 and recombination events with berne virus at the he-ns2 region 52 based on the recombination and truncation events occurring within these intergenic regions the phylogenetic relationship between the sars-cov and other group 3 coronaviruses has been reconstructed figure 2 at least four subgroup common ancestors  in figure 2 have acquired their s-e intergenic orfs and other group-specific orfs from several independent rna recombination events moreover there is a tendency of deletions or truncations of these orfs when crossing the species barriers within the subgroups eg orf 4ab in group 2 54 55 56 57 58 orf 3ab and orf 7ab in group 1 41 42 47 48 50 70 71 72 the deletions of these redundant accessory orfs are likely to be the result rather than the cause of crossing the host barriers as coronavirus host range specificity and tropism have been demonstrated at least in four studies 7 73 74 75 as determined by the receptorbinding domain of the spike glycoprotein recombination within certain types of viruses is a common phenomenon in various virus families 67 particularly for large rna viruses as a means of shedding the deleterious effects of the errors accumulated during its genome replication 68 recombination events within the coronavirus family 70 76 77 or with other non-related virus families 52 66 69 have been reported apparently the diversity of the redundant accessory genes has been accompanied by extensive genome rearrangement by heterogeneous or homogenous rna recombination events providing useful information for the taxonomy of the coronaviruses from this point of view the sars-cov is definitely a new and unique member of the coronavirus family the divergence of these redundant orfs between the sars-cov and other known coronaviruses suggests that the sars-cov might have been circulating in other animal hosts long before its emergence and somehow crossed into a human host several months ago either by a sudden bottleneck mutation event or a rna recombination event with unknown sources it has been demonstrated that the sars-cov possesses the ability to infect macaques which display symptoms similar to the clinical signs of sars patients 78 and to replicate in cats and ferrets 79 together with the evidence implied by the phylogenetic studies it is tempting to identify the possible animal reservoir of the coronavirus recent studies of domestic and wild animals in guangdong where the sars epidemic was first reported identified the existence of the sars-cov from several animals found in the livestock market including himalayan palm civets paguma larvata and raccoon dogs nyctereutes procyonoides ref 80 in spite of the failure of another group to identify any sars-cov after the screening of more than 60 animal species 81 the genome sequences of the coronaviruses isolated from these animals are almost identical 998 to that of the sars-cov revealing the extremely close phylogenetic relationship between them another major finding from the sequence analysis highlighted a 29-bp deletion upstream the n gene which was noted only in one guangdong isolate available from the gen-bank gd0l accession number 278489 such deletion leads to the fusion of the two orfs identified in mrna 8 into one orf yet its biological significance remains to be elucidated 8 comparison of the s gene nucleotide sequence of the animal and human sars-cov indicated 11 consistent nucleotide signature mutations that appeared to distinguish them the phylogenetic analysis of the s gene sequence between human and animal sars-cov likely ruled out the possibility that it is a consequence of human to animal transmission implying the infected animals may acquired the virus from a true animal source that has yet to be identified 80 this was also supported by the host-association analysis of coronaviruses based on the nucleocapsid gene 39 which pinpointed that host-shifts had played an important role in the evolution of the virus and the host the occurrence of avian-mammal host-shift supports the hypothesis that the sars-cov emerged from an unknown animal coronavirus the reverse genetics system a very useful tool in studying function of viral proteins and its mutations was firstly described by masters group 82 for mhv in coronaviridae in less than six months since the first identification of the sars-cov 2 yount et al
83 developed the reverse genetic systems for this coronavirus using the full-length cdna clone of urbani strain by combining six component clones spanning through the entire genome following in vitro transcription and the transfection of the resulting rna transcripts a rescued recombinant virus was found to be capable of replication in the same way as the wild type expected marker mutations introduced were also identified the success of the experiment offers hope for the development of attenuated strains of live vaccine against the sars-cov 9 there is considerable scientific interest in the identification of the genetic agents responsible for the unusual susceptibility of the sars-cov in some ethnic groups a molecular survey of the hla system a common method adopted to identify autoimmune disorders and emerging infectious diseases was conducted in taiwan during the sars epidemic 84 using pcr amplification plus sequencespecific oligonucleotide probing pcr-ssop researchers identified the hla genotype of sars patients healthy unrelated taiwanese were used as controls and the hla genotype of sars patients was compared with probable cases and with high-risk uninfected health care workers the results indicated that a higher frequency of hla-b4601 allele was found in severe sars cases which may explain the severity of sars in these patients such genotype as stated in the report is common in southern han chinese singaporeans and vietnamese but not in indigenous taiwanese there was no reported sars case within the latter ethnic group such findings may explain the unusual sars epidemic in south asia advances have been made in molecular diagnostic techniques in recent years and such rapid and sensitive methods allow efficient monitoring of infectious viral diseases for sars the first genetic fragment of the virus was generated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction rtpcr ref 2 two rt-pcr protocols were then developed by two who sars network laboratories httpwwwwhointcsrsarsprimersen the sensitivities of the assay were demonstrated to be at least 50 with the highest percentage found in throat swab specimens 85 no false positive was found in these assays the first rapid real-time assay was developed based on the most conserved region of the orf1b gene sequence 86 87 a person will be confirmed to be infected by the sars-cov if viral rna is detected by either the two pcr assays two aliquots of specimen or two sets of primers httpwwwcdcgovncidodsarsspecimencollectionsars2htm the second generation of this test protocol can detect the existence of the virus within 10 days after the onset of fever 87 88 89 and provides 80 sensitivity and 100 specificity in the testing of 50 npa samples collected from sars patients within three days after the onset of the disease 87 to further increase the sensitivity one-step real-time rt-pcr has been recently developed 89 specificity of the pcr can be enhanced by coupling it with the use of an additional amplification target using the virus n gene fragment 89 which is theoretically the most abundant subgenomic mrna produced during transcription 13 the technique provides information on viral load during anti-viral treatments in real time so that the efficacy of the therapy can be evaluated 10 however although the pcr assays are powerful their performance is also technically demanding and labor intensive 10 the development of microarray technology for viral discovery was firstly described by wang et al in 2002 90 the capability of the rapid high throughout screening of unknown viral pathogen gives it great potential to be used as a diagnostic tool in the identification of the sars-cov wang et al
11 employed the use of an improved microarray platform which comprised conserved 70mers from each of the 1000 viruses to characterize the coronavirus genome four hybridizing oligonucleotides from astroviridae which share the s2m motif and three from coronaviridae sharing conserved orf1ab fragment were firstly recognized in the experiment the sequence recovered from the surface of the microarray further confirmed that it is a member of the coronavirus family the identity of the sars-cov was confirmed within 24 hours and this feat was followed by the partial sequencing of the novel virus a few days later such technique demonstrated a rapid and accurate means of unknown virus characterization through genetic data virus isolation by cell culture is used extensively as a traditional technique in virology coronavirus presenting in the clinical specimens of sars patients was detected by inoculating the clinical specimens in cell cultures to allow the infection and the subsequent isolation of the virus fetal rhesus kidney frhk-4 ref 2 and vero cells 3 were found to be susceptible to sars-cov infection after the isolation procedure the pathogen was identified as the sars-cov by further tests such as electron microscopy rt-pcr or immunofluorescent viral antigen detection virus isolation is the only means to detect the existence of live virus from the tissue the methodology is generally employed only for a preliminary identification of an unknown pathogen as the procedure requires skillful technicians and is time consuming the requirement of infectious viruses and that the duration of live virus existence varies add on further problems for conducting such assays but they are nevertheless of very high specificity the n protein is usually chosen as the antigen for anticoronavirus antibody detection assay 91 92 as it is believed to be a predominant antigen of the sars-cov 35 36 it is also the only viral protein recognized by acute and early convalescent sera from patients recovering from sars 29 in addition to the n protein the s protein in the sars-cov was also reported as an antigen eliciting antibodies in human body 29 but at a much lower titer than that of the n protein 35 36 the assay based on the presence of sars-cov antibodies is suggested to be valid only for specimens obtained more than three weeks after the onset of fever 88 89 although some patients have detectable sars-cov antibodies within 14 days of the onset of illness nevertheless the negative result ie absence of sars-cov antibodies within the first three weeks cannot conclude that the patient is free of the virus though the elisa method was still defined as a good standard for rapid diagnosis of sars 85 seroconversion from negative to positive or a four-fold rise in antibody titer from acute to convalescent serum indicates recent infection httpwwwwhointcsrsarsdiagnostictestsen the epidemiology of sars has been extensively investigated since the outbreak of sars in november 2002 in guangdong 1 this traditional method was used to access the epidemiology of sars initially molecular epidemiology can be used to trace the disease transmission by using phylogenetic analysis of viral nucleotide sequence which can quickly identify and aid in monitoring the transmission 93 in coronavirus variations in the spike protein can drastically affect viral entry pathogenesis 94 antiviral immune response 29 virulence 95 cellular 6 or even species tropism 7 the s gene has been used as a target for genotyping most coronaviruses like human coronaviruses 96 and ibv 97 study of the n-terminal region of the sars-cov spike protein produced similar conclusions by conventional epidemiology methods 98 the investigation included the collection s1 gene sequences from sars patients in hong kong and guangdong during february-april 2003 mainly by direct sequencing of rt-pcr products derived from clinical specimens and compared it phylogenetically to additional 27 other sequences available from genbank the majority of the hong kong viruses including those from a large outbreak in a high-rise apartment block amoy garden clustered to a single index case that came from guangdong to hong kong in late february figure 3 most of the viruses derived from hong kong patients belong to the same lineage with viruses derived from the hong kong index case outbreaks in canada singapore taiwan and vietnam were also derived from the sars-cov of the same initial virus lineage as judged from the same phylogenetic analysis a number of viruses derived from the early patients were excluded from the major lineage and formed distinct cluster implying multiple introductions of the virus have occurred although these viruses did not caused large-scale outbreaks viral sequences identified in guangdong and beijing are genetically more diverse 1 98 implying that the sars-cov has been circulating there for a while before the introduction to hong kong the hong kong index case that initiated the first super-spreading incident to affect 12 other patients might be simply a matter of chance or the viruses found in that patient were contagious to initiate super-spreading events but these still need further investigations apart from findings that indicate the possible transmission routes transitional isolates that possess both the characteristics of two lineages were also identified ruan et al
99 and tsui et al
100 performed similar analysis based on the comparison of full genome sequences of different sars-cov isolates they independently identified some of the variations as guan et al
98 did chiu et al
101 have recently identified the nucleotide substitution in the s gene that is unique to the taiwan isolates and was linked to the hong kong index case sequence comparison of the amoy garden isolates revealed no significant variations within the s1 gene or across the whole genome implying that other non-viral factors may contribute to the abnormal transmission and clinical presentation of sars in this cluster of high-rise apartments 98 102 in summary the transmission route of the sars-cov in different countries and areas correlates well with the traditional epidemiological findings implying the successful application of molecular epidemiological techniques in tracing the virus transmission history concerning viral evolution zeng et al
103 have performed a linear regression analysis and tried to estimate the last appearance of the sars-cov common ancestor with such effort which has been successfully applied in timing of the ancestral sequence of human immunodeficiency virus hiv ref 104 the ancestral sequence is believed to have appeared last in late 2002 these preliminary findings provide important information for tracing the origin of the sars-cov and monitoring its spread current knowledge on coronavirus immunity has mainly been acquired from research on animal coronaviruses clinical observations have shown that humoral and cell-mediated immune responses may be both necessary against sars-cov infection 105 it was reported that t cell cd3 cd4 and cd8 depletion was observed in early infection but that levels returned to normal as the disease was improved 106 igg antibody could be detected at the 7th day after the onset of symptoms and kept at high titer at least three months 107 another report indicated that the virus was still detectable in respiratory and stool specimens by rt-pcr diagnosis but could not be cultured more than 40 days after presentation 108 implying that the antibody could be stimulated rapidly and might restrict the virus infection however it has also been reported in fowl and feline coronaviral diseases that low-level antibody may exacerbate diseases 109 it is therefore important to conduct further investigations into the immune response to sars patients in the future so as to benefit the vaccine development and disease control concerning the candidate target for vaccine development the s1 unit of the spike proteins has been identified as the host protective antigen and used as a vaccine candidate in other coronaviruses 110 an extensive structural analysis of the corresponding protein in sars is thus desirable with the identification of the sars-cov functional receptor 30 and the mapping of the receptor-binding domain on the spike protein 31 subunit vaccine targeting the receptorbinding domain and the preparation of killed or attenuated vaccine using ace2 expression cell line may be promising 30 antiviral drugs represent an alternative anti-sars strategy to vaccination inhibiting chemicals targeting the sars-cov replication-related proteins were considered as anti-sars-cov drug candidates eg inhibition the enzymatic activity of 3clpro an extensive structural analysis of 3clpro encoded from nsp5 on orf 1a was performed 28 111 the 3clpro structure showed a considerable degree of conservation of the substrate-binding sites with the evidence that it could retain its proteolytic activity upon tgev transmissible gastroenteritis virus main proteinase 111 though another group mentioned that the inactive property of the enzyme might exist in vitro
112 from this result these authors suggested that the use of rhinovirus 3cpro inhibitor might be useful in anti-sars therapy two months later a research group from the us conducted a study on the interaction of two chemicals kz7088 and the avlqsgfr octapeptide with 3clpro
113 further highlighting the importance of the main proteinase as a target for anti-viral drug design fan et al
114 provided valuable additional information and concluded that only the dimeric form of the 3clpro is active and that the proteinase-substrate interaction can be speeded up if more beta-sheet-like structure is involved in the substrate recently the crystal structure of 3clpro was reported by yang et al
115 the 3clpro crystal underwent conformational changes under different ph conditions while complexing with the specific inhibitor at the same time a serine-protease fold with a cys-his at the active site was recognized on the other hand the modeling of the structure of 20-o-mt domain located at nsp16 was proposed by von grotthuss et al
116 using the 3d jury system with high reliability 3d jury score 100 the conservation of the unique tetrad residues k-d-k-e of the domain assigned a proposed mrna cap methylation function of this domain suggesting an alternative target for anti-viral drug design in addition to main proteases blocking the virus entry should be considered as well structural analysis of the s2 domain of the sars-cov s protein which plays a role in fusion of the virus with host cell revealed a conservation of sequence motifs with the wellstudied gp41 protein of hiv-1 and other viruses with class i transmembrane domain 27 such a structure may be another target for drug design the collaborative efforts of the global scientific community have provided invaluable insights into the molecular biology of the sars-cov the development of a rapid and accurate method of diagnosis based on the molecular findings has helped to identify sars patients at an early stage of the disease thereby providing valuable information for national authorities to monitor the spread of the disease and take effective quarantine measures and contributing to the understanding of the clinical presentations of the syndrome the elucidation of the molecular biology of the sars-cov has provided a foundation for vaccine design and narrowed down the targets for large-scale high throughput drug screening program for anti-viral therapy these advances helped the global community to contain the spread of sars within four months since its first identification however much remains to be discovered about this novel coronavirus and it may yet pose a serious threat unlike other recently identified viral diseases like ebola and west nile virus it seems the transmission of sars-cov does not need a visible vector for spreading and that a tiny invisible respiratory droplet is sufficient to infect another person 117 the nearly undetectable symptom presented by the recently confirmed sars case in singapore suggests that the virus may continue to circulate undetectably 65 the possibility that common domestic animals are also a virus reservoir for sars further complicates the struggle to contain and ultimately eradicate this disease in these aspects sensitive accurate and rapid diagnosis plays an extremely important role in limiting the disease spread especially in the developing world and densely populated countries luckily the aggressive quarantine measures imposed by the who proved to be effective in containing the outbreak and the experience gained in the last sars outbreak has prepared us to face another outbreak with some confidence nevertheless nobody can predict exactly when an effective vaccine or anti-viral drug will be developed all that can be said is that based on our growing knowledge of the molecular epidemiology and evolution of the virus the successful development of countermeasures to sars is very possible  title stability of sars-cov-2 phylogenies yatish turakhia bryan thornlow landen gozashti angie hinrichs s jason fernandes d david haussler russell corbett-detig  the sars-cov-2 pandemic has led to unprecedented nearly real-time genetic tracing due to the rapid community sequencing response researchers immediately leveraged these data to infer the evolutionary relationships among viral samples and to study key biological questions including whether host viral genome editing and recombination are features of sars-cov-2 evolution this global sequencing effort is inherently decentralized and must rely on data collected by many labs using a wide variety of molecular and bioinformatic techniques there is thus a strong possibility that systematic errors associated with lab-specific practices affect some sequences in the repositories we find that some recurrent mutations in reported sars-cov-2 genome sequences have been observed predominantly or exclusively by single labs co-localize with commonly used primer binding sites and are more likely to affect the protein coding sequences than other similarly recurrent mutations we show that their inclusion can affect phylogenetic inference on scales relevant to local lineage tracing and make it appear as though there has been an excess of recurrent mutation andor recombination among viral lineages we suggest how samples can be screened and problematic mutations removed we also develop tools for comparing and visualizing differences among phylogenies and we show that consistent clade-and tree-based comparisons can be made between phylogenies produced by different groups these will facilitate evolutionary inferences and comparisons among phylogenies produced for a wide array of purposes building on the sars-cov-2 genome browser at ucsc we present a toolkit to compare analyze and combine sars-cov-2 phylogenies find and remove potential sequencing errors and establish a widely shared stable clade structure for a more accurate scientific inference and discourse a2 - a2a  we wish to thank all groups that responded rapidly by producing these invaluable and essential sequence data their contributions have enabled an unprecedented lightning-fast process of scientific discovery---truly an incredible benefit for humanity and for the scientific community we emphasize that most lab groups with whom we associate specific suspicious alleles are also those who have produced the most sequence data at a time when it was urgently needed we commend their efforts we have already contacted each group and many have updated their sequences our goal with this work is not to highlight potential errors but to understand the impacts of these and other kinds of highly recurrent mutations so as to identify commonalities among the suspicious examples that can improve sequence quality and analysis going forward extremely rapid whole genome sequencing has enabled nearly real-time tracing of the evolution of the sars-cov-2 pandemic 1 2 3 4 5  by leveraging sequence data produced by labs throughout the world researchers can trace transmission of the virus across human populations 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14  typically viral evolution is encapsulated by a phylogenetic tree relating all of the virus samples in a large set to one another 5 15 16 17 18 19  however despite efforts to mitigate the impact of sequencing and assembly errors and to provide standardized datasets for real-time analysis 20  inferred phylogenetic histories of the outbreak often differ between analyses of different research groups results and these inferred histories sometimes differ between analyses performed by the same group with different data  eg 31 different nextstrain trees produced between 323 and 430 results these differences may be created or accentuated when samples that contain unidentified sequencing errors are incorporated into the phylogenetic tree defining stable and easily referenced major clades of the virus is essential for epidemiological studies of viral population dynamics 17 18  an understanding of how errors might be affecting the trees that are being published is essential to achieving that goal  figure 1  pictorial representation of how the evolutionary histories of viral sequences long black lines adjacent to tree nodes can be traced on a phylogenetic tree using mutational events green and blue circles that occur in this case each

leaves 4  5  large boxes group together subgroups based on inferred first mutation it can be difficult to distinguish sequencing errors of different types from genuine transmitted and non-transmitted mutations in genome sequences taking a conservative approach many researchers remove mutations that are observed only once during the evolution of the virus when constructing a phylogenetic tree as these may be more likely to be errors 21 22  or non-transmitted mutations however systematic errors where the same error from a common source is introduced many times in otherwise distinct viral genome sequences are not removed by that approach 23 24  these are more problematic as they can appear as if they are genuine transmitted mutations  figure 1  this might result from recurring errors in data generation or processing or due to contamination among samples each case induces an apparent mutation that may be challenging to rectify with the real structure of the viral tree consequently systematic errors can produce support for erroneous relationships between viral isolates and destabilize tree-building efforts one possible approach is to mask out specific sites in the genome sequence where recurring errors are suspected as suggested previously 24  however genuine recurrent mutations that may contain important information about properties of viral evolution 6 8 25 26 27 are sometimes hard to distinguish from recurrent systematic errors and this could obscure important biology here we present data that we hope will help the community make the important decision as to how to treat potential errors in sars-cov-2 genome sequences in addition to their influence on phylogenetic inference recurrent systematic errors can also lead to erroneous inferences about viral mutation processes recombination and selection for example artefactual biases in mutational processes could confound signatures of mutational hotspots 28 29 30 31 32 33  the issue of whether or not recombination has occurred during the outbreak is critical to the immunological battle against the virus and is under intense debate 6 34 35 36 37 38 39 40  because many tests of recombination assume that all mutations can only occur once at each site recurrent mutation and systematic errors can confound signatures of recombination 6 26 35  finally recurrent mutations have been identified as a possible signatures of elevated mutation rates and natural selection in sars-cov-2 8 13 24 25 26 29 33 35 41  but some of these apparent instances of selection may be due systematic errors in the sequences confusion about recurrent mutations and recombination affects our understanding of host response and influences our decisions about which viral molecular processes or specific immune epitopes we might want to target in vaccine development thus it is essential that we explore the possible extent and impact of systematic errors in the viral genome sequences another basic problem in current investigations of viral evolution is widespread phylogenetic uncertainty in part this has prevented the community from settling on a consensus definition of distinct viral clades subtypes groups lineages representing the early divergence events producing a tower of babel problem in the scientific discourse 17 42  furthermore many groups are making phylogenetic trees with widely varying goals including dissecting patterns of nucleotide substitution recurrent mutation local lineage tracing and large-scale phylogenomics 8 17 26  the resulting topologies vary dramatically in structure owing to differences in analysis choices and to phylogenetic uncertainty stemming from limited genetic diversity in the expanding viral populations consistent approaches for identifying commonalities and rectifying differences among trees are therefore foundational to the efforts to characterize viral evolution and epidemiology a maximally stable topology will be essential for consistent nomenclature and facilitating conversations between analyses 17 42  our work takes on these two interrelated considerations systematic errors and phylogenetic uncertainty first we show that hundreds of samples in the current sars-cov-2 sequencing datasets are affected by lab-associated mutations which are potentially erroneous see also 24  these mutations distort phylogenetic inferences at scales most relevant to local lineage tracing and impact inferred patterns of mutational recurrence and recombination we demonstrate that many can be identified and removed by cross-referencing patterns of recurrence against the source sequencing lab and we provide automated methods for detecting suspicious and highly recurrent mutations second to facilitate communication and comparison across different sars-cov-2 phylogenies we develop approaches for efficiently comparing and visualizing differences among trees all of the tools and functionality that we describe here are publicly available and integrated into the ucsc genome browser to facilitate rapid visualization data exploration and cross referencing among datasets and analyses we anticipate that these methods will fuel more accurate continued discovery during the current pandemic and beyond nextstrain datasets our analyses are built in large part on the work of nextstrain 15  this team has already implemented a number of precautions to remove problematic sites and samples in particular they remove samples that are too divergent from others or whose date of sampling is inconsistent with the number of accumulated mutations additionally all indels in the resulting multiple alignment are masked here we do not consider the impact of alternative multiple alignments upstream filtering methods or the possible impacts of indels each of these factors has the potential to affect downstream analyses and should be considered carefully for our purposes we anticipate that nextstrains filters will minimize idiosyncratic errors and should be retained in the majority of future analyses here we use as a primary example 31 different nextstrain trees from days between 3232020 and 4302020 we focused in particular on the dataset from 4192020 which contains 3246 variants in total methods the vast majority of variants are at low frequency as is expected for a rapidly expanding population non-random errors can present a fundamental challenge for phylogenetic inference and to the interpretation of viral evolutionary dynamics there are at least four possible sources of real or apparent mutations that recur within independent lineages in a tree and each makes distinct predictions about the source of recurrent mutations table 1  in particular recent work has shown a strong bias towards cu mutation in the sars-cov-2 genome 21 42 43 44  systematic errors which usually result from consistent errors in molecular biology techniques or bioinformatic data data processing need not reflect this bias and are not subject to natural selection we therefore anticipate that many systematic errors will affect many mutation types modify protein sequences and strongly correlate with genome sequences generated in particular labs 24  heritable many apparently recurrent mutations found in the sars-cov-2 genome to examine patterns of recurrent mutation we employ a simple statistic the parsimony score which is the count of the minimum number of unique mutation events consistent with a tree and sample genotypes  45 46 computed using our software from httpsgithubcomyatishtstrainphylogenetics  methods more sophisticated statistics could be employed but this simple one is effective is readily interpretable and can be computed rapidly we restrict most analysis to bi-allelic sites ie sites that contain one the allele in the reference genome from the root of the tree here and in nextstrain this is wuhan-hu-1 obtained in december 2019 in the city of wuhan and a single alternate allele across the 4192020 nextstrain tree we found 2533 395 94 40 and 44 bi-allelic sites with parsimony score one two three four and five or more respectively  figure 2  figure s1  in particular there is a strong on diagonal component of the data that is defined by a linear relationship between the log of the alternate allele count and parsimony score dashed line in figure 2a  log2-based slope  3188 these mutations reoccur across the phylogeny at exceptional rates relative to their allele frequencies hereafter we refer to the set of variants in this on-diagonal group as extremal sites blue red and orange in figure 2a  this relationship suggests that the extreme accumulation of independent clades for the alternate allele is logarithmically related to the number of instances of the alternate allele in the phylogeny  figure 2b  this suggests that even the most mutable or error prone sites in the genome will sometimes have alternate alleles grouped into clades during phylogenetic inference thereby appearing to be inherited the relationship between alternate allele count and parsimony score point radius indicates how many sites share a single parsimony score and alternate allele count several noteworthy recurrent mutations are labelled note that the x-axis is log-scaled b the sizes of independent clades for the same alternate allele arranged in descending order the number of lineages per clade is shown on logarithmic scale facilitating comparison with panel a these data indicate that when alternate allele clade sizes for a given site are sorted in decreasing order their sizes are reduced going from left to right by a multiplicative factor at each step consistent with the log-linear relationship displayed in panel a mutations with remarkably high recurrence are shown with color reflecting their properties lab-associated red recurrent and associated with a poly-u stretch blue and high frequency with many forward and backward mutations purple grey lines in the background are the same values but for all other mutations with parsimony score 4 or greater the values in parentheses in the mutation names indicate the number of unique clades associated with the alternate allele note that in some cases this extends beyond the limit of the x-axis and that the y-axis is log-scaled for visibility c an example of the observed patterns of evolution at one highly recurrent site with reference allele u and alternate allele g site 13402 and parsimony score 14 where 14 alternate allele clades in red each represent an apparently independent incidence of the mutation substituting the alternate allele lab-association is a straightforward indication that we use below to identify highly suspect mutations in the sars-cov-2 genome however hypermutable sites might also impact phylogenetic reconstruction for similar reasons as systematic errors we therefore sought to provide researchers with a method for rapidly identifying and flagging suspiciously recurrent mutations we therefore developed code to identify the on diagonal extremal sites and produce plots of the output similar to figure 2  that is available at httpsgithubcomyatishtstrainphylogenetics  note that depending on the dataset this component is not always so linear as in figure 2  but it is associated with highly homoplastic sites regardless  eg figure s1  our list of extremal sites includes two that we later show are strongly lab-associated a4050c and u13402g three mutations that are adjacent to 5bp poly-u segments in the genome c11074u g11083u and c21575u as well as two more cu mutations c21711u c28887u regardless of their proximate causes highly recurrent mutations can negatively impact the accuracy of inferred tree topologies and thus should be removed prior to phylogenetic tree construction and for many subsequent analyses to search for systematic errors associated with a particular lab we extracted the set of sites with parsimony score 4 or more we then flagged sites as lab-associated mutations if more than 80 of the samples containing the alternate allele were generated by a single group using this heuristic approach we found 16 such sites table s1  we note that this set of sites contains two mutations previously identified as lab-associated mutations 24  some others identified as highly homoplastic 8 24 25 42  as well as several identified as evidence for recombination 26  these mutations in lab-associated sites display a range of base compositions and only one is a cu transition c6255u this rate of cu mutation is much less than the genome-wide average rate of cu mutation for non-singleton sites 49 p  00004914 fishers exact test and differs significantly from the rate of cu mutation among our set of highly recurrent mutations that are not strongly associated with a single sequencing lab p  1005e-07 fishers exact test furthermore our set of lab-associated mutations is weakly enriched for protein altering mutations relative to other highly recurrent mutations p  009372 collectively our results suggest that some recurrent mutations among these 16 could be lab-associated systematic errors the potential causes of lab-associated mutations are numerous a non-exhaustive list follows first primers for reverse transcription or pcr might introduce systematic errors either via errant priming because they overwrite true variation or because of errors during bioinformatic processing for example the commonly used artic primer sets amplify the viral genome from metatranscriptomic cdna by tiling the viral genome with pcr amplicons  httpsarticnetwork  second if a portion perhaps a single amplicon from a contaminating sample were present in many sequencing reactions from a single lab this could propagate variants across all genome sequences from a single group third contamination from the human transcriptome itself might be inadvertently included in assembled viral genomes two labs contributed a disproportionate number of lab-associated mutations in our dataset suggesting a consistent source of these alternate alleles table s1  one lab group is strongly associated with two adjacent high parsimony score mutations a24389c and g24390c these occur in a 10bp sequence that otherwise closely resembles an oxford nanopore sequencing adapter cagca cc tt and is adjacent to an artic primer binding site here the differences between the genome sequence and adapter are bolded  see also 24  where a commenter on that work comes to a similar conclusion regarding the likely source of these mutations additionally a4050c u8022g u13402g and a13947u  figure 2  table s1  are associated with this same lab and either overlap or are within 10bp of artic primer binding sites 14leftalt4 26right 44right and 47left respectively suggesting that a consistent bioinformatics data processing error may be responsible sequences submitted by another lab group are strongly associated with four additional high parsimony score mutations g2198a g3145u a3778g and c6255u  figure 2  table s1  here again each of these intersects one of the artic primer binding sites 8left 11left 13left and 20right respectively figure 3  in aggregate our set of lab-associated mutations are significantly closer to artic primer binding sites than would be expected by chance p  00283 permutation test figure 3  our results therefore suggest that mutations intersecting or immediately surrounding commonly used primer binding sites should be subjected to particular scrutiny another lab-associated mutation c22802g also overlaps an artic primer 76left  table s1  but the ultimate source is unrelated in this case that would not be possible because these sars-cov-2 genomes were assembled from whole metatranscriptomic data without pcr selection instead the cause appears to be misalignment of a human ribosomal rna sequence that was incorporated into the consensuses for a subset of genomes produced by this group dr darrin lemmer pers comm  this highlights the broad range of possible causes of lab-associated mutations it is more challenging to identify the specific sources of the other five lab-associated mutations that we observed but commonalities are informative three of these mutations are associated with a single group and each is a gu transversion g3564u g8790u g24933u table s1  even more strikingly each mutation occurs in a ggu motif suggesting a common molecular mechanism might underlie this set of lab-associated mutations as well  ie ggu  guu one possible hint is that this group uses a transposase-based library preparation method which is relatively uncommon among sars-cov-2 sequencing groups and might explain this unique signature beyond these g1149u and u153g are associated with two different sequencing groups but do not show similar signatures as other variants table s1  more generally the fact that many recurrent mutations are associated with genome sequences produced by individual lab groups suggests that consistent data processing or generation issues affect many sites for example sample contamination which can be quite challenging to confidently detect might also contribute to mutational recurrence and might not strongly be lab-associated text s1 however we caution that this does not definitively prove that these apparent mutations are errors but we believe it is prudent to remove these sites for most analyses until additional sequencing corroborates them to study how systematic errors affect phylogenetic inference and inferred properties of viral evolution we experimentally introduced errors in replicate experiments we found that the parsimony score displays a roughly linear relationship with the log of the alternate allele count as it does for extremal sites in nextstrain trees we examined built on different days in april but with varying slope figure 4  this is expected because errors will sometimes occur in sample genomes whose positions are close on the real phylogeny and even in sister lineages tree-building methods could then group these samples into a single clade importantly the effect of drawing samples together can cause systematic error or hypermutable sites for that matter to appear heritable additionally we find that viral genetic background and mutation type is an important contributor to this relationship when errors are placed randomly across australian samples  figure 4a  we see much higher parsimony scores than when errors are placed only in samples from france collected between march 1 and march 17  figure 4b  the difference likely reflects the fact that the samples from france are more closely related because many of the lab-associated mutations that we identified are derived from a similarly restricted time and geographic region as our samples from france parsimony scores at those sites closely resemble these sets of simulated error  figure 4b  this suggests that the identification of lab-associated mutations will become increasingly straightforward as the viral populations accumulate genetic diversity we also observe that mutations that truly occur less often during sars-cov-2 evolution  eg c to g have slightly lower parsimony scores this is likely due to modelling nucleotide-specific mutation rates during tree-building where mutations consistent with viral mutational processes are less likely to be erroneously grouped importantly our results suggest that a simple heuristic based on each sites parsimony score and recurrence is sufficient to identify most lab-associated mutations above very low frequencies however extremely infrequent lab-associated error could be challenging to distinguish from more conventional sequencing error because systematic errors also affect the inferred tree they can impact inferred patterns of mutational recurrence at other positions in the genome as well in 50 out of 54 total experiments where we introduced a single recurrent error we found that the parsimony score increased at other sites range 2 to 44 this emphasizes the importance of identifying and excluding such mutations prior to inferring the final tree and downstream analyses corresponding clade sizes arranged in descending order for error simulations in a-c respectively as in figure 2b  correlated lab-associated mutations have large impacts on phylogenetic inference if infrequent but highly correlated errors were introduced at different sites in many samples this could cause more samples to be grouped into a clade we might not easily detect these errors based on recurrence two lab-associated mutations a24389c and g24390c are not just on adjacent genomic locations but are nearly perfectly correlated across samples these sites have low parsimony scores when compared to other lab-associated mutations 4 and 5 respectively figure 4c  when we introduced similar correlated errors we found that the parsimony scores were lower than in single error introduction experiments nonetheless in only two error introduction experiments out of 9 with 10 affected samples did we see a parsimony score as low as 3 although low frequency and highly correlated error could be challenging to identify in general we believe this is infrequent in our dataset see text s2 therefore we have not included tests for correlated errors in our suggested methods for finding lab-associated mutations but adjacent correlated sites should be carefully scrutinized to investigate the impacts of lab-specific mutations on phylogenetic inference we removed masked each of the 16 sites with a lab-associated mutation table s1  importantly removing lab-associated mutations sometimes impacted phylogenetic patterns at other sites for example after removing all lab-associated mutations the evidence for back-mutations at c14408u is eliminated while many forward-mutations remain  eg  figure 5  in fact the parsimony score changed for 107 sites and decreased for 53 sites on the tree that we inferred after removing all of the lab-associated mutations relative to the tree inferred including all sites additionally we find that many samples containing lab-associated mutations have been repositioned on local topologies  eg figure 5  furthermore in some cases the placement of closely related lineages that are unaffected by lab-associated mutations is also affected  figure  s2  these mutations therefore affect phylogenetic inferences at scales relevant to local lineage tracing which may obscure dynamics of local transmission part of the tree we inferred from the 4192020 nextstrain dataset left compared to the corresponding part of tree after removal of sites with lab-associated mutation right lab-associated mutations red can affect the inferred phylogeny and are associated with apparent back-mutation to the ancestral allele grey in column 14408 left at other sites white when lab-associated mutations are removed the resulting tree right shows no evidence for back-mutation at those sites now white in column 14408 though several independent forward mutations remain evident to examine the effect of each lab-associated mutation and the other extremal sites in isolation from one another we individually masked each site and inferred a phylogeny as a comparison we also masked a set of sites that have similar alternate allele frequencies as the lab-associated mutations but each has a parsimony score of one the distributions of entropy-weighted total distance a measure of distance between trees described below are remarkably similar when masking individual lab-associated sites other extremal sites and our control sites  figure 6  most exceed the distance we observed when we independently inferred two trees from the same input alignment dashed black line our results therefore suggest that the lab-associated and extremal sites can impact tree-building approaches on par with real mutations although the effects are typically small on the scale of whole topologies as is expected given their typically low allele frequencies  figure 6  figure s3  phylogenies made after removing two mutations one control and one lab-associated are outliers for entropy-weighted total distance  figure 6  figure s4  and other tree distance statistics  figure s3  in each case however the likelihood of the tree produced from the full dataset is actually higher table s5  suggesting that our tree-building method discovered a different locally optimal but less favorable topology rather than a dramatic impact of each site individually these results suggest higher level uncertainty in the tree topology largely independent of the effects of lab-associated mutations figure 6  the relationship between alternate allele frequencies of lab-associated mutations and effect of masking on inferred tree topology entropy-weighted total distances relative to the reference maximum likelihood phylogeny are shown for phylogenies constructed after masking individual sites blue points correspond to sites with lab-specific alternate alleles grey points correspond to control sites with parsimony scores of 1 and similar alternate allele frequencies to the sites with lab-specific alternate alleles and brown points correspond to non-lab-specific extremal sites the black horizontal line indicates the entropy-weighted total distance value for a maximum likelihood phylogeny constructed from an alignment identical to that of the reference phylogeny two outliers c21590u control and g1149u lab-associated have outsize effects on inferred tree topology hypermutation rather than positive selection may explain many remaining highly recurrent sites previous analyses showed that the rate of cu mutation is exceptionally high relative to other mutation types in the viral genome 10 25 43 47  this class of mutations should show increased evidence of recurring multiple times because they experience elevated mutation rates 25  indeed parsimony scores at sites containing cu mutations are significantly higher than those for all other mutation types p  22e-16 wilcoxon test figure 7  furthermore parsimony scores at cu sites also significantly exceed those at ga p  5993e-12 as well as uc p  1407e-10 sites this mutational bias might be driven by apobec editing of the viral genome 25 43 44 47 48 49  consistent with previous results 43 44 47 48 49  we find that 5-uacu mutation more frequently than 5-cgcu p  00501 but we do not see a similar effect for 3 flanking sites at 5-cuua relative to 5-cugc mutations p  0378 the highly biased spectrum of cu mutations and the correlation with local sequence context implies that the plus-stranded virus biology may be leading to recurrent cu mutations 47  of the 83 highly recurrent mutations with parsimony greater than three 50 are bi-allelic not strongly lab-associated and have an alternate allele frequency less than 001 of these 42 are cu mutations this is a significant excess of cu mutations relative to the rate among non-singleton bi-allelic sites with parsimony score three or fewer p  3658e-07 fishers exact test additionally cu mutations that do not affect the underlying amino acid sequences display higher parsimony scores than do cu mutations that do affect amino acid sequences p  00553 wilcoxon test figure 7  this suggests that negative selection has played a role in shaping the distribution of highly recurrent mutations by purging strongly deleterious alleles evidence suggests that any contribution of sequencing error to the excess of cu mutation is small alternate alleles at 814 of sites with parsimony greater than 3 are corroborated by more than one sequencing technology of those 77 of bi-allelic sites are cu transitions table s2  illumina ct errors in raw sequence reads are typically enriched in the contexts of flanking g regions 50 51  but here we do not see this pattern similarly nanopore sequencing typically creates errors in homopolymer stretches 52  but we only see a few recurrent mutations associated with such regions notable exceptions are the extremal sites c11074u and c 21575u which abut poly-u stretches in the genome and might result from replication slippage see also g11083u it is possible that the excess of cu mutations are driven in part by high error rates during reverse transcription 53 54 55 56  which is required for cdna sequencing however cu mutation is overrepresented in high frequency mutations as well 920 frequency  0025 mutations are cu table s3  indicating that this bias likely reflects a true mutational process additionally these mutations are approximately as distant from artic primer binding sites as we would expect by chance p  07851 permutation test table s2  collectively our results suggest that neither library preparation or sequencing error is not the major driving force behind biased cu mutation observed at highly recurrent mutations that are not strongly associated with a single lab however even if real the existence of these highly recurrent mutations does not require that they are heritable it must be that many viral mutations are never transmitted in which case their phylogenetic behavior should be the same as systematic errors  we proposed a simple heuristic approach to detect lab-associated mutations to briefly reiterate here first we identify sites that experience mutations on at least four independent branches of the sars-cov-2 tree and then we extract the set where 80 or more of the alternate allele comes from sequences produced by a single lab these are classified as lab-associated recurrent mutations then for all sites we plot parsimony score versus log2 of alternate allele count and determine a set of extremal sites as described in methods we recommend that lab-associated and most extremal mutations be masked for the purposes of constructing a phylogenetic tree to be used in downstream analyses one exception here is extremal site 11083 which is sufficiently high frequency that it affects inference of the deepest branches of the tree we suggest that it should be included during phylogenetic inference however alternative masking strategies that remove small clades containing apparent forward and backwards mutations at high frequency sites might also be effective and will be investigated going forward many downstream analyses following tree-building should consider masking 11083 as well after masking the set of lab-associated and extremal sites the samples which previously contained them can be retained in phylogenetic inference and downstream analyses tracks identifying these sites are available on the ucsc genome browser and in table s1  though not a focus here we emphasize that filtering for genomic regions that are difficult to assemble or align  eg those used by nextstrain to filter the ends of chromosomes as defined here httpsgithubcomnextstrainncov  should also be rigorously employed in fact in light of our discovery of a possible lab-associated mutation at position 153 which is just within the usual filtering range we suggest that it may be preferable to simply mask the full 5 and 3 utr regions which are typically harder to assemble and align confidently to examine the aggregate effect of lab-associated and extremal mutations we inferred a tree for the full dataset and another after masking all lab-associated and extremal mutations except 11083 using iq-tree 2 with 1000 ultrafast bootstraps 57 58  we then collapsed all branches that do not contain a mutation into a polytomy in contrast to the single site masking experiments above here the topologies of the two maximum likelihood consensus trees differ significantly the symmetric entropy-weighted total distance between the two topologies is not large 94  but the fit to the multiple alignment having masked these sites improved by 189 log-likelihood units relative to the tree inferred without lab-associated and extremal mutations below we show that confident relationships at higher branches in the topology are minimally affected relative to other widely-used phylogenies which were inferred including lab-associated and extremal mutations our phylogeny produced following these masking recommendations is available from the ucsc genome browser figure 8  and we will update and maintain this resource as we add new data as other suspicious mutations are identified and as improved masking recommendations are developed many of the most intriguing and evolutionarily relevant biological phenomena such as viral recombination and recurrent mutation explicitly require inferences based on homoplastic mutations special caution is clearly warranted for these analyses it is still necessary to mask lab-associated mutations and extremal sites because they can destabilize phylogenetic inference but clearly one could not exclude all homoplasies in light of significant phylogenetic uncertainty which we address below we recommend that each analysis be repeated across alternative possible tree topologies to confirm the robustness of biological inferences however this is not without significant challenges and the most general solution for confirming recurrent mutation or recombination is heritability if a mutant or recombinant lineage grows sufficiently large and is corroborated by many labs we can be much more confident 26  we therefore suggest that evidence of heritability and independent sequence confirmation should be required to support inferences of either recurrent mutation or recombination exploring data quality and mutational recurrence using our tools sars-cov-2 sequence data is growing at an incredible pace here we developed tools to enable investigations of similar patterns in updated and additional datasets to summarize 1 we provide a method for rapidly computing parsimony scores to identify highly recurrent positions 2 we provide an approach for identification of unusually recurrent sites relative to their allele frequencies here termed extremal 3 we provide an approach for semi-automated metadata correction see methods which improved detection of lab-associated mutations and 4 we provide a method for identifying the set of highly homoplastic mutations that are strongly associated with individual sequencing labs our heuristic cutoffs appear to perform well in the datasets we examined but the program is designed to empower users to explore other datasets and other filters as well software to perform each analysis are provided via github  httpsgithubcomlgozashtcovid-19-lab-specific-bias-filter and httpsgithubcomyatishtstrainphylogenetics  visualizing data quality genetic variation and correlation via the ucsc sars-cov-2 genome browser data visualization remains one of the most powerful mechanisms for identifying unusual patterns and possible errors in genome sequence data  eg figure 3  above therefore as an integral part of this work we provide powerful data exploration and visualization tools that can be applied to future variation datasets as well output from our programs for computing parsimony scores and detecting lab-association mutations can be imported directly into the ucsc sars-cov-2 genome browser 59 as custom tracks to facilitate visual exploration of suspect mutations with a user defined vcf file and tree this is a very useful visualization framework for data quality control and for investigating the root causes of highly recurrent mutation for example it is straightforward to explore the relationships between phylogeny genetic variation and functional genomic annotations figure 8  figure 8  ucsc genome browser view of all lab-associated mutations in the context of parsimony scores alternate allele frequencies the full genetic variation dataset with phylogenetic tree constructed after removing lab-associated and extremal mutations this genetic variation data can be cross-referenced against many other diverse datasets available in the ucsc sars-cov-2 genome browser interactive view httpgenomeucscedussarscov2labassocmutsall researchers can upload their own aligned sars-cov-2 genome samples and phylogenetic trees to the sars-cov-2 genome browser in order to compare their phylogenetic analysis to those from nextstrain and cog-uk and also to look at the specific molecular features of the clades that their phylogenetic analysis identifies text s4 these molecular features include widely used primer pairs as in figure 3  as well as crispr guides predicted and validated epitopes for cd4 and cd8 t-cells key functional sites on the viral genome including cleavage sites for viral proteases pl-pro and 3cl-pro as well as cleavage sites for host proteases locations of important rna secondary structures the locations of the transcriptional regulatory sequences locations of protein phosphorylation and glycosylation sites identification of sites in the virus that are highly conserved or rapidly evolving in closely related viruses in bats and other mammals as well as a lively crowd-sourced annotation set where any researcher can point out additional sites on the viral genome of special functional diagnostic or therapeutic significance 59  this helps researchers to quickly determine if alternate alleles they believe characterize a new viral clade may be significant beyond their role as epidemiological markers instructions for producing custom genome-browser tracks for a given phylogeny and variation dataset are provided in text s4 in the second part of this work we address concerns arising from phylogenetic uncertainty as expected for a relatively slowly-evolving and rapidly expanding viral population 60  there is substantial uncertainty in the sars-cov-2 phylogeny this extends well beyond the typically localized impacts of lab-associated and highly recurrent mutations and instead derives from the fact that most branches in the sars-cov-2 phylogeny are supported by few mutations undoubtedly thousands of unique phylogenies will be produced by groups studying this viral outbreak and these may sometimes support conflicting evolutionary relationships we therefore sought to provide tools to facilitate interpretation of commonalities and differences among such large phylogenies a tree comparison algorithm using entropy-weighted matching splits there are many metrics for measuring the total distance between two or more phylogenetic trees 61 62 63 64 65 66  one popular metric maximum cluster distance mcdist also identifies the best-matching clades between the two trees a clade in a rooted tree splits the leaf nodes of that tree into two sets those inside the clade and those outside the clade given a clade c in tree t and a clade c in tree t the split distance between c and c is the number of leaves that have to be moved so that the split for c in t becomes equal to the split for c in t the nonsymmetric correspondence between the clades of t and the clades of t established by minimizing the split distance is referred to as the maximum cluster alignment or best split alignment from t to t 61  this is particularly appealing here because we aim to facilitate comparisons across phylogenetic trees both globally and at individual clades we implemented a modified version of mcdist in httpsgithubcomyatishtstrainphylogenetics to compare two trees t and t both restricted to the same set of samples with two improvements first we proportionally weighted the split distance between each clade c of t to the best matching clade in t by the entropy of c ie by hp  -p log 2 p -1-p log 2 1-p where p is the fraction of leaves from t that are in c see methods figure 9  the entropy-weighted matching split distance emphasizes the importance of the clades in t in terms of how much information about the leaves they carry which helps highlight clades where the most dramatic changes have occured the sum over all clades in t of the entropy-weighted matching split distance to the best-matching clade in t is referred to as entropy-weighted total distance from t to t second we label all internal branches in t and t and identify the most similar branches in both trees based on the clades they define when multiple branches in t match the branch b in t with the same best split distance we report all best-matching branches methods additionally we confirmed that our statistic is a robust measure of tree distance judging by the strong correlation with other frequently used tree distance metrics text s3 our implementation can compute this statistic for two trees of size 10000 leaves in just 20 minutes on a single cpu so it scales to the large trees required for sars-cov-2 phylogenetics the split distance statistic for each t node see methods for notation split distance of each t split branch from all t splits plus a garbage node  containing a null set of leaves with the matching split distance and its corresponding t split branch for each t split branch highlighted in red multiple t splits can match a t split but the garbage node is given precedence as is the case in t branch 4 c table showing the entropy best-matching t branches matching split distance and entropy-weighted matching split distance for each branch in t as well as the entropy-weighted total distance dtt between t and t a tanglegram is the most often used method of visualizing the topological difference between two rooted phylogenetic trees defined on the same set of leaf taxa here termed samples 67  we expect that tanglegrams will have a wide use for analyzing and comparing different sars-cov-2 phylogenies tanglegrams plot two trees side-by-side with their common leaves connected by straight lines  eg figure s5  for visually appealing and informative tanglegrams clades in both trees are arranged in a similar vertical order given the tree topology constraints with minimum crossing of connecting lines with each other while there are a number of tree node rotation algorithms that optimize tanglegrams for visual appeal 67 68  we found none of the available implementations that we tested 68 69 worked reasonably for phylogenies as large as sars-cov-2 phylogenies either producing unacceptable results or not able to finish the computation we therefore developed a fast heuristic approach that produces vastly improved tanglegrams methods figure s5  httpsgithubcomyatishtstrainphylogenetics  our approach takes approximately one minute for the tanglegrams we show here and we use this heuristic for displaying tanglegrams throughout the text nextstrain phylogenies vary significantly over time we next explored differences among trees made by the same group from slightly different sample sets with the goal of understanding phylogenetic stability as new samples are incorporated for the purposes of comparison we restricted 31 nextstrain trees produced between march 23 2020 and april 30 2020 to just the 468 samples they all have in common comparing topologies we found that a number of these 468 samples moved back and forth between different clade designations during the month  figure s5  including samples in the specific clades a1a a2 a2a a6 a7 b b1 b2 b4 named and analyzed by the nexstrain consortium during this period  eg  table s6  note that the nextstrain clade id system was updated while we were finalizing this work 70  we then measured all pairwise tree distances between restricted trees and found that they varied widely normalized entropy-weighted total distances ranged from 0089 to 0352 figure 10  there is therefore substantial variation in nextstrain phylogenies over time each topology is labelled with its date and dates are depicted in a color gradient from 323 red to 430 blue coordinates 1 and 2 are plotted here and each contributes 34 and 15 of the total variance explained respectively b relationships between nextstrain phylogenies are shown in a tree-of-trees meta-tree 64 we constructed which displays the distances among topologies of the constitutive trees  multidimensional scaling mds of the pairwise distances among each topology as well as meta-tree analysis 64 reveals a strong relationship between topologies and the date that each tree was produced  figure 10  in particular the first mds coordinate is strongly correlated with the release date of the tree spearmans rho  0688 p  3087e-05 this effect is expected and likely driven at least in part by the impact of the sample set used to produce the resulting tree which necessarily changes as new data are incorporated indeed the proportion of overlapping samples used in constructing each pair of trees is strongly negatively correlated with the normalized entropy-weighted total distance between their topologies r  -0384 p  4e-05 mantel test while the set of 468 samples for which we analyze topology is held fixed for all trees these tools provide the research community a method for tracking the phylogenies of sars-cov-2 as the pandemic progresses and phylogenies are produced for larger and larger sample sets the tools can detect when older clades are confirmed as new samples accumulate stabilizing inference of these clades as well as track new subclades as they grow if inconsistent data is causing persistent clade instability which may result from lab-associated sequencing errors or actual recombination it should be visible in this analysis even if it was possible to obtain error-free data and multiple alignments as well as have all groups use that same data different tree inference approaches can produce different topologies furthermore there is substantial uncertainty inherent to sars-cov-2 evolution because there are few mutations that uniquely mark each branch nonetheless it is essential that epidemiologists studying the pandemic be able to communicate phylogenetically informed observations 17 42  as discussed above the clade placements of individual samples even when inferred by the same group can vary as different datasets are incorporated into the tree construction process  eg table s4  figure 10  differences between groups are expected to be even more pronounced this threatens to leave the community with a tower of babel problem in clade characterization and naming from various different phylogenetic trees indeed the names used for nextstrain consortium clades a1a a2 a2a a6 a7 b b1 b2 b4 have nothing whatsoever to do with the clades names a b a1 a2 b1 b2 a11 etc  suggested by the cog-uk consortium 17 18  and without a 1-1 correspondence between the topologically defined clades in their respective phylogenetic trees it is difficult to translate nomenclature in order to conduct precise scientific discourse pertaining to the evolutionary conclusions reached by these groups adding further difficulty to this situation clade naming approaches based on phylogenies must themselves be subject to change as the pandemic spreads and as the evolution of new genotypes requires naming new clades and modifying existing clades as clade based comparisons are an essential part of consistent scientific discourse tools are needed to ameliorate these difficulties the cog-uk clades which they term lineages having the highest jaccard similarity coefficient j with each nextstrain ns named clade and vice versa where the jaccard similarity coefficient is computed using the set of samples from the root of that clade clades with more than 200 samples are shown in bold font and called big the others small while the naming schemes differ for each big nexstrain clade there is a closely corresponding cog-uk clade and vice-versa to explore the differences among available phylogenies and to provide guidelines for clade-based comparisons across possible evolutionary histories we used our approach to identify the correspondence between the nextstrain phylogeny produced on april 19 2020 and the cog-uk phylogeny produced on april 24 2020  figure 11a  we observe good agreement between the big nextstrain named clades and their corresponding best matching named clades in the cog-uk tree and vice versa  eg a2a clade in nextstrain b1 clade in cog-uk etc figure 11b  suggesting that these clades are reasonably stable across different analyses however in small named subclades within those big clades there are many noteworthy differences between the two topologies and the overall congruence is significantly reduced  figure 11a  in addition to differences in methodology this reflects a difference in the time when clades were originally named and the intents of each nomenclature system nextstrain named clades much earlier and many did not increase in size subsequently others have since emerged and were named by cog-uk later additionally the cog-uk system is intentionally dynamic and clades that have become inactive are removed as a consequence some clades do not have an obvious named analog in the two systems resulting in low similarities  figure  11b  perhaps the most obvious difference between the topologies is that the cog-uk tree has many more large polytomies  figure 11a  this reflects the decisions motivating their analysis 17 71  where the authors goal is to provide a well-supported and stable topology to facilitate lucid communication about viral lineages for evolutionary as well as epidemiological studies this contrasts with the nextstrain consortiums primary goal of up-to-date transmission tracing as is typical in phylogenetics topological stability comes as a tradeoff against the cost of articulation in the branches because of the many different motivations for constructing phylogenetic trees it is a certainty that many independent trees will be used to study the evolution of sars-cov-2 comparisons using our approaches can enable communication about evolving viral lineages across disparate analyses by facilitating the identification and visualization of the most closely matching clades higher branches in our tree closely mirror a nextstrain consensus tree and the cog-uk tree to identify stable nodes across analyses we compared a nextstrain consensus tree and the cog-uk tree to do this we produced a majority rule clade consensus tree 72 for the 422 common samples in 31 nextstrain releases between 323 to 430 and restricted the cog-uk tree to these same samples we find exceptionally good congruence between our nextstrain consensus and the cog-uk phylogenies  figure 12a  even though the inference methods differed substantially specifically the cog-uk tree is built using a more typical bootstrapping approach 58 whereas our approach for building a nextstrain consensus from trees produced on subsequent days would resemble a kind of bootstrapping by samples approach this congruence reaffirms the idea that the cog-uk tree provides a stable backbone to enable direct conversations in epidemiology nonetheless we still observe several small rearrangements between the two topologies suggesting that both will likely be subject to clade refinements in the future we also observed good overall congruence between the tree that we produced after removing lab-associated and extremal mutations except 11083 see above and the cog-uk tree  figure 12c  here the sample size is much larger 4172 allowing for a much more quantitative comparison the correspondence between the two trees is very high with normalized entropy weighted total distance of just 012 because lab-associated and extremal mutations were used in the cog-uk tree but not in our tree this consistency among topologies supports our assertion that the effect of lab-associated and extremal mutations will typically not result in large-scale reorganizations of large clades across the phylogeny each tree including our nextstrain consensus is available for visualization through the ucsc genome browser  figure  8  s6 powerful tools for visualizing interpreting differences among phylogenies different analysis goals require varying levels of phylogenetic resolution and certainty and it is very likely that hundreds of partially independent phylogenies will be produced studying sars-cov-2 evolution for that reason we have sought to provide the community with effective methods for tree-based comparisons in particular here we provide 1 improved methods for quantitative comparison among trees at the level of whole topologies and at individual nodes 2 an extremely rapid tanglegram clade rotation method for visualization of differences among tree topologies and 3 dynamic tree visualization capabilities within the sars-cov-2 genome browser importantly each method that we present scales well to thousands of samples and is integrated into the sars-cov-2 genome browser to facilitate rapid comparison with existing phylogenetic datasets and to cross-reference sites to molecular information relevant to basic biology diagnostics and therapy software to run each analysis is available from httpsgithubcomyatishtstrainphylogenetics  the sars-cov-2 pandemic has driven an impressive global community response providing real-time sequencing data to trace the viral outbreak 1 2 3 4 5  because these efforts are both decentralized and urgent there is potential for systematic differences in data generation and processing to inject inappropriate biases and signal into these data 24  similarly thousands of distinct and differing phylogenies will be made from these data in this work we sought to provide tools to detect and interpret sources of conflict and uncertainty in local and global phylogenies we integrate these into powerful visualization systems to facilitate continued global analysis of viral population dynamics we have downloaded genomic variation data from httpnextstrainorgncov  which is ultimately processed and derived from the gisaid database 73  and transformed it into variant call format vcf 74  file with genotypes for all samples as assigned by nextstrain a newick tree file and associated files for display in the ucsc sars-cov-2 genome browser software to perform this is described here  httpsgithubcomucscgenomebrowserkentblobmastersrchgutilsottonextstrainncovnextst rainpy  we obtained the gisaid metadata table in bulk from gisaid 75  before we were able to search for lab-associated mutations we identified various errors in gisaid metadata files most of which appear to be due to misspellings and inconsistent naming conventions of originating and submitting labs across separate sample submissions we therefore developed a simple approach to detect these errors systematically based on the character content and length of originating and submitting lab names  httpsgithubcomlgozashtcovid-19-lab-specific-bias-filter  we merge coincident metadata under consistent lab names if originating or submitting lab names share 70 length similarity and 90 character similarity or 70 length similarity and 80 identical character positions and output a revised metadata file we checked all merged names by hand to ensure accuracy and we maintain a log of each merger event and annotate low confidence mergers our updated metadata table is available from httpsgithubcomlgozashtcovid-19-lab-specific-bias-filter  to detect mutations that reoccur many times through viral evolution we computed the parsimony score 45 46 for each polymorphic site our program is available from httpsgithubcomyatishtstrainphylogenetics  briefly conditional on a tree we compute the minimum number of branches that have experienced a mutation at a single site to accommodate the phylogenetic distribution of the mutant and reference allele these are candidate highly recurrent mutations but we note that these mutations or others elsewhere on the chromosome might also impact the process of tree building itself and the score should be interpreted with caution if counting the specific rate of occurrence at a given site is of interest after computing the parsimony score for each polymorphic site we identified a set of extremal sites that displayed exceptional parsimony scores relative to their allele frequencies as follows first we excluded sites with rare alternate alleles ie sites whose alternate allele frequency was found to be lower than a certain threshold k where k is the maximum alternate allele frequency at which at least two sites had saturated parsimony scores  ie parsimony score equals alternate allele count second we extracted sites whose parsimony score was found to be the highest among sites with the same or smaller alternate allele frequency finally we also required that extremal sites have an alternate allele frequency that is lowest among all sites with its parsimony score or higher a program to perform this search is available at httpsgithubcomyatishtstrainphylogenetics  this program also optionally allows for extremal sites to be identified without including cu mutations as these are particularly abundant in sars-cov-2 genomes we systematically flagged possible variants resulting from lab-specific biases based on the proportion of lab-specific alternate allele calls and respective alternate allele frequency  httpsgithubcomlgozashtcovid-19-lab-specific-bias-filter  to do this we first filtered variants with parsimony score greater than 4 using concurrent nextstrain tree and vcf files from 4192020 next we obtained metadata for all covid-19 genomes on gisaid accessed 4282020 and computed the proportion of alternate allele calls contributed by each originating lab and submitting lab for each filtered variant we then employed a fishers exact test associating the number of major and alternate alleles attributed to each specific originating and submitting lab and the respective global major and alternate allele counts we flagged variants for which one lab accounts for more than 80 of the total alternate allele calls and for which a fishers exact test suggests a strong correlation at the p  001 level between that lab and samples containing the alternate allele we note that these cutoffs are somewhat arbitrary and may require modification in the future but the subdivision of the data is consistent with our expectations as described in results because samples are not independent and identically distributed p-values may not reflect error but rather relatedness among samples sequenced at a single facility for example if a single lab sampled a transmission chain many mutations could be strongly associated with that facility these should be interpreted cautiously however there is no obvious reason why unrelated samples sequenced at the same facility should share an excess of homoplasious mutations to compare our highly recurrent mutations to the artic primer set we downloaded the positions of the artic primer binding sites from  httpsgithubcomartic-networkartic-ncov2019blobmasterprimerschemesncov-2019v3n cov-2019bed  last accessed 562020 we computed the number of mutation in each category that overlapped primer binding sites and we computed the mean distance between each variant and the nearest primer binding site to test for enrichment for overlap and proximity to primer binding sites we performed a permutation test where we selected positions at random without replacement across the viral genome to compare to our observed distribution for the real mutations each permutation was performed 10000 times comparison of clades is made using a symmetric notion of a clade that are called splits as defined in treecmp 61  in a rooted tree the branches are directed to point away from the root and a directed branch defining a clade divides all the leaves lineages into 2 categories those in the clade reachable by following additional directed edges forward from the branch we call this being inside the branch and the rest ie those not in the clade outside the branch we might say these samples are in the unclade it is the root of the tree that polarizes each split by providing a direction for the branch ie providing a concept of inside versus outside or equivalently clade versus unclade these two sets say a and b define the split the split is denoted as ab two phylogenetic trees are similar if their branches produce a similar set of splits when comparing two phylogenetic trees we begin by finding the common leaf set that is the set of leaves lineages that are included in both trees then for each tree and each branch in that tree the reduced split is obtained from the split by removing all samples not in the common leaf set for the two trees being compared to compare two reduced splits ab and xy we first compute the size of the set-theoretic symmetric difference between the clades a and x ie  the number of samples that are in a but not in x denoted by ax plus the number of samples that are in x but not in a denoted by xa this number is denoted by sabxy and is called the split distance between the reduced splits ab and xy symbolically since the above metric scales with the size of trees being compared we also define a normalized version using the expected distance 76  which is computed using trees t p and t p  that randomly permute the leaves of t and t respectively while maintaining the tree structure as code for computing these distance measures can be found at httpsgithubcomyatishtstrainphylogenetics  this code has additional features such as the ability to replace the shannon entropy -p log 2 p -1-p log 2 1-p with related weighting functions such as 2 minp1-p we find that the method is robust to such replacements data not shown while node rotation algorithms in the context of tanglegram visualization have been implemented in the cophylo and dendroscope3 tools 67 68  we found these algorithms to be either too slow or inadequate for the large sars-cov-2 phylogenies that we compared we implemented a simple node rotation heuristic rottrees that works well and completes in reasonable time 1 min for sars-cov-2 trees with 5k leaves the algorithm rottrees accepts two trees t and t each pruned to only contain the shared set of leaves as input first while maintaining the leaf order of t rottrees makes a breadth-first traversal in t rotating the children of each traversed node based on its average rank  ie child with a lower average rank appears higher which is the average of the positions of the appearance of that child nodes leaves in t second rottrees repeats the above to rotate the leaves of t while maintaining the leaf order of t the previous two steps are repeated until convergence no new rotations in that iteration and the final tree rotations for t and t are returned we made this routine available in httpsgithubcomyatishtstrainphylogenetics  this may not be optimal for all tree co-visualization purposes but here we find that this approach is sufficient to produce vastly improved tree visualizations than many available packages we obtained the phylogenetic tree hosted by nextstrain accessed 4192020 and used this in our comparisons of clades among trees and as our primary data object for examining apparently recurrent mutation on the tree we did separately confirm that most apparently recurrent mutations are recovered on the trees produced on different days by nextstrain for comparison of clades among different tree-building approaches we obtained variant datasets and phylogenies from nextstrain  httpsnextstrainorgncov accessed 4192020-4262020 and from cog-uk  httpscog-uks3climbacuk20200424cog2020-04-24treenewick  accessed 4242020 from the 0419 nextstrain release we created a reference phylogeny using iq-tree-2 57 77 to build phylogenies from each of these alignments using the gtrg nucleotide substitution model for all other phylogenies we altered the input by removing or masking individual sites then produced phylogenies from these altered alignments using the same iq-tree-2 parameters the likelihood of a tree given the alignment from which it was constructed was automatically calculated by the iq-tree command used above  iqtree -s alignmentphy -m gtrg  however to compute the likelihood of a particular alignment given a different tree we used the command iqtree -s alignmentphy -te phylogenynh -m gtrg  to generate our final tree having masked lab-associated and extremal mutations we used the same command but also included the ultrafast bootstrapping option -bb 1000 to assist with quantifying uncertainty in our final phylogeny 58  we used the same command but included the full multiple alignment to compare the tree obtained to one obtained from the full dataset using identical methodology finally we collapsed all branches that were not supported by at least one mutation using parsimony to identify nodes that experienced a mutation to investigate the effects of lab-specific alleles on phylogenetic topology we also introduced artificial errors at control sites we chose three sites at which to introduce these errors a11991g c22214g and c10029u to introduce an error we manually changed a reference allele to an alternate allele for a given sample at a given site for each of these sites we chose 10 25 and 50 samples for which we introduced errors to mimic the effects of a lab-specific allele we ensured that each set of samples with artificial errors must come from the same country we chose australia due to its high representation in the nextstrain data as 372 samples in the 0419 nextstrain release came from australia to further mimic lab-specific behavior we separately introduced errors at the same sites for 10 25 and 50 randomly selected french samples collected between march 1 and march 17 after introducing these errors we constructed phylogenies from the modified alignments using iq-tree 2 57 77  as described above in total we produced 54 phylogenies in this experiment introducing errors at three sets of random samples for each of the three sites at 10 25 and 50 samples each for australian and french samples we also repeated this experiment but introducing errors at pairs of sites simultaneously rather than at individual sites ie a11991g and c22214g a11991g and c10029u and c10029u and c22214g we used the same randomly chosen sets of french samples for this aspect of the experiment and produced phylogenies by the same methods in total we produced 27 phylogenies in this experiment introducing errors at three sets of randomly chosen samples at 10 25 and 50 samples each for each of the three pairs of sites to understand commonalities in tree structure over time we used multidimensional scaling of a distance matrix of normalized entropy-weighted total distances among nextstrain releases pruned to 468 shared samples spanning from march 23 to april 30 to do this we used the cmdscale function in base r  httpswwwr-projectorg  and we retained the first six coordinates because they accounted for the vast majority of the total variance explained approximately 80 we computed the correlation between our distance matrix and the proportion of samples shared among topologies produced each day using a mantel test implemented within the ade4 package in r to produce a nextstrain consensus tree we first pruned all nextstrain trees to a common set of samples included in each tree we then used the sumtrees script within the dendropy package 69 to produce a majority rule consensus tree out of each tree requiring at least 50 of trees support a clade for inclusion in the final consensus tree specifically we used the sumtrees function to perform this task in our cases that is equivalent to requiring at least 16 of 31 trees contain a given clade to include it although much of this work is focused on detecting and characterizing the impacts of low-frequency highly recurrent and lab-associated alleles cross-contamination among samples is also a potential source of widespread phylogenetically discordant sites that warrants mentioning the majority of labs performing viral genome sequencing are processing multiple samples there is therefore a significant possibility for contamination to drive the apparent recurrence of high frequency mutations unfortunately contamination short recombination tracts and high frequency recurrent mutations create largely similar predictions about the distributions of recurrent alleles table 1  yet there are some distinctions one might expect both recombination and contamination require a sample or lineage to encounter another of a different allele to be observable therefore high frequency alleles should typically be involved in both recombination and contamination events additionally all else being equal we expect that we would observe equal numbers of forward and backward mutations across the tree for recombination and contamination but not for recurrent mutation which can be quite biased see above consistent with this idea six out of eleven sites with alternate allele frequency above 10 show evidence of additional forward and backward mutation even after removing lab-associated mutations  figure 2  table s3  hence even if we could remove all systematic errors contamination should be considered as a possible source of homoplasious mutation before confident conclusions are drawn about natural selection or the presence of viral recombination to investigate the potential for highly correlated lab-associated mutations in the real data we extracted the set of mutations with alternate allele counts of 10 or more and where at least 80 of samples containing alternate alleles were derived from a single lab table s4  this set of alleles shares many features with sites that we believe to be sites of real variation suggesting that many are indeed true variants in aggregate these mutations are not enriched for proximity to artic primer binding sites p  09502 permutation test the cu mutation fraction is similar to that observed in high frequency sites p  05307 fishers exact test they affect amino acids at similar rates to those of high frequency alleles p  07643 and they have low parsimony scores even relative to our two-error experiments 1-2 table s4  our results therefore suggest that highly correlated lab-associated mutations are relatively rare it is noteworthy that there is overlap with some of the lab groups who contributed high parsimony lab-associated alleles nine out of 24 table s1  however these are also groups who contributed the most genome sequences in our dataset and they are therefore the most likely to be associated with low frequency variation or lab-associated mutations for that matter most such mutations do not overlap in samples with other lab-associated mutation sites indicating that if they were independent mutations we would likely see their placement vary across the tree nonetheless in one extreme case g11417u u14073c and a23947g co-occur in a single clade across many samples suggesting that these sites could impact tree-building algorithms even more substantially than those in our two-error simulations however samples containing these mutations are not unusually divergent relative to the clade size the average pairwise nucleotide diversity is 118 sitesgenome as would be expected if they were incorrectly grouped moreover we emphasize that real variants should be correlated on the viral phylogeny and that these do not constitute sequencing errors we believe that our approach has likely identified the majority of lab-associated recurrent mutations in this dataset that occur in more than a handful of samples to confirm that our distance measure will be robust and consistent with expectations we compared the set of all pairwise distances between trees produced by nextstrain from march 23 to april 30 across a range of tree distance statistics in particular we find that entropy-weighted total distance is strongly correlated with quartet robinson-foulds and matching-split tree distance measures p  1e-5 in all cases mantel test this strongly suggests that our approach yields robust and interpretable tree distances we provide researchers the ability to upload their own set of aligned sars-cov-2 genomes and an accompanying phylogenetic tree this allows the researcher to compare their tree to trees from nextstrain and cog-uk and to map alleles characteristic of particular clades to sites in the virus genome of functional diagnostic or therapeutic significance alignment files built by most tools are too large to transfer when the number of viral samples gets large so we require they be converted to the more compact vcf format with sample genotypes before upload the msa2vcf tool produces vcf with sample genotypes once the vcf file for the alignment is created one does the following figure s1  alternate allele count versus

activation loop javier jaimes a nicole andr m joshua chappie s jean millet k gary whittaker r   coronaviruses are zoonotic pathogens that are well known to evolve environmentally and infect many mammalian and avian species 1 these diverse viruses often have effective transmission and immune evasion strategies especially when outbreaks occur within dense human populations in the past two decades coronavirus outbreaks have arisen in human populations around the world each with unique features but also sharing several similarities severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov emerged in 2002 in guangdong province china causing an outbreak that spread to 26 countries with more than 8000 infections and 774 deaths and a case fatality rate of 95 2 more recently the ongoing middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov outbreak that originated in 2012 in saudi arabia has spread to 27 countries with 2494 infections and 858 deaths with a case fatality rate of 344 3 the recent surfacing of the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 first identified on december 12th 2019 was initially detected in wuhan hubei province china and has now spread globally via travelers and breached the boundaries of 182 countriesregions 45 on march 11th 2020 the world health organization officially declared a global pandemic the rapidly evolving situation has prompted most affected countries to impose tight restrictions on border movements and unprecedented statewide lockdown measures at the time of writing april 06th 2020 over 12 million cases and approximately 70000 fatalities have been reported globally 5 similar to sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 infections in the early stages of the outbreak were observed in family clusters and hospital personnel 46 7 8 the outbreak occurring during the winter is another commonality between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 9 currently sustained community-based spread is occurring which would make sars-cov-2 a community-acquired respiratory coronavirus along with the other less pathogenic human community-acquired respiratory coronaviruses 229e oc43 hku-1 and nl63 10 clinical signs associated with sars-cov-2 include pneumonia fever dry cough headache and dyspnea which may progress to respiratory failure and death 7911 the incubation period for sars-cov-2 seems to be longer than for sars-cov and mers-cov which have a mean incubation time of 5 to 7 days leading to challenges in contact tracing 12 preexisting conditions and comorbidities such as hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disease or kidney disease affect the severity of pathogenesis attributed to sars-cov and mers-cov and thus far similar patterns seem to exist with sars-cov-2 711 sars-cov and mers-cov seem to exhibit deleterious morbidity and mortality on the elderly population  60 years of age with most deaths occurring in this age group and sars-cov-2 is currently portraying a comparable trend 7 the coronaviruses belong to the coronaviridae family and the orthocoronaviridae subfamily which is divided in four genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 are all betacoronaviruses a genus that includes many viruses that infect humans bats and other domesticated and wild animals 13 betacoronaviruses have many similarities within the orf1ab polyprotein and most structural proteins however the spike protein and accessory proteins portray significant diversity 14 mers-cov has maintained a stable genome since its emergence in 2012 unlike other coronaviruses that readily evolve and can undergo notable recombination events 15 alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses including sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 and other human coronaviruses like hcov-nl63 are thought to have originated in bats 14 15 16 gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses are reported to have an avian origin but are known to infect both mammals and avian species 17 human infections of bat-origin viruses typically occur through intermediate hosts for sars-cov these hosts are palm civets paguma larvata and racoon dogs nyctereutes procyonoides for mers-cov the known host is the dromedary camel camelus dromedarius 1418 sars-cov antibodies were first detected in palm civets and the animal handlers in wet markets 14 mers-cov is thought to have been circulating for at least 30 years within the dromedary camel population based on retrospective antibody testing of serum from 1983 14 the source of the sars-cov-2 outbreak has been linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market in wuhan where it was initially confirmed that the majority of cases with onset prior to january 1st 2020 were linked to the market 19 the market sells many species including seafood birds snakes marmots and bats 7 the market was closed on january 1st 2020 and sampling and decontamination have occurred in order to find the source of the infection origination of sars-cov-2 from bats has been strongly supported but the presumed intermediate host remains to be identified recent reports have suggested the malayan pangolins manis javanica as a possible intermediate host for sars-cov-2 with putative recombination signals found between pangolin bat and human coronavirus sequences 7920 21 22 however the direct precursor sequence to the currently circulating human sars-cov-2 and putative intermediate host remain to be identified the coronavirus spike protein s is the primary determinant of viral tropism and is responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion it is a large approx 180 kda glycoprotein that is present on the viral surface as a prominent trimer and it is composed of two domains s1 and s2 23 the s1 domain mediates receptor binding and is divided into two sub-domains with the n-terminal subdomain ntd often binding sialic acid and the c-terminal subdomain also known as c-domain binding a specific proteinaceous receptor 24 the receptor for sars-cov has been identified as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 similar to what has been recently identified with sars-cov-2 91425 hela cells transfected to express or not the ace2 receptor from either human chinese horseshoe bat mouse civet and pig were infected with sars-cov-2 and it was reported that the virus was able to use all receptors except mouse ace2 9 sars-cov-2 was not found to use dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 the receptor for mers-cov 91425 following receptor binding the s2 domain mediates viralmembrane fusion through the exposure of a highly conserved fusion peptide 2627 the fusion peptide is activated through proteolytic cleavage at a site found immediately upstream s2 which is common to all coronaviruses in many but not all coronaviruses additional proteolytic priming occurs at a second site located at the interface of the s1 and s2 domains s1s2 28 the use of proteases in priming and activation combined with receptor binding and ionic interactions eg h and ca2 together control viral stability and transmission and modulate the conformational changes in the s protein that dictate the viral entry process into host cells 232629 specifically sars-cov and mers-cov both infect type ii pneumocytes in vivo however they individually infect ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and non-ciliated bronchial epithelial cells respectively 14 sars-cov-2 can infect ex vivo with the same range of cell culture lines as sars-cov and mers-cov eg vero e6 huh-7 cells though primary human airway epithelial cells have been reported to be its preferential cell type 152530 overall how cell tropism of sars-cov-2 reflects a balance of receptor binding endosomal environment and protease activation and the specifics of these mechanisms remain to be determined the rapid dissemination and sharing of information during the sars-cov-2 pandemic has surpassed that of both mers-cov and sars-cov where the latter virus was only identified after several months and with a genome available a month later 7 the sars-cov-2 was identified and a genome sequence was available within a month from the initial surfacing of the agent in patients 7 initial reports identified that sars-cov-2 contains six major open-reading frames in the viral genome and various accessory proteins 9 the sars-like sl virus batcov-ratg13 also named bat-sl-ratg13 was observed to have a remarkably high degree of genomic sequence identity with that of sars-cov-2 at over 96 overall sequence identity and with two other bat sars-like viruses bat-sl-cov-zc45 and bat-sl-cov-zxc21 both having around 88 sequence identity compared with sars-cov-2 on a genome-wide level 9 when sars-cov-2 is compared to the clinically relevant human coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov pairwise percent identities fall to around 796 and 50 on a genomic level respectively 49 the s protein of sars-cov-2 was found to be approximately 75 homologous to the sars-cov spike 79 in this study we perform phylogenetic bioinformatic and homology structural modeling analyses of sars-cov-2 s in comparison with closely related viruses we identify a distinct four residue insert featuring two arginine residues that maps to the s1s2 priming loop of sars-cov-2 which is missing from all other sars-cov-related viruses but present in mers-cov s and in many other coronaviruses we discuss the importance of this extended basic loop for s protein-mediated membrane fusion and its implications for virus transmission to obtain an initial assessment of shared andor specific features of the sars-cov-2 spike s envelope glycoprotein a protein sequence alignment was performed to compare the sequence of the wuhan-hu-1 strain of the novel coronavirus with that of the closely related human sars-cov s strain tor2 sequence supplementary figure 1 the overall percent protein sequence identity found by the alignment was 76 figure 1a a breakdown of the functional domains of the s protein based on the sars-cov s sequence reveals that the s1 receptor-binding domain was less conserved 64 identity than the s2 fusion domain 90 identity within s1 the ntd was found to be less conserved 51 identity compared to the receptor binding domain rbd 74 identity which is part of the c-terminal subdomain figure 1a the relatively high degree of sequence identity for the rbd is consistent with the view that sars-cov-2 like sars-cov may use ace2 as its host cell receptor 92531 interestingly when the more defined receptor binding motif rbm was analyzed ie the region of sars-cov s containing residues that were shown to directly contact the ace2 receptor the identity between the two sequences drops to 50 figure 1a in this case hinting at possible differences in binding residues involved in the interaction with the receptor andor binding affinities 31 32 33 as expected within the well-conserved s2 domain subdomain identities were high for the fusion peptide region fp 93 identity high for the heptad-repeat 1 region hr1 88 identity identical for hr2 100 identity and high for both the transmembrane and the c-terminal endodomain tm 93 identity e 97 identity figure 1a early phylogenetic studies on sars-cov-2 genomic sequences revealed that it clustered closely with sequences originating from sars-like sequences from bats within lineage b of the betacoronavirus genus lineage a groups prototypical coronaviruses such as murine hepatitis virus mhv and human coronaviruses hcov-hku1 and hcov-oc43 the other highly pathogenic coronavirus mers-cov is found within lineage c along with related camel-derived mers-cov lineage c also groups viruses from bats and other mammals such as hedgehogs lineage d contains viral species infecting bats to gain a better understanding of both shared and specific features of sars-cov-2 s protein a phylogenetic analysis centered on s protein sequences of representatives of the four betacoronavirus lineages was carried out figure 1b fifteen sequences of sars-cov-2 s sequences obtained from ncbi and gisaid from china and various export locations worldwide were analyzed along with representative members of lineages ad betacoronaviruses the analysis confirmed that all sars-cov-2 s sequences clustered very closely with bat sars-like sequences with the closest matching sequence corresponding to a bat coronavirus bat-cov strain named bat-sl-ratg13 other closely related sequences found were from bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 the sub-clade that groups sars-cov-2 bat-sl-ratg13 bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 is distinct from the one grouping human and civet sars-cov along with other related bat sars-like viruses such as bat-sl-lyra3 while bat coronaviruses are the established reservoir for sars-cov-2 the presumed intermediate host remains to be determined based on the high degree of sequence identity in the rbd of sequences found in malayan pangolins m javanica it was proposed that these mammals could be intermediate hosts 20 21 22 subsequent whole-genome analysis revealed 85592 identity to sars-cov-2 which is less than what is observed for bat-sl-ratg13 963 34 to explore the relationship of pangolin covs to sars-cov-2 we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the spike gene of pangolin covs isolated from animals smuggled into china in 2017 guangxi province gx and 2019 guangdong province gd compared to sars-cov-2 batcov-ratg13 and other betacoronaviruses figure 2
 pairwise comparison between sars-cov-2 s protein and that of batcov-ratg13 and representative sequences from guangxi pangolin 2017 abbreviated gx here and guangdong pangolin 2019 abbreviated gd confirm that overall batcov-ratg13 had the highest identity 97 overall 96 and 100 for s1 and s2 respectively figure 2a the analysis reveals that pangolin s protein sequences are more divergent overall 92 identity for gx and 89 identity for gd with most of the divergence concentrating in the s1 domain notably while the ntd domain of both gx and gd pangolin sequences fell to 88 and 67 identity respectively the rbd domain of the gd domain was confirmed to be remarkably well conserved compared to sars-cov-2 97 identity compared to 87 identity for gx pangolin and 89 for batcov-ratg13 these observations are in line with previously reported putative recombination events occurring between pangolin bat and human betacoronavirus sequences 22 phylogenetically pangolin spike sequences from 2017 gx form a subclade that groups with ratg13 figure 2b interestingly the 2019 pangolin gd sequence appears to branch off early ie it could represent an s protein sequence that diverged earlier and forms its own subclade distinct from the ratg132017pangolin and sars-cov-2environmental subclades an s protein sequence alignment focusing on the rbd region of sars-cov-2 sars-cov and bat-sars-related viruses reveals that the n-terminal half of the rbd is relatively well conserved whereas the c-terminal half which contains the rbm exhibits more variation figure 3a notably bat-sl-cov-zc45 and bat-sl-cov-zxc21 both have two deletions of 5 and 14 residues within the rbd the composition of residues found at the two known coronavirus s cleavage sites was performed using alignment data figure 3b and c the region around arginine 667 r667 of sars-cov s the s1s2 cleavage site aligned well with sars-cov-2 and the bat sars-related sequences 56 notably an arginine at the position corresponding to sars-cov r667 is conserved for the other five sequences analyzed the alignment shows that sars-cov-2 contains a four amino acid insertion 681prra684 that is not found in any other sequences analyzed including the closely related bat-sl-ratg13 figure 3b together with the conserved r685 amino acid found in sars-cov-2 at the putative s1s2 cleavage site the insertion introduces a stretch of three basic arginine residues that could potentially be recognized by members of the pro-protein convertase family of proteases 3536 this insertion was conserved for all 15 sars-cov-2 sequences analyzed supplementary figure 2 within the betacoronavirus genus the presence of a basic stretch of residues at the s1s2 site is found for a number of species from lineages a hcov-hku1 mhv hcov-oc43 and c mers-cov batcov-hku5 the four-amino-acid insertion feature appears unique among lineage b viruses as all other species analyzed in the extended alignment none contained the stretch of basic residues identified in sars-cov-2 s supplementary figure 2 as expected from previous analyses the s2 cleavage site located immediately upstream of the fusion peptide and corresponding to the residue position r797 in the case of sars-cov was strictly conserved for sars-cov-2 and closely related bat sars-related sequences figure 3c of note the leucine l residue found at position 792 of the sars-cov sequence is substituted to serine s residue for sars-cov-2 s as well as the bat sars-related sequences the fusion peptide sequence was found to be well conserved for all sequences analyzed notably protein alignment analyses show that pangolin sequences as for other viruses in betacoronaviruses lineage b do not show the presence of the predicted proteolytically sensitive s1s2 fusion activation site present in sars-cov-2 figure 4
 only environmental samples taken from the huanan seafood market appear to also harbor the s1s2 insert interestingly the 2019 pangolin sequence shares the same motif immediately upstream of the s1s2 insert found in sars-cov-2 s 675qtqtns680 sars-cov-2 numbering this is also shared with batcov-ratg13 but not with the other pangolin sequences from 2017 which harbor a distinct motif 673hsmsslf678 betacovpangolinguangxip4l2017  epiisl410538 numbering to gain a deeper understanding of common and possibly distinguishing structural features found in sars-cov-2 s protein homology modeling was undertaken the analysis of modeled proteins provides a powerful tool to identify predicted structural characteristics which can translate into structurefunction changes in the studied protein our laboratory has previously taken advantage of these tools for structurefunction studies of other covs s proteins 233738 to perform the modeling it is first necessary to identify a suitable protein structure to be used as template which will determine the accuracy of the predicted model the s protein structure of several covs including the following have been reported previously alphacoronavirus hcov-nl63 and feline coronavirus uu4 fcov-uu4 betacoronavirus hcov-hku1 mhv sars-cov and mers-cov gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus ibv and deltacoronavirus porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 considering that genome and s protein alignments have showed that the sars-cov-2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genus we focused our analysis on the s structures from viruses belonging to this genus to select the template structure the s protein amino acid sequences from four representative betacoronaviruses hcov-hku1 mhv sars-cov and mers-cov were aligned and the solved s protein structures were compared to determine their amino acid identity and the overall structural organization similarities among these proteins supplementary figure 3a we observed an average of  30 identity among the four viral s proteins at the amino acid level with the exception of hcov-hku1 and mhv which share an amino acid identity of 59 at the s protein supplementary figure 3a despite the differences at the amino acid level the overall structure of the four betacoronavirus s proteins showed a similar folding pattern supplementary figure 3b and major differences can only be spotted at specific sections of the functional domains where flexible loops are abundant eg rbd and cleavage sites considering this we used modeller v 923 university of california to build a first set of models for the sars-cov-2 s protein based on each of the above-mentioned structures supplementary figure 4 interestingly we found no major differences at the secondary structures among the sars-cov-2 s protein-predicted models depending on the s structure that was used as template for the modeling construction however extended flexible loops at the rbd andor clashes between s monomers at the s2 domain level were observed in the sars-cov-2 s models based on hcov-hku1 mhv and mers-cov supplementary figure 4 first three panels in contrast the predicted sars-cov-2 s model based on the sars-cov s structure displayed a much better organized folding and no major clashes were observed between the s monomers supplementary figure 4 last panel as we described previously the identity between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov at the s protein amino acid level was 76 and phylogenetic analyses grouped sars-cov-2 in the lineage b of the betacoronavirus genus closely related to sars-cov as well as to other covs originating in bats figure 1b these two considerations in addition to our preliminary modeling results suggested sars-cov s as the most suitable template for modeling the sars-cov-2 s protein taking an alternative approach the s protein sequence of sars-cov-2 was submitted to two structure homology modeling servers phyre 2 and raptorx 4647 for both cases the structural models with highest homology scores were based on the sars-cov s template structure pdb id 5x58 data not shown confirming the choice of using sars-cov s as template for generating structural models of sars-cov-2 to better compare the predicted structural characteristics of the sars-cov-2 we also performed homology modeling of four s proteins from bat-covs belonging to lineage b in our phylogenetic analysis which are closely related to sars-cov-2 the modeled s proteins from the bat-covs ratg13 covzc45 covzxc21 and lyra3 were compared to the predicted structure of sars-cov-2 s and to the template structure of sars-cov figure 5
 the amino acid homology of the modeled s proteins in comparison to the template sars-cov s was  71 for all the bat-cov s with the exception of the lyra3 s which shares a homology of 847 with the template s overall all the modeled s proteins shared a similar folding pattern in comparison to sars-cov s and both s1 and s2 domains showed a uniform organization figure 5 as expected differences were mostly observed at the flexible loops forming the head of the s1 domain especially at the ntd region rbd region where most of the amino acid variation was observed figures 3a and 5 the s protein amino acid identity among the bat-cov including sars-cov-2 ranged between 753 and 967 with lyra3 and ratg13 s proteins having the lowest and highest identity to sars-cov-2 respectively despite amino acid variability no major changes in the secondary structures and the overall folding of the proteins were observed among the modeled s structures of these viruses suggesting a conserved organization for all the s proteins of the lineage b including sars-cov-2 nevertheless differences at the flexible loops in both domains were observed and their impact in the sars-cov-2 s protein function must be further studied it was recently reported that the sars-cov-2 binds ace2 as a receptor to infect target cells 9253348 this finding appears to agree with previous reports describing the ability of bat-covs to successfully bind and use ace2 as a cellular receptor for infection 49 50 51 this conservation in the receptor usage among sars-cov and sars-like bat-covs contrasts with the high variability that are observed at the amino acid sequence of the rbm figure 3a considering this high variability we compared the predicted rbm structure of the sars-cov-2 and bat-covs to the one of sars-cov interestingly despite the variability the modeled sars-cov-2-predicted rbm displayed a similar organization to sars-cov figure 6
 top panel this was also observed in the ratg3 and lyra3-predicted rbm structures figure 6 middle left and bottom right panels suggesting that the rbm organization is well conserved among these viruses in contrast the predicted rbm of the covzc45 and covzxc21 viruses showed a different folding at this region in comparison to sars-cov figure 6 middle right and bottom left panels these two last viruses showed a 5- and a 14-amino-acid deletion respectively in the rbm sequence figure 3a which can explain the differential folding in the modeled proteins the alignment in figure 3b shows a four-amino-acid insertion 681prra684 as well as a conserved arginine corresponding to r685 at the s1s2 site of the sars-cov-2 this insertion which appears to be unique among lineage b betacoronaviruses suggests a differential mechanism of activation for the sars-cov-2 compared to other sars-cov and sars-like batcov at the structural level the s1s2 site has been shown to be difficult to solve for most covs structures resulting in either incomplete structures missing the complete s1s2 site or structures with an altered ie mutated s1s2 site 424445 solving the structure of the s1s2 site was also found to be an issue in the sars-cov s structure we used for our modeling analyses we have previously shown that the s1s2 site can be modeled in other cov s proteins and it appears to be organized as a flexible exposed loop that extends from the s structure and suggest it could be easily accessible for proteolytic activation 37 to better study the s1s2 site structural organization we modeled the sars-cov s protein based on the s structure of mhv s1s2 site mutated in the structure and mers-cov and sars-cov s1s2 site missing in the structure to see if the predicted structure of the s1s2 site was similar despite the template structure we observed no differences in the modeled sars-cov s protein at the s1s2 site predicting an exposed flexible loop in all the three models data not shown based on this we proceeded to compare the s1s2 site as well as other major functional elements of the s2 domain ie s2 site and fusion peptide in the predicted structure in our sars-cov sars-cov-2 and bat-cov s models figure 7
 remarkably two features appear to exhibit distinctive characteristics in the sars-cov-2 s model the fusion peptide which is predicted to be organized in a more compact conformation for sars-cov-2 s than in sars-cov s figure 7 surface models and the region corresponding to the s1s2 cleavage site which contains r667 in the case of sars-cov figure 7 s1s2 alignment box and ribbon models for sars-cov and the bat-cov proteins the s1s2 site forms a short loop that appears flanking closely to the side of the trimeric structure in the case of sars-cov-2 s the s1s2 site is predicted to form an extended loop that protrudes to the exterior of the trimer figure 7 this feature suggests that the s1s2 loop in sars-cov-2 s could be more exposed for proteolytic processing by host cell proteases as mentioned before solving the structure of the s1s2 site appears to present difficulties for most of the reported cov s structures figure 8
 top panel however the exposed loop feature has been demonstrated in both modeled and cryo-em cov s structures with similar amino acid sequences at the s1s2 site ie fcov and ibv respectively figure 8 top panel interestingly fcov viruses do not always display a s1s2 site figure 8 top panel which results in distinct cell entry mechanisms we also performed an analysis of the s2 site of the sars-cov-2 in comparison to sars-cov and bat-cov s proteins as expected differences in the modeled s2 site structure were not predicted in any of the studied spikes figure 7 s2 ribbon models this agrees with the fact that the s2 site appears to be conserved in the studied sequences figure 7 s2 alignment box and as we described previously the sars-cov functional r797 residue at the cleavage position 1 p1 as well as the serine at position 798 cleavage position p1 are conserved in the sars-cov-2 and among the compared bat-covs this feature also appears to be conserved in other covs figure 8 bottom panel however mutations in the residues immediately upstream of the sars-cov r797 residue or equivalent in each virus have been shown to result in changes in the proteolytical requirements in other covs 28 we observed mutations l to s and t to s which are located upstream of the p1 arginine at positions p3 and p6 in the s2 site of the sars-cov-2 in comparison to sars-cov these mutations are not predicted to alter the structure of the s2 in the sars-cov-2 figure 7 s2 ribbon models the current covid-19 pandemic caused by sars-cov-2 is evidence of the potential of coronaviruses to continuously evolve in wild reservoirs and jump to new species our study aims to contribute to our understanding of the sars-cov-2 from a phylogenetic and structural point of view focusing on the functional and the proteolytically sensitive sites of the s protein using phylogenetic analysis we showed that the sars-cov-2 s protein is closely related to other sars-like viruses originating in bats figure 1b which agrees with early similar reports 34 the identity of the s protein of batcov-ratg13 strain of bat coronavirus was shown to be 9665 suggesting this virus as the closest relative to sars-cov-2 while the origin of the novel coronavirus appears to be in bat reservoirs there is still no definitive evidence of the possible intermediate host that could transmit the virus to humans recent reports have suggested the malayan pangolins as an intermediate host for the sars-cov-2 in our analysis we found that the pangolin spike sequences grouped in a subclade branching from ratg13 we additionally observed that the 2019 guangdong pangolin sequence appeared to branch off early in a distinct subclade from ratg13 based on these findings we hypothesize that despite of having a common origin in bats the phylogenetic relationship between pangolin covs and sars-cov-2 is not sufficient to support the claim that pangolins harbor the direct precursor to the currently circulating human sars-cov-2 in fact our analysis suggests that both humans and pangolins could be considered final hosts of their respective coronavirus in this study we show the presence of a distinct insert that maps to the s1s2 priming loop of the sars-cov-2 spike protein and is not shared with sars-cov or any sars-related viruses in betacoronavirus lineage b during the preparation of this manuscript the cryo-electron microscopy structures of sars-cov-2 s have recently been determined 335253 these studies have revealed in detail the structure of the sars-cov-2 spike rbd and how it contacts the ace2 host cell receptor with notable differences compared to sars-cov 54 it has been described that the sars-cov rbm down conformation packs more closely to the ntd of the s protein 33 in the same report the sars-cov-2 rbd was shown to be angled to the center of the trimmer in its down conformation which differs to the sars-cov rbm structure interestingly we observed in our models that the rbd is predicted to pack similarly to sars-cov and the rbm is also predicted to organize as a flexible loop with similar structure despite the lower amino acid identity between these two proteins figure 6 in a more recent report it has been shown that ace2-binding mode of both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 rbds is nearly identical which supports the claim that the flexibility in the rbm is key to compensate the amino acid differences between the two covs proteins and agrees with our predicted models 54 one of the common difficulties of the covs s protein cryo-em studies is the difficulty to solve proteolytically sensitive regions in the protein 3955 since the s1s2 region is proteolytically sensitive it is common to introduce mutations in this site to prevent proteolytic priming and to allow efficient heterologous expression and purification 42 this has resulted in a difficulty to solve the s1s2 region in most of the available cov s protein structures with a few exceptions for the s proteins of viruses belonging to the alphacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus genera 4044 considering that this region is proteolytically sensitive and has been shown to play a major role in the s protein function in other covs the use of in silico modeling tools has become a useful alternative to study this region in the context of the structural organization of the protein 3738 the sars-cov-2 s protein is not an exception to this issue and the recently reported structures do not allow resolution of the s1s2 priming loop andor have the loop mutated we used the structural modeling approach to better understand the organization of this region which is not only suggested to be functionally active but has been reported as one of the major differences between the sars-cov-2 and its closest relative ratg13 2533 we observed that the sars-cov-2 s1s2 site is predicted to be organized as an exposed flexible loop suggesting that the site is easily available for protease cleavage and suggesting a major role in sars-cov-2 s function figure 7 the significance of the sars-cov-2 spike protein s1s2 priming loop is yet to be explored experimentally but we consider it may fundamentally change the entry pathway of this virus compared to other known viruses in betacoronavirus lineage b the presence of the extended s1s2 priming loop containing paired basic residues predicts that sars-cov-2 s would most likely be cleaved by golgi-resident proprotein convertases such as furin during virus assembly and delivery to the cell surface indeed analysis of western blots of vsv-pseudoparticles containing sars-cov-2 s have shown the presence of cleaved s in contrast to pseudoparticles containing sars-cov s 25 in the case of mers-cov but not sars-cov it is known that priming of s by pre-cleavage occurs at the s1s2 site giving sars-cov-2 cleavage activation properties more in line with mers-cov than sars-cov 2556 57 58 the extended structural loop may also allow enhanced priming by trypsin-like proteases ttsps or even cathepsins sars-cov-2 is currently believed to be highly sars-cov-like with respect to its receptor binding and the modeling studies reported here are broadly in line with this finding despite the relatively low amino acid identity in the rbm however it is important to remember that changes in protease usage may allow coronaviruses to undergo receptor-independent entry viruscell fusion as well as affect syncytia formation cellcell fusion and tissue pathology 59 60 61 our study provides a structural context to the s1s2 insert which has also been reported by others 5262 the presence of a distinct insert containing paired basic residues in the s1s2 priming loop is common in many coronaviruses in betacoronavirus lineage c eg mers-cov as well as in lineage a eg mouse hepatitis virus mhv and lineage d and is universally found in gammacoronavirus s eg ibv 40 it is noticeably absent in most alphacoronaviruses with the clear exception of type i canine and feline coronaviruses 2837 one feature of the distinct insert for of sars-cov-2 that warrants attention relates to potential changes as the virus evolves an equivalent loop is present in influenza ha in this case adjacent to the fusion peptide and insertions of basic residues into the loop are a primary marker of conversion from low pathogenicity to highly pathogenic avian influenza virus eg h5n1 63 in coronaviruses such loop modifications are known to affect mhv pathogenesis and to modulate neurovirulence and neuroinvasiveness of hcov-oc43 6465 the fcov is another example where s1s2 loop modifications appear to lead directly to changes in viral pathogenesis 376667 in the case of fcov the equivalent proteolytically sensitive structural loop is within a hypervariable region of the spike gene suggesting that this region of spike is a significant driver of virus evolution 67 at present sars-cov-2 is behaving in a distinct manner compared to sars-cov we believe our findings are of special importance considering that the available data indicates ace2 as a suitable cellular receptor for sars-cov-2 entry 4868 in our modeling analysis we observed that the rbm of the sars-cov-2 predicted a similar organization as sars-cov and that deletions at this rbm region in other bat-covs are reported to not impact its ability to bind ace2 49 50 51 this suggests that instead of receptor binding the s1s2 loop is a distinctive feature relevant to sars-cov-2 pathogenesis and marks a unique similarity to mers-cov we would predict that the distinct insert in sars-cov-2 s would give the virus biological properties more in line with mers-cov and not sars-cov especially with regard to its cell entry pathway however it may also impact virus spread and transmission while many epidemiological features of sars-cov-2 still need to be resolved there are many features of transmission that appear to align more with mers-cov than sars-cov one component of transmission is the reproductive number r0 which is currently thought to be approximately 2030 for sars-cov-2 broadly in line with than for sars-cov and while mers-cov has a low r0 in humans  1 it is high in camels and in outbreak situations  3 69 70 71 72 73 another study has reported that the serial interval time from the disease onset in a patient to the onset of the disease in secondary case can be estimated to be below 4 days suggesting that transmission can occur before the onset of clinical signs 74 these two parameters highlight the high transmissibility of the sars-cov-2 one notable feature of the s protein s1s2 cleavage site was first observed during the purification of the mhv s protein for structural analysis 42 mhv with an intact cleavage loop was unstable when expressed and so we consider that the s1s2 loop controls virus stability likely via access to the down-stream s2 site that regulates fusion peptide exposure and activity as such it will interesting to monitor the effects of s1s2 loop insertions and proteolytic cleavability in the context of virus transmission in addition to virus entry pathogenesis and evolution amino acid sequences

respiratory syndrome related coronavirus sarsr-cov 121 sequences of beta coronavirus 97 sequences of middle east respiratory syndrome related coronavirus mersr-cov 19 sequences of human coronavirus hku1 9 sequences of murine hepatitis virus 4 of rousettus bat coronavirus hku9 3 of rat coronavirus and one wgs of tylonycteris bat coronavirus hku4 zariabatcoronavirus and longquan rl rat coronavirus to this reference dataset we added 47 whole genomes of the current coronavirus 2019 2019-ncov outbreak that originated in wuhan china in december 2019 the 2019-ncov sequences were downloaded from the gisaid database httpswwwgisaidorg together with annotation of its original location collection date and originating and submitting laboratory the 2019-ncov data generators are properly acknowledged in the acknowledgements section of this paper and detailed information is provided in supplementary table 1 the 431 reference wgs were aligned with muscle edgar 2004 the alignment was manually edited until a codon alignment was attained in all coding sequences cds a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree 1000 bootstrap replicates was constructed in phyml guidon  gascuel 2003 lemoine et al 2018 and a bayesian tree using mrbayes ronquist  huelsenbeck 2003 were constructed the trees were visualized in figtree rambaut 2018 we selected 25 reference sequences that represent the diversity of each well-defined phylogenetic cluster with bootstrap support of 100 and posterior probability of 1 we identified five well supported phylogenetic clusters with more than two sequences of sarsr-cov and used them to set up our automated phylogenetic classification tool cluster 1 included sars strains from the 2002 and 2003 asian outbreaks in our tool we named this cluster sars-cov outbreak 2000s but may rename it as sars-a if a new proposed naming system for sarsr-cov is adopted in the near future rambaut 2020 cluster 2 provisionally named as sars related cov includes 7 sequences from bats which did not cause large human outbreaks cluster 3 named as bat sars-covhku3 includes three wgs sampled from rhinolophus sinicus ie chinese rufous horseshoe bats cluster 4 bat sars-cov zxc21zc45 includes two sarsr-cov sampled from rhinolophus sinicus bats in zhoushan china cluster 5 provisionally named as wuhan 2019-ncov which may be renamed as sars-b includes one public sequence from the outbreak in wuhan china we identified this cluster with many sequences from gisaid but kept only this one as this is the only genbank sequence accession number mn908947 which was kindly shared by prof yong-zhen zhang and colleagues in the virologicalorg website detailed information about the phylogenetic reference datasets are available in supplementary table 2 the phylogenetic reference dataset was used to create an automated coronavirus typing tool using the genome detective framework vilsker et al 2019 fonseca et al 2019 to determine the accuracy of this tool each of the 431 test wgs was considered for evaluation ie 384 reference sequences from vipr and 47 public 2019-ncov sequences the sensitivity specificity and accuracy of our method was calculated for both species assignment and phylogenetic clustering of sarsr-cov sensitivity was computed by the formula tptpfn specificity by tntnfp and accuracy by tptntpfpfntn where tp  true positives fp  false positives tn  true negatives and fn  false negatives classifying query sequences in an automated fashion involves two steps the first step enables virus species assignments and the second which is restricted to sarsr-cov includes phylogenetic analysis the first classification analysis subjects a query sequence to blast and aga analysi aga is a novel alignment method for nucleic acid sequences against annotated genomes from ncbi refseq virus database aga deforche 2017 expands the optimal alignment algorithms of smith-waterman smith  waterman 1981 and gotoh gotoh 1982 based on an induction state with additional parameters the result is a more accurate aligner as it takes into account both nucleotide and protein scores and identifies all of the polymorphisms at nucleotide and amino acid levels in the second step a query sequence is aligned against the phylogenetic reference dataset using -add alignment option in the mafft software katoh  standley 2013 in addition a neighbor joining phylogenetic tree is constructed using the hky distance metric with gamma among-site rate variation with 1000 bootstrap replicates using paup swofford the query sequence is assigned to a particular phylogenetic cluster if it clusters monophyletically with that clade or a subset of it with bootstrap support 70 if the bootstrap support is 70 the genotype is reported to be unassigned the result of the phylogenetic and mutational analysis performed by aga is available in a detailed report this report contains an interactive phylogenetic tree and genome mapper supplementary figure 1 it also presents the virus species and cluster assignments and a detailed table that provides information about open reading frames orfs cds and proteins this table can be expanded to show nucleotide and amino acid mutations that differentiate a query sequence from their species refseq or from a sequence in the phylogenetic reference dataset all results can be exported to a variety of file formats xml csv excel nexus or fasta the genome detective coronavirus typing tool correctly classified all of the 175 sarsr-cov sequences at species level ie specificity sensitivity and accuracy of 100 furthermore all of the 47 2019-ncov wgs that were isolated in china n36 usa n  5 france n2 thailand n2 japan n1 and taiwan n1 were correctly classified at phylogenetic cluster level as 2019-ncov which may be renamed as sars-b in addition we classified with very high specificity sensitivity and accuracy ie 100 all of the 112 sars outbreak wgs of 2002 and 2003 we also achieved perfect classification ie specificity sensitivity

performance please refer to the supplementary table 3 our tool also allows detailed analysis of coding regions and proteins for each of the coronavirus species for example the analysis of the first released 2019-ncov sequence the whhuman1china2019dec genbank mn908947 demonstrated at genome level the nucleotide nt identity was 790 to the reference strain of sarsr-cov accession nc0047183 and that the envelop small membrane protein protein e is the most similar protein in total 948 7377 of the amino acids were identical the four amino acid differences were located at positions 55 t55s 56 v56f 69 69deletion and 70 g70r the spike protein protein s which can be associated with virulence was 762 identical to the reference strain of sarsr-cov supplementary table 4a interestingly there were four amino acid insertions at position 237 a237f238inshrsy genome nt position 2220222203inscatagaagttat which is just upstream from a cleavage site the most diverse coding regions were the cds sars8a and sars8b in these two regions only 30 of the amino acids were identical sars8b protein was truncated early and its cds had four stop codons supplementary table 4sa our coronavirus typing tool also allows a query sequence to be analysed against a sequence in the phylogenetic reference dataset for example the whhuman1china2019dec genbank mn908947 the identity was 875 to the bat sequence batslcovzxc21 genbank mg772934 this was one of the bat-cov sequences that were most related to n2019-cov lu et al 2020 the envelop small membrane protein protein e was 100 identical supplementary table 4b when the 2019-ncov isolated from france betacovfranceidf03732020 was analysed with our tool and compared with the 2019-ncov whhuman1china2019dec strain accession mn908947 this sequence was 999 identical and had only two nt mutations supplementary table 4c these two differences were located on positions 22551gt  26016gt which caused three amino acid mutations e2 glycoprotein protein mutation v354f 22551gt sars3a protein mutations g250v 26016gt and sars3b protein mutations v110f 26016gt detailed in supplementary table 4c-ii the analysis of a wgs in fasta format takes approximately 60 seconds we developed and released the genome detective coronavirus typing tool as a free-of-charge resource in the third week of january 2020 in order to help the rapid characterization of ncov-2019 infections this tool allows the analysis of whole or partial viral genomes within minutes it accepts assembled genomes in fasta format or raw ngs data in fastq format from illumina ion torrent pacbio or oxford nanopore technologies ont can be submitted to the genome detective virus tool vilsker et al 2019 to automatically assemble the consensus genome prior to executing the coronavirus typing tool user effort is minimal and a user can submit multiple fasta sequences at once the tool uses a novel and dynamic aligner aga to allow submitted sequences to be queried against reference genomes using both nucleotide and amino acid similarity scores this allows accurate identification of other coronavirus species and the tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally it also performs detailed analysis of the coding regions and proteins moreover it can easily be updated to add new phylogenetic clusters if new outbreaks arise or if the classification nomenclature changes the tool has been able to correctly classify all the recently released ncov-2019 genomes as well as all the 20022003 sars outbreak sequences in conclusion the genome detective coronavirus typing tool is a web-based and user-friendly software application that allows the identification and characterization of novel coronavirus genomes  multivariate analyses of codon usage of sars-cov-2 and other betacoronaviruses haogao gu daniel chu k malik peiris leo poon l   a novel coronavirus outbreak took place in wuhan hubei province china in december 2019 wang et al 2020 this novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 causes pneumonia in patients zhu et al 2020 and it has rapidly spread to other provinces in china and other countries who 2020 this novel coronavirus outbreak had raised global concern but current knowledge on the origin and transmission route of the pathogen is still limited the sars-cov-2 belongs to the genus betacoronavirus which also includes two highly virulent human coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov apart from human many animal species such as bat rat camel swine and hedgehog can be infected by different types of coronaviruses further sequence analyses of this novel and other betacoronaviruses might provide additional information to better understand the evolution of sars-cov-2 preferential codon usage is commonly seen in different organisms and it has been evident that the uneven codon usage is not neutral but related to gene expression or other selection pressures akashi and eyre-walker 1998 percudani and ottonello 1999 pepin domsic and mckenna 2008 there are two levels of codon usage biases one is at amino acid level and the other is at synonymous codon level the first one mainly originates from preferential usage of certain amino acids for example integral membrane proteins maybe enriched in hydrophobic amino acids and respective codons perriere 2002 the synonymous codon usage bias in viruses can be driven by selective pressures from the host cells wong et al 2010 fan et al 2015gu et al 2019 and studies on different viruses have shown that selection pressures can be dominant in the evolution of codon usage patterns of the virus liu et al 2011 fan et al 2015 kumar et al 2016 wang et al 2016 correspondence analysis ca is a tool for visualization high dimension discrete-state data which has been applied in many codon usage studies perriere 2002 charif et al 2005 wong et al 2010 lobry 2018 the recently developed within-group ca wca and between-group ca bca are derivatives to the conventional ca lobry 2018 and the application of block structure in these methods allows separating the codon usage bias at amino acid and synonymous codon levels as the natural history of the sars-cov-2 remains largely unknown an in-depth codon usage analysis of this newly emerging virus might provide some novel insights in this study we used both ca bca and wca to analyses codon usage patterns of 3076 betacoronavirus sequences we found sars-cov-2 and bat sarsr-cov have similar amino acid usage however our analyses suggested that the spike and membrane genes of sars-cov-2 have relatively distinct synonymous codon usage patterns to the orf1ab or nucleocapsid genes to construct a reference sequence dataset available full-length complete genome sequences of coronavirus were collected through virus pathogen resource database httpswwwviprbrcorgbrchomespgdecoratorcorona accessed 13 july 2019 ticket 958868915368 the sequences were filtered by the following steps 1 remove sequences without protein annotation 2 keep only sequences with complete set of desired replicase and structural proteins sequences coding for orf1ab spike membrane and nucleocapsid 3 filter out sequences that are unusually long and short 130 or 70 of the median length for each group of gene sequences 4 limit our analysis to genus betacoronavirus and 5 concatenate orf1a and orf1b sequences to form orf1ab if necessary the final dataset comprised 769 individual strains 3076 individual gene sequences that contain complete sets of coding regions for orf1ab spike membrane and nucleocapsid genes the sequences for envelope gene were not included in the analysis because of the short length and potential bias in codon usage corresponding metadata for the sequences were extracted by the sequence name field twenty-four complete genome sequences of the newly identified sars-cov-2 and its phylogenetically close relatives were retrieved from genbank and gisaid accessed 22 jan 2020 six genomes in this study

count for every gene sequence input for the ca was calculated by the synmut gu and poon 2019 package the implementation of the different correspondence analyses in this study was performed by functions in the package ade4 dray and dufour 2007 three stop codons taa tag and tga were excluded in the ca correspondence analysis ca is a dimension reduction method applied to a contingency table that is well suited for amino acid and codon usage analysis the concept in ca is similar to pearsons 2 test ie the expected counts are calculated under the hypothesis of independence based on the observed contingency table with the deduced expected count table the 2 distance supplementary method can be used to evaluate the difference between two observations the total inertia calculated from the 2 distance is proportional to the statistic used in pearsons 2 test lobry 2018 the pearson residuals were applied in the ca as input for singular value decomposition suzuki et al 2008 and resulted eigenvalues were visualized and interpreted in the study k-means clustering k  7 was performed based on the results from ca analysis to provide quantitative measurement on the proximity between data points all the correspondence analyses in this study were performed individually for each gene to achieve better resolution on gene specific codon usage pattern in contrast to the previous global ca the within-block ca benzcri 1983 wca can segregate the effects of different codon compositions in different amino acids by introducing a block structure into the analysis wca becomes model of choice for analysing synonymous codon usage in recent years as it is more robust than other traditional methods eg ca with relative codon frequency or ca with relative synonymous codon usage values perriere 2002 suzuki et al 2008 wca focuses on the within-amino acid variability and it technically excludes the variation of amino acid usage differences the implementation of wca was based on the existing global ca with additional information for factoring details included in supplementary method  between-group ca bca is complementary to wca and it focuses on the between-group variability bca can be interpreted as the ca on amino acid usage we used bca in this study to investigate the amino acid usage pattern in different coronaviruses the grand average of hydropathy gravy score provides an easy way to estimate the hydropathy character of a protein kyte and doolittle 1982 it was used in this study as a proxy to identify proteins that are likely to be membrane-bound proteins the gravy score was calculated in a linear form on codon frequencies as
s i164ifiwhere i is the coefficient for a particular amino acid provided by data exp in seqinr package charif and lobry 2007 encoded by codon i fi correspond to the relative frequency of codon i a total of 3076 individual gene sequences passed the filtering criteria and were included in this study viral sequences from three different species middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus mersr-cov betacoronavirus 1 sars-related coronavirus sarsr-cov were the three most dominant species see supplementary fig s1 in the filtered dataset four conserved protein sequence encoding regions of betacoronavirus were analysed separately the median lengths of the studied sequence regions were 21237 nt for orf1ab gene 4062 nt for spike gene 660 nt for membrane gene and 1242 nt for nucleocapsid gene spike gene has the lowest average and median g  c contents among these four genes median 3745 3731 4260 and 4722 for orf1ab spike membrane and nucleocapsid respectively the gc contents of the orf1ab and spike genes were found distributed in bi-modal patterns and the g  c contents of sars-cov-2 were found located at the lesser half of the data of these two genes the g  c contents for membrane and nucleocapsid genes of studied viral sequences were distributed in unimodal pattern fig 1a the overall amino acid and codon usage of the dataset are plotted in an ascending order fig 2 we observed that leucine and valine were the two most frequently used amino acids in the four studied genes while tryptophan histidine and methionine were the three least used ones we also found that codons ending with cytosine or guanine were generally less frequent than the codons ending with adenine or thymine this pattern of uneven usage in synonymous codons is in accordance with the g  c content distribution results codons ending with guanine or cytosine were less frequently observed we found a substantial bias in amino acid usage among these four genes and this bias is well explained by the hydropathy of the encoded proteins collectively results from global ca on all the four genes data not shown we discovered that the nucleocapsid protein sequences had significantly lower gravy scores when compared with those from other genes while the membrane protein sequences had highest gravy scores fig 1b of all the four global correspondence analyses for the four genes the extracted first factors explained more than 50 per cent of the total variance see supplementary fig s2 the first two factors in orf1ab global ca represented 677 and 168 per cent of total inertia similarly the first two factors of the spike membrane and nucleocapsid global ca represented 510 and 185 per cent 526 and 202 per cent and 548 and 142 per cent respectively of total inertia with only these two factors we could extract 70 per cent of the variability of the overall codon usage for each studied gene these levels of representations were higher than or similar to those deduced from other codon usage analyses zhou et al 2005 suzuki et al 2008lobry 2018 the data points in global ca analysis are shown in different colours that represent different features of the sequences eg viral host or viral species there were no neighbouring human viruses in the same k-means cluster around sars-cov-2 in ca results of orf1ab spike and membrane fig 3 supplementary fig 3a suggesting that the overall codon usage of sars-cov-2 in the orf1ab spike or membrane gene was significantly different from those of human betacoronaviruses in contrast the nucleocapsid genes of sars coronavirus and sars-cov-2 are found to be relatively similar supplementary fig s3a except for the nucleocapsid gene virus sequences adjacent to the sars-cov-2 were all from bat coronaviruses coloured in purple in fig 3 the five groups of viral sequences sars-cov-2 betacoronavirus 1 human coronavirus hku 1 mers-cov and sars-cov were well separated from each other in three genes except that in nucleocapsid sars-cov-2 and sars-cov have similar overall codon usage we also found that sars-cov codon usage processed more similarity to sars-cov-2 compared with the other three types of human coronaviruses ie yellow point always closest to sars-cov-2 in supplementary fig s3a compared with human coronavirus sequences the bat coronavirus sequences have more scattered codon usage even within the same viral species supplementary fig s3b some viral species in bats formed their own clusters in all four genes eg sarsr-cov sarsr-cov is a group of coronavirus that can be found in both humans and bats the codon usage of sars-cov-2 in orf1ab spike and membrane were slightly different from the sars-cov clusters and these data points are located in between sarsr-cov and other coronavirus species eg mersr-cov and bat coronavirus hku9 etc the global codon usages of bat ratg13 virus were found most similar to sars-cov-2 in orf1ab spike and nucleocapsid genes but not in membrane gene fig 3 in membrane protein pangolin p1e virus had a more similar codon usage to sars-cov-2 than all the other viruses we found the similarity in codon usage between pangolin p1e and sars-cov-2 were also high in orf1ab where p1e was the second closest data point to sars-cov-2 but this is not the case for spike and nucleocapsid genes we also observed that the codon usage pattern in spike gene was more complex than in other genes for example we found that the p1e virus was in different k-means cluster with sars-cov-2 which was not observed in the other three genes moreover data points adjacent to the spike gene of sars-cov-2 were coronaviruses not only from bat and human but also from rodent hosts which is unseen in the other three genes fig 3 supplementary fig s4b although the ca results suggested relatively novel codon usage pattern it captured a large proportion of the variance between hosts or virus species this was supported by significant differences between the ca distances in both host anosim statistic r 0085 p  0001 and virus species groups anosim statistic r 0506 p  0001 the codon usage from camel swine and other coronaviruses were found to be well clustered and relatively distant to sars-cov-2 see supplementary fig s4a c and d wca and bca were used to further differentiate codon usage of these betacoronaviruses at synonymous codon usage and amino acid usage levels respectively we found that most of the variability in codon usage can be explained at synonymous codon usage level 9036 for orf1ab gene 8529 for spike gene 8371 for member gene and 8407 for nucleocapsid gene table 1 results from the bca suggested that the amino acid usage of sars-cov-2 is closely related to bat and human sarsr-covs in all four genes figs 4b and 5b specifically we discovered that the sars-cov-2 had amino acid usage pattern most similar to bat ratg13 virus followed by pangolin p1e bat covvzc45 and bat covzxc21 the sequences of btky72 and bm48-31 were from a more phylogenetically distant clade and accordingly they had relatively distinct amino acid usage to sars-cov-2 as expected in all four studied genes this result agrees with the result in the full-genome phylogenetic analysis supplementary fig s5 the difference between sars-cov-2 and ratg13 at synonymous codon usage level was marginal in orf1ab and nucleocapsid sequences however our results suggest the synonymous codon usage patterns in the spike and membrane gene of sars-cov-2 are different from those of its genetically related viruses ie ratg13 and other reference relatives for example the pangolin p1e virus was not grouped in the same k-means cluster with sars-cov-2 in spike and the synonymous codon usage pattern of sars-cov-2 was found to be closer to a cluster of rodent murine coronaviruses at the first two factorial levels figs 4a and 5a further analysis on spike gene however suggested that the codon usage of sars-cov-2 and rodent murine coronaviruses were distinct at the third factorial level supplementary fig s6a the results show that although ratg13 became the most adjacent to sars-cov-2 when adding the third dimension wca values our results suggest a complex genomic background in the spike gene of sars-cov-2 which made its synonymous codon usage harder to differentiate from other genomic sequences in our wca analysis the distances between k-means clusters are smaller despite the relative proximity between ratg13 and sars-cov-2 at three-dimensional level they were still at significantly different positions supplementary fig s6a it is evident that the synonymous codon usage pattern of sars-cov-2 is distinct from other bat origin coronaviruses the difference in synonymous codon usage is largely explained by the first factor more than 50 and our analysis on codon usages suggest that the first factor maybe highly related to the preferential usage of codons ending with cytosine supplementary fig s7 we also had similar observation for the membrane gene our three-dimensional analysis revealed that the synonymous codon usage of sars-cov-2 in membrane was most similar to p1e and covzxc21 supplementary fig s6b it is worth noting that comparing to ratg13 p1e and covzxc21 had lower synonymous codon usage similarity to sars-cov-2 in the other three genes overall our wca results support a more complex synonymous codon usage background on spike and membrane genes though we identified unique codon usage patterns of sars-cov-2 on these two genes codon usage can be affected by many sequence features including nucleotide composition dinucleotide composition amino acid preference host adaption etc hershberg and petrov 2008 suzuki et al 2008 gu et al 2019 the codon usages of viral sequences can vary by genes and host origins jenkins and holmes 2003 wong et al 2010 cristina et al 2015 the bias in codon usage is a unique and distinctive characteristic that can reflect the signature of a genomic sequence codon usage analyses are often complementary to ordinary sequence alignment-based analyses that focus on the genetic distance at nucleotide level whereas codon usage analyses enable capturing signals at different sequence parameters therefore codon usage bias can be another good proxy for identifying unique traits eg virus origin host origin or some functions of proteins of a genome the goal of this study was to investigate the codon usage bias of betacoronaviruses by studying the codon usages of these viruses in a systematic manner we identified viral sequences carrying traits similar to those of sars-cov-2 which provided useful information for studying the host origin and evolutionary history of sars-cov-2 the codon usage of different genes in betacoronaviruses is very different the g  c content especially the gc3 content is known to be influential to the codon usage of some bacteria and viruses perriere 2002 gu et al 2004 woo et al 2010 the gc3 content has pronounced effects on our wca analysis of the orf1ab and spike genes the gc3 content was found correlated with high wca values on the first factor of orf1ab in contrast codons ending with cytosine had lower factorial values in the spike gene analysis supplementary fig s7 the g  c contents in membrane and nucleocapsid genes were less suppressed fig 1a this can be partly explained by the fact that membrane and nucleocapsid are two genes with shorter lengths which may limit the flexibilities for mutation or codon usage adaptation in addition to global ca analysis the application of wca and bca can eliminate the effects caused by amino acid compositions and synonymous codon usage respectively these alternative analytical tools were important because the amino acid sequences are expected to be more conserved such that they can preserve biological functions of the translated genes in contrast mutations at synonymous level tend to be more frequent as most of these codon alternatives do not affect the biological function of a protein of all the existing genomes in the dataset ratg13 best matched the overall codon usage pattern of the sars-cov-2 although the sars-cov-2 had amino acid usage similar to bat and human sarsr-covs the synonymous codon usages between them were relatively different which indicates similar protein characteristics but maybe different evolutionary histories the codon usage of bat coronaviruses is more scattered than coronaviruses of other hosts this result agrees with the fact that bat is a major host reservoir of coronavirus calisher et al 2006 thus it harbours coronaviruses with more complex genomic backgrounds sars-cov-2 was first identified in human but its codon usage pattern is very different from those of other human betacoroanviruses supplementary fig s3a in fact the codon usage at both the amino acid level and synonymous level denote that the orf1ab gene in sars-cov-2 had closest relationship to sarsr-cov especially ratg13 the covzx45 and covzxc21 had similar amino acid usage but relatively different synonymous codon usage to sars-cov-2 fig 4 besides bat-origin sarsr-cov the pangolin p1e also had similar codon usage to sars-cov-2 both at amino acid and synonymous codon levels the result in orf1ab is in accordance with the full-genome phylogenetic analysis supplementary fig s5 showing a close relationship between sars-cov-2 and ratg13 by the overall backbone of the genome the s protein is responsible for receptor binding which is important for viral entry the genetic variability is extreme in spike gene gallagher and buchmeier 2001 and this highly mutable gene may possess more information about recent evolution history in our results the synonymous codon usage of sars-cov-2 in spike gene was distinct from those of p1e and other phylogenetic relatives fig 4a which was not observed in orf1ab or nucleocapsid gene although the codon usage in spike of sars-cov-2 ratg13 and p1e were similar at amino acid level the difference at synonymous codon usage level indicates that they are unlikely to share a very recent common ancestor it is more likely that sars-cov-2 ratg13 and p1e might have undergone different evolution pathways for a certain period of time the amino acid usage of sars-cov-2 in membrane was clustered with bat sarsr-cov however the synonymous codon usage of sars-cov-2 was still distinct to these bat coronaviruses notably in membrane gene pangolin p1e had a more similar synonymous codon usage to sars-cov-2 than ratg13 these findings suggest that there may be different selection forces between genes our result supports different evolutionary background or currently unknown host adaption history in sars-cov-2 the codon usage of sars-cov-2 in nucleocapsid gene was similar to bat sarsr-cov both at amino acid level and synonymous level suggesting that no highly significant mutation happened in this gene codon usage can be shaped by many different selection forces including the influence from host factors some researchers have hypothesized that the codon usage in sars-cov-2 maybe directly correlated to the codon usage of its host ji et al 2020 however our recent study on influenza a viruses implied that these may not be the most influential factors shaping the codon usage of a viral genome gu et al 2019 our analysis took advantage of the existing genomes of betacoronavirus to study the complex host effect on codon usage which warrants more accurate but relatively conserved estimation however we also understand that the results from codon usage analysis cannot be deterministic or direct evidence revealing the origin of the virus as the number of available genomic data is currently limited and virus with high 99 genetic similarity to sars-cov-2 was yet to be identified we cannot draw a conclusion on the origin of sars-cov-2 at this stage another potential limitation of the study maybe from the ca method itself although ca have been widely applied in codon usage studies in many different organisms the codon usage data are usually not independent observations the phylogenetic relationship among observations make it hard to differentiate source of the codon usage bias as the codon usage bias may both affected by selective pressures and descent relationships unfortunately there is currently no established method for adjusting phylogenetic relationships in ca analysis in codon usage data an alternative method addressing the above concern is needed  a distinct phylogenetic cluster of indian sars-cov-2 isolates sofia banu bani jolly payel mukherjee priya singh shagufta khan lamuk zaveri sakshi shambhavi namami gaur rakesh mishra k vinod scaria  divya sowpati  tej  from an isolated epidemic covid-19 has now emerged as a global pandemic the availability of genomes in the public domain following the epidemic provides a unique opportunity to understand the evolution and spread of the sars-cov-2 virus across the globe the availability of whole genomes from multiple states in india prompted us to analyse the phylogenetic clusters of genomes in india we performed whole-genome sequencing for 64 genomes making a total of 361 genomes from india followed by phylogenetic clustering substitution analysis and dating of the different phylogenetic clusters of viral genomes we describe a distinct phylogenetic cluster clade i  a3i of sars-cov-2 genomes from india which encompasses 41 of all genomes sequenced and deposited in the public domain from multiple states in india globally 35 of genomes which till date could not be mapped to any distinct known cluster fall in this newly defined clade the cluster is characterized by a core set of shared genetic variants -c6312a t2016k c13730t a88va97v c23929t and c28311t p13l further the cluster is also characterized by a nucleotide substitution rate of 14 x 10 -3 variants per site per year lower than the prevalent a2a cluster and predominantly driven by variants in the e and n genes and relative sparing of the s gene epidemiological assessments suggest that the common ancestor emerged in the month of february 2020 and possibly resulted in an outbreak followed by countrywide spread as evidenced by the low divergence of the genomes from across the country to the best of our knowledge this is the first comprehensive study characterizing the distinct and predominant cluster of sars-cov-2 in india  since the emergence of the outbreak in the chinese city of wuhan in late 2019 the novel coronavirus disease has spread widely to become a global pandemic with over 5000000 individuals infected worldwide and resulting in the death of over 300000 individuals as of 26 may 2020 1 the causative virus sars-cov-2 is a member of the genus betacoronavirus during its transmission the virus has differentiated into at least 10 clades globally and is continuously evolving 2 this has implications in genetic epidemiology surveillance contact tracing and the development of long term strategies for mitigation of this disease 3 the recent availability of whole-genome sequences of the sars-cov-2 from across the world deposited in public databases provides an unprecedented opportunity to understand the dynamics and evolution of the pathogen the availability of genomic data in a public repository like gisaid 4 also provides wider access to the resources and enables researchers across the globe to address pertinent hypotheses likewise this gave us a unique scope to understand the introduction evolution and spread of the virus in india and understand it in the context of global clades circulating across the world in this manuscript we report the sequences of sars-cov-2 isolates predominantly sampled from the state of telangana further we systematically analysed the phylogenetic clusters of genomes from india and characterised a unique cluster of sequences clade ia3i which could not be classified into any of the previously annotated global clades isolates forming this cluster were predominant in a number of states and potentially characterized by a shared set of four genetic variants the cluster potentially arose from a single outbreak followed by a rapid spread across the country to the best of our knowledge this is the first comprehensive report of the novel and predominant cluster of sequences from india and suggests its distribution beyond india in many countries in the middle east south asia and oceania sample collection and rna purification samples were collected and processed as per the guidelines of the institutional ethics committee nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs collected in viral transport media were used for rna isolation samples were anonymised by removing all patient identifiers except for gender age collection date and symptoms where applicable sars-cov-2 nucleic acids were isolated from 300 l viral transport media using the qiaamp viral rna mini kit qiagen according to the manufacturers protocol samples were eluted in 50 l nuclease-free water and stored in -80c until further use shotgun rna sequencing 100ng of rna was taken as input for rrna depletion using truseq ribozero gold kit illumina following rrna depletion and fragmentation rna was converted to cdna and processed for ngs library prep using truseq stranded total rna library prep kit illumina library profiles were analyzed using bioanalyzer and sequenced on illumina novaseq 6000 at a depth of 30 million reads per sample a modified version of the ncov-2019 sequencing protocol as described by josh quick 2020 was used to amplify the viral genome 5 briefly a combination of random hexamers anchored oligodt23 and the 98r primer from ncov-2019v3 primer set were used to synthesize the first strand according to the reaction conditions mentioned in the protocol next a 3-step multiplex pcr was carried out to amplify the viral genome using ncov-2019v3 primer pools 1 and 2 the400 bp amplicons thus obtained in two pools were combined purified using agencourt ampure xp beads beckman coulter and eluted in 30 l elution buffer qiagen around 100 ng of purified amplicons were used for library preparation dna libraries were prepared using either the qiaseq fx dna library kit qiagen or nextera dna flex library prep kit illumina according to the manufacturers protocol paired-end sequencing 2x150bp was performed on the novaseq 6000 illumina with a targeted depth of 2 million reads per sample 20000x coverage raw image data was basecalled using bcl2fastq v220 with --no-lane-splitting option enabled qc of the fastq files was performed using fastqc v0117 and adaptorspoor quality bases were trimmed using trimmomatic 6  7 reads were aligned to the reference genome mn9089473 using hisat2 8 consensus sequence from the bam file was derived using seqtk and bcftools 9 samtools depth command was used to calculate the coverage across the genome with the options -a and -d 50000 10 the sequences were deposited in gisaid the complete list of accessions is detailed in supplementary data 1 the datasets of indian sars-cov-2 genomes deposited in gisaid till 25 may 2020 were used for the analysis the samples sample annotations originating and submitting institutions are listed in supplementary data 2 further 10 high-quality genomes from each of the 10 clades respectively as annotated by nextstrain were retrieved from gisaid and used in the analysis a stringent quality criteria was employed for considering the genomes for evaluation of the nucleotide substitution rates molecular clock and phylogenetic clustering as these would be sensitive to the quality of genomes for this the individual samples were systematically aligned to the wuhan-hu-1 reference genome nc045512 using emboss needle 11 samples which had ns  1 andor gaps  1 of the sequence length andor degenerate bases were removed from the analysis similarly if a submitting laboratory had 90 samples annotated as low quality all the data from the laboratory was removed from the analysis samples having an ambiguous date of collection were also removed from the analysis after the initial high-quality analysis all genomes originating from india irrespective of the quality criteria were considered for computation of the proportions of clades in each of the states a compendium of problematic genomic loci was compiled from a previous study and from the protocol specified by nextstrain 12 13 these positions were masked in all the genomes this compendium included 36 variants and is available as supplementary data 3 phylogenetic analysis of the samples was performed as detailed previously following the standard protocol for analysis of sars-cov-2 genomes provided by nextstrain 13  14 the sequences were clustered using augur the phylodynamic pipeline provided by nextstrain 15 the sequences were aligned against the wh1 reference genome using mafft and spurious variant positions were masked from the alignment 16 the initial phylogenetic tree was constructed using iqtree following the augur tree implementation 17 the raw tree was further processed with augur to construct a timetree annotate ancestral traits infer mutations and identify clades the resulting tree was viewed using nextstrain most recent common ancestor the substitution rate of ncov-2 was estimated using beast v1104 following a methodology described previously 18 19 the masked alignment file was used as input to estimate a strict molecular clock and a coalescent growth rate model exponential growth mcmc was run for 50 million steps and burn-in was adjusted to attain a suitable effective sample size ess times to the most recent common ancestor tmrca for the individual clusters were also computed by bayesian coalescent analysis using beast all runs were executed using the hky substitution model with gamma-distributed rate variation gamma categories4 a strict molecular clock and a coalescent growth rate model mcmc was run for steps as described above the log output of each mcmc run was analysed in tracer v171 20 the priors used for each parameter in the analysis are given in supplementary data 4 the variants were also evaluated for the functional consequences using the sorting intolerant from tolerant sift 21 sift prediction database for sars-cov-2 was built using the genome annotations for the wh1 reference genome nc045512 a sift score of 00 to 005 was interpreted to have a deleterious effect while scores in the range 005 to 10 were predicted to be tolerated the functional effects of protein variants identified in the clades were assessed using the provean web server using the protein sequences of the wuhan-hu-1 genome as reference and a default threshold value of -25 22 additionally phylop conservation scores and base-wise gerp rejected substitutions scores rs scores for the variants were also computed 23 24 sites having positive phylop scores are predicted to be conserved while negative scores are indicative of fast-evolving sites positive gerp scores were considered indicative of a site under evolutionary constraint while negative scores indicate neutrally evolving sites the variants were also checked for overlaps with immune epitope predictions as given on ucsc genome browser for sars-cov-2 the samples sequenced encompass 64 genomes in total majorly collected from the state of telangana the age of the patients ranged from 10-73 years with 80 54 out of 64 within the age bracket of 20-60 years fig s1a  a total of 61 samples were sequenced using an amplicon-based approach with a target of2 million paired-end reads per sample we could achieve an average coverage of 1000x in all cases with a uniform representation from all amplicons fig s1b top s1c  3 samples were sequenced using a shotgun sequencing approach and had an average coverage of approximately 100x however the coverage across the genome was uniform fig s1b bottom  the samples and metadata for the isolates sequenced and deposited in the public domain are summarised in supplementary data 1 a total of 361 genome sequences of the sars-cov-2 were available for analysis as of 25th may 2020 from india including the genomes sequenced by our group after stringent analysis of the sequence quality and removal of all sequences which did not meet the quality criteria the dataset resulted in a total of 213 genomes submitted from 7 institutions including 55 out of our 64 genomes supplementary data 2 summarises the genomic data considered for the analysis submitting institutions quality criteria used for inclusionexclusion and the acknowledgements the genomes isolated from india were found to be classified under 5 clusters 4 of these clusters are known clades identified by nextstrain a2a a3 b and b4 13 the first and the major cluster encompassed 133 62 of genomes which fell into the a2a clade of the sars-cov-2 genome the clade was represented by samples derived from multiple states across the country including gujarat west bengal maharashtra tamil nadu and telangana the second-largest cluster consisted of 62 genomes 29 this cluster of sequences could not be classified into any of the 10 clade sequences defined by nextstrain 13 we further evaluated the nucleotide compositions which define each of the 10 clustersclades worldwide and compared this to the nucleotide composition of the clade in question our analysis suggests that the nucleotide compositions which define the 10 clades were absent in the clade of question this cluster was found to have diverged from the a1a and a3 clades and most but not all of the sequences shared a variant l3606f in orf1a with members of the a3 and a1a clades we propose to call this the a3i clade in cognisance of this fact to avoid potential conflict with the nomenclature followed by nextstrain we therefore define this cluster of sequences as clade ia3i for the unique occurrence as a dominant cluster amongst sars-cov-2 genome sequences from india and also since this clade is largely formed by sequences from india the other clusters encompassed the a3 b4 and b clades with 13 3 and 1 genomes each falling into the respective clusters figure 1 summarises the different phylogenetic clusters of the genomes from india  systematic analysis of members of the cluster revealed that a set of unique genetic variants defined the core cluster a discriminant analysis was performed for all variants in any genome defined by the cluster of sequences a unique combination of four variants c6312a c13730t c23929t and c28311t was found to be shared by a majority of members of the cluster a total of 60 genomes of the 62 genomes 968 in the cluster shared the combination of variants this unique combination of variants was shared by none of the other genomes which were assigned to any other clade we further analysed the global datasets for identifying the genomes which displayed matches for 44 variants which defined the clade ia3i our prospective search retrieved a total of 21 high-quality genomes  supplementary data 5  of the retrieved genomes the largest number of genomes originated from singapore which had 5 genomes and constituted 8 of the high-quality genomes from singapore the other genomes originated from a number of countries including australia brazil brunei canada china gambia guam philippines saudi arabia slovenia and taiwan the members in the cluster however contributed to a much smaller proportion of the cladesclusters identified in the respective countries of these 4 were sampled from a date earlier than the earliest sample of this cluster from india and were from australia brazil canada and saudi arabia mutation rates were calculated for the indian sequences using beast with the wh1 genome as the root our analysis suggests that the substitution rate is 164  10 -3 95 hpd 141  10 -3 -188  10 -3  substitutions per site per year for the entire indian sars-cov-2 genomes put together this also confirms the estimates previously made 25 the substitution rate was also computed for the individual clades the gene-wise substitution rates were also similarly calculated for the major clusters the analysis suggests that the ia3i clade has a nucleotide substitution rate of 14 x 10 -3 variants per site per year compared to the estimate of 165 x 10 -3 variants per site per year for the prevalent a2a clade and 164 x 10 -3 variants per site per year for all the high quality genomes from india analysed the nucleotide substitution rate suggests that the evolution of the ia3i clade is largely determined by changes in the structural proteins -nucleocapsid n and envelope e genes compared to the a2a the globally predominant clade which is determined by changes in the spike s and membrane m genes table 1  table 1 nucleotide substitution rates of the different structural protein genes and genome-wide across the different clusters and clades in india the estimates for b and b4 were not computed since the clades had only 3 and 1 genomes respectively from india the date of the most recent ancestor for the dataset of all indian sars-cov-2 genomes with wh1 genome sequence included was computed using beast the median tmrca was found to be 11 december 2019 95 hpd 26 november to 25 december confirming the previous estimates of the origin of the epidemic in wuhan city of china 26 tmrca for the ia3i clade as well as the a2a clade which constituted the majority of samples was also computed the clade a2a which is the predominant clade in india had a tmrca of 2nd jan 2020 95 hpd interval 13 dec 2019 -22 jan 2020 while the clade ia3i had a tmrca of 8 feb 2020 95 hpd interval 17 jan 2020 -25 feb 2020 of the four variants which characterise the clade ia3i three of the variants caused an amino acid change non-synonymous additionally all variants which defined the other clades were compiled the nonsynonymous variants were analysed for potential functional consequences using the sorting intolerant from tolerant sift and protein variant effect analyser provean 21  22 sift prediction database for sars-cov-2 was built using the genome annotations for the wh1 reference genome nc045512 additionally phylop and gerp conservation scores were also computed for the variants 23 24 the variants and their respective predictions are summarised in table 2  majority of the variants which defined other clades were predicted to be neutral by provean with the exception of g251v which defines the a1a clade three variants which define clade ia3i c6312a c13730t and c28311t resulted in amino acid changes with potentially deleterious functional consequences as predicted by sift and mapped to quite conserved genomic loci in the sars-cov-2 genome  table 2   one of these variants a97v in the rdrp protein corresponds to a88v in orf1b is located in its niran domain which is suggested to be important in rna binding and nucleotidylation activity 27 both sift and provean analyses table 2 suggest that the effect of this mutation is deleterious in nature however as both alanine and valine are hydrophobic amino acids the exact effect of the mutation needs to be experimentally validated of notable significance is the p13l variant c28311t in the nucleocapsid protein which is required for the viral entry into the cells the variant maps to the idr domain of the n protein and sift predicts the variant to be deleterious though the provean analysis categorized it as a neutral mutation  table 2  two of the variants c6312a in orf1a and c13730t in orf1b also mapped to immune epitope predictions hla-a0201 binding peptides from netmhc 40 available on ucsc genome browser and as listed on ucsc genome browser for sars-cov-2 28 the potential consequences of the variants in the immune response could not be ascertained  the presence of a short tree of clade ia3i with divergence from a single point suggests a single point of introduction 29 the single point of divergence also suggests that the origin and spread of the cluster were possibly from a single outbreak figure 3   the clustering of samples in feb 2020 suggests a rapid spread spanning multiple regions across the country the first sequence from the cluster in india was gmc-kn4432020 accession id  epiisl431103  genomic evolution coupled with the appropriate tools like genome sequencing provides a unique opportunity to understand the spread and evolution of pathogens 30 31 the recent emergence of covid-19 as a global pandemic and the emergence of the open data for sars-cov-2 genomes from across the globe facilitated by genomic databases like genbank and gisaid has truly opened up new opportunities to understand the pathogen and its spread and evolution at an unprecedented rate 4 32 whole-genome sequencing of sars-cov-2 has also been extensively used in understanding epidemics at a macro-level as well as at micro-levels at hospitals 33 in this report we describe a distinct cluster of sequences from genomes of sars-cov-2 sequenced and deposited from multiple laboratories across india which we classify as the ia3i clade this distinct cluster could not be classified into any of the 10 clade annotations as described by nextstrain and was characterized by a unique combination of four variants which was shared by over 92 of the isolates falling in the cluster the cluster was predominantly found in genomes from india though additional members could also be found from genomes deposited in other countries they form a minor proportion of the genomes from the respective countries the indian genomes constituted63 of the global genomes for this cluster in-depth analysis of the genome cluster suggests a comparable rate of nucleotide substitutions with other predominant clades though a gene-wise estimate of substitution suggests a distinct mode of evolution driven by the nucleocapsid n and envelope e genes and sparing of the spike s gene in contrast to predominant diversity in the spike s and membrane protein m genes in a2a clade the globally predominant clade 34 however it has not escaped our attention that host genetic factors could modulate the evolution of the virus genome and without large-scale host-genomic studies the causal relationships cannot be conclusively established the cluster suggests a potential single introduction in february followed by a country-wide spread mostly affecting the south indian states as evidenced by the tmrca as well as the short cluster our analysis suggests that the clade ia3i was represented in almost all states from which genomes are available barring a few members of the clade ia3i formed the predominant class of isolates from the states of tamil nadu telangana maharashtra and delhi and the second largest in membership in bihar karnataka uttar pradesh west bengal gujarat and madhya pradesh put together the cluster of genomes clade ia3i forms a distinct cluster predominantly found amongst indian sars-cov-2 genomes with limited representation outside the region to the best of our knowledge this is the first comprehensive study characterizing the distinct and predominant cluster of sars-cov-2 in india this report also

and characterization of point mutations in the sars-cov-2 genome jun-sub kim jun-hyeong jang jeong-min kim yoon-seok chung cheon-kwon yoo myung-guk han   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 emerged in wuhan china in late december 2019 since then it has rapidly spread across the world and was finally declared as a public health emergency of international concern pheic by the world health organization on january 30th 2020 1 sars-cov-2 is taxonomically classified under nidovirales order coronaviridae family coronavirinae subfamily and betacornoavirus genus it is an enveloped virus with non-segmented positive-sense single-stranded rna although sars-cov-2 presents with a lower pathogenicity than severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov which emerged in 20022003 and middle-east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov which emerged in 2012 it reveals more rapidly human-to-human transmission 2 the genome of sars-cov-2 consists of non-segmented rna that includes a 5 untranslated region utr structural proteins non-structural proteins several accessory proteins open reading frames and a 3 utr the orf1ab of several orfs is proteolytically cleaved into 16 putative non-structural proteins nsp116 for genome maintenance and replicase complex formation in viral replication the structural proteins essential in viral particles include the spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n proteins the receptor-binding domain rbd of the s protein is crucial for binding directly to the human receptor ace2 inducing viral entry and determining host tropism and transmission capacity 35 the s protein is cleaved into 2 subunits s1 and s2 the s1 subunit directly recognizes and attaches to human receptor ace2 while s2 fuses the host cell membrane with viral membranes allowing entry of sars-cov-2 6 in general rna viruses like sars-cov-2 undergo rapid mutation enabling evolutionary and genetic diversity which result in alterations such as viral transmissibility receptor affinity host tropism and pathogenicity in recent years several studies based on mutation analysis of sars-cov-2 genome have attempted to understand phylogenetic relationships host infectivity human-to-human transmission viral tropism and pathogenicity of sars-cov in humans firstly the comparative evolutionary diversity in point mutations synonymous-non-synonymous mutations are suggestive that sars-cov-2 should to be classified into 3 major clades s g and v and other clades according to amino acid changes 79 secondly the high affinity and stable structure of rbdace2 have been associated with amino acid variations in the rbd such as the high affinity group n354d d364y v367f and w436r 10 and the high ace2-binding affinity and stability group 484-ngvegfn-490 q496n and q496y 11 thirdly the deletion of 382 nucleotides towards the 3 end of the viral genome may have an impact on viral phenotype 12 and the qtqtn motif adjacent to the polybasic cleavage site rrar chain of amino acids at the bridge between s1 and s2 may be related to host adaptation 13 in addition insertion of the rrar which has been well known to determine high or low pathogenicity in avian influenza virus may be important in determining transmissibility and pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 14 finally primer-template mismatch has been known to affect the stability and functionality of polymerase in particular the primer-template mismatch located in the primer 3 end region can interfere with polymerase active sites and this may have a significant impact on the accuracy of the molecular diagnosis using primers or probes 15 therefore we analyzed the mutations of the sars-cov-2 genome by focusing on phylogenetic evolution rbd region deletion mutations in polybasic cleavage site and primer-template mismatches in the genome although the mechanisms responsible for rapid transmission pathogenicity and tropism in sars-cov-2 remain unclear identification of mutations in the sars-cov-2 genome may help to interpret the high infectivity of the virus with the host the set of 4254 sars-cov-2 genome sequences and acknowledgment files were downloaded from the epicov browser httpsepicovorgepi3 of the gisaid 16 the raw data were processed by removing unnecessary genome sequences with low-quality reads base calling errors unsolved nucleotides as n and small gaps to investigate the genome-wide phylogenetic analysis we recombined 12 coding sequences orf1a orf1b s m e n orf3 orf6 orf7a orf7b orf8 and orf10 excluding 5 and 3 utr low-quality sequences and strains with high sequence similarity within the same clade as a result of the processing a reference genome hcov-19wuhan-hu-12019 epiisl402125 29903 bp and 178 fully complete genomes were collected phylogenetic analysis was performed to identify evolutionary relationships across the genome by using the mega 17 with parameters such as neighbor joining method bootstrap 1000 replications for the phylogeny test kimura 2-parameter as a substitution model and pairwise deletion as gapmissing data treatment for identifying the types of point mutation synonymous and non-synonymous mutation from 4254 sequences we separately extracted 12 fully coding sequences cdss determining the sequence of amino acids in a protein from the genomes and then conducted an in-house program based on perl computer programming language to analyze mutations among the cdss and the reference genome in nomenclature for the replacement from one amino acid to a different amino acid in a gene we illustrated it as the gene name surrounded by parenthesis after the substitution of amino acids for example d614g s means that an aspartic acid is converted into a glycine at amino acid position 614 of the s gene in comparison with the reference strain hcov-19wuhan-hu-12019 for the comparative analysis of primer- and probe-template mismatches we referred several lists published

phylogenetic analysis was carried out with 178 representative strains to comprehend monophyletic distribution of the sars-cov-2 population the phylogenetic tree showed 3 major clades s g and v clades similar to previous reports by gisaid these clades s g and v clades were determined by the mutations l84s orf8 g251v orf3a and d614g s respectively figure 1 of the three mutations determining the clades the significant d614g s in g clade is located in the adjacent polybasic cleavage site but its actual function on rdbace2 affinity is unclear in addition to the three clades two subclades belonging g clade were observed and they were named g1 and g2 clades referring to their parent clade name the g1 and g2 subclades were determined by three mutations g204r n r203k n and p214l orf1b and one mutation q57h orf3a respectively figure 2 in this respect the derivation of g1 and g2 subclades from the g clade shows that a clade can be also determined by one or more mutations to identify the number and the types of mutation across a total of sars-cov-2 strains the 12 different types of cds from the 4254 strains were completely extracted in accordance with the genomic positions presented by the ncbis genbank format file sequence id nc0455122 the unsuitable sequences with base calling errors unsolved nucleotides as n and undefinable gaps were excluded a total of 47176 cdss were gathered from orf1a orf1b s m e n orf3 orf6 orf7a orf7b orf8 and orf10 we identified 767 types of synonymous and 1352 types of non-synonymous mutation from them genes with high frequency mutations were orf1a orf1b s n and orf3a orf1a showed the highest frequency mutations containing 302 types of synonymous and 530 types of non-synonymous mutation table 2 figure 3 the non-synonymous mutations with high frequency in the genes were representative mutations in the clades l84s orf8 in s clade d614g s in g clade g251v orf3a in v clade p214l orf1b r203k n and g204r n in g1 clade and q57h orf3a in g2 clade figures 4 and 5 orf1a and orf1b encode replicase polyproteins essential component of the viral rna replication therefore conserved structure of them have been the focus of antiviral drugs 18 rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp located between orf1a and orf1b is an important component for application and translation and has a functionally conserved region known as high sequence similarity 19 the conserved region of rdrp has been widely used as a target for designing primers and probes based on rt-pcr technology in genetic diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 in this regard the mutations from orf1a and orf1b were analyzed and we identified 302 types of synonymous and 530 types of non-synonymous mutation in orf1a and 179 types of synonymous and 305 types of non-synonymous mutation in orf1b also a total of 144 types of mutation were identified in the rdrp region corresponding to the 13442 to 16236 genomic position of which 56 types of synonymous and 88 types of non-synonymous mutation were detected figure 6 since the non-synonymous mutation with the highest frequency of in the rdrp region was p214l which determines the g1 subclade together with g204r and r203k of the n gene it was necessary to further study the functional interaction amongst these mutations of the orf1a and n gene on one hand 9 types of primer-template mismatch were identified in the rdrp region although it is not understood how these mismatches affect the stability of primer-template complexes it is necessary to determine the interrelationships the s gene of sars-cov-2 plays an important role in escaping the immune system of host the rbd in the s gene is directly or indirectly concerned with the binding and affinity to ace2 the strong binding between rbd and ace2 may have led to the worldwide transmission and rapid infectivity of sars-cov-2 on the other hand the rrar which is located between s1 and s2 681685 amino acid position of the s gene may be related to the pathogenicity of sars-cov-2 therefore it is might be inferred from the mutations in the rbd and the polybasic cleavage site in the s gene that the mutations will provide important clues to understanding immunity and pathogenicity of sars-cov-2 we identified 109 types of synonymous and 182 types of non-synonymous mutation in the s gene figure 7 d614g is a major non-synonymous mutation in g clade and accounts for 1764 130 in a total of 13537 non-synonymous mutations above all it is located in the s1s2 junction region near the polybasic cleavage site but its biochemical and structural relationships with ace2 has been unclear so far in the rbd region 2247823191 genomic position we found 12 types of synonymous and 27 types of non-synonymous mutation among them the d467v i468f i468t i472v g476s s477g v483a p491r y508h r509k and v510l were located within the zone 443510 amino acid position of the s gene adjacent to ace2 in particular the v483a and g476s mutations have previously been reported to be related to human receptor-binding affinity in mers and sars-cov research 20 21 we detected a r682q mutation from the rrar where arginine residue was replaced by glutamine residue the arginine residue is not only electrically charged but also strongly basic while the glutamine residue is polar uncharged therefore it is necessary to study how this biochemical difference may affect functional and structural changes of the proteins of s1 or s2 according to a recent study the fact that a deletion of the qtqtn amino acid motif near the polybasic cleavage site is related to adaptation of sars-cov-2 has been reported hence we tried to confirm whether some deletions occurred in this region 675679 amino acid position of the s gene we identified no deletion of qtqtn in this region but confirmed 5 types of non-synonymous mutation type 1 with n679y and s680p type 2 with n679k type 3 with q677h type 4 with q675h and type 5 with q675r except for type 1 type 2 to 5 had a common feature where glutamine and asparagine with a polar uncharged side chain were converted into lysine histidine or arginine with basic property although deletion of the qtqtn motif was not identified near the polybasic cleavage site it may be informative to study the functional significance of the five mutations in this region the e m orf6 orf7a orf7b orf8 and orf10 are less frequent mutations than other genes orf3a is a novel short positive protein essential to viral adaptation in vitro and is involved in the viral pathogenicity the major types of synonymous mutation of orf3a are q57h and g251v which are significant mutations in determining g2 clade and v clade respectively it is inferred from this result that q57h and g251v may have a positive effect on viral adaptation in the e gene known to be involved in viral budding along with the m gene we confirmed a relatively small number of mutations in it this means that there are high conserved regions so it seems reasonable to infer that the preserved sequence is important to encode protein participating in viral reproduction like the region of rdrp the e gene has been also used to design primers and probes for the diagnosis of sars-cov-2 we identified 10 types of synonymous and 12 types of non-synonymous mutation in the e gene figure 8 of these mutations 7 primer-template mismatch mutations 3 types of synonymous and 4 types of non-synonymous mutation occurred the m gene which is associated with cellular immunogenicity showed 28 types of synonymous and 21 types of non-synonymous mutation of which mutations with high frequency were observed as t175m and d3g several types of synonymous mutation in orf6 orf7 and orf10 were identified but mutations with high frequency were not observed however l84s in orf8 was identified as a mutation with high frequency the n gene packaging of the viral rna genome into the medical ribonucleocapsid has been regarded as a candidate target region for primers and probes like the e and rdrp genes in the n gene we detected 63 types of synonymous and 119 types of non-synonymous mutation among them r203k and g204r showed high frequencies in g2 clade together with p214l orf1b in addition 51 primer-template mismatch mutations 17 types of synonymous and 34 types of non-synonymous mutation occurred from the non-synonymous mutation is overall more frequent than the synonymous mutations in the set of 4254 sars-cov-2 genome sequences it is inferred from this results that the evolution of the sars-cov-2 has been accepted to be positive selection in consequence several point mutations may directly or indirectly influence the interaction between sars-cov-2 and human and the diversity of mutations in sars-cov-2 may enhance the evolution of the virus towards rapid transmission based on our analysis the d614g s mutation of g clade which revealed the highest frequent in our phylogenetic analysis may have a positive advantage in natural selection according to the frequency of mutations within sars-cov-2 strains orf1a orf1b s and n genes were shown at high frequency and they may advantageously evolve to adapt to not only external interactions with host cells such as recognizing a cell surface receptor attaching to the host receptor and fusing with cellular membranes but also internal interactions in host cells such as replicating and transcribing viral genome and budding by cellular exocytosis although d614g in the s gene is not a mutation within rbd the fact that it occurred as the highest frequency in all sars-cov-2 genomes suggests it may be related to host infection and transmission therefore we believe that it is necessary to continuously monitor the accumulation of mutations and to further study how these mutations affect receptor affinity propagation ability and pathogenicity on the other hand rdrp e and n genes are the target genes for designing primers and probes in rt-pcr-based sars-cov-2 diagnosis owing to their high sequence conservation it has not been known how the primer-template mismatches affect the accuracy and precision of the genetic diagnosis of covid-19 but we suggest that it is desirable to avoid the variable hotspot regions as much as possible our results about genomic mutations of sars-cov-2 strains may be helpful for interpreting the potential relationships of pathogenicity infectivity and transmission between sars-cov-2 and human host  genomics of indian sars-cov-2 implications in genetic diversity possible origin and spread of virus mainak mondal  ankita

in-depth analysis of 449 viral genomes derived from samples representing countries from usa europe china asia regions which strongly implying the spread of virus through most travelled countries the

almost reaching 24700 in india while the genome sequence of sars-cov-2 is 962 identical to a batcov ratg13 it shares with 795 similarity to sars-cov based on this virus genome sequence analysis and evolutionary analysis bat has been suspected to be the natural host of the virus origin since bats are not available at seafood markets of wuhan it is suspected that virus spread might have occurred through alternative intermediate hosts like turtles and snakes guo et al 2020  since then a total of 10478 viral isolates have been sequenced and deposited online httpswwwgisaidorg genome sequence analysis of viral genome between countries would help to understand the origin and also the severity of the disease process itself there are only two reports of sequencing of very few numbers of indian isolates of sars-cov-2 yadav et al 2020 sardar et al 2020  the diagnosis of covid-19 is largely overseen by indian council of medical research icmr government of india with diagnosis being carried out using commercial diagnostic kits in icmr approved government and private facilities httpswwwicmrnicin to identify the origin of indian isolates of sar-cov-2 virus we examined the phylogenetic data from database features of global initiative on sharing all influenza data gisaid httpswwwgisaidorg although the sequence information is available from 11919 sars-cov-2 isolates from all continents the phylogenetic data from 3123 samples which included 4 indian isolates is only available at gisaid website because of limitation with respect to single view performance and legibility reasons figure 1 supplementary   figure 1  it is of our interest to note that there are two major clusters-asian cluster represented by purple and related colours and european cluster represented by greenish yellow the indian samples represented by arrows black and white cluster with both asian cluster and european clusters it is interesting to note that while the indian samples with black arrows were isolated during january 2020 the other two samples with white arrows were isolated during march 2020 see more details later further to precisely map the origin of indian sars-cov-2 isolates we carried out an independent phylogenetic analysis using a selected set of samples representing most regions and countries where covid-19 infection rate is high our selection criteria also considered the fact that more genomes are sequenced in usa europe east asia and oceania compared to other parts of the world hence we chose a set of 449 samples derived from usa 75 europe 80 china 75 east asia 64 south asia 41 oceania 75 middle east 11 and india 28 the analysis shows interesting features about the possible source of indian sars-cov-2 samples figure 2 supplementary figure 2  in particular

indian samples provide some hint at the origin and spread of virus the first two indian viral isolates that were detected during january 2020 from patients who travelled from wuhan china showed more similarity with chinaeast asia viral isolates this conclusion is well supported by the fact that the initial outbreak of sars-cov-2 virus in wuhan happened during december 2019 zhou et al 2020  the remaining twenty-six indian viral isolates which were collected during march 2020 show more similarity with samples from europe middle east south asia and oceania regions the one month delay in the occurrence of majority of indian covid-19 cases probably indicate the time taken for the virus  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted

the indian travellers would have contracted the virus it is interesting to note that two samples epiisl420551 and epiisl420555 that are seen with european cluster in figure 1  grouped with the cluster b which is enriched with european and few numbers of middle eastsouth asian samples as per figure 2  similarly other two samples epi-isl413522 and epiisl413523 collected from patients who had travel history from wuhan china that grouped with samples from china were also identified to be associated with the major asian cluster in figure 1  thus the results of our independent phylogenetic analysis as per figure 2  are matching to that of analysis done by gisaid thus increasing the confidence in our findings according to specific variations in different viral proteins gisaid identified three clades of sars-cov-2 namely g v and s elbe and bucklan-merrett 2017  g clade is characterized by d614g in s protein and largely encompasses sequences from europe v clade is characterized by g251v in orf3 and mostly includes asian and european sequences s clade is characterized by the presence of l84s in orf8 and mostly comprises sequences from north america recently a new clade of sars-cov-2 carrying v378i in orf1ab has been linked to travellers returning from iran to australia eden et al 2020  we then investigated the genomes of indian sars-cov-2 viruses to find out the association between indian samples and different clades this analysis revealed several interesting facts figure 3  we found indian samples does not belong to either clade v or s except the sample epi-isl413522 which is one of samples derived from patient with recent travel history from wuhan the other indian sample epiisl413523 who also had travel history from wuhan does not seem to belong to any of these clades suggesting that this virus may be more similar to original wuhan-china virus however the origin of these two viral isolates needs to more investigation most indian samples are found to classify between g and i clades one set of thirteen indian samples  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the

figure 2 segregate into g clade as they carry d614g mutation in s gene another set of thirteen indian samples n13 that belong to the cluster a which are enriched with oceania samples as per figure 2 segregate into i clade as they carry v378i mutation in orf1ab gene we have also extended our viral clade analysis to recently submitted indian samples n9 from the state of karnataka due to the fact that these samples are low coverage samples they could not be included in phylogenetic analysis however clade analysis revealed three samples from this karnataka set belongs to g clade while the status of other samples could not be clearly established supplementary figure 3  we conclude from this analysis that indian samples are divided between i and g clades thus these results provide additional confirmation to our earlier findings as per figure 2 that while one set of indian samples in cluster a is more similar to oceania samples the other set of indian samples in cluster b is more similar to european samples our finding that indian sars-cov-2 isolates belong to different clades may have important consequences with respect to virus transmission rate and virulence extend of the disease severity and various other aspects of disease pathogenesis it has been reported that viruses belonging to different clades may differ in their virulence brusky 2020  for example the g clade viruses carry glycine g corresponding to the codon 614 of s protein instead of aspartic acid d in other clades phylogenetic analysis identified that d614g mutation is originated from ancestral d residue seen in the reference wuhan virus wu et al 2020  this residue is located very close to glycosylation region of the viral spike protein encoded by s gene anderson et al 2020  it has been proposed that mutations in and around glycosylation region may alter viral spike protein structure and hence the membrane fusion process resulting in varied pathogenicity and transmissibility further the difference in the death rate of covid-19 patients of east coast vs west coast of usa is implicated to their difference in their g  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a

brusky 2020  there are also many reports that mutations in spike protein of other coronaviruses alter the virulence krueger et al 2001 geoghegan and holmes 2018 ontiveros et al 2003  the presence of multiple clades of sars-cov-2 strains in a population may also have serious implications in the accuracy of diagnostic tests that are being employed worldwide the diagnostic tests based on detection of antibody or quantifying the viral rna genome does not appear to distinguish these variations consequently it is important to develop diagnostic kits based on the types of clades prevalent in an area indeed it is reported that the serology based rapid tests are ineffective in detecting coivd-19 positive cases in india and elsewhere in the world the variation created by the presence of different viral clades in a population also needs to be considered seriously in developing vaccines it has been also proposed that relaxation models of social distancing should consider the presence of one or more types of viral clades brusky 2020 collectively we conclude that the indian sars-cov-2 viruses belong to two major clades i and g based on this limited analysis the probable source of indian sars-cov-2 viruses is countries from europe and oceania regions besides middle east and south asian regions the possible spread of the sars-cov-2 virus to india through middle east countries from europe and oceania regions cannot be ruled out both a and b clusters contain samples from middle east countries in addition these samples appear to split between i and g clades supplementary figure 3  in the absence of the information related to travelcontact history of indian patients more inference and definite conclusions on the possible origin and source could not be made at present thus our result also indicate that there is a close connection between source of virus and the countries that are most travelled by indians the study also  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is

httpsdoiorg101101 highlights the power of rapid viral genome sequencing and public data sharing to improve the detection and management of pandemic diseases such as covid-19 it is important to point out that most countries in america europe oceania and east asia were quick in supporting the advanced scientific studies on the virus and disease process itself to develop treatment modalities and preventive vaccines needless to say that major countries from emerging economies such as brazil and india should support experimental research on sars-cov-2 pathogenesis certainly our analysis has clear limitations the most important one being that we were able to analyse only a small number of indian sars-cov-2 genomes while the number of covid-19 cases increased beyond 20000 further lack of travel history of the patients is another lacuna which makes the conclusions not conclusive hence it is required that more number of indian isolates of sars-cov-2 needs to be sequenced to confirm these results nevertheless our study highlights the need for large-scale community surveillance for sars-cov-2 introductions and the spread more importantly this work underscores the power of pathogen genomics to identify epidemiological understanding of the virus and the disease we have collected 28 genome sequences from indian clinical samples deposited at gisaid in addition we also collected

multi-epitope based peptide vaccine design using three structural proteins s e and m of sars-cov-2 an in silico approach arpita roy singha mahafujul islam quadery tonmoy atqiya fariha ithmam hami ibrahim khalil afif  munim adnan mohammad alam rahanur  shahadat hossain  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 is the novel coronavirus responsible for the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease  no sustainable treatment option is available so far to tackle such a public health threat therefore designing a suitable vaccine to overcome this hurdle asks for immediate attention in this study we targeted for a design of multi-epitope based vaccine using immunoinformatics tools we considered the structural proteins s e and m of sars-cov-2 since they facilitate the infection of the virus into host cell and using different bioinformatics tools and servers we predicted multiple b-cell and t-cell epitopes having potential for the required vaccine design phylogenetic analysis provided insight on ancestral molecular changes and molecular evolutionary relationship of s e and m proteins based on the antigenicity and surface accessibility of these proteins eight epitopes were selected by various b cell and t cell epitope prediction tools molecular docking was executed to interpret the binding interactions of these epitopes and three potential epitopes wtagaaayy yvysrvknl and gtitveelk were selected for their noticeable higher binding affinity scores -91 -74 and -70 kcalmol respectively targeted epitopes had 9109 population coverage worldwide in summary we identified three epitopes having the most significant properties of designing the peptide-based vaccine against sars-cov-2  history suggests that humanity is always challenged by emerging viruses and viral infections in terms of livelihood and economic progress in a population the current situation of ongoing pandemic of corona virus disease covid 19 verily supports that history the disease came to recognition by the world health organization who as a pandemic on 11 th march 2020 and has caused a global emergency across 210 countries and territories around the world and 2 international conveyances 1  as of today 11 th june 2020 at 1809 gmt 6 a confirmed report of 3295032 active infected cases with 2 criticality and 421363 deaths has been found httpswwwworldometersinfocoronavirus but the disease originated back in december 2019 in wuhan city hubei province china in the form of cluster of pneumonia like symptoms which then quickly transcended the border to spread across the globe within a short span of time 2  the causative agent behind the infection was first designated as 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov by the world health organization who 3  the novel coronavirus was further renamed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronovirus-2 or sars-cov-2 because of its genomic similarity of 795 and 96 at nucleotide level respectively with sars-cov and bat coronavirus 4 5 through phylogenetic analysis sars-cov-2 has been categorized under the family coronaviridae and order nidoviralae and has shown an origin in bat as a natural host 6 7  the sars-cov-2 is similar to the sars-cov and mers-cov of the same genus betacoronavirus within the same family in terms of infectivity in humans the latter two viruses caused pandemic situations as well in recent years and were the reasons for thousands of death across the world 8 9 10  as for the structural similarity the sars-cov-2 contains a positive single stranded rna as its genetic element having a genomic length of around 30 kilobases 11  the encoded proteins by this genome are structural and non-structural in kind and the major structural proteins are spike s glycoprotein membrane m protein envelope e protein and nucleocapsid n protein 12 13 14  especially the exposed parts of these proteins contain domains necessary for infection into the host cells and account for antigenicity the similarity between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 extends to the structure of spike glycoprotein which may be exploited for a potential vaccine design because the s protein has two major subunits namely s1 and s2 which assist during viral infection into the host cell s1 subunit contains receptor binding domain rbd and n-terminal domain ntd where rbd binds to the receptor of the host cell known as angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ace2 15 16  the envelope e protein also has its role in establishing a series of involvement from pathogenesis to viral assembly by not only interacting with the host cell protein but also maintains a defining connection with all the other structural proteins m s n proteins of the virus 17  moreover the exposed portion of m protein outside the membrane provides us an opportunity to design a suitable epitope-based subunit vaccine currently different therapeutic strategies are being utilized by the scientific community to combat this dangerous spread of covid-19 most of which are opted to develop novel drugs or vaccines chinese traditional drugs named shufengjiedu capsules and lianhua qing wen capsules had been applied to some of the preliminary cases before they were reported to be effective but no clinical trials to this date have ever proven them to be safe enough 18  some other drugs such as remdesivir and chloroquine had also been reported to be effective against covid-19 through in-vitro trials however no authentic clinical trial has justified such a claim so far 18 19 besides sars-cov-2 is dispersing too fast across almost all the countries of the world and is mutating in an unbelievable manner due to the high mutation rate in the genome of sars-cov-2 single epitope will not suffice to provide for a successful vaccine rather a multiple epitope based vaccine may do the trick here 20  at the current stage of the pandemic it will be highly insensible to develop a vaccine through classical approach in vitro that involves identification isolation and culture of pathogenic viruses following this particular process will be too expensive and time consuming which is not desirable at all given the circumstances a very sustainable way to overcome such hurdles would be to design peptide vaccine by genome and proteome analysis of the virus using computational methods since the genome and proteome sequencing of sars-cov-2 has already been done it is only rational that we take control measures by making the best out of computation-based analysis to design therapeutic targets in this study we explored the s e and m proteins of sars-cov-2 by using different in silico tools and servers to predict b-cell and t-cell epitopes to eventually design an effective epitope-based vaccine the predicted epitopes were analyzed further to check their antigenicity and surface accessibility epitope-allele interaction was investigated through molecular docking a phylogenetic analysis was undertaken to identify molecular evolutionary relationship of the selected s e and m proteins the study was concluded with the introduction of a properly designed vaccine from the most suitable of epitopes the fasta format of s e and m protein sequences of sars-cov-2 from various geographical areas australia china usa finland india sweden south korea were retrieved from national center for biotechnology information ncbi httpswwwncbinlmnihgov then the blast program from ncbi was used to derive the similar sequences against the proteins the s e and m protein sequences of sars-cov-2 sars-cov mers and common human coronavirus strains 229e nl63 oc43 and hku1 were targeted for this phylogenetic study all the sequences of the proteins retrieved from the ncbi blastp result were aligned separately through the clustalw algorithm by utilizing the mega version 1005 21 all the required parameters for the alignment analysis were used as default program in the software the aligned sequences were then visualized with the jalview version 2110 22 for the observation of consensus and conserved sequences the phylogenetic trees were built using the neighborjoining tree function and default analysis preferences in mega epitopes of a protein must be in the exposed regions to mount sufficient immune response the membrane topology of these proteins was analyzed using tmhmm v20 server23and was later cross-referenced with the interpro server 24 25  the outer membrane regions of these proteins were selected for further analysis a vaccine candidate must elicit sufficient antigenic response as

t cell epitopesconsist of a group of amino acids presented by antigen presenting cell apc in the bound form with major histocompatibility mhc molecules to mount t cell mediated immune response prediction of t cell epitopes was performed by using netctl tool which utilizes mhc binding affinity proteosomal processing tap transport 32 33 34  the tool predicts half-maximal inhibitory

three-dimensional structure of targeted t-cell epitopes were modeled by the pep-fold3server 37a peptide structure predicting tool the best 3d structure generated by this server was selected as a ligand for docking analysis molecular docking was performed by the virtual screening tool pyrx38through its autodock vina 39 40 program in order to analyze the interactions among our proposed epitopes and different hla molecules protein data bank provided most of the pdb files of hla molecules for docking study whereas phyre2 protein prediction server protein homologyanalogy recognition engine v20

non-polar hydrogen and unnecessary moleculespdbfiles were converted into pdbqt files and the default grid box parameters were maintained with exhaustiveness value 8the binding interactions of epitope-hla molecules were visualized using ucsf chimera 113rc 43  determination of population coverage for individual is essential as epitopes may exhibit variety in their binding sites during interacting with different hla allele the iedb population coverage calculation tool 44 was utilized to determine the percentage of people expected to respond to a specific number of mhc-restricted epitopes around the world one of the most prolific ways to reduce the load of viral diseases is to design novel vaccines 45 46 47 48  in terms of sars-cov-2 continuous research projects are being held to figure out the biological characteristics genomics and proteomics and pathophysiology of the virus around the world 49  immunoinformatics tools have always been a medium to develop multi-epitope based vaccines for some of the dangerous viral diseases such as rhinovirus50 dengue virus51chikungunya virus52 etc consistent with that idea this study aimed at providing for a peptide based vaccine design against sars-cov-2 using different bioinformatics tools by exploring structural proteins of virus namely spike s glycoprotein membrane m protein and envelope e protein53 54responsible for virulence mechanism and pathogenic pathways a total of 13 sequences of s protein  figure s4  13 sequences of m protein  figure s5  and 6 sequences of e protein  figure s6 were selected for analysis s e and m protein sequences from different strains of mers sars-cov sars-cov-2 table s1s3 and common human coronavirus table s2 were aligned with the phylogenetic tree construction using the built-in inclustalw algorithm in the mega version 1005 phylogenetic trees represented the ancestral molecular changes evolutionary history and the molecular evolutionary relationship on account of s m and e proteins respectively from the phylogenetic analysis of spike glycoprotein from the different strains of mers sars-cov sars-cov-2 and common human coronaviruses human coronavirus strains 229e nl63 oc43 and hku1 we noticed that their ancestral and evolutionary relationship has been comprehensive and found relatable  figure s1  analysis also showed that both human coronavirus oc43 and hku1 are closely related to mers virus whereas distantly related to the sars and sars-cov-2 on the other hand human coronavirus nl63 and 229e are closely related to each other phylogenetic analysis of the membrane proteins  figure s2  of different strains of mers sars-cov sars-cov-2 and envelop proteins  figure s3  from diverse strains of mers sars-cov sars-cov-2 along with common human coronaviruses strains 229e nl63 oc43 and hku1 showed that sars-cov and sars-cov-2 are closely related to mers virus whereas oc43 and hku1 strains are closely related and also comparatively closer to the sars-cov sars-cov-2 and mers virus rather than the other closely related 229e and nl63 strains unlikely the ancestral relationship in regard of s and m proteins analysis showed a different result for e protein that sars-cov and sars-cov-2 are closely related to mers virus whereas human coronavirus 229e and nl63 are closely related and also related to comparatively closer to the sars-cov sars-cov-2 and mers rather than the other closely related strain human coronavirus oc43 and hku1 viral infection is facilitated by the outer portion of the domain of viral protein which binds with the receptor proteins of the host cell so exposed portions of s e and m proteins of sars-cov-2 normally offer a large scope to induce antibody production against itself 55 56 therefore it is necessary to design a therapeutic target based on those exposed portions of the virus in order to do so interpro and tmhmm servers were used to predict the outer portions of each of the protein the length of exposed regions non-cytoplasmic region ranging from 1-1213  figure  1  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and 1-19 74-78 respectively for s e and m proteins were taken for our assessment a vaccine candidate must have antigenic features to maximize its reliability to be an agent of immune response to ensure the efficacy of the vaccine antigenicity of the target sequences must be checked as it is crucial for the design of peptide-based vaccine vaxijen 20 server was used to predict antigenicity of all the respective proteins the s protein region had an antigenic value of 04646 whereas values for the region of e and m protein were 07282 and 05102 respectively potential b cell epitopes play significant role by providing protection against viral diseases 57 therefore distinctive analysis techniques were utilized in this method for the prediction of a linear b cell epitope primary sequences of s e and m protein were checked through abcpred and iedb server to foresee b-cell epitopes a total of 59 5 and 19 b-cell epitopes for s e and m were predicted individually by abcpred from all anticipated epitopes only 4 epitopes s 2 epitopes e 1 epitope and m 1 epitope presented on the outside of s e and m proteins were chosen table 1 with higher antigenicity scorekolaskar and tongaonkar antigenicity estimation tool figure2 was utilized to predict this antigenicity score appeared in table1 and tmhmm server was used to check the surface accessibility based on abcped among these four identified epitopes of s protein hrsyltpgdsssgwta and cftnvyadsfvirgde showed most elevated antigenic score of 092 and 085 respectively moreover epitope hrsyltpgdsssgwta is positioned within the ntd region whereas cftnvyadsfvirgde is inside the rbd region the e protein epitope nvslvkpsfyvysrvk showed 08 antigenic score this epitope is situated at 48 position of e protein while at 7 position of m protein the titveelkklle revealed 075 antigenic score and selected for m protein table 1  according to iedb the titveelkklle indicated most noteworthy antigenicity of 1113 followed by the cftnvyadsfvirgde titveelkklle and hrsyltpgdsssgwta with the antigenicity of 1048 1043 and 0993 respectively the abcpred score and vaxijen antigencity results revealed the ability of all predicted peptides to expand barrier reactions within the host during sars-cov-2 infection as an extracellular part of transmembrane-protein to discover the hydrophilicity of anticipated b-cell epitopes parker-hydrophilicity strategy was performed figure3with the hydrophilicity analysis the hrsyltpgdsssgwtawas found to have remarkable hydrophilicity with the value of 295 whereas hydrophilicity values of cftnvyadsfvirgde titveelkklle and nvslvkpsfyvysrvk were 1513 0492 and 045 respectively table 1  b-cell epitope based vaccines have been quite popular for a long time however vaccines based on t-cell epitopes are currently in the trend as the cd8 t cells produce a long term memory response in the host against the infected cell 58thats why prediction of t-cell epitopes is an unquestionable requirement for a vaccine to have preventive capacity some of the recent studies on vaccine development against covid-19 shed light on only the t-cell epitopes whereas in our study we have approached both eligible b and t cell epitopes of sars-cov-2 for a maximized yield in our vaccine design project 58 here iedb server was utilized to evaluate the best t-cell epitopes from the chosen protein sequences of s e and m protein  moreover antigenicity testing and screening of peptides were done with help of vaxijen 20 server in light of the high combinatorial score the 4 best epitopes for mhc class-i table 2 were chosen for additional investigation for mhc class i assessment netmhccons 11 server is a consensus approach that combines the three best netmhc netmhcpan and pickpocket class strategy to provide the most accurate predictions the mhc-i alleles for which the epitopes demonstrated higher affinity ic50 500nm were chosen table 2  between mhc class-i anticipated epitopes a 9 mer epitope kiadynykl that is inside the rbd region of sars-cov-2 showed higher antigenicity score of 16639 followed by the gtitveelk yvysrvknl and wtagaaayy within the ntd region of sars-cov-2 with antigenicity score of 10976 07020 and 05371respectively for mhc class-ii on the basis of high combinatorial score the 4best epitopes table s4 were chosen for further analysis netmhcii 23 server was used to anticipate mhc-ii binding prediction with hla-dr hla-dq and hla-dp mhc class ii alleles the mhc-ii alleles for which the epitopes demonstrated higher affinity ic50 500nm were selected table s4  the peptide gvltesnkkflpfqq that is within the rbd region of sars-cov-2 was viewed as increasingly antigenic for its higher antigenicity score 08200 followed by the yfkiyskhtpinlvr inside the ntd area of sars-cov-2 fyvysrvknlnssrv madsngtitveelkk with antigenicity score of 08197 06103 and 04367 individually moreover molecular docking was performed for the analysis of the binding affinity of our targeted eight epitopes from membrane spike and enveloped protein with different hla molecules t-cell epitope sequence with their docking score are showed in the table 3  among these eight selected t cell epitopes wtagaaayy bound in the binding pocket of hla-b3501 allele pdb id4prn showed the highest binding score of -91 kcalmol figure4 5interaction between the epitope and the binding pocket atoms of hla molecule showed in the figure 6 on the other hand  yvysrvknl bound with hla-a0203pdb id 3ox8 and gtitveelk bound with hla-a1101 pdb id 6joz with the binding affinity of -74 and -7 kcalmol respectively exhibit good binding interaction of these epitopes with hla molecules another essential prerequisite in epitope based vaccine design is to determine population coverage as mhc polymorphism leads to the expression of different forms of hla at considerably different rates among different ethnicities 59 60  on the basis of binding interaction of our targeted epitopes with their respective hla alleles we finalized three epitopes for vaccine design having the highest binding affinity population coverage for these three epitopes demonstrated the consequences of the host genetic variety on the binding specificity of these targeted epitopes to class i hla alleles their cumulative population coverage around the world 9109 which revealed that these epitopes can cover about 91 figure 7 population from different regions of the world most of the recent studies emphasized on only the spike protein of the virus given its wide range of conservancy across the viral population but our work was dedicated to specific epitopes and domains of all the mentioned proteins s m and e proteins for an in-silico design of multiepitope vaccine vaccine development against sars-cov-2 shed light on only the t-cell epitopes in some recent studies whereas in our study we have approached both eligible b and t cell epitopes of sars-cov-2 for a maximized yield in our vaccine design project 61  all the ideal criteria of a potential epitope had been pulled off by our selected epitopes of s m and e proteins different vaccine development strategies against sars-cov-2 are being opted along with ongoing trials on novel drug design in our current study we suggested three epitopes from conserved regions of spike membrane and envelope proteins of sars-cov-2 as they have abilities to produce antigenic response their potentialities as vaccine candidate assured by their antigenic properties and strong binding affinity for mhc molecules this in-silico study requires experimental validation to get cost effective epitope based peptide vaccine with higher efficacy against

syndrome coronavirus 2 reflected the several routes of introduction to taiwan the united states and japan tomoko matsuda hikoyu suzuki norichika ogata  worldwide severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection is disrupting in the economy and anxiety of people the public anxiety has increased the psychological burden on government and healthcare professionals resulting in a government worker suicide in japan the terrified people are asking the government for border measures however are border measures possible for this virus by analysing 48 almost complete virus genome sequences we found out that the viruses that invaded taiwan the united states and japan were introduced independently we identified thirteen parsimony-informative sites and three groups ctc tcc and tct viruses found outside china did not form a monophyletic clade opposite to previous study these results suggest the difficulty of implementing effective border measures against this virus i  the outbreak of a new coronavirus sars-cov-2 1 has had a significant impact on neighbouring countries with transportation to and from china due to the spread of sars-cov-2 it is reasonable to think that restricting human movement is effective in managing viruses as human movement accelerates the spread of the virus a total ban on traffic could have helped control virus transmission 2  movement of people across the sea by plane or ship is considered necessary in the movement of viruses 3  several governments announced strengthened border measures to prevent viral border invasion 4 5  the various restrictions associated with the pandemic hurt not only the economy 6  but also the mental health 7 8  the fear of the virus has resulted in discrimination and excessive demands on the government a 37-yearold government worker who worked on antivirus committed suicide in japan 7  with the availability of viral genome sequences research is being conducted into many different aspects 9 10 11 12 13  an analysis of previously collected viral genomes indicated that viruses outside china formed a monophyletic clade suggesting the effectiveness of border measures 14  recently more complete viral genome sequences have been published providing more resources to discuss virus transmission 15  although several phylogenetic trees of the virus have been published many analyzes including fragment sequences did not provide accurate phylogenetic information therefore we scrutinized the available viral sequences and collected only fulllength viral genomic sequences for phylogenetic analysis the genome sequences of sars-cov-2 isolated from human and batcov ratg13 accession no gwhabkp00000000 which is most closely related to sats-cov-2 9  were obtained from 2019 novel coronavirus resource 15 accessed 22 feb 2020 we choose 51 longer sequences the shortest one is 26973 bps and the longest one is 29903 bps one of the longest sequences wuhan-hu-1 accession no mn908947 was used as the reference genome we also obtained the genome sequence of bat sarslike coronavirus accession no mg772933 from genbank as the outgroup according to the previous study 9  in total we used 49 sars-cov-2 sequences table 1  and 2 bat coronavirus sequences table 2 isolation of open reading frames the open reading frames orf information of the reference genome were obtained from genbank we used the translated orf amino-acid sequences as the queries and searched other sars-cov-2 genomes for orf by using fate 16 with tblastn engine and other default parameters there were 13 parsimony-informative sites in 29145 bps alignment of sequences from 47 samples isolated from human dots indicate the same as the reference base on the top of the alignment a c g or t indicate the difference in the reference base blue green and yellow highlight indicate group tct tcc and ctc respectively group tct was defined by t8782 c28144 and t29095 group tcc was defined by t8782 c28144 and c29095 group ctc was defined by c8782 t28144 and c29095 all sites including gaps were removed from the analysis bases of the same sites on the 2 coronavirus genomes isolated from bat were shown in bottom and 2nd line from the bottom of the alignment respectively codon-based multiple sequence alignment and extraction of variableparsimony-informative sites isolated orf sequences were aligned for each gene based on codons by using dialign-tx 18  the largest gene orf1ab was divided into upstream and downstream regions and aligned respectively because this gene has the ribosomal slippage site we removed three samples human-unitedstates- mt020781 and human-china-hubeiprovince-wuhancity accession no nmdc60013002-05 from the analysis because their sequences include mixed bases then we extracted variableparsimony-informative sites based on the multiple sequence alignment by using in-house perl script maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses based on the multiple sequence alignment of orf were performed under the seven conditions below 1 dna-based no separate 2 separating 1st2nd and 3rd codon position 3 separating each codon position 4 separating each gene 5 separating each gene and also 1st2nd and 3rd codon position 6 separating each gene and each codon position and 7 protein-based separating each gene for each condition the best evolutionary models were estimated by using modeltest-ng 19 with default parameters followed by estimating the phylogenies of sats-cov-2 by using raxml-ng 20 with --all option and the best bayesian information criterion bic-supported evolutionary models under any conditions the outgroup was set to bat sars-like coronavirus and the number of bootstraps replicates was set to 1000 obtained phylogenies were colored by using mega x 21  all analyses data and inhouse scripts are available 22  60 variable sites were found from 29145 bps alignment of sars-cov-2 orf sequences from 47 samples isolated from human  figure s1  there were 13 parsimony-informative sites 614 2662 5084 8782 18060 24034 24325 26144 26729 28077 28144 28854 and 29095-th nucleotide of referential sars-cov-2 genome mn908947 of which 7 were non-synonymous table 3  there were 3 important parsimony-informative sites the first important parsimony-informative site was 8782-nd nucleotide of referential sars-cov-2 genome mn908947 referential nucleotide is c and alternative nucleotide is t the second important parsimony-informative site was 28144-th nucleotide of referential sars-cov-2 genome mn908947 referential nucleotide is t and alternative nucleotide is c this substitution results in changes in amino acids 84 of orf8 a previously indicated polypeptide involved in promoting virus transition from bat to human 24 25  the third important parsimony-informative site was 29095-th nucleotide of referential sars-cov-2 genome mn908947 referential nucleotide is c and alternative nucleotide is t therefore we named 3 groups tcc tct and others ctc figure 1  viruses found outside china did not form a single group opposite to previous study 14  this result suggests that the viral were introduced to each country several times phylogenies of sars-cov-2 were constructed based on the orf sequences  figure 2 and figure  s2  dna-based phylogeny under the separating each codon position condition figure 2 showed the highest final log-likelihood and 2nd-lowest aic score among dna-based phylogenetic trees on the other hand protein-based phylogenetic tree  figure  s2f  might not be reliable because the tree was constructed based on less informative sites except for the synonymous substitution sites according to our phylogeny the group ctc formed a monophyletic clade including all samples isolated from chinese in wuhan except for cna0007335-human-china-hubeiprovince-wuhancity samples of the group tcc and tct were paraphyletic for group ctc and located near the root of the tree our phylogenies suggest that the bat-sars-like coronavirus mg772933 and batcov ratg13 are more closely related to samples included in the group tcc and tct than samples included in the group ctc some of the phylogenies constructed under other conditions suggest the different phylogenetic position of group tcc and tct however support the monophyly and the same phylogenetic position of group ctc  figure s2  these results indicate that sars-cov-2 widely spread in wuhan is different from that of other areas in areas other than wuhan where virus invasion has been observed the damage has not seemed to be as severe as wuhan however the spread of group ctc might increase the damage in the near future from the perspective of virus control sequencing should be performed since viruses have multiple properties that is hard to be distinguished by qpcr the viral genome sequences mt039890-human-sourth-korea and gwhabkg0000000-human-china-hubei-province-wuhan-city have many sample-specific substitutions in their sequence the viral genome sequence mn988713-human-usa-illinois-chicago has several ambiguous bases in parsimony-informative sites discovered in this study interestingly the ambiguous bases can be explained by the mixture of group tcc and ctc table 4  this fact suggests that mn988713-human-usa-illinois-chicago contains at least two different viral genomes we could corroborate this hypothesis after next generation sequence data release to determine whether viral sequences have novel mutations acquired during spreading the infection or just reflect the diversity of the place of origin various sars-cov-2 genome sequences should be collected in the place of origin a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis based on the multiple sequence alignment of orf were performed under the condition of separating each codon position blue green and yellow branches indicate group tct tcc and ctc respectively substitutions on the parsimony-informative sites were mapped to the corresponding branches sars-cov-2 isolated from human formed a monophyletic clade with 100 bootstrap value group ctc formed a monophyletic clade with 74 bootstrap value group tcc was paraphyletic respect to the group ctc group tct was paraphyletic respect to the clade consists of group ctc and tct final log-likelihood was -55794362675 aic score was 112649332493 branch length was meaningless  w means t or a y means c

coronavirus 12  anand et al 1 reported a three-dimensional model of sars-cov main proteinase and suggested that  there are a number of methods and software packages that have been developed for detection of recombination events in dna sequences the performance of these methods has been extensively evaluated and compared on simulated and real data 23 24  in the present study we applied these methods to rna viruses sars-cov and other 6 coronavirus genomes sars-cov ibv bcov hcov mhv pedv tgev were first aligned using clustalw 33  sites with gaps were removed and a 25077-nt alignment was

detection here we consider the regions identified by at least 3 methods as putative recombination regions the results are summarized in table 6  seven putative recombination regions span a range of positions in sars-cov  phylogenetic trees constructed by using putative recombination regions and nonrecombination regions identified by above techniques are shown in figure 4  the left panels stand for non-recombination regions and the right panels for recombination regions we compared each row of figures and found that the phylogenetic tree in the left panel non-recombination region had very different topology when compared to the phylogenetic tree in the right panel recombination region which indicates that recombination has occurred for example in fig 4a  7 coronaviruses are divided into 4 groups group 1 for tgev hcov and pedv group 2 for bcov and mhv group 3 for ibv and group 4 for sars-cov consistent with marra et al 17  while in fig 4b 7 coronaviruses are divided and sars-cov suggests that sars-cov is most closely related to bcov and mhv which is consistent with a recent report 29  at the same time sars-cov is also most closely related to tgev fig 4d and ibv fig 4f  thus phylogenetic analysis substantiates the presence of recombination events in the history that led to the sars-cov genome in this study seven recombination detection methods and phylogenetic analyses were performed on sars-cov and the six coronaviruses identified by blast ibv bcov hcov mhv pedv and tgev these techniques successfully identified recombination events in bacteria and viruses 2 3 6 21 26 39  our analysis concurred to suggest the occurrence of recombination events between ancestors of sars-cov and these 6 coronaviruses indeed pairwise alignment showed that many segments of high homology with ibv bcov hcov mhv pedv and tgev do exist in sars-cov genome table 7 exhibits the segments with length 20 nt and identiy 80 and fig 5 shows the mosaic structure of the region 14930-15908 in sars-cov genome based on the segments with length 50 and identity 80 of course the other coronaviruses used in the analysis are also mosaic structures for more sequence similarities exist among them than with sars-cov it is noted that all the sequence comparisons in this study are based on nucleotide sequences while the protein sequences in sars-cov are largely different from those in the known three groups of coronavirus 17  such as for s protein the identity is 259 for sars-cov and bcov 217 for sars-cov and hcov 215 for sars-cov and ibv 256 for sars-cov and mhv 206 for sars-cov and pedv 194 for sars-cov and tgev although sars-cov is close to bcov mhv tgev and ibv the corresponding protein replicase 1a is still different with identity 274 for sars-cov and bcov 248 for sars-cov and ibv 322 for sars-cov and mhv 250 for sars-cov and tgev naturally we should take into account the role of convergent evolution which would bear its mark on the viral genome the recombination events that we witnessed in sars-cov are present in six different viruses suggesting sequential horizontal transfers and progressive adaptation to new hosts cells or animals indeed because viruses need both receptors to permeate host cells and resist the immune response of the host their outer layer proteins are submitted to an extremely strong selection pressure that may restrict considerably the possible variations of the corresponding proteins and accordingly of the corresponding genome pieces of sequences it is nevertheless remarkable that despite the inclusion of all possible types of viruses in our sample set as well as shuffled genomes from the viruses we have identified as relevant we find a more or less single category of viruses as similar to sars-cov this suggests that even if the contribution of convergent evolution is important this happened on a more or less common phylogenetic background suggesting several steps of recombination followed by fine adaptation in this context we would like to suggest that ancestors of pedv mhv or both are the most plausible origin of sars-cov guan et al 7 based on phylogenetic techniques and bootscan recombination analysis stavrinides and guttman 32 indicated that the replicase of sars-cov was a mammalian-like origin the m and n proteins have an avian-like origin and the s protein has a mammalian-avian mosaic origin while in the present study we used phylogenetic analysis and 7 recombination detection methods including the powerful methods of maxchi and geneconv among 14 methods studied simplot bootscan geneconv homoplasy test pist  maxchi chimaera phypro plato rdp recpars reticulate  runs test sneath test triple 23 24  to conduct whole genomewide recombination analysis we identified seven putative recombination regions which encompass in terms of proteins involved replicase 1a replicase 1b and the spike glycoprotein stavrinides and guttman 32 primarily inferred the occurrence of recombination qualitatively but did not identify the precise recombination region in the protein involved the s protein is an exception they identified a recombination region in s protein located between nucleotides 2472 and 2694 of the s protein ie between nucleotides 23963 and 24185 of the sars-cov genome basically covered by the last recombination region for s protein table 6  most importantly each of our recombination regions is identified by at least 3 methods because one should not rely too much on a single method as suggested in 23  in general we believe two studies lead to the overall conclusion the evolution of sars-cov has involved recombination the recombination event in the replicase is related to the fact that the rna polymerase of coronaviruses utilize a discontinuous transcription mechanism to synthesize mrnas the viral polymerase must jump between different rna templates regularly during positive-or negative-strand rna synthesis and depending on the rejoining sites the resultant rna recombination will be either homologous or nonhomologous this is the copy-choice model of recombination in rna viruses 13 27 31 34  the recombination event in s protein is certainly important since this allows the virus to alter surface antigenicity and escape immunesurveillance in the animals thus adapting to a human host the existence of sars-cov-like viruses 998 homology to human sars-cov in several wild animals in a live animal market in guangdong 7 indicated that interspecies transmission among the human and animal sars-cov-like viruses had occurred the mutation analysis of sequence variations among these isolates will help identify the genetic signature of sars virus strains when a sufficient amount of sequence data is available the very fact that several species of animals are affected does not allow one to trace directly the origin of the virus as endemic in one of these species but rather might be indicative that animals and men might have been contaminated by a virus from a common origin presumably located in animal food present in local markets in the guangdong province investigating a wide variety of animal coronaviruses especially in relation to rodents birds snakes and farm animals would be interesting with regard to the origin of the sars-cov that caused disease in humans finally a challenging question arises what is the molecular basis of recombination in sars-cov many requirements are needed for recombination to occur 1 two coronaviruses can infect a host simultaneously and continue to replicate without interference with each other 2 sufficient nucleotide identity between these genomes is essential for genome-switching to occur during rna replication 3 the proteins arising from recombination must be functional 4 the recombinant virus must have some selective advantage for its survival that is the recombination that creates a successful new coronavirus is probably a rare event so we must stress that the potential recombination events in sars-cov identified in the present study are most likely old events which may represent the events that occurred thousands of years ago although the recent findings indicated that sars-cov did exist in a number of wild animals 7  we have not yet determined where these sars-cov-like virus strains come from  coronavirus genomics and bioinformatics analysis patrick

coronaviruses were defined as enveloped viruses of 120160 nm in diameter with a crown-like appearance the name coronavirus is derived from the greek  meaning crown based on their antigenic relationships coronaviruses were classified into three groups group 1 and 2 are composed of mammalian coronaviruses and group 3 avian coronaviruses the invention of and advances in nucleic acid amplification technologies automated dna sequencing and bioinformatics tools in the recent two decades have revolutionized the characterization and classification of all kinds of infectious disease agents using molecular methods coronaviruses are classified as positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses furthermore the results of using phylogenetic methods for classification also supported the group boundaries of the traditional antigenic classification phylogenetic methods have also enabled the classification of sars-related coronavirus sarsr-cov as a subgroup of group 2 group 2b coronavirus as well as the discovery of group 2c 2d 3b and 3c coronaviruses 13 recently the coronavirus study group of the international committee for taxonomy of viruses has proposed three genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus to replace these three traditional groups of coronaviruses 4 the first complete genome of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus mhv was sequenced more than 50 years after it was isolated before the sars epidemic in 2003 there were less than 10 coronaviruses with complete genome sequences available these include two human coronaviruses hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 four other mammalian coronaviruses mhv bovine coronavirus bcov transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv and one avian coronavirus ibv the sars epidemic that originated from southern china in 2003 has boosted interest in all areas of coronavirus research most notably coronavirus biodiversity and genomics 57 after the sars epidemic up to april 2010 15 novel coronaviruses were discovered with their complete genomes sequenced among these 15 previously unrecognized coronaviruses were two globally distributed human coronaviruses human coronavirus nl63 hcov-nl63 and human coronavirus hku1 hcov-hku1 810 10 other mammalian coronaviruses sars-related rhinolophus bat coronavirus sarsr-rh-batcov rhinolophus bat coronavirus hku2 rh-batcov hku2 tylonycteris bat coronavirus hku4 ty-batcov hku4 pipistrellus bat coronavirus hku5 pi-batcov hku5 miniopterus bat coronavirus hku8 mi-batcov hku8 rousettus bat coronavirus hku9 ro-batcov hku9 scotophilus bat coronavirus 512 sc-batcov 512 miniopterus bat coronavirus 1ab mi-batcov 1ab equine coronavirus ecov and beluga whale coronavirus sw1 361115 and three avian coronaviruses bulbul coronavirus hku11 bucov hku11 thrush coronavirus hku12 thcov hku12 and munia coronavirus hku13 muncov hku13 2 most of these genomes were sequenced using the rna extracted directly from the clinical specimens such as nasopharyngeal aspirate or stool as the template while the viruses themselves were still non-cultivable 2361115 this provided more accurate analysis of the in situ viral genomes avoiding mutational bias during in vitro viral replication these sequence efforts have resulted in a marked increase in the number of coronavirus genomes and have given us an unprecedented opportunity to understand this family of virus at the genomic and in silico levels these understandings have also led to generation of further hypotheses and experiments in the laboratory in this article we reviewed our current understanding on the genomics and bioinformatics analysis of coronaviruses details of the bioinformatics tools will not be discussed orf1ab of coronaviruses occupy about two thirds of their genomes it encodes the replicase polyprotein and is translated from orf1a 11826 to 13425 nt and orf1b 7983 to 8157 nt in all coronaviruses a slippery sequence uuuaaac followed by sequences that form a putative pseudoknot structure are present at the junction between orf1a and orf1b translation occurs by a -1 rna-mediated ribosomal frameshift at the end of the slippery sequence instead of reading the transcript as uuuaaacggg it will be read as uuuaaaccggg the replicase polyprotein is cleaved by papain-like proteases plpro and 3c-like protease 3clpro proteins encoded by orf1ab of the coronavirus genome at consensus cleavage sites into 15 to 16 non-structural proteins nsps named nsp1 nsp2 nsp3 etc table 1 as the number of coronavirus genomes is expanding novel cleavage sites have been discovered 318 some of these non-structural proteins encode proteins of essential functions such as plpro nsp3 3clpro nsp5 rna-dependent rna polymerase pol nsp12 and helicase nsp13 figure 1 the genomes of all known members of alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus subgroup a possess two plpro pl1pro and pl2pro while those of all known members of betacoronavirus subgroup b c and d and gammacoronavirus possess only one plpro table 1 figure 1 the gene sequences that encode these conserved proteins are frequently used for phylogenetic analysis in addition to the nsps with essential functions bioinformatics analysis of some other nsps revealed their putative functions downstream to plpro or pl1pro in nsp3 is the x domain which contains putative adp-ribose 1-phosphatase adrp activity 1 in other microorganisms such as saccharomyces cerevisiae and other eukaryotes adrp and its functionally related enzyme cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase cpdase were important for trna processing 19 adp-ribose 12-cyclic phosphate apprp is produced as a result of trna splicing apprp is in turn converted to adp-ribose 1-phosphate appr-1p by cpdase and appr-p is then further processed by adrp as for nsp13 nsp14 and nsp15 they possess a putative 3-to-5 exonuclease exon domain of the dedd superfamily 1 a putative polyu-specific endoribonuclease xendou domain and a putative s-adenosylmethionine-dependent ribose 2-o-methyltransferase 2-o-mt domain of the rrmj family respectively 1 adrp cpdase exon xendou and 2-o-mt are enzymes in rna processing pathways contrary to the pre-trna splicing pathway that adrp and cpdase belong to exon xendou and 2-o-mt are enzymes in a small nucleolar rna processing and utilization pathway in all members of betacoronavirus subgroup a a haemagglutinin esterase he gene which encodes a glycoprotein with neuraminate o-acetyl-esterase activity and the active site fgds is present downstream to orf1ab and upstream to s gene figure 1 the he gene of coronavirus is believed to be acquired from influenza c virus and is the most notable example of acquisition of new genes from non-coronavirus rna donors by heterologous recombination 20 the presence of he genes exclusively in members of betacoronavirus subgroup a but not members of betacoronavirus subgroup b c and d suggested that the recombination had probably occurred in the ancestor of members of betacoronavirus subgroup a after diverging from the ancestor of other subgroups of betacoronavirus the s proteins are responsible for the spikes present on the surface of coronaviruses and give this family of virus the characteristic crown-like appearance under electron microscopy the s proteins are type i membrane glycoproteins with signal peptides the s proteins are used for receptor binding and viral entry and are the proteins with the most variable sequences in the coronavirus genomes in some coronaviruses the s proteins are cleaved into the s1 and s2 domains at consensus cleavage site rrsrr of bcov rrsr of hcov-oc43 rrkrr of hcov-hku1 rsrr of phev rradr of mhv rrfrr of sdav and rrfrr of ibv table 1 with the sequences of the s1 domains much more variable than the s2 domains in all coronaviruses most of the s protein is exposed on the outside of the virus with a short transmembrane domain at the c terminus followed by a short cytoplasmic tail rich in cysteine residues two heptad repeats are present at the c termini of the extracellular parts of the s proteins at the moment no bioinformatics tool is available for accurate prediction of the receptor by analyzing the amino acid sequences of the s proteins of the corresponding coronaviruses the e and m proteins are small transmembrane proteins associated with the envelope of all coronaviruses in some coronaviruses such as mhv and sdav and possibly hcov-hku1 the translation of the e protein is cap-independent via an internal ribosomal entry site although these two genes are conserved among all coronaviruses they are not good targets for phylogenetic studies because of their short sequences similar to the conserved proteins encoded by orf1ab the n gene is also another common target for phylogenetic analysis due to its immunogenicity it is also a common target for cloning and generation of recombinant proteins for serological assays variable numbers of small orfs are present between the various conserved genes in different lineages in the coronaviridae family table 1 figure 1 in some coronaviruses small orfs are present downstream to the n gene table 1 figure 1 most of these small orfs are of unknown function one exception is the small orfs downstream to n in feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv and tgev which are important for virulence and viral replicationassembly respectively 2123 another notable exception is the 3a protein of sarsr-cov which forms a transmembrane homotetramer complex with ion channel function and modulates virus release 24 for some of these small orfs such as orf3a and orf8 of sarsr-cov genomes their sequences are as highly variable as those of the s proteins in particular the most significant difference between human sarsr-cov and civet sarsr-cov genomes was a 29-bp deletion in the orf8 of human sarsr-cov 25 the first impression of the phylogenetic position of a strain or species of coronavirus is usually acquired by constructing a phylogenetic tree using a short fragment of a conserved gene such as pol or n however this can sometimes be misleading because the results of phylogenetic analysis using different genes or characters can be different when sarsr-cov was first discovered it was proposed that it constituted a fourth group of coronavirus 2627 however analyses of the amino-terminal domain of s of sarsr-cov revealed that 19 out of the 20 cysteine residues were spatially conserved with those of the consensus sequence for betacoronavirus 28 on the other hand only five of the cysteine residues were spatially conserved with those of the consensus sequences in alphacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus 28 furthermore subsequent phylogenetic analysis using both complete genome sequence and proteomic approaches it was concluded that sarsr-cov is probably an early split-off from the betacoronavirus lineage 1 and sarsr-cov was subsequently classified as betacoronavirus subgroup b and the historical betacoronavirus as betacoronavirus subgroup a therefore the phylogenetic position of a coronavirus is best appreciated and confirmed by constructing phylogenetic trees using different genes in the coronavirus genome the most commonly used genes along the coronavirus genome for phylogenetic studies include chymotrypsin-like protease pol figure 2 helicase s and n because these genes are present in all coronavirus genomes and are of significant length the envelope and membrane genes although present in all coronavirus genomes are too short for phylogenetic studies it is noteworthy that the cluster formed by the three novel avian coronaviruses bucov hku11 thcov hku12 and muncov hku13 which was originated proposed as group 3c 2 might represent a new coronavirus genus provisionally designated deltacoronavirus figure 2 using this approach of multiple gene phylogenetic studies unique phylogeny of individual gene that may have biological significance may be discovered during our phylogenetic study on rh-batcov hku2 another coronavirus that has was also found in the stool samples of chinese horseshoe bats its unique s protein phylogenetically distinct from the rest of the genome was discovered 15 the s protein of rh-batcov hku2 is the shortest among s proteins of all coronaviruses and had less than 30 amino acid identities to those of all known coronaviruses in contrast to other genes that showed higher amino acid identities to the corresponding genes in other members of alphacoronavirus when the s protein of rh-batcov hku2 is aligned with those of other members of alphacoronavirus many of the amino acid residues conserved among and specific to alphacoronavirus were not found rather the s protein of rh-batcov hku2 shares the two conserved regions of deletions both of 14 amino acids among members of betacoronavirus in its c-terminus suggesting that this segment of the s protein of rh-batcov hku2 may have co-evolved with the corresponding regions in betacoronavirus most interestingly a short peptide of 15 amino acids in the s protein of rh-batcov hku2 was found to be homologous to a corresponding peptide within the rbm in the s1 domain of sarsr-cov a similar peptide was also observed in sarsr-rh-batcov but not in any other known coronaviruses these suggested that there is a common evolutionary origin in the s protein of sarsr-cov sarsr-rh-batcov and rh-batcov hku2 and rh-batcov hku2 might have acquired its unique s protein from a yet unidentified coronavirus through recombination in 1992 sanchez et al analyzed 13 enteric and respiratory tgev related isolates and estimated the mutation rate of tgev to be 7104 nucleotide substitutions per site per year 29 1n 2005 using linear regression maximum likelihood and bayesian inference methods vijgen et al estimated the rate of evolution in bcov to be 43 95 confidence internal 27 to 60 104 nucleotide substitutions per site per year 30 the estimation of time of divergence was first extensively used in coronaviruses after the sars epidemic for estimating the date of interspecies jumping of sarsr-cov from civets to humans and that from bcov to hcov-oc43 3132 subsequently when various novel human and animal coronaviruses were discovered evolutionary rates and divergence time in the coronaviridae family were estimated by various groups using different approaches 313335 although bayesian inference in beast is probably the most widely accepted approach and was used by most researchers the use of different genes orf1ab helicase s and n genes and datasets by different groups have resulted in considerable difference in the estimated history of coronaviruses it was found that the s and n genes of phev bcov and hcov-oc43 evolved at different rates and the divergence time of the phev lineage and the hcov-oc43 and bcov lineage based on these two rates were 100 years different 31 one group using the helicase gene for analysis has estimated the life history of coronaviruses to be as short as about 420 years 35 recently we used the uncorrelated exponentially distributed relaxed clock model uced in beast version 14 36 to estimate the time of divergence of sarsr-cov based on an alignment of a large set of sarsr-rh-batcov orf1 sequences collected over a period of five years under this model the rates were allowed to vary at each branch drawn independently from an exponential distribution using this model and large dataset the time of emergence of sarsr-cov was at 1972 about 31 years before the sars epidemic that of sarsr-cov in civet was at 1995 about eight years before the sars epidemic and the most recent common ancestor date of human and civet sarsr-cov was estimated to be 200136 which was comparable to the dates estimated by other groups table 2 37 as a result of their unique random template switching during rna replication thought to be mediated by a copy-choice mechanism coronaviruses have a high frequency of homologous rna recombination 4142 recombination in coronaviruses was first recognized between different strains of mhv and subsequently in other coronaviruses such as ibv between mhv and bcov and between feline coronavirus fcov type i and canine coronavirus ccov 4346 as shown below such recombination can result in the generation of coronavirus species or different genotypes within a coronavirus species in our experience the possibility of homologous rna recombination and the possible part of the genome that recombination has taken place are usually first appreciated using bootscan analysis or phylogenetic analysis using different parts of the coronavirus genome other methods for recombination analysis such as those in the rdp3 package are also available then the exact site of homologous rna recombination would be best revealed by multiple sequence alignment the best documented example of generation of coronavirus species through homologous rna recombination is the generation of fcov type ii by double recombination between fcov type i and ccov it was first observed that the sequence of the s protein in fcov type ii was closely related to that of ccov 4748 but the sequence downstream of the e gene in fcov type ii was more closely related to that of fcov type i strain than to ccov 4950 this observation suggested that there might have been a homologous rna recombination event between the genomes of ccov and fcov type i resulting in the generation of fcov type ii further analysis by multiple sequence alignments pinpointed the site of recombination to a region in the e gene a few years later an additional recombination region in the pol gene was also discovered and it was concluded that fcov type ii originated from two recombination events between the genomes of ccov and fcov type i 43 as for the generation of different genotypes in a coronavirus species through homologous rna recombination the best documented example is hcov-hku1 the possibility of homologous rna recombination was first suspected when a few strains of hcov-hku1 showed differential clustering when the pol s and n genes were used for phylogenetic tree construction 51 this observation has led to our subsequent study on complete genome sequencing of 22 strains of hcov-hku1 recombination analysis by bootscan analysis and phylogenetic analysis using different parts of the 22 complete genomes revealed extensive recombination in different parts of the genomes resulting in the generation of three genotypes a b and c of hcov-hku1 52 using multiple sequence alignment two sites of recombination were pinpointed the first one was observed in a stretch of 143 nucleotides near the 3 end of nsp6 where recombination between hcov-hku1 genotype b and genotype c has generated genotype a and the second one in another stretch of 29 nucleotides near the 3 end of nsp16 where recombination between hcov-hku1 genotype a and genotype b has generated genotype c 52 recently using the complete genome sequences of the 19 coronavirus genomes we analyzed the codon usage bias in coronaviruses as well as selection of cpg suppressed clones by the immune system and cytosine deamination being the two major independent biochemical and biological selective forces that has shaped such codon usage bias 53 in the study we showed that the mean cpg relative abundance in the coronavirus genomes is markedly suppressed 53 however we observed that only cpg containing codons in the context of purine-cpg acg and gcg pyrimidine-cpg ucg and ccg and cpg-purine cga and cgg but not cpg-pyrimidine cgu and cgc are suppressed however when trinucleotide frequencies were analyzed in the 19 coronavirus genomes all the eight trinucleotides with cpg were suppressed 53 these indicate that another force that has led to an increase use of cgu and cgc as codons for arginine but does not act on trinucleotides over the whole genome in general is probably present furthermore this force is probably unrelated to the relative abundance of the corresponding trna molecules in the hosts of the coronaviruses as the pattern of bias in the hosts is not the same as that in the coronaviruses in addition to cpg suppression marked cytosine deamination is also observed in all the 19 coronavirus genomes 53 using the six amino acids that are only encoded by nnc or nnu asparagine histidine aspartic acid tyrosine cysteine and phenylalanine hence excluding most other pressures that may affect the relative abundance of cytosine and uracil it was observed that all nnu are markedly over represented with usage fractions of more than 0700 whereas the usage fractions of all nnc are less than 0300 53 for all codons that encode the same amino acid and with either u or c in any position the usage fraction of the codon that uses u is always higher than the one that uses c in all coronaviruses furthermore the percentage of u showed strong inverse relationships with the percentage of c in the coronavirus genomes these suggest that cytosine deamination is another important biochemical force that shaped coronavirus evolution interestingly among all the 19 coronaviruses hcov-hku1 showed the most extreme codon usage bias hcov-hku1 is the only coronavirus that had effective number of codons outside the mean  2 standard deviations range in addition hcov-hku1 also possessed the lowest g  c content highest gc skew lowest percentages of g and c and highest percentage of u among all coronavirus genomes furthermore hcov-hku1 showed extremely high nnunnc ratio of 8835 the underlying mechanism for the extreme codon usage bias cytosine deamination and g  c content in hcov-hku1 is intriguing rapid and accurate batch sequence retrieval is always the cornerstone and bottleneck for all kinds of comparative genomics and bioinformatics analysis during the process of batch sequence retrieval for comparative genomics and other bioinformatics analysis of the coronavirus genomes that we have sequenced we encountered a number of major problems about the coronavirus sequences in genbank and other coronavirus databases first in genbank the non-structural proteins encoded by orf1ab are not annotated second in all databases the annotations for the non-structural proteins encoded by orfs downstream to orf1ab are often confusing because they are not annotated using a standardized system third multiple accession numbers are often present for reference sequences these problems will often lead to confusion during sequence retrieval fourth coronaviruses especially sarsr-cov amplified from different specimens may contain the same gene or genome sequences which will lead to redundant work when they are analyzed in view of these problems we have developed a comprehensive database covdb of annotated coronavirus genes and genomes which offers rapid efficient and user-friendly batch sequence retrieval and analysis 54 in covdb first annotations on all non-structural proteins in the polyprotein encoded by orf1ab of every single sequence were performed second annotation was performed for the non-structural proteins encoded by orfs downstream to orf1ab using a standardized system third all sequences with identical nucleotide sequences were labeled and one can choose to show or not to show strains with identical sequences fourth this database contains not only complete coronavirus genome sequences but also incomplete genomes and their genes this is useful because some genes of coronaviruses such as pol s and n are sequenced much more frequently than others because they are either most conserved or least conserved and therefore are particularly important for primers design for rt-pcr assays and evolutionary studies after the sars epidemic there has been a marked increase in the number of coronaviruses discovered and coronavirus genomes being sequenced this increase in the number of coronavirus species and genomes a comprehensive and user-friendly database for efficient sequence retrieval and the ever improving bioinformatics tools have enabled us to perform meaningful genomic phylogenetic evolutionary rate and divergence recombination and other bioinformatics analyses on the coronaviridae family three genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus have been used to replace the traditional group 1 2 and 3 coronaviruses a fourth genus deltacoronavirus which includes bucov hku11 thcov hku12 and muncov hku13 is likely to emerge under this new classification system bat coronaviruses dominate the alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus genera and bird coronaviruses dominate the gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus genera this huge diversity of coronaviruses in bats and birds has made them excellent gene pools for coronaviruses in these four genera 55  analysis title regaining perspective on sars-cov-2 molecular tracing and its implications inhomogeneous sampling and phylogeographic uncertainly carla mavian simone marini costanza manes ilaria capua mattia prosperi marco salemi  during the past three months a new coronavirus sars-cov-2 epidemic has been growing exponentially affecting over 100 thousand people worldwide and causing enormous distress to economies and societies of affected countries a plethora of analyses based on viral sequences has already been published in scientific journals as well as through non-peer reviewed channels to investigate sars-cov-2 genetic heterogeneity and spatiotemporal dissemination we examined all full genome sequences currently available to assess the presence of sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies our analysis clearly shows severe limitations in the present data in light of which any finding should be considered at the very best preliminary and hypothesis-generating hence the need for avoiding stigmatization based on partial information and for continuing concerted efforts to increase number and quality of the sequences required for robust tracing of the epidemic  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity which was not certified by peer review  in december 2019 a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 was identified in wuhan china as the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019  which by march 2020 has already spread across more than 80 countries 1  common symptoms of infection include fever cough and shortness of breath while severe cases are characterized by advanced respiratory distress and pneumonia often resulting in death 2  soon after the first epidemiological data together with sars-cov-2 genetic sequences were made available a glut of phylogeny-based analyses began to circulate discussing in scientific papers as well as social media countries that might have been fueling the spread the implications of misunderstanding the real dynamic of the covid-19 pandemic are extremely dangerous ethnic or social discrimination resulting from unsupported assumptions on viral contagion -often amplified by irresponsible uncontrollable communications -can be highly damaging for people and countries despite social media are often vehicle for fake news and boast news hype it is also worth noting the tremendous effort of the scientific community to provide free up-to-date information on ongoing studies as well as critical evaluations in particular the us-based nextstrain 3 team has been posting real-time updates on the epidemic tracing by molecular analyses several discussions and evidence-based debates on controversial hypotheses on the epidemic have ensued -such as the number of untraced infections in the us the putative virus introduction in italy through germany and the alleged lineage diversification in china 4 later criticized 5 -aided by a concerted and productive effort of internationally-renowned research groups in edinburgh glasgow and oxford uk among others recently an editorial published on science 6 has also highlighted how unsupported or misleading claims circulating in forums social media and even peer-reviewed articles have been led by a substantial over interpretation of the available data hence the urgency to reframe the current debate in more rigorous scientific terms and quantitatively evaluate whether sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies currently exists or which gaps need to be addressed

to test the quality of sequence data since uneven sampling presence of phylogenetic noise and absence of temporal signal can affect reliability of the results eg ancestral state reconstructions molecular clock calibrations 7  we downloaded all sars-cov-2 full genome sequences deposited on gisaid httpswwwgisaidorg 8 to compare the number of high quality genomes sampled per country with the number of confirmed cases at the time of sampling as well as the countrys total population  figure 1  as march 10 th 2020 331 genome sequences from 29 countries were available almost twice as much than just one week earlier march 3 rd 2020 169 genome sequences from 22 countries yet the sampling per country was inhomogeneous with confirmed cases clearly uncorrelated to the number of genomes spearman correlation  003 moreover correlation could only be investigated with confirmed cases as proxy since not all affected countries have made publicly available the total number of coronavirus testing performed even within the same country sequenced genomes were usually sampled from few hotspots not necessarily representative of the whole epidemic in that country italy for example the second country per confirmed cases has uploaded so far only two genomes from lombardy and three from lazio table s1  ie only two of the twenty italian regions all with confirmed cases 9  china and usa contributed with 123 and 63 genomes respectively 56 combined while 13 countries contribute with only one or two samples 63 combined notably three countries with less than 400 confirmed cases have provided a substantial number of genomes netherlands 28 australia 18 singapore 11 17 combined  figure 1  the effect of inhomogeneous sampling and missing data on phylogeography reconstructions like the ones recently rushed through news and social media to claim specific dissemination routes of sars-cov-2 among countries can be quite dramatic an instructive example is the putative introduction of sars-cov-2 in italy from germany the maximum likelihood ml tree inferred from the full genome viral sequences available on march 3 rd  2020 supplementary figure s1  showed a well-supported cluster of

finland mexico germany and switzerland figure 2a  based on this observation which was available on nextstrain a heated discussion circulated on social media about a transmission event from germany to

there is no sufficient evidence of a higher likelihood shimodaira-hasgawa test table 1  for tree topologies generated arbitrarily switching branches in the tree see arrows in figure 2b compared to the ml tree inferred from the real data in other words it is not possible with the present data to decide which branching pattern and therefore phylogeographic reconstruction is the most likely lack of resolution and uncertainty in the sars-cov-2 phylogenetic tree is to be expected considering that relatively little genetic diversity can be accumulated during the first three months of an epidemic even for an exponentially spreading and fast-evolving rna virus plots of pairwise transitionstransversions vs genetic distance 10 showed indeed low genetic diversity among sars-cov-2 genomes considerable scattering and overlap in transitions and transversions among closely related sequences figure 3a  the 331 full genomes available contained 477 out of 29564 variable sites 16 of which 377 were singleton and only 100 034 parsimony informative indicating a substantial lack of phylogenetic information and raising the possibility of a number of sequencing errors further assessment of phylogenetic signal in the dataset was carried out using likelihood mapping analysis 11  which estimates the likelihood of each of possible tree topology for any group of four sequences quartet

detected in the sars-cov-2 full genomes alignment  figure 3b  it is important to keep in mind that such a lack of phylogenetic signal makes the overall topology of any sars-cov-2 tree unreliable and even clades with high bootstrap values should be interpreted with extreme caution finally the mean genetic distance of each sequence from the root of a ml tree indicated that the available genomic data lack temporal signal no significant linear correlation between accumulated genetic distance and sampling time figure 3c  this is again expected in genomes obtained over a very short period of time  three months since the beginning of the outbreak bayesian analysis 13  which infers phylogenetic and phylogeographic patterns from a posterior distribution of trees might facilitate comparisons

areas made available literally every day bayesian analysis may soon be a viable option however as long the new data do not increase phylogenetic and temporal signal bayesian phylogenetic and phylogeography results would remain equally questionable taken together our observations suggest that any conclusion drawn at present about existing lineages and direction of viral spread based on phylogenetic analysis of sars-cov-2 sequence data is potentially misleading nowadays published scientific data and media are very easily  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available

audience thus it is important more than ever to weigh the information being shared we believe that current molecular epidemiology data are not solid enough to provide a scientifically sound analysis of sars-cov-2 spread any inference based on phylogenetic trees should be considered at the very best preliminary and hypothesis-generating hence the need for 1 avoiding stigmatization based on partial information and 2 continuing the concerted scientific effort to increase the number and quality of available data the evolutionary dynamics of sars-cov-2 spread will unveil an unprecedented amount of information which is essential to make policy decisions the whole of humanity is threatened by the current pandemic and policy makers need to adjust their mitigation measures while the pandemic itself is developing some of the urgent answers required lie in the timely availability of abundant high quality sequence data not only from countries experiencing a high number of reported cases such as italy and south korea but also from others that seem to be experiencing at least for now a lower number of infections gisaid was accessed on march 3 rd and 10 th  2020 final dataset information

viruses is associated with lower viral loads in patient upper airways ramon lorenzo-redondo hannah nam h scott roberts c lacy simons m lawrence jennings j chao qi chad achenbach j alan hauser r michael ison g judd hultquist f egon ozer a   in late 2019 the first clusters of people with severe respiratory infections and pneumonia were reported in the hubei province of china13 the novel betacoronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has since emerged as the cause of an unprecedented worldwide healthcare crisis with more than 7 million confirmed cases worldwide and more than 400000 attributable deaths during the first six months of 202045 the spread of the novel coronavirus disease covid-19 has proceeded at different rates across the globe but ongoing community transmission is widespread in the united states us the first confirmed case of covid-19 was reported on january 20th in washington state with a second confirmed case reported shortly thereafter in chicago illinois on january 23rd both cases were linked with recent travel to china6 the chicago patient later passed the virus to her husband in the first reported case of local transmission on january 30th6 the state of new york reported its first case on march 1st and rapidly developed into a hotspot by the end of march the us had confirmed cases in all 50 states and reported the most cases of any country in the world stay-at-home orders went into effect in an attempt to mitigate virus spread in illinois new york and washington on march 21st 22nd and 23rd respectively based on publicly available data prevalence and mortality rates differ on a state-by-state basis as of april 27th 2020 new york 282143 cases 58 mortality washington state 13319 cases 55 mortality illinois 41777 cases 45 mortality supplemental figure 178 these differences can be attributed to a multitude of factors including geography population density demographics the timing and extent of community mitigation measures testing availability healthcare infrastructure and public health reporting practices9 whether variability in viral genotype may also contribute to these observed differences in transmission and disease burden remains unknown in parallel with the unprecedented speed and scale of the pandemic the sharing and integration of clinical and epidemiological data has also occurred at an exceptional pace with over 40000 viral genome sequences of sars-cov-2 from across the globe currently available via online databases such as gisaid10 rapid whole-genome sequencing wgs of emerging viruses allows for informed development of molecular diagnostic assays as well as tracing of patterns of spread across multiple epidemiological scales11 understanding the molecular epidemiology of the virus through evolutionary models and phylogenetic analysis can further aid in estimating the genetic variability and evolutionary rate which can have significant implications for disease progression as well as drug and vaccine development while extensive wgs has been reported in washington state and new york there are relatively few sequences available from illinois here we present a phylogenetic analysis of 88 sars-cov-2 viruses from the airways of covid-19 patients seeking care in a single healthcare system in chicago illinois from march 14 2020 through march 21 2020 we further assessed these viral genomic data for correlations with clinical and demographic features of our cohort individuals suspected of covid-19 within two hospitals of the northwestern medicine healthcare system were screened for sars-cov-2 infection as per the cdc protocol12 samples were collected between march 14 2020 through march 21 2020 participants included individuals presenting to emergency departments at northwestern memorial hospital nmh or lake forest hospital lfh patients admitted to the hospital at nmh and outpatient or corporate health clinic patients nasopharyngeal swab andor bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens were collected from screened individuals and stored in either phosphate-buffered saline pbs or viral transport medium viral rna was extracted from clinical specimens utilizing the qiaamp viral rna minikit qiagen clinical testing for sars-cov-2 presence was performed by quantitative reverse transcription and pcr qrt-pcr with the cdc 2019-ncov rt-pcr diagnostic panel utilizing n1 and n2 probes as previously described12 all specimens with a cycle threshold ct less than or equal to 35 were considered positive and included in this study ct values from the n1 probes were used in all subsequent analyses detailed whole genome sequencing and analysis methodologies can be found in the supplemental methods briefly cdna synthesis was performed with superscript iv first strand synthesis kit thermo according to manufacturers specifications direct amplification of the viral genome cdna was performed using multiplexed primer pools per protocols provided by the artic network version 3 release13 the sequencing library preparation protocol was adapted from the artic network protocol and oxford nanopore protocol pcr tiling of covid-19 virus1315 adapter ligation and cleanup was performed using the oxford nanopore genomic dna by ligation kit according to manufacturer specifications libraries were sequenced on the nanopore minion device using flo-min106d type r941 flow cells base calling of nanopore reads was performed on the northwestern universitys quest high performance computing cluster for genomics using guppy v345 with the dna r941 450bps high accuracy configuration and default quality score filtering --qscorefiltering read quality filtering reference alignment and consensus sequence generation was performed using artic network software and protocols1516 regions with less than 10-fold read coverage were masked we chose to use a lower read coverage cutoff than the default of 20 in the artic network software to allow for consensus sequence calls in regions with relatively poor amplification due to inefficient primer binding manual validation of variant calls in regions with 10  19x coverage was performed using tablet software17 consensus genome sequences were deposited in the gisaid database accession numbers provided in supplemental table 1 detailed phylogenetic and statistical methodologies can be found in the supplemental methods this study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of northwestern university the funding sources had no role in the design of the study in the collectionanalysisinterpretation of the data in the writing of the report or in the decision to publish the corresponding authors had access to all of the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit this work for publication between march 14 and march 21 2020 a total of 127 qrt-pcr clinical tests performed at nmh were positive for sars-cov-2 supplemental figure 2a residual rna from these diagnostic tests was collected for wgs of these 37 specimens failed to achieve sufficient amplification required for sequencing or had inadequate read coverage after sequencing almost half of the 90 successfully sequenced specimens had been collected from patients evaluated in emergency departments at nmh or lfh 25 from non-icu hospitalized patients at nmh and 12 from patients in the nmh icu supplemental figure 2b two sequenced specimens were found to be redundant and were excluded from further analysis leaving 88 sequenced specimens from 88 individuals the qrt-pcr cycle threshold ct values of these specimens ranged from 1452 to 3237 after applying alignment quality filters and normalizing segment coverage to a maximum of 200 reads in each direction the average median genome coverage across non-overlapping amplicon sequences was 348 reads per specimen min 56 max 395 we first performed a maximum likelihood ml phylogenetic analysis of the 88 sars-cov-2 specimen genomes in this study supplemental methods this analysis showed that most of the sequences 93 clustered in three main clades support 85 alrt and 85 ufboot figure 1a for the purposes of this report we will refer to these clades ordered by relative abundance in the sequence set as clades 1 n51 579 2 n24 273 and 3 n7 79 using the pangolin software method of lineage classification1819 isolates in clade 1 were assigned mainly to lineage b1 92 assigned to lineage b1 2 to b11 and 6 to b15 the majority of isolates in clade 2 belonged to lineage a3 92 to a3 8 to a and isolates in clade 3 belonged mainly to lineage a1 86 to a1 14 to a supplemental table 1 the intra- and inter-clade variability of the sequences showed a mean intra-group variability of 116104 base differences per site sem 316105 versus a mean inter-group variability of 480 104 base differences per site sem 117104 confirming the higher within-clade sequence similarity in the observed phylogenetic clustering to place the three observed clades in a broader geographic context we expanded our analysis to include 901 sars-cov-2 sequences from the us deposited in gisaid as of april 4 2020 with the complete us dataset we performed ml phylogenetic reconstruction of the sequences generated a temporal phylogeny and reconstructed the ancestral states of the tree to identify clade-defining mutations figure 1b and possible geographical transitions these analyses confirmed our previous clustering with a bulk of the chicago sequences falling into three distinct clades figure 2a overall the local epidemic in the chicago area was broadly reflective of the epidemic in the us as a whole clade 1 viruses clustered predominantly with those from new york while clade 3 viruses clustered with those circulating on the west coast particularly in washington state these two clades showed a broader spread across the us than clade 2 which was comprised almost exclusively of our newly sequenced specimens in illinois with only a few representatives from elsewhere in the us figure 2a supplemental figure 3 clade 2 also contained a few previously sequenced sars-cov-2 specimens identified in illinois at the end of january 20206 we next studied the phylodynamic and phylogenomic characteristics of these three clades using a bayesian approach to infer possible differences in their population dynamics these analyses suggested very limited spread of clade 2 with an average proportion of branches residing in illinois of 081 95 ci 066088 supplemental figure 3b illinois was found to be the most probable origin of clade 2 in the us with an estimated most recent common ancestor tmrca around january 18 2020 95 highest posterior density hpd interval january 9  january 21 2020 the timing location and the sequences close to the inferred root of this tree usail1 and usail2 coincide with the first reported covid-19 cases in illinois6 though alternate early introductions cannot be ruled out these results suggest that clade 2 was introduced to the chicago area early in the us epidemic with limited spread beyond illinois figure 2b middle panel a similar analysis of clade 1 suggested multiple introductions a high degree of diversity and the existence of several probable sub-clades although the highest proportion of branches were found to reside in new york this proportion was relatively low at 034 95 ci 031037 in agreement with the broad geographic spread of this clade supplemental figure 3a these findings are most consistent with clade 1 being centered in new york but rapidly expanding throughout the region and to many other locations across the us figure 2b bottom panel the tmrca of this clade in the us was calculated to be february 10 2020 95 hpd interval january 28  february 20 2020 an estimated date in close alignment with prior reports20 these results are suggestive of this clade having had multiple introductions into the chicago area with some occurring early during the epidemic in february and march of 2020 finally us isolates in clade 3 are estimated to have originated in washington state and remained centered there throughout the investigated time course proportion of branches residing in washington of 083 95 ci 081085 supplemental figure 3c this clade was also estimated to have been introduced into the us early in the epidemic tmrca  january 16 2020 95 hpd interval january 11  january 17 2020 though we cannot rule out the possibility that this clade was independently introduced on more than one occasion21 these data are most consistent with subsequent expansion of clade 3 from washington state to multiple locations throughout the us including illinois followed by limited spread elsewhere figure 2b top panel overall our results suggest that as of mid-march 2020 three main clades of sars-cov-2 were circulating in the chicago area clade 2 appears to have been introduced in illinois early in the epidemic and seems to have undergone more limited spread when compared to clade 1 centered in new york and clade 3 centered in washington to further investigate the origin and population dynamics of the clade 2 we performed a phylogenetic analysis at the global level we included an additional 3099 sars-cov-2 sequences deposited in gisaid from outside the us up through april 4 2020 we conducted similar ml analyses as those performed on the us sequences above supplemental figure 4 these results further confirmed strong statistical support for clade 2 916 alrt and 92 ufboot again the detected spread of this clade has been exceptionally limited with a majority of sequences derived from this study china or australia ancestral reconstruction of these global sequences showed low divergence of these samples from those first sequenced in wuhan china figure 3a to better discern the most likely origin of clade 2 we performed a phylogeographical analysis using all available clade 2 sequences and related global sequences as suggested above these results determined the most likely origin of this clade to be china at our current state of global sampling figure 3b clade 2-like sequences from other areas outside the us most likely represent introductions of similar viruses into those areas rather than secondary seeding from illinois one exception to this is a cluster of sequences in australia that appear to be more closely related to those in illinois than china figure 3b together these findings are most consistent with an introduction of clade 2 into illinois from china in january 2020 additionally global analysis with the other two clades supplemental figure 4 suggest that the new york-centered clade 1 was likely to have been introduced into the us from europe while the washington-centered clade 3 was most likely introduced directly from china consistent with other reports21 together these analyses show distinct global phylodynamics of the three main clades observed in the chicago area clade 1 was introduced by way of new york through europe clade 2 was introduced directly from china and clade 3 was introduced through washington state from china while clade 1 is well-represented on the east coast and clade 3 is well-represented on the west coast to date clade 2 is almost exclusively found in the chicago area the limited spread of clade 2 sars-cov-2 viruses both in the us and worldwide could suggest phenotypic variability that may impact transmission rate to further investigate this we compared the ct values for each sample which serves as a proxy for viral load in the patients upper airways at the time of diagnosis we grouped the viruses according to their assigned clade creating an additional group for the viruses that did not fall into any of the three major clades we fit a linear model to test for differences in ct values between the clades controlling for the date of isolation hospital location age sex race severity of illness and specimen collection source supplemental table 2 we detected significantly higher ct values corresponding to lower viral loads in clade 2 chicago-centered compared to clade 1 new york-centered q0008 and clade 3 washington-centered q0027 figure 4a due to the limited sample sizes for clade 3 n  7 and ungrouped specimens n  6 our subsequent analyses focus solely on clades 1 n  51 and 2 n  24 next we tested whether the source of the sample nasopharyngeal swab np vs bronchoalveolar lavage fluid bal influenced the viral load as measured by the ct value andor could account for the differences between clades 1 and 2 we tested for differences between sample source clade and both accounting for their potential interaction in the linear model we found a significant difference between np and bal samples q 00484 with lower ct values in the bal specimens supplemental figure 5a when considering only np samples the ct values of clade 1 viruses were still significantly lower than clade 2 viruses as observed previously q00062 however no significant difference in ct value was detected by clade in the bal samples while the numbers of bal samples are low this result suggests that the viral load differences between the two clades are primarily observed in the upper airways of infected patients it has been reported that viral loads in the upper airways generally decrease over the course of infection2223 to determine whether the difference in average ct values between samples from patients infected with clade 1 or clade 2 viruses corresponded with the time of specimen collection the number of days between reported symptom onset and specimen collection was determined for each patient from available case files no significant difference in time from symptom onset to specimen collection between patients infected with clade 1 or clade 2 viruses was observed supplemental figure 5b additionally the date of possible virus exposure was able to be determined for 29 patients and again no significant difference was found between clades supplemental figure 5c consistent with prior reports we did find that later dates of specimen collection after symptom onset significantly correlated with higher ct values among patients infected with clade 1 viruses though this same trend was not observed among patients infected with clade 2 viruses supplemental figure 5d these results suggest that the average viral load in the upper airways of patients infected with clade 2 viruses is lower relative to those infected with clade 1 viruses at the time of diagnosis independent of time since symptom onset given early reports that covid-19 disease severity is correlated with sars-cov-2 viral load2425 we next looked for associations between viral clades 1 and 2 and maximal disease severity disease severity was binned as mild outpatient or ed only moderate inpatient hospitalization or severe icu admission andor death and set as the outcome variable we then fit a logistic regression model including all available demographic and clinical variables interestingly we found no significant association between any available variable and disease severity in our dataset including clade figure 4b we finally fit a logistic regression model including all available demographic and clinical variables with clade as the outcome variable supplemental table 3 consistent with our previous results ct value was the only variable associated with viral clade and vice versa these data suggest that ct value in the upper airway at the time of diagnosis may not be associated with disease severity though it is associated with the viral clade in this study we report the phylogenetic and phylodynamic analyses of 88 sars-cov-2 genomes from covid-19 patients in chicago illinois us which largely fall into three major clades two of these three clades are broadly representative of the major circulating clades that expanded and disseminated rapidly across the us through early april 2020 with points of origin in new york clade 1 and washington state clade 3 in addition we identified a third major clade clade 2 that is relatively unique in the us and predominantly found in the chicago area based on current sampling viruses in this clade lack the rapid and wide dispersion evidenced with the other viral clades notably patients infected with clade 1 viruses presented with significantly higher viral loads in the upper airways at the time of diagnosis compared to patients infected with clade 2 viruses these data suggest that differences in sars-cov-2 genotype may impact viral load which in turn may influence transmission and overall viral spread chicago illinois is the third-largest city in the us and is located centrally in the country with direct flights to all continents except antarctica despite recording the second confirmed case of covid-19 and the first confirmed case of person-to-person transmission in the us relatively little sars-cov-2 sequencing data has been reported from the chicago area with only 11 sequences available on gisaid as of may 11 2020 the data presented here add an additional 88 sequences to this collection and constitute the first systematic analysis of sars-cov-2 whole genome sequences from covid-19 patients in the chicago area phylogenetic analyses of these sequences demonstrate that the major clades circulating in chicago in mid-march 2020 represent separate introduction events that can be traced back to distinct sources although the chicago-centered clade 2 and the washington-centered clade 3 are phylogenetically related this analysis shows that they were the result of geographically and temporally separate introductions into the us from china our analysis suggests that clade 2 viruses were introduced into the chicago area from china and began community transmission around mid-january 2020 while clade 3 viruses are related they are more consistent with an independent introduction event through an intermediate in washington state we additionally find that that clade 1 viruses are most likely to have been introduced to chicago via new york through europe a model which is also supported by a recent pre-print report describing the european origin of sars-cov-2 in new york city20 both the us and global sequence data suggest relatively little dispersion of clade 2 strains beyond illinois as of mid- to late-march 2020 indeed though the clade appears to have originated from china as early as mid-january 2020 there is little evidence to date of spread beyond a few likely cases in other midwest states and a secondary cluster in australia this is in contrast to clade 3 and especially clade 1 viruses which have spread over a larger geographic area in less time though a large number of isolates collected in the us and globally were available to this study through the gisaid collective under-sampling of some regions andor patient groups could have resulted in imprecise estimates of transmission patterns or potentially have missed a broader distribution of clade 2 specimens however the proportion of viruses sampled from chicago in this study that were clade 2 24 of 88 273 was far greater than the proportion in the database sampled across the us 10 of 901 11 or from non-us countries 34 of 3099 11 suggesting that clade 2 was more abundant in the chicago area relative to other sampled locations as of late march 2020 as more genomes both from illinois and elsewhere are sequenced we will continue to assess for changes in the population structure and distribution of sars-cov-2 notably we found that clade 2 viruses had significantly lower viral loads in patient upper airways relative to clade 1 viruses at the time of diagnosis this is among the first reports of sars-cov-2 phylogenetic lineage correlating with phenotypic differences clade 1 viruses are defined by nonsynonymous mutations in the rna-dependent rna polymerase nsp12 p322l and spike s d614g proteins other studies have likewise linked the spike d614g mutation to a broader global spread and to higher viral loads2627 similarly other reports have noted the rapid spread of the nsp12 p322l mutation28 our study was not designed to determine causal relationships between mutations and phenotypes and it is possible that the virus is adapting multiple independent changes that aid in its propagation lower viral loads in the upper airways of infected patients may decrease viral transmissibility and impact the overall spread but further laboratory and clinical studies will be required to test the impact of these variants on viral replication disease severity and transmissibility other than the potential for lower viral loads there are other factors that could account for the muted spread of clade 2 viruses outside the chicago region first the state of illinois instituted a relatively rapid and stringent lockdown by implementing restrictions on mass gatherings on march 13th closing schools on march 17th and issuing stay-at-home orders on march 21st while these restrictions went into place concurrent with sample gathering for this study they may have contributed to a slower spread of clade 2 viruses outside the state second the virus may be more prevalent among members of a relatively more insular community within the state with comparatively less travel or socialization with non-community members third these viruses may be found to have distinct clinical manifestations that lessen the opportunity for asymptomatic transmission to multiple other individuals ongoing studies of clinical and demographic patient data associated with ongoing specimen collection may provide support for these or other scenarios the other clinical and demographic data we examined including disease severity did not correlate significantly with clade or ct value previous reports suggested that disease severity may be correlated with viral load as measured by ct value during disease but our data suggest the same may not hold true for ct values collected at diagnosis29 although patients in the icu had lower ct values than patients in other locations supporting a link between viral load and severity most icu samples were bal specimens not np specimens this correlation may therefore simply be reflective of different ct values in the lower vs upper airways finally we did observe a correlation between ct value and the time since symptom onset confirming previous reports2223 though this did not change significantly by clade and did not explain the higher ct values of clade 2 viruses further studies with more specimens and associated clinical data will be needed to elucidate these relationships as the specimens in this study were collected over the first 8 days during which testing was broadly available at our institution the phylogenetic patterns and abundances observed represent a cross-sectional snapshot of our region longitudinal evaluations could reveal more detailed clade dynamics and population structure additionally these specimens were collected from one healthcare system primarily serving patients from the north and west sides of chicago potentially limiting generalizability to other regions in and around chicago or other parts of illinois nevertheless these data suggest chicago is an ideal location for observational and interventional studies to capture the breadth of sars-cov-2 genetic diversity this ability to compare diverse viral genotypes in a single hospital setting allowed us to identify clade-specific differences in viral load at the time of diagnosis which may in turn have consequences for transmissibility  bioinformatics analysis of sars coronavirus genome polymorphism gordana pavlovi-laeti m nenad miti s milo beljanski v   severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is a new infectious disease reported first in the autumn of 2002 and diagnosed for the first time in march 2003 1 it is still a serious threat to human health and sars coronavirus cov has been associated with the pathogenesis of sars according to kochs postulate 2 significant research efforts have been made into investigation of the sars-cov genome sequence aimed at establishing its origin and evolution to help eventually in preventing or curing the disease it causes although the task is a hard one it opens up the opportunity amongst others for comparative investigation of different sars-cov isolates aimed at identification of genome regions properties expressing different levels of sequence polymorphism 3-8 the genome of sars-cov consists of a single positive rna strand approximately 30 kb in length consisting of about 10 open reading frames orf and about 10 intergenic regions igrs the first two overlapping orfs at the 5 end encompass two-thirds of the genome while the rest of the orfs at the 3 end account for the remaining third we investigated 38 isolates of the sars-cov complete genome two pairs of which were identical sequenced and published by october 31st 2003 with updated revisions up to february 20th 2004 sequences were taken from the pubmed ncbi entrez site 9 in gbk and fasta formats table 1 the main goal was twofold first to analyze and compare nucleotide sequences to identify snps positions insertions and deletions and second to group them according to sequence similarity eventually pointing to phylogeny of sars-cov isolates according to the length of isolates insertions and deletions and the presence of snps we classified them into three main groups with subgroups regular isolates with no insertions or deletions with different numbers of snps isolates with long insertions and isolates with many individual insertions and deletions with different positions of snps which is close to phylogenetic analysis results all the sequences are between 29573 and 29757 in length table 1 with a high degree of similarity 99 pairwise still they can be differentiated on the basis of sequence polymorphism insertions and deletions number and sites of snps 8 results of the comparison of genome primary structure of the analyzed isolates are given in figure 1 analysis of genomic polymorphism of the isolates resulted in the following facts i some of the isolates are nucleotide-identical or almost identical there are two pairs of nucleotide-identical isolate sequences twh twc2 and tor2 with accession numbers ay274119 nc004718 therefore instead of 38 we consider the dataset to contain 36 isolates further the isolate twc3 differs in just one position with twh see table in additional file 1 which is about randomly expected 11 isolates frankfurt 1 and fra are identical up to the poly-a of length 13 present at the 3 end of fra figure 1 ii similarity analysis showed that a significant number of isolates have the same length 29727 bases the same beginning and ending subsequences that seem to be exact starts and ends of the complete sars-cov genome up to the poly-a at the 3 end thus forming a kind of referent group these are the isolates twh twc3 twk tws twy urbani frankfurt 1 figure 1 the fully sequenced isolate twh then has been chosen as the referent isolate for sequence comparisons since its average number of snps compared to other isolates is the smallest for example twh and urbani have an average number of snps 157 and 176 respectively for all the isolates and 57 and 105 respectively for the referent group for snps see the tables in the additional files 1 and 2 iii most isolates compared to twh are shorter at the 5end eg sin2500 sin2679 sin2774 sin2677 sin2748 as have various length poly-a strings at the 3 end eg tor2 hsr1 fra bj02 tw1 hku-39489 whu or both bj01 bj03 bj04 cuhk-w1 cuhk-su10 three of the isolates taiwan tc1 taiwan tc2 taiwan tc3 have both starting and ending deletions at the 5 end 69 at the 3 end 85 nucleotides several isolates eg twj twc sin2677 sin2748 have some short deletions inside the sequence figure 1 iv there is a group of isolates that have significant length insertions 29 nucleotides inside the sequence these are the isolates gd01 sz3 sz16 a significant number of individual insertions have been identified in zj01 and zmy 1 isolates figure 1 additional files 345 among the snp contents of isolates there is a significant difference in the number of snps for different pairs of isolates for twh as the referent isolate this number varies from 1 to 80 snps isolates may be classified into three groups based on the number of snps with twh figure 2 1 with less than 15 twc3 twk tws twy urbani twj twc tw1 tor2 hsr1 cuhk-su10 as sin2500 sin2679 sin2774 sin2677 sin2748 taiwan tc1 taiwan tc2 taiwan tc3 frankfurt1 fra hku-39849 cuhk-w1 2 between 15 and 30 whu gz50 bj01-bj04 zj01 3 with equal to or greater than 30 snps gd01 sz3 sz16 zmy 1 finally besides the number there are differences in positions of snps potential mutation sites in order to avoid nucleotide changes that probably arose during propagation of the virus in cell culture and sequencing figure 3 represents positions on the relative scale of all isolates and on twh scale where two or more snps occurred not taking into consideration isolates with long insertions gd01 sz3 and sz16 the positions of multiple snps of these three isolates similar as far as these three are concerned are highly different from all the others and are represented in figure 4 these results coincide with those published in marra et als paper 4 for urbani and tor2 isolates but differ from those published in ruans paper 8 for the 14 isolates therein analyzed sin-group bj-group tor2 urbani cuhk-w1 hku-39849 gd01 which were obviously based on different revisions of the pubmed ncbi entrez database 9 lengths of the sequences tor2 cuhk-w1 gd01 bj01-bj04 differ from the revisions we analyzed and consequently in some nucleotides and the number of base changes at given positions differences include the following positions based upon urbani and twh sars-cov 2601 tor2 t instead of c bj04 t instead of missing base 7919 bj03 c instead of t 8559 bj04 t instead of a 8572 bj01 t instead of g gd01 g instead of t 9404 bj04 t instead of missing base 9479 bj04 t instead of missing base 9854 bj04 t instead of missing base 19838 gd01 g instead of a 21721 gd01 bj01 a instead of missing base bj04 g instead of missing base 22222 bj04 c instead of n 27243 gd01 t instead of c bj03 t instead of n 29279 all as the results obtained also differ from hsueh et al 12 regarding nucleotides in hku-39849 isolate on positions 7746 9404 9479 17564 17846 19064 21721 22222 27827 additional file 12345 represent snps for all the isolates in all five groups whether they occur in orfs or igr for annotated isolates as well as the number of snps in orfs and snps in igr per isolate the total number of snps is 312 only 2 in igrs twh positions 27812 for the isolate taiwan tc3 and 27827 for the isolates bj01 and cuhk-w1 the average number of snps per isolate is 157 and significant difference from the average shows twc3 just 1 snp and zmy 1 even 80 the isolates from the dataset considered may be classified according to their sequence polymorphism and snp contents properties just described at first properties iii iv may result in three different groups figure 2 a regular isolates whose nucleotide structure is close to the referent group different 5 and 3 ends short deletion individual insertion twh twc3 twk tws twy urbani twj twc tw1 tor2 hsr1 cuhk-su10 as sin2500 sin2679 sin2774 sin2677 sin2748 taiwan tc1

will move cuhk-w1 from a1 into a2 group more than 50 of common snp positions while whu will move from a2 into a1 less than 30 of common snp positions giving the final grouping of isolates presented as a structural tree figure 2 a1 twh twc3 twk tws twy urbani twj twc tw1 tor2 hsr1 cuhk-su10 as sin2500 sin2679 sin2774 sin2677 sin2748 taiwan tc1 tc2 tc3 frankfurt1 fra hku and whu figure 5 and the

7b and the additional file 5 although qualitative in nature the structural tree turns out to be close to the quantitative grouping which is a basis for computational phylogenetic classification tables in additional files 12345 represent snps insertions and deletions in groups a-c see additional files 1 for isolates of a1 group on the relative and twh scale additional files 2 for isolates of a2 group and twh on the twh scale additional files 3 for isolates of group b with twh and additional files 45 for isolates of c1 c2 groups respectively figures 567 represent density distribution of snps insertions and deletions on the twh scale for the same groups of isolates figure 8 represents the overall density distribution of snps insertions and deletions for all the 36 isolates along with the gene map for twh which is quite similar to gene maps of other isolates density distributions do not show regularities yet with respect to the number of available sequences that could provide for precise statistical characterization still they exhibit crowding regions close to the 3 end which is also characterized by the presence of a number of proteins of unknown function it can also be noted that the proposed grouping of 36 isolates based on different criteria still conserves the previous classification t-t-t-t  c-g-c-c 8 all the isolates from groups a1 and c have t-t-t-t configuration while all the isolates from groups a2 and b have c-g-c-c configuration except for gz50 bj04 being tgcc figure 2 figure 9 the two sequence variants correspond to the epidemiological spread so that those that originated in the hotel m in hong kong have the t-t-t-t configuration  covering a1 c groups in our classification  canada tor2 singapore all sins frankfurt taiwan hong kong hku39849 hanoi urbani italy hsr1 china zj01 etc and others having c-g-c-c configuration a2 b in our classification which originated in guangdong china gd01 and gz50 hong kong cuhk-w1 sz3 and sz16 beijing bj01-bj04 the fact that the enlarged number of isolates exhibits the same properties relating to the four loci supports the assumption that the mutations could not have arisen by chance base substitution during propagation in cell culture and the sequencing procedure 8 we analyzed amino acid changes in proteins for the annotated isolates 19 out of 36 and presumed proteins in non-annotated ones for multiple snps in all the isolates results of the analysis are represented in figures 3 and 4 figure 3 shows that silent mutations occurred in envelope protein e while nucleotide changes resulted in amino acid changes in spike s membrane m and nucleocapside n proteins all three snps in the spike protein are situated in the outer membrane region and not within the potential epitope region amino acid position 469882 as proposed by ren y et al 13 amino acid changes occurred in two multiple snps in m protein one multiple snps in n protein and 7 out of 13 multiple snps of the polyprotein 1ab as well as in one multiple snp of a hypothetical protein while the silent mutations occurred in three hypothetical proteins figure 3 also represents properties of the corresponding amino acids resulted by snps the only significant change in amino acid properties is in s protein glyasp a2 b groups ie in cuhk-w1 gz50 bj01-bj03 gd01 sz3 and sz16 isolates and hypothetical protein cysarg the same isolates bj04 in addition the only addition in non-annotated sequences is in hypothetical protein following s protein in twh exhibiting silent change and in non-annotated bj02 and bj03 corresponding to the hypothetical protein glyglu similar analysis can be done for amino acid changes corresponding to snps at positions specific for b group isolates figure 4 taking into account the only annotated isolate gd01 there are five amino acid changes in polyprotein 1ab two amino acid properties changes in s protein serleu and tyrasp the second being within the epitope region one amino acid change in m protein and one amino acid property change cisarg in bgi-pup the sars-cov isolates have been multialigned using the clustalw program 10 as the very first step in obtaining a phylogenetic tree the aligned sequences have been submitted then to clustalw for bootstrapping and phylogenetic tree production enlargement of the sequence set resulted in the refinement of the phylogenetic tree produced as compared to previous results such as ruan 8 and zhangzheng 14 obtained for 14 and 16 isolates respectively the phylogenetic tree obtained drawn using the phylodraw program 15 is represented in figure 9 it is similar to our structural tree based on qualitative analysis of the isolates figure 2 the results of the analysis of dissimilarities described in previous paragraphs are in accordance with the alignment obtained by clustalw but regrouped and formatted in a way that facilitates further interpretation and application comparative analysis of genome sequence variations of 38 sars-cov isolates resulted in some conclusions that might be of interest in further investigation of the sars-cov genome 1 all of the sars-cov isolates are highly homologous more than 99 pairwise most of them have similar nucleotide structure with the same 5 and 3 ends and poly-a at the 3 end of different length 024 some of them with a single short deletion close to the 3 end of the sequence out of 312 snps in total only two are in igrs 2 three of the 38 isolates have long insertions within the sequence 3 two of the isolates have a large number of individual insertions  deletions exhibiting different snp positions 4 all the isolates may be grouped according to sequence polymorphism into three groups with up to two subgroups reflecting their similarities  dissimilarities since the isolate sequences have a high degree of homology different properties of groups are represented in a more transparent way in the classification tree obtained by such a qualitative analysis than in a bootstrapped phylogenetic tree obtained from multialigned sequences using the clustalw program 10 5 the total number of amino acid changes caused by multiple snps is 15 in isolates of a c groups and 34 in isolates of b group the total number of silent mutations is 10 for a c groups and 7 for b group 6 since s protein is of special interest regarding its receptor affinity and antigenecity it is interesting to notice that all amino acid properties changes are located in its outer membrane region one for a c groups and two for b group 7 the results obtained may be useful in further investigation aiming at identification of sars-cov genome regions responsible for its infectious nature we investigated the complete genomes of 38 sars-cov isolates nucleotide sequences are taken from the pubmed ncbi entrez database 9 in gbk and fasta formats table 1 the coverage included all the isolates published by october 31st 2003 with updated revisions the identifiers accession numbers genomic size in nucleotides revision dates and country or source of the isolates considered are included in the table together with labels as referred in this paper the fully sequenced isolate twh has been chosen as the referent isolate since its average number of snps was the lowest as compared to all other isolates for similarity analysis of isolates the following procedure has been applied consisting of two steps 1 identification of structurally identical parts of isolates ie insertion and deletion sites 2 identification of snps in structurally identical parts step 1 has been carried out by a function performing similarity analysis of subsequences of a given length eg 100 bps and identifying significantly non-matching strings as being inserted in the corresponding sequence ie deleted from the other since significant number of isolates have the same length 29727 bases and starting and ending subsequences that seem to be the exact starts and ends of the complete sars-cov genome up to the poly-a at the 3 end they may be considered as forming a representative group the nucleotide structure of all other isolates was analyzed with respect to this representative group for each pair of isolates xy x from the representative group a file insdelx-y has been produced containing positions and lengths of each of the insertions or deletions in the isolate y step 2 has been carried out by comparing structurally identical parts of the same length of pairs of isolates the starting and ending positions of those parts have been taken from the file insdelx-y for comparison of x and y produced in step 1 the procedure returns results in a file with snps in the two sequences files mismx-y we also used the clustalw program 10 for multialignment as a control process as well as for phylogenetic investigations in order to use similarity analysis results for drawing any phylogenetic conclusions about the sars-cov genome dataset a clustalw 10 multialigned output has been generated and a bootstrapped phylogenetic tree has been produced and drawn using the phylodraw program 15 gmp-l performed the computational analysis and structural classification of sars-cov genome isolates

remaining hipposideros species were assigned to the complex of forms related to currently recognized species h caffer and h ruber because 2 morphotypes were present figure 2 the mitochondrial

additional samples of this virus 1 of them from booyem cave b and the remaining from kwamang nucleotide identity among these sequences was 972100 phylogenetic analysis with different methods of inference neighbor-joining nucleotide-based neighbor-joining amino acidbased bayesian yielded variable tree topologies suggesting basal associations with either the 2a 2d or 2b subgroups data not shown 24 based on alignments of prototype group ii viruses 8 additional nested rt-pcr primer sets were designed and 2 of the samples could be amplified sequences could be extended 520 bp upstream and 383 bp downstream of the initial fragments yielding 1221-bp fragments for phylogenetic analysis bayesian phylogenetic inference with different substitution models and parallel analysis using metropolis coupling now placed the virus reliably next to a common ancestor with the 2b group of cov sars-like viruses figure 3 the bayesian posterior probability of the cov 2bghanabt-covgrp2 clade being monoyphletic was 10 a maximum of 722 nucleotide identity was shared with sars cov reliable isolation dates were researched in the literature for each employed virus because a reliable molecular clock dating existed for the most recent common ancestor mrca of the hcov-oc43bovine cov pair 25 this date was set as a normal-distributed probabilistic prior within the published ranges 25 for calibration of all analyses a first analysis was conducted on the 1225-bp dataset that did not include the novel ghanabt-covgrp1 all virus sequences were assumed to be contemporary phylogeny was inferred using a gtr  4  i model the resulting mrca date of the cov2b sars-likeghanabt-covgrp2 clade was 260 ad and that of the hcov-nl63-229e pair was 981 ad see table 2 for details to include the novel ghanabat-covgrp1 we repeated the same analysis by using the 817-bp dataset the resulting mrca date of the hcov-nl63229e pair was 816 ad in this analysis which was in good concordance with results from the 1221-bp dataset table 2 and also with previously published data 26 the diversification estimate for the novel group 1 bat-cov and hcov-229e then was 1803 ad because it has been suggested that codon-based evolutionary models may be preferred for bayesian phylogenetic inference from protein-coding datasets 27 analyses on the 817-bp dataset were repeated by using the srd06 substitution model in beast this analysis did not yield a different substitution rate but resulted in older resulting mrca dates table 2 a bayes factor test conducted in tracer yielded a strong estimate of superiority of the codon-based model over the gtr  4  i model log10 bayes factor 139 20 is highly significant to further optimize the prediction of mrca dates the constant population size assumption used in all analyses was exchanged against expansion growth or exponential growth assumptions both assumptions were predicted to fit the data better than the constant size model bayes factors 135 and 139 there was no difference between the expansion and exponential models bayes factor 034 in favor of expansion the mrca date of hcov-229e and the ghanabt-covgrp1 was 1686 expansion or 1800 exponential growth table 2 summarizes the results figure 3 shows a dated phylogeny of coronaviruses with mrcas according to the 2 last mentioned analyses to determine whether cov recombination might play a role in the studied virus population the structural nucleocapsid gene was amplified using 8 nested rt-pcr primer sets that had been designed on alignments of all available cov group 1 nucleocapsid sequences using a similar approach we also tested the same samples for cov group 2 nucleocapsid sequences only group 1 rt-pcrs yielded fragments these fragments could be combined into contiguous 1030-nt sequences for bt-cov ghanakwam 19 and 1176 nt for bt-cov ghanaboo 344 as shown in figure 3 panel b the resulting phylogenetic placement was exactly matching that of the rdrp fragments giving no evidence of recombination between the rdrp region located in the middle of the genome and the nucleocapsid gene located at the extreme downstream end sequencing of the nucleocapsid gene of the ghanabt-covgrp2 was not successful when we used 15 nested rt-pcrs designed on alignments of all available cov 2b nucleocapsid sequences amplification with above mentioned nested rt-pcrs for cov group 1 was also unsuccessful in the aftermath of the sars epidemic bats have been identified as carriers of cov in china 37 furthermore in addition to our earlier finding of antibodies against covs in various african bats 10 we have confirmed the presence of cov in bats of ghana together with recent data from germany north america trinidad and kenya 111228 these findings suggest that the association of cov with bats is a worldwide phenomenon the prevalence of cov in insect-eating bats 976 matched our previous findings in germany however in that study we sampled during the breeding season and showed that covs are most likely amplified in maternity roosts 11 the composition of the catch in this study no lactating females no young bats suggests sampling outside the breeding season and may not be directly comparable future studies relating to risks of exposure should address whether virus prevalence may change over time the risk of exposure was also addressed by investigations of virus concentration several groups have shown that covs are almost exclusively detected in bat feces and not as hypothesized earlier in saliva 342829 surprisingly little virus was found in all fecal samples tested in our study we estimated the rna concentration per full sample 100 mg feces  24 fecal pellets to be only up to 45  104 rna copies human pathogenic viruses transmitted by the fecal-oral route generate much higher virus concentrations in stool up to 1012 rna copiesmg eg for different picornaviruses 3032 based on these data it would be difficult to postulate that humans can acquire cov from bat feces however studies in other locations and at different times are needed to address virus concentration in bat droppings in more detail because virus in this study was only observed in insectivorous bats and not in frugivorous bats future studies should investigate whether insects might constitute a source of cov infection for bats to achieve a direct prediction of the potential of bat covs to infect human cells it would be highly relevant to conduct virus isolation studies on bat feces however in our study we sampled no more than 100 mg of feces per bat all samples had to be collected in rnalater solution 05 ml applied biosystems for reasons of storage and transportation although it has been suggested that rnalater solution may preserve virus infectivity 3334 our observations showed that the solution has to be diluted at least 120 in cell culture medium to avoid cytotoxicity data not shown because of the low virus rna concentrations observed we did not attempt to isolate the virus however the absence of successful virus isolation from bat feces in previous studies 3681112 may not reflect the incapability of bat cov to infect human cells recently a synthetic bat cov complemented with an appropriate spike protein has shown potential to infect human cells 35 reconstruction of phylogenetic and temporal relationships between bat cov and other mammalian cov is another way to obtain information on their zoonotic potential unfortunately for cov long sequence fragments must be analyzed before valid phylogenies can be inferred from the conserved nonstructural genome portion 2836 because of the low concentration of rna in bat samples generation of long sequences from novel bat cov is tedious and technically demanding which may be why some published phylogenies of bat cov are based on short datasets making it difficult to use these data for reference for molecular clock dating we have therefore relied on reference viruses mainly from other mammals that covered our 1221-bp fragment in the conserved rdrp region we assumed that the rdrp would be under less selective pressure than the structural genes and other nonstructural genes and therefore could be used to infer nucleotide substitution rates over distantly related covs 725263638 we have confirmed all tree topologies using alternative methods of phylogenetic inference including an mcmc algorithm implemented in mrbayes that eliminates artifacts contributed by fixation of mcmc chains in suboptimal prosterior probability maxima 20 calibration was conducted on reliable isolation dates of prototype and novel bat cov from the literature as well as on the mrca of the hcov-oc43bovine cov clade for dating of only this specific cov clade a wide range of dated virus isolates has been available that covered as much as 34 19652004 of the projected time of virus evolution from root to tip 18902004 25 a probabilistic calibration prior was used which is favorable for dating in combination with relaxed molecular clock assumptions 39 the determined mean substitution rates were in good concordance with earlier studies on non-batcov that used maximum likelihood-based methods in addition to bayesian inference 25263840 although the exponential growth prior on the virus population seemed equivalent with an expansion growth model by the bayes factor test and produced highly compatible mrcas the exponential model produced a better match with the previously determined mrca of the hcov-nl63hcov-229e pair 26 because pyrc et al generated these data by 3 alternative approaches bayesian serial unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean maximum likelihood 26 we used their mrca to validate our results and consequently prefer the mrca dating from the exponential growth population model as presented in figure 3 in plain type one earlier study on bat and non-bat cov suggested a much faster evolutionary rate for cov than other studies 7 as vijaykrishna et al pointed out their results were associated with large confidence intervals caused by the lack of available data on bt cov at the time the study was conducted 7 the increase of available sequence data now enables a better account of cov evolutionary history all covs in our study were found in members of the genus hipposideros family hipposideridae the genus rhinolophus from the sister family rhinolophidae was found to host sars-like viruses in several studies in china one of our hipposideros covs was in a basal phylogenetic relationship with the sars-like clade group 2b their most recent common ancestors date back to 400 bc tong et al 17 have detected a sequence fragment of a bat cov in kenya that also belongs to the 2b clade but is associated with the genus chaerephon a free-tailed bat that is rather distantly related to the genus hipposideros although these authors analyzed only a short sequence fragment their 2b cov seems to be related more closely to sars cov than the virus found in our study in the many studies conducted in china only closely related members of the 2b group were detected with the most basal members dating back only to the 17th century according to our analysis the co-occurrence of basal and closely related viruses in africa as well as the existence of the same virus clade in bats other than those of the family hipposideridae may entail speculations about a possible origin of the sars-like group of covs in africa rather than in asia another result that should be integrated with earlier findings is the surprisingly recent date of the mrca of the novel grp1 bt cov and the human common cold virus hcov-229e further to the proven recent host switching of sars cov vijgen et al have suggested that hcov-oc43 entered the human population 120 years ago causing a pandemic 25 this virus was most likely acquired by humans from domestic cattle results of our study show that it is not unlikely that hcov-229e which today is circulating worldwide in humans resulted from a host switching event not more than 208322 years ago however as with molecular clock dating of viruses associated confidence limits should not be overlooked because h cf ruber bats are found only in sub-saharan africa and are not migratory 23 it would be relevant to know how tightly the associated cov is restricted to its host despite the statistical limitations of our rather small sample size the absence of cov in bats of the closely related species h abae that were tested in our study in two different caves speaks in favour of tight host restriction another supportive argument is the absence of cov in c afra a bat species sampled in sufficient numbers at the booyem cave this cave was coinhabited by cov-positive h cf ruber bats if tight host restriction to nonmigratory h cf ruber bats existed this would indicate an origin of hcov-229e within the geographic range of its host ie the rainforest belt and the wet forested savannahs of sub-saharan africa 23 unfortunately it will be difficult to reconstruct whether the projected host transition event might have been associated with human epidemic disease

peptidase 411 12 the cellular receptor for mers-cov as of august 2016 212 genome sequences of mers-cov were available in genbank although 91 of the sequences were obtained from mers-cov in dromedaries a large proportion of them were from a recent study in saudi arabia13 the small number of dromedary mers-cov genomes obtained from other countries has hindered understanding of the epidemiology and evolutionary history of the virus in camels outside of saudi arabia in our previous report on mers-cov epidemiology in dubai nine dromedary mers-cov strains were sequenced and found to be closely related14 recently we have reported another dromedary mers-cov strain detected in an isolated dromedary herd in the united arab emirates uae15 complete genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis has indicated that this mers-cov strain is a unique member of a cluster of closely related mers-cov strains obtained from patients in the hafr-al-batin region of saudi arabia and qatar16 17 as well as those from patients in the recent korean outbreak18 from the results of these two studies we hypothesized that diverse mers-cov strains may be circulating in dromedaries of the uae to test this hypothesis we performed complete genome sequencing of 10 additional strains of mers-cov isolated from dromedaries in different regions of the uae the results support a polyphyletic origin of mers-cov in dromedaries and the co-circulation of diverse strains from multiple sources in the same farm a novel clade a strain the first identified in the uae may belong to a separate lineage a2 circulating in dromedaries ten mers-covs isolated from 10 respiratory samples from 10 dromedaries sent to the central veterinary research laboratory in dubai uae in 2014 and 2015 were included in this study isolation of mers-cov was performed as previously described15 briefly the samples were diluted 10-fold with viral transport medium and filtered two hundred microliters of the filtrate was inoculated into 200 l of minimum essential medium gibco grand island ny usa four hundred microliters of the mixture was added to 24-well tissue culture plates containing vero cells for adsorption inoculation after 1 h of adsorption excess inoculum was discarded the wells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and the medium was replaced with 1 ml of minimum essential medium gibco the cultures were incubated at 37 c with 5 co2 and were inspected daily by inverted microscopy for cytopathic effect cpe for five days each of the cultures exhibited the typical cpe of detachment and rounding of cells all cultures with a cpe were confirmed to be infected with mers-cov through a real-time quantitative rt-pcr assay targeting a region of the viral genome upstream of the envelope gene and isothermal amplification with a genie instrument optigene limited horsham uk viral rna was extracted from the cultures using a qiaamp viral rna mini kit qiagen hilden germany the rna was eluted in 60 l of buffer ave and was used as the template for rt-pcr the complete genomes of the 10 isolated dromedary mers-cov strains were sequenced as previously described14 15 briefly the rna extracted from the mers-cov strains was converted to cdna by using a combined random priming and oligodt priming strategy the cdna was amplified by primers designed on the basis of multiple sequence alignments of available mers-cov genome sequences using previously described strategies19 the 5 ends in the viral genomes were confirmed via rapid amplification of cdna ends race using a 53 race kit roche diagnostics gmbh mannheim germany sequences were assembled and edited to produce the final sequences of the mers-cov genomes nucleotide and amino acid sequences of predicted open reading frames orfs and the full genomes of 10 mers-cov were aligned with 85 human mers-cov and 87 camel mers-cov genomes using multiple alignment using fast fourier transform mafft ten mers-cov genome sequences from genbank were not included in the analysis because of an incomplete 5 genomic region or having redundant sequences of a single strain pairwise identity of the 182 mers-cov genome sequences as well as their orfs and predicted proteins was calculated using mega5 maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees with 1000 bootstrap replicates were constructed using phyml v30 montpellier france on the basis of the complete genome orf1a orf1b and s genes of 85 human and 97 camel mers-cov genomes the best-fit substitution model was selected using jmodeltest and used in the maximum-likelihood analysis to detect possible recombination bootscan analysis was performed by using the nucleotide alignment of the genome sequences of mers-cov and simplot version 351 as previously described20 21 the analysis was conducted using a sliding window of 1500 nucleotides moving in 200 nucleotide steps with genome sequences obtained in the present study as the query possible recombination sites suggested by the bootscan analysis were confirmed through multiple sequence alignments in addition to the bootscan analysis possible recombination breakpoints were also detected using rdp geneconv bootscan maximum chi square chimaera siscan and 3seq implemented in recombination detection program version 4 rdp4 automasking was used for optimal recombination detection the rdp analysis was run without a reference and with a window size of 60 the bootscan window size was increased to 500 the maxchi and chimaera number of variable sites per window was increased to 120 and the window size and step size for siscan were increased to 500 and 20 respectively potential recombination events detected by four or more of the seven independent recombination detection methods in the ten genomes in this study were further analyzed with phylogenetic trees constructed using sequences upstream and downstream of the potential recombination breakpoint divergence times for the mers-cov strains were calculated using a bayesian markov chain monte carlo mcmc approach implemented in beast version 180 as described previously22 23 one representative strain was selected for mers-cov strains with close sequence similarity and obtained from the same outbreak analyses were performed under the srd06 substitution models for the concatenated main coding regions of the genome orf1ab s e m and n with an uncorrelated lognormal molecular clock and a gmrf skyride coalescent model the mcmc run was 1  108 steps long with sampling every 1000 steps convergence was assessed on the basis of the effective sampling size after a 10 burn-in using tracer software version 16022 the mean time to the most recent common ancestor tmrca and the highest posterior density regions at 95 hpds were calculated the trees were summarized in a target tree by using the tree annotator program included in the beast package by choosing the tree with the maximum sum of posterior probabilities maximum clade credibility after a 10 burn-in the nucleotide sequences of the ten dromedary mers-cov genomes sequenced in this study have been submitted to the genbank sequence database under accession nos kx108937kx108946 we isolated 10 mers-cov strains from nasal swabs of two live and eight dead dromedary calves from different regions in the uae including a breeding herd which returned from its winter pasture in saudi arabia and calves from dromedary dairy farms in dubai and umm al quwain the clinical and epidemiological data of the 10 dromedaries infected with mers-cov strains isolated and sequenced in this study are summarized in table 1 and figure 1 the median age of the dromedaries was 1 month range 15 days to nine months two of the eight dead dromedaries exhibited nasal discharge before they died phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomes of the ten sequenced mers-cov isolates showed that one isolate belongs to clade a and nine belong to clade b table 2 figure 2 phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome orf1a orf1b and the s gene sequences all showed that the clade a strain d99815 isolated from a 1-month-old dromedary calf from a special dairy farm in dubai is a unique member of clade a being most closely related to another dromedary isolate nrce-hku205 which was previously detected in egypt figure 3 moreover these two isolates formed a separate cluster distinct from the other two known clade a strains emc2012 and jordan-n32012 both isolated from humans the results suggest that clade a isolates from humans and camels may form two separate lineages a1 and a2 this hypothesis is further supported by analysis of amino acid substitutions along the whole genome sequences comparison of deduced amino acid sequences of proteins among clade a1 clade a2 and the six lineages of b strains showed a total of 16 substitutions most occurring in the viral nsp3 and s proteins table 2 notably two substitutions in nsp3 at positions 1574 and 1717 were found within the catalytic domain of plpro24 highly variable residues were observed at position 1574 which has been reported to be under positive selection25 another substitution in the s protein at position 1020 glutamine in clade a strains and histidinearginine in clade b strains was found within heptad repeat 1 of the s2 region interestingly the heptad repeat region has recently been reported to be a major selection target among mers-covs and different residues at position 1020 may affect the stability of the six-helix bundle formed by the heptad repeats26 there were nine amino acid substitutions between clade a and b strains and five amino acid substitutions between clade a1 and a2 strains from these results we propose that the two clade a dromedary isolates d99815 and nrce-hku205 should be classified under a new lineage a2 which is distinct from the two clade a human isolates emc2012 and jordan2012 the nine clade b isolates belong to three distinct lineages figure 2 five isolates from a dairy farm in dubai and one from a dubai breeding herd returning from saudi arabia belong to lineage 1 one isolate from a dairy farm in dubai and one from umm al qaiwain belong to lineage 3 one isolate from a dairy farm in dubai belongs to lineage 5 figure 2 phylogenetic trees based on orf1a orf1b and the s gene were further constructed to assess strains that had an inconsistent phylogenetic position in the different trees the two lineage three strains in this study d127115 and d1189115 along with other lineage three strains were found to cluster more closely with lineage 4 mers-cov in the tree constructed for orf1a but cluster more closely with lineage 5 mers-cov in the tree constructed for orf1b figure 3 for the tree constructed for the s gene these lineage three strains did not cluster closely with either lineage 4 or lineage 5 mers-cov figure 3 the remaining eight strains identified in this study were found to consistently cluster within the same lineages in all three trees figure 3 because phylogenetic analyses showed inconsistent phylogenetic positions for strains d127115 and d1189115 in the orf1a and orf1b trees we performed bootscan analysis and multiple sequence alignments for these two strains for both strains bootscan analysis showed high bootstrap support for clustering between the two strains and lineage 4 mers-cov in two parts of their genomes position 115000 but for position 1500024000 bootscan analysis showed high bootstrap support for clustering between the two strains and lineage 5 mers-cov figure 4a a multiple sequence alignment using these two strains a lineage 4 mers-cov and a lineage 5 mers-cov further indicated that upstream of position 14697 the two strains possessed nucleotides identical to lineage 4 mers-cov but from position 1615523785 the two strains possessed nucleotides similar to lineage 5 mers-cov figure 4a for the analysis using rdp4 recombination breakpoints were detected in the two genomes at positions 14958 and 28835 phylogenetic trees constructed using concatenated nucleotides sequences from position 1 to 14957 and 28836 to 30087 and from position 14958 to 28835 confirmed the inconsistent phylogenetic position of these two newly detected strains in the two trees figure 5 the inferred evolutionary rate of mers-cov was 855  104 95 hpd 709  104 101  103 the divergence time of the present 10 dromedary strains is shown in figure 6 on the basis of time-resolved phylogeny the root of the tree is january 2011 95 hpd june 2010 august 2011 the time of the most recent common ancestor tmrca of clade a was dated back to march 2011 95 hpd august 2010 september 2011 and that of clade b to november 2011 95 hpd july 2011 march 2012 figure 6 in this study we showed that mers-covs isolated from dromedaries in the uae were of polyphyletic origin for the eight mers-cov strains isolated from dromedaries from dairy farms in dubai one belongs to clade a d98815 and seven d2597214 d25215 d37415 d38315 d38915 d115715 and d127115 belong to clade b figure 2 interestingly the source clade a strain d98815 was isolated from a young female dromedary in a special dairy farm with camel mothers from pakistan therefore the source of this virus was most probably different from that of the seven clade b strains which were isolated from dromedaries from a different dairy farm the latter farm is a large closed system which may explain the relative genetic closeness of the circulating mers-cov strains yet the seven clade b isolates belonged to three distinct lineages with five isolates d2597214 d25215 d37415 d38315 and d38915 clustered with several other mers-cov from dubai27 for the mers-cov isolated from a dromedary calf returning from saudi arabia 1164114 the dromedary was from a herd of approximately 50 female breeding dromedaries in dubai every year these camels were brought to saudi arabia for 6 months because of the better grazing conditions due to the higher amount of rainfall in saudi arabia than in dubai the dromedary calves from this herd were born in saudi arabia young dromedaries are usually removed from the herd and start their training as racing camels when they are one year old although this mers-cov was most probably acquired in saudi arabia its genome sequence is closely related to two human mers-cov strains from oman kt156560 and abu dhabi kp209312 respectively figure 2 the mers-cov isolated from the dromedary in umm al quwain d1189115 is closely related to d127115 in this study and to a human mers-cov strain isolated in thailand kt225476 figure 2 the present data showed that the genome sequences of the mers-cov strains isolated in the uae were intermingled with other mers-cov strains found elsewhere in the middle east or strains from patients who acquired their infections directly or indirectly in the middle east moreover diverse mers-covs are co-circulating in dromedaries in the uae which derive from different sources this polyphyletic origin of mers-cov is unique among human covs such a polyphyletic origin of mers-cov in dromedaries is similar to the diverse lineages of sars-cov-like viruses in horseshoe bats28 29 but in contrast to the monophyletic origin of most human sars-cov strains mers-cov strains from humans are polyphyletic as a result of multiple camel-to-human transmission events30 31 according to the existing evidence a single interspecies transmission event probably occurred from bats to palm civets as the intermediate or amplification host and then from palm civets to humans before the sars epidemic in 200328 32 33 the rapid expansion of the epidemic arose after efficient human-to-human transmission of the human sars-cov strains in contrast mers-cov has become endemic in dromedaries of the uae and other countries in the middle east with diverse strains being introduced into the human population this finding is in line with the overall mers-cov phylogeny in the middle east with the tmrca of all mers-covs being dated back to around january 2011 thus suggesting that mer-cov has emerged in humans relatively recently figures 2 and 6 the difference in evolutionary pathways between sars-cov and mers-cov also provides an explanation for why mersunlike sars which disappeared rapidly after civets were segregated from humans by closing wild animal markets in provinces in southern chinahas persisted for more than three years and will probably continue to circulate in dromedaries and humans unless effective vaccines are available recently viruses closely related to human coronavirus 229e hcov 229e have also been found in camels34 however in contrast to the polyphyletic origin of human and camel mers-covs the hcov 229e and related dromedary-derived viruses were each monophyletic thus suggesting that this endemic human coronavirus may constitute a descendant of camelid-associated viruses the clade a isolate d98815 the first clade a mers-cov detected in the uae may belong to a separate lineage a2 within clade a at present there are only a few clade a isolates including the first human mers-cov isolated in saudi arabia emc2012 another human isolate from jordan jordan-n32012 two dromedary strains from egypt nrce-hku205 and nrce-hku270 with partial sequence available only35 and six nigerian strains genome not completely sequenced36 although clade a strains are much less common than clade b strains our results suggest that diverse clade a mers-covs may be present in various countries in the middle east and africa both phylogenetic and amino acid substitution analyses showed that the current clade a strains may consist of two distinct lineages one from humans a1 and one from camels a2 further studies to isolate and sequence more clade a strains in humans and camels may provide insights on the role of clade a strains in mers-cov evolution and the potential significance of the observed amino acid changes for host adaptation the present results show that recombination events are common among certain strains of mers-cov recombination is a well-recognized mechanism by which covs generate diversity we have previously described recombination among the three human cov hku1 genotypes and other human or animal coronaviruses21 37 38 and other researchers have also found recombination in coronaviruses such as feline coronavirus type ii and infectious bronchitis virus39 a number of studies have also reported recombination among mers-covs from different countries13 40 however we should be cautious when interpreting possible recombination events solely on the basis of phylogenetic analysis to avoid drawing premature conclusions for example by phylogenetic tree analysis strains d127115 and d1189115 in the present study and strain d2731314 which we have reported previously15 showed inconsistent phylogenetic clustering in trees based on different viral genes figure 3 however bootscan analysis and multiple alignments did not reveal evidence of recombination for strain d2731314 figure 4b only strains d127115 from dubai and d1189115 from umm al quwain showed evidence of a likely recombination event after stepwise examination using phylogenetic analysis bootscan analysis and multiple sequence alignments figure 4a it is also important to note that the nucleotide sequences of all mers-cov genomes are 99 identical therefore even for the strains with possible recombination there are only approximately 10 base pair differences upstream and downstream of the potential recombination site between the recombinant and parent strains although these sequence differences may have arisen through recombination they may also have resulted from individual nucleotide mutations further studies with careful interpretation of recombination analysis results will be important to understand the role of recombination in the emergence and evolution of mers-cov  neocov is closer to mers-cov than sars-cov mohamed hassan m mohamed hussain a sumaya kambal ahmed elshikh

450 kda and the second is orf1ab measuring approximately 750 kda these
polyproteins have processed into numbers of nonstructural ns proteins and 4
structural proteins namely spike s protein envelope e protein membrane m
protein and nucleocapsid n protein5 these structural proteins are important components as they play key roles in
cov infectivity in which the integral membrane protein m adapts a region of
membrane for virus assembly and captures other structural proteins at the budding
site the n protein chaperones and protects the viral rna genome s protein
which consists of 3 copies of the s glycoprotein promoting receptor-binding and
membrane fusion and the small membrane protein e which presents in
sub-stoichiometric amounts and acts as budding enhancer6 it has previously been identified that mers-cov is a beta cov causing high morbidity
and mortality in humans7 in saudi arabia it has been detected in a patient clinically diagnosed with
a severe respiratory infection8 in june 11 2014 mers-cov infection has been diagnosed in 699 patients
mainly from the arabian peninsula with a case fatality rate potentially exceeding
the rate reported during the sars-cov pandemic9 a research has reported a high rate of neutralizing antibodies against
mers-cov found in camels in the arabian peninsula showing high relationship at
genetic level to those from human cases suggesting that these camels are
constituting the source of human infections10 at molecular level the covs have a high frequency of recombination due to
their unique replication mechanism which increases the propensity to result in high
rates of mutation allowing the viruses to acclimatize to new hosts and ecological niches11 de benedictis et al have characterized small genomic sequence fragments of
bat covs btcovs that were closely related to mers-cov and suggested that mers-cov
ancestors may have evolved in bats12 in china since 2002 sars-cov was implicated as a causative agent of sars
and caused atypical pneumonia that spread rapidly throughout parts of asia north
america and europe during 2002 to 2003 with cases having been reported in 30 countries13 according to the world health organization report the mortality rate of
sars-cov was more than 105 close person-to-person contact has been shown to be the major transmission
way of sars-cov principally via contact with aerosolized droplets or other bodily fluids14 shortly after sars-cov outbreak and the subsequent implication of bats as
reservoir hosts of the causative agent cov drove numerous studies on bats and the
viruses they harbor a specimen from neoromicia cf zuluensis bat in 2011 yielded a
novel betacoronavirus called neocov15 according to the ndapewa ithete and his colleagues results in 2013 neocov differed
from mers-cov by only one amino acid aa exchange 03 in the translated 816-nt
rdrp gene fragment and by only a 109 aa sequence distance in
the gene that encodes the glycoprotein responsible for cov attachment and cellular
entry thus neocov was much more related to mers-cov than any other known virus16 victor max corman et al10 reported that 85 of the neocov genome was identical to mers-cov at the
nucleotide level therefore neocov shared essential details of genome architecture
with mers-cov and thus they have suggested that neocov and mers-cov belonged to one
viral species the presence of a genetically divergent s1 subunit within the neocov
spike gene indicated that intra-spike recombination events may have been involved in
the emergence of mers-cov9 despite the clinical similarities between mers and sars mers-cov is distinct
from sars-cov in several biological aspects such as it uses a distinct receptor
dpp4 and was classified as a generalist cov which enable it to infect a broad
range of cells in culture7 in this study we have attempted to provide a better understanding of the
relationship between mers-cov sars-cov and neocov at the level of amino acids
regarding 6 similar proteins including e m n s orf1a and orf1ab using
different bioinformatics tools the leading force for this study was the previous
studies which constructed phylogenetic tree between different species of
coronaviridae based on either structural protein and nonstructural protein or whole
genome and they have found that there was some relationship between mers-cov and
sars-cov while others studied the relationship between mers-cov and neocov but
there was no study included mers-cov sars-cov and neocov in the same study to know
whose is the most related to whom bioinformatics tools and phylogenetic analysis
enables us to understand relationships between ancestral sequences and its
descendants in this study genome sequences of the 3 target species of cov were retrieved
from the national center for biotechnology information ncbi genome and
nucleotide databases httpswwwncbinlmnihgovgenome httpswwwncbinlmnihgovnuccore namely mers-cov genome
id 31360 sars-cov genome id 10320 and neocov genome id kc869678
however 4 structural proteins e s n and m and 2 ns proteins orf1a and
orf1ab of each species were obtained from the ncbi protein database wwwncbinlmnihgovprotein table 1 presents general information
about all retrieved both nucleotide and protein sequences these genome and
protein sequences were then subjected for comparison using different
bioinformatics prediction tools nucleotide composition of the target genomes mers-cov sars-cov and neocov was
calculated as shown in table 2 using molecular evolutionary genetics analysis software
version 70 mega7 httpswwwmegasoftwarenethome furthermore pairwise
alignment was done for each pair of target genomes using blast needleman-wunsch
global align nucleotide sequences httpsblastncbinlmnihgovblastcgi as it is presented in
figure 1 for the purpose of protein sequences comparison first the multiple sequence
alignments msa was done using the clustal method implemented in clustal omega
tool httpwwwebiacuktoolsmsaclustalo following the
alignment phylogenetic relationships were depicted in phylogram using distance
matrix methods neighbor-joining nj and unweighted pair group method with
arithmetic mean upgma in phylogeny server httpwwwebiacuktoolsphylogenyclustalw2phylogeny1718 once trees
were constructed they were viewed by treedyn viewer tool httpwwwtreedynorg as shown in boxes b and c in figures 4 6 8 10 12 and 14 by the same token second scenario
was as follows and msa was done by multiple sequence comparison by
log-expectation muscle method using muscle online tool httpswwwebiacuktoolsmsamuscle after that alignment
results in phylip or clustal format were subjected to gblocks program version
091b alignment curation tool furthermore phyml 30 using
maximum-likelihood method and protpars using parsimony method were used to
generate newick format tree files which have been viewed by treedyn viewer tool19 as shown in boxes a and d in figures 4 6 8 10 12 and 14 previous tools are available at
gblocks httpmolevolcmimacsicescastresanagblocksserverhtml
phyml 30 httpwwwatgc-montpellierfrphyml and protpars httpwwwtrexuqamca the third scenario was revolved
around constructing ultrametric phylogenetic trees using muscle method for
multiple sequence alignments and reltime method to generate the tree then
time-trees were generated by the molecular evolutionary genetics analysis
software version 70 mega7 httpswwwmegasoftwarenethome figures 2 and 3 show the constructed phylogenetic trees
of this scenario that have been done by mega7 to determine physical and chemical properties of the protein sequence protparam
tool httpwebexpasyorgprotparam has been used which gives the
computation of various physical and chemical parameters for a given protein
stored in swiss-prot or trembl databases or for a user entered sequence the
computed parameters are the molecular weight theoretical pi amino acid

instability index aliphatic index and grand average of hydropathicity gravy
as presented in tables
3 to 1428 same type of protein sequences of the cov species of interest was compared using
basic local alignment search tool blast httpsblastncbinlmnihgovblastcgi pairwise alignment
was done to determine the matched regions and the number of identicalsimilar
amino acids as described in table 15 for the purpose of converting the primary protein structure to secondary protein
structure gor iv tool has been used version 40 httpsnpsa-prabiibcpfrcgi-binnpsaautomatplpagenpsagor4html
which was based on the information theory which gives the 2 outputs the first
output comprised the sequence and the predicted secondary structure in rows
h  helix e  extended or beta strand and c  coil the second presents
probability values for each secondary structure at each amino acid position the
program gives the predicted secondary structure with the highest probability
compatible with a predicted helix segment of at least 4 residues and a predicted
extended segment of at least 2 residues29 as shown in figures
16 to 21 the three-dimensional 3d structure prediction of target structural proteins e
m n and s was obtained by using cph models and raptorx servers in cph
server the template recognition is based on profile-profile alignment guided by
secondary structure and exposure predictions httpwwwcbsdtudkservicescphmodels30 proteins that do not have close 3d structures were subjected to raptorx
server which was developed by xu group it is excelling at predicting 3d
structures for protein sequences without close homologs in the protein data bank
pdb additionally it predicts secondary and tertiary structures contacts
solvent accessibility disordered regions and binding sites with many
confidence scores to indicate the quality of the predicted 3d model including
p value for the relative global quality global distance
test gdt and un-normalized gdt ugdt for the absolute global quality and
modeling error at each residue31 then for the purpose of protein 3d structures visualization chimera
software v18 has been used httpwwwcglucsfeduchimera it is a high-quality
extensible molecular graphics program designed to maximize interactive
visualization analysis system and related data32 as shown in figures
22 to 25 the tm-score is defined to assess the topological similarity of 2 protein structures33 zhang tool is designed to solve 2 major problems in the traditional
metrics such as root mean square deviation rmsd 1 tm-score measures the
global fold similarity and is less sensitive to the local structural variations
and 2 magnitude of tm-score for random structure pairs is length-independent
tm-score has the value between 0 and 1 where 1 indicates a perfect match
between 2 structures following strict statistics of structures in the pdb
scores below 017 correspond to randomly chosen unrelated proteins whereas with
a score higher than 05 assume generally the same fold in scopcath httpszhanglabccmbmedumichedutm-score34 table
16 in this study we have endeavored to provide a deep understanding of the relationship
between mers-cov sars-cov and neocov at the amino acids level as the proteins are
representing the functional unit of the genome and are directly involved in chemical
processes essential for life the proteins are species and organ-specific in which
the proteins of one species or organs differ from those of another species or
organs however proteins of similar function have similar amino acid composition
and sequence despite the difficulties in explaining functions of protein from its
amino acid sequence understanding the correlations between structure and function
is the key role of protein function with respect to the aim of determining the properties of amino acids that compose
proteins of this study table
1 shows the physical and chemical properties of these proteins amino
acids that are present in all cov species of interest35 we have found that the number of amino acids of e m n and s proteins in
addition to all other parameters including molecular weight atomic composition
theoretical pi and structural formula of mers-cov and neocov were close to each
other if not identical and this has supported the previous finding that neocov was
closely related to mers-cov and suggested that mers-covs ancestors may have evolved
in bats12 this finding is in contrary to victor max corman et al10 results which have reported that neocov and mers-cov belonged to one viral
species and that the presence of a genetically divergent s1 subunit
within the neocov spike gene indicated that intra-spike recombination events may
have been involved in the emergence of mers-cov because there were some differences
regarding all 6 proteins and not s protein only9 in accordance with our results agnihothram et al1 have demonstrated that neocov shared essential details of genome architecture
with mers-cov but however disagreement in that 85 of the neocov genome is
identical to mers-cov at the nucleotide level in this study we used 5 different methods of phylogenetic tree construction
including maximum parsimony mp neighbor-joining nj unweighted pair group
method with arithmetic mean upgma maximum likelihood ml and reltime rt to
depict the relatedness evolution change and relative time between the viruses of
interest in the level of genome and protein according to phylogenetic results of
the whole genomes which had relied on muscle alignment results have shown that
joining of mers-cov and sars-cov with the nearest common ancestor and mers-cov has
the lowest evolutionary change genetic distances the reltime method showed that
neocov was the oldest while mers-cov and sars-cov were belonged to the same time
based on the relative time furthermore according to phylogenetic results of
protein sequences which had relied on muscle and clustalw alignment methods in
general trees have shown that joining neocov and mers-cov proteins in same clades
indicates that they are closest on the basis of all used methods furthermore
according to the horizontal branch length through used methods most neocov proteins
have the shortest branch length comparing to others regarding proteins primary and secondary structures most of the comparison results
showed the most similarity between neocov and mers-cov another comparison tool has
template modeling score tm-score which is used to measure the topological
similarity between the structure of proteins and this method is insensitive to
local structural variation the tm results confirmed that neocov was more close to
mers-cov than sars-cov generally phylogenetic analysis of the 6 proteins e s m
n orf1a and orf1ab revealed that there were high similarities between the 3
viruses although neocov appeared close to mers-cov this result indicated that they
have the same common ancestor and neocov may implicate in human-related infection
sooner because of high similarity in portions involved in viral infectivity  nonstructural proteins ns7b and ns8 are likely to be phylogenetically associated with evolution of 2019-ncov muhamad fahmi yukihiko kubota masahiro ito   in december 2019 the seventh human coronavirus termed 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was found in wuhan china on february 8 2020 the total number of infections and deaths due to 2019-ncov globally was 34439 and 720 respectively according to the johns hopkins university center for systems science and engineering coronaviruses are enveloped rna viruses that infect many species including humans other mammals and birds after infection the host may develop respiratory bowel liver and neurological diseases weiss and leibowitz 2011 cui et al 2019 coronaviruses are members of the order nidovirales and subfamily orthocoronavirinae this subfamily is divided into four genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus generally alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus tend to infect mammals while gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus typically infect birds however some gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus can infect mammals under specific conditions woo et al 2012 in immunocompromised individuals infection with one of the four human coronaviruseshuman coronavirus nl63 hcov-nl63 human coronavirus 229e hcov-229e human coronavirus oc43 hcov-oc43 and human coronavirus hku1 ecov-hku1usually results in cold-like symptoms these viruses can cause severe infections in some infants and the elderly due to the frequent interaction between wild animals and humans wild animals are a common source of human zoonotic infections sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov are zoonotic coronaviruses that can cause severe respiratory diseases in humans both belong to betacoronavirus su et al 2016 forni et al 2017 cui et al 2019 luk et al 2019 ramadan and shaib 2019 2019-ncov is the seventh coronavirus discovered that infects humans it causes acute respiratory disease in respiratory infections immediately after its discovery the complete genome sequence of 2019-ncov was determined the sequence mn908947 was released by genbank on 05 january 2020 lu et al 2020 the sequence of 2019-ncov is 96 identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus zhou et al 2020 the genomic characteristics and epidemiology of 2019-ncov have been analyzed lu et al 2020 nine inpatient culture isolates were subjected to next-generation sequencing and individual complete and partial 2019-ncov genomic sequences were obtained phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-ncov genomes and other coronaviruses was performed to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and to explore the origin of 2019-ncov at the first onset homology modeling investigated the potential receptor-binding properties of the virus however sars-cov and mers-cov showed approximate similarities of 79 and 50 with 2019-ncov respectively these findings indicated that there is not a close evolutionary relationship of 2019-ncov with sars-cov and mers-cov thus 2019-ncov is considered the seventh novel human betacoronavirus lu et al 2020 in this study we comprehensively characterized the relationship of the translated proteins of 2019-ncov to other species of orthocoronavirinae this was done using a combination of the phylogenetic tree constructed from the genome sequences and the cluster tree developed from the profiles retrieved from the presence and absence of homologs of ten 2019-ncov proteins
 the genomes and the combination of genome and protein sequences were used to develop a phylogenetic tree and phylogenetic profiling respectively the dataset of the genomes of the orthocoronavirinae subfamily was collected from the refseq database using the orthocoronavirinae ncbi taxonomy id txid2501931 this dataset contains representative complete genomes from each species of that subfamily pruitt et al 2007 federhen 2012 supplementary table 1 additionally we collected genome sequences from bat sars-like coronavirus mg772934 and mg772933 from ncbi and betacovbatyunnanratg132013 epiisl402131 from gisaid httpwwwgisaidorg one species of the okanivirinae subfamily the yellow head virus was also collected as an outgroup supplementary table 1 the genome sequences were aligned using mafft multiple sequence alignment program provided at the xsede portal in the cipres science gateway with an automatic selection strategy miller et al 2012 katoh and standley 2013 a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method with raxml-hpc blackbox in the cipres science gateway stamatakis 2006 the analysis used an automatic bootstrapping option using a general time-reversible substitution model with a gamma-shape parameter gtr g the model was selected as the best-fit model under the akaike information criterion using modeltest-ng darriba et al 2020 phylogenetic trees were viewed using figtree v14 httptreebioedacuksoftwarefigtree the annotated protein sequences of 2019-ncov were collected from the data of one representative genome from ncbi mn996527 we built a blast database with the retrieved genome sequences data using blast version 2230 camacho et al 2009 we then determined the presence and absence of homolog proteins of one representative set of annotated 2019-ncov proteins against other genome sequences in a database using tblastn with a threshold of 50 and  25 bits score for protein sequences 50 amino acids aa and  50 aa in length respectively the results of the presence and absence of homolog proteins were converted into a binary matrix and used to build a clustering tree using ward hierarchical clustering method ward jr 1963 supplementary table 2 nonstructural protein ns 7b and ns8 local alignments were only positive in the sarbecovirus subgenus sample excluding the sars coronavirus additionally we predicted the structural properties of the 2019-ncov ns7b protein including the secondary structure and order-disorder propensity using jpred4 and dichot respectively fukuchi et al 2014 drozdetskiy et al 2015 we also predicted the structure using the contact assisted protein structure prediction c-i tasser composite approach zhang et al 2018 additionally we specifically collected the sequences that produced significant alignments of ns7b using the mega x software kumar et al 2018 the phylogenetic analysis using complete genome sequences showed that 2019-ncov was the most closely related to batcov ratg13 and belonged to the sarbecovirus subgenus of betacoronavirus together with sars coronavirus and bat-sars-like coronavirus bat-sl-covzxc21 and bat-sl-covzc45 with the full support of reliability fig 1
 additionally hibecovirus with bat hp-betacoronaviruszhejiang2013 as the representative species was the most closely related subgenus of betacoronavirus to sarbecovirus as compared to other subgenera including merbecovirus under which mers-cov has been classified nobecovirus and embecovirus these findings agree with previous phylogenetic tree and similarity plot data paraskevis et al 2020 2019-ncov was found to be more closely related to the bat-infecting sarbecovirus species bat sars-like coronavirus and betacov ratg13 than to the sars coronavirus that infects humans this indicated that 2019-ncov more likely originated from bats however the wuhan outbreak was first detected in december which is a time of year when most bat species hibernate moreover the huanan seafood market which is considered as ground zero of the outbreak does not sell bats instead it has been suggested that there is an animal mediator for virus transmission from bats to humans similar to the previous cases of sars-cov and mers-cov wherein the masked palm civet paguma larvata and dromedary camel camelus dromedarius act as intermediate hosts respectively lu et al 2020 although coronaviruses can exchange genetic material during coinfection a recent report described the lack of a mosaic relationship of 2019-ncov to the closely related sarbecovirus indicating the lack of a recombination event in the emergence of 2019-ncov paraskevis et al 2020 hence 2019-ncov likely emerged from the accumulation of mutations responding to altered selective pressures or from the infidelity of rna polymerase perpetuated as replication-neutral mutations these speculations need to be studied further a previously reported comprehensive similarity plot revealed notable mutational hotspots and conserved regions of the genome nucleotide positions of 2019-ncov against closely related coronaviruses lu et al 2020 paraskevis et al 2020 the present findings provide a different perspective of the similarity among orthocoronavirinae species using a cluster tree developed from the profiles retrieved from the presence and absence of homologs of ten 2019-ncov proteins this cluster was combined with the cladogram of a previously constructed phylogenetic tree fig 2
 both the trees were consistent in their heatmap distributions the tree of 2019-ncov proteins comprised two clades the first indicated with a blue bar in fig 2 contained a group of conserved proteins in most orthocoronavirinae species these comprised orf1ab polyprotein nucleocapsid protein spike glycoprotein and membrane protein spike and orf1a regions of 2019-ncov were previously shown to have the lowest sequence identity as compared to the closely related coronavirus species lu et al 2020 paraskevis et al 2020 however since the translated spike glycoprotein and orf1ab polyprotein from these regions are very long the sequence similarity is still sufficient to classify them as homologs in contrast another clade indicated by the green bar in fig 2 comprised proteins specific to sarbecovirus for all proteins in this clade and hibecovirus for envelope protein only this clade included proteins that were not completely conserved by all orthocoronavirus two ns7b and ns8 of five nonstructural proteins were specific for 2019-ncov and its closely related species batcov ratg13 and bat-sars-like coronavirus bat-sl-covzxc21 and bat-sl-covzc45 the other three nonstructural proteins ns3 ns6 and ns7a were also detected in the sars coronavirus based on these results we propose that the comprehensive analysis of nonstructural proteins especially ns7b and ns8 may provide new insight into the properties of 2019-ncov as shown in fig 2 ns7b and ns8 of 2019-ncov batcov ratg13 and bat-sars-like coronavirus were distinct from other species of orthocoronavirus in sars-cov ns7b is an integral protein localized in the golgi compartment the protein is packaged into sars-cov particles schaecher et al 2007 interestingly open reading frame orf 7b but not orf 7b deletion induces interferon ifn-dependent reporter gene expression as well as apoptosis and the type i ifn response pfefferle et al 2009 moreover the deletion of orf 7b enhance virus growth pfefferle et al 2009 thus we speculate that the property of the non-conserved ns7b in 2019-ncov may affect the human infective property of the virus similarly the existence of 29 nucleotide deletions in orf 8b has been described in sars-cov oostra et al 2007 a study involving mers-cov described that orf 8b strongly antagonizes the inf-beta  promoter and orf4b and 8b significantly suppress ifn induction lee et al 2019b accessory proteins 8b and 8ab of sars-cov can suppress the inf- signaling pathway and thus interferon production by their participation in the ubiquitin-mediated rapid degradation of inf regulatory factor 3 irf3 wong et al 2018 in contrast when we focused on mers-cov from bats and camels orf 8b antagonized melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5-mediated nuclear factor kappa b nf-b activation orf 8b strongly inhibited tank-binding kinase 1-mediated induction of nf-b signaling but not ib kinase epsilon and irf3-mediated activations lee et al 2019a thus we speculate that the properties of the accessory proteins ns7b and ns8 in 2019-ncov may affect its ability to infect humans further studies are required to confirm this speculation ns7b is a short peptide of 43 residues a three-dimensional structure is often difficult to obtain from such a short peptide we predicted the three-dimensional structure of the queried ns7b amino acid sequence using dichot and c-i-tasser supplementary fig 1 fig 3
 fukuchi et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 a protein family pf11395 was found but no known three-dimensional structure was found the secondary structure of this query was also predicted using jpred4 supplementary fig 2 drozdetskiy et al 2015 the secondary structure was predicted to be an -helix but that this very likely does not occur depending on the environment fig 3 the alignment of this protein revealed three polymorphism sites between 2019-ncov batcov ratg13 and bat-sars-like coronavirus sequences bat-sl-covzxc21 and bat-sl-covzc45 supplementary fig 3 in summary some nonstructural proteins were conserved and others were not conserved between 2019-ncov and sars-cov by focusing on the 2019-ncov-specific proteins ns7b and ns8 we proposed a combination of phylogenetic profiling analysis and structural characterization of the genes that were specifically expressed in 2019-ncov and the closely related bat coronavirus the data provide insight for further characterization of the infective properties of this virus the following are the supplementary data related to this article

 the phylogenomic tree of our study indicates that the target wuhan-hu-1 genome was closely related to different isolates of sars-cov-2 genomes bat coronavirus ratg13 bat-sars-cov zxc21 and pangolin-cov gx-p5l were found to be an ancestor a separate phylogenomic tree of various isolates of sars-cov-2 was represented in supplementary fig s1 bat sars-like coronavirus was found to be an ancestor of newly identified covid-19 dataset used for the phylogenomic and phylogeographic tree construction and its closely related species are available in supplementary table s1 based on the constructed genomic tree we further summarized and select an isolate of phylogenetic neighbor from each cluster along with two newly sequenced indian isolates accession mt0120981 mt0504931 to identify proteomic differentiation between them based on these criteria a proteome-based phylogenetic analysis was performed it also provides support evidence to the zoonotic evolution theory that sars-cov-2 might have evolved from bat sars-like coronavirus and pangolin coronavirus as represented in fig 2a when compared with the previous study the genome of sars-cov-2 was found to be about 82 96 and 869 identical to the sars-cov bat-cov-ratg13 and bat-sars like-covzc45 respectively zhou et al 2020 the genetic diversity analysis of our study revealed that wuhan-hu-1 was closely related to new isolates of two indian sars-coronavirus 2 with 100 query coverage and 9998 sequence similarity respectively the pair-wise genetic distance occurred in the range between 00 and 0001 however the sars-cov-2 genome was genetically distinct from sars-cov and has a relatively long branch length to the bat-cov ratg13 0014 bat-sars like-cov zxc21 0067 and pangolin-cov gx-p5l 0073 fig 2b a total of 9998 similarity was found across the sars-cov-2 genomes obtained from different patients lu et al 2020 genetic recombination events are complex and more likely occurring in bat-cov ratg13 and bat-sars like-cov zxc21than in sars-cov-2 jaimes et al 2020 lu et al 2020 paraskevis et al 2020 the tajimas neutrality test tajima 1989 was estimated to identify the mutations by dna polymorphism it shows that the nucleotide diversity appears in the range 0045977 with a high number of segregating sites 1123 it further confirms that the rate of gene duplication events may occur due to radical changes in the segregating sites with a high recombination rate as described by clark et al 2012 the fluctuation of amino acid frequencies was estimated using jones et al 1992 evolutionary model jones et al 1992 as represented in fig 2c comparing to other amino acids leucine 911 is a highly enriched amino acid found in this group as per the earlier investigation by matsushima et al 2019 the diverse effects of the mutations or recombinant events are occurred due to leucine-rich repeat and it leads to the origin of several human diseases these conversions provide keen evidence of variance in chemical composition atputpgtpctp between the species the hierarchical clustering results show that the two indian isolates sars-cov-2humanind292020 and sars-cov-2humanind1662020 are closely related to each other and it can deviate when sars-cov-2wuhan-hu-1 is compared to other ancestral species fig 3a a low abundance of amino acid was found in pangolin cov gx-p5l and bat-sars-cov zxc21 it also indicates that several compositional variances are found in amino acid bases between the selected species it was further proved by principal component analysis it shows that the two indian isolates and bat-cov ratg13 were closely related to each other while compared to wuhan-hu-1 fig 3b therefore these variations may refer that the sars-cov-2 genome has been expanded in human hosts due to the establishment of a hyper-variable genomic hotspot population wen et al 2020 as per the previous investigation magiorkinis et al 2004 and paraskevis et al 2020 stated that these may occur due to altered diverse lineages in the evolutionary rates or either by ancient recombination events a dot plot comparison was performed for the function coding region between wuhan-hu-1 and selected phylogenetic neighbors and ancestors fig 4
 it shows that 70 of sequences from the sars-cov-2 wuhan-hu-1 match with selected species represented in the colored block as aligned regions 1 2 and 3 interestingly a few blocks were identified in wuhan-hu-1 isolates in the position 709611500 bp stand for a white block as mismatch or gapped region a total of 4404 amino acid bases were uniquely found in the wuhan-hu-1 while comparing to our analysis approximately 30 of wuhan-hu-1 doesnt match with any isolates and it may offer new ancestry relationships within the subgenus of sarbecovirus paraskevis et al 2020 we conducted a detailed genomic survey to understand molecular and functional diversity between sars-cov-2 and its phylogenomic neighbors from our analysis it is inferred that sars-cov-2 of indian origin has highly diverged from the sars-cov-2 of wuhan-hu-1 which might due to the high mutagenicity rate of covid further high mutagenicity rate was occurred due to the variations of transitiontransversion genetic ratio between the selected pairs it is speculated that this divergence in the evolution of indian origin sars-cov-2 is responsible for the lower death rate scenario in india hence the present genomic and proteomic impending of this virus will provide a lead to the researchers in turn to understand the mutation rate among indian strains and helps to unravel the mechanism behind its emergence and also in drug discovery authors are thankful to 1013039501100001843serb 1013039100007225ministry of science and technology

sars-cov-2 strains in middle eastern countries khalid mubarak bindayna shane crinion s crinion1nuigalway  ie  background sars-cov-2 is diverging from the initial wuhan serotype and different variants of the virus are reported mapping the variant strains and studying their pattern of evolution will provide better insights into the pandemic spread  since the discovery in wuhan in late 2019 the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov2 virus has spread internationally to 213 countries with confirmed 6194533 cases and 376 320 deaths at time of writing 1  of these cases 536 148 are from the eastern mediterranean 1  the virus which causes covid-19 is a betacoronavirus related to sars-cov and bat coronaviruses 2  sar-cov-2 is easily transmittable due to mutations in the receptor-binding s1 and fusion s2 domain of the strain 2  the rapid spread and high mortality due to the virus have elicited the global response including the lockdowns and new vaccine development while the efforts to understand the virus dynamics of transmission and epidemiology are still underway the virus is diverging from the wuhan strain the initial wuhan stain could eventually evolve into a more deadly strain 3  a recent study by t koyama et al 4 used 48 genomes to map variants and classify sub-strains from many locations including china japan and the usa we used koyamas study model and analysed the strains in the eastern mediterranean emro countries namely iran jordan kuwait saudi arabia and uae the variants were mapped to wuhan reference genome nc0455122 and were aligned using other wuhan strains we found variants in 43 of 50 genomes studied  to study the genomic and phylogenetic variation in the sars-cov2 in the eastern mediterranean region  to trace the pattern of spread of sars cov2 in the eastern mediterranean region sample size 50 source of data-we obtained the data from the chinese national genomics data center ngdc data in the ngdc include those obtained from ngbdb genbank gisaid gwh and nmdc databases 5  ncbi genbank and the global initiative on sharing all influenza data gisaid were also used to extract data 6 7  table 1 shows the source of all 50 samples 20 of the 50 samples were from wuhan and used for comparison and validation with the variant analysis performed by koyama et al 4 the other 30 samples consisted of 5 samples from iran kuwait jordan qatar saudi arabia and the united arab emirates these samples were all extracted from gisaid sample selection samples were selected from who emro countries with at least 5 high-quality genomes available of all the countries bahrain iraq and syria were excluded to due to inadequate samples lebanon was excluded due to poor quality samples sample filing we performed multiple sequence alignments msa using emboss clustal omega 8 and observed for conserved and consensus sequences to study the evolutionary relationship between the genomes all the outputs were set for the pearsonfasta formats the outputs were represented in sequence alignment file and phylogenetic tree we performed variant calling to identify variants that co-occur in different groups and to track the strains in each country the sequence alignment file from multiple sequence alignments was used to identify the location of variants the snp-sites program was used to extract snp sites from a multi-sample alignment file 9  we tabulated the output of the snp-sites analysis as a variant calling vcf file with the list of snps against the genotype for each sample the snps in the vcf file were compared with the snps reported by koyama et al for the validation variant annotation variant annotation was used to understand the genomic regions and functions affected by the snps we used the galaxy web platform and the public server at usegalaxyorg to facilitate variant annotation 10  snpeff a genetic variant annotation program in the galaxy server was used to identify the protein level changes caused by snps 11  the genome database for both sars-cov-2 nc0455122 and sars nc004718 were built and compared using snpeff and genbank 7  we visualised the overlapping variants between populations using the genome alignment the patterns of the emergence of covid-19 in each country were analysed the annotated data was imported manipulated and plotted using r v362 12  dplyr v084 package was used to summarise and align the data 13  the visualisation package ggplot2 13 was used to plot the graphs the x-axis in the plots indicates the variant position along the sars-cov-2 genome the left y-axis indicates the sample name and the right y-axis represents the country of origin for each sample this plot is used to compare the genome in different populations phylogenetic analysis evolutionary and phylogenetic analysis is used to explore the evolutionary hypothesis for the strain emergence in each country bayesian evolutionary analysis sample trees beast v1104 is used to perform bayesian analysis of molecular sequences using mcmc 14  the alignment file output from msa was used as the input data for bayesian analysis the hky transition-transversion parameter a burn-in of 1x10 6 iterations and a coalescent tree were used as models for molecular evolution here the unrooted tree obtained from the models and the phylogenetic tree generated by clustal omega is used to predict the associations between samples of the initial 50 samples 20 of them were from wuhan 4 of them did not contain any variants gwhabki00000001 gwhabkl00000001 nmdc6001300208 and mn908947 the sars-cov-2 had the best scoring variant annotation  table 2  the results from the variant annotation are presented in figure 1  however ten variants caused errors and are not included in the figure multi-allelic variants were included in figure 1 if the second alternative allele was likely due to poor reading the distribution of snps across samples studied using the snp genotypes from 442 sars-cov-2 strain showed a vast difference between the sub-strains within each country variant calling identified 379 variants of these 250 were modifier variants 21 were modifier variants 18 were low impact variants and 10 were high impact variants the variants had a missensesilent ration of 175 table 2 shows the distribution of variants by region and table 3 shows the distribution of variants by their type figure 3 shows the number of transitions and transversions observed in the sample figure 2 shows the drift towards transition is evident with a tstv ratio of 336 one variant occurs for every 378 bases and 16 multi-allelic sites all include indels from the phylogenetic analysis and tree generation in figure 3  we can infer that the iranian samples have the earliest common ancestor saudi arabia samples are all form a distinct group compared to other samples the samples from sa qatar and kuwait have the most developed sars-cov2 genomes four of the wuhan strains that did not have any variants matched with the variants identified by koyama phylogenetic-based approach phylogenetic trees help in understanding the evolutionary relationships between groups in the present context they are used to identify the earliest strains and to track the spread of covid-19 across the middle east we expected strains similar to wuhan to have emerged earlier than the other strains saudi arabia has reported the highest number of cases in the middle east who 2020 this can be explained from our phylogenetic analysis the four samples from saudi arabia epiisl443181 epiisl443180 epiisl443179 eplisl443178 were more distantly related than samples from any other country this distinction might be due to the swift response by the country leading to a unique and restricted strain the remaining saudi arabian samples epiisl443182 were in a separate clade with one sample from wuhan gwhabkm00000001 one from kuwait epiisl422426 and one from uae epiisl435143 jordan has adopted a stringent pandemic response strategy they imposed restriction and closed the non-essential services early on the same is reflected in the genome variation four out of the five jordan samples epiisl430015 epiisl430014 epiisl430013 epiisl430012 were in a separate clade with only one sample mn908947 similar to wuhan the jordan samples clusters at one of the final tree branching indicating that they are the most evolved variants their sample divergence might be the reason for their most distinctive genome the remaining jordan sample epiisl434516 and a qatar sample epiisl427419 diverge from a kuwait sample epiisl421652 and all of these have emerged from the common wuhan ancestor gwhabkj00000001 one of the earliest lineage divergences are found in five samples from iran epiisl445088 epiisl442044 epiisl442523 epiisl437512 epiisl424349 two from wuhan gwhabkn0000001 nmdc60013002-07 one from uae 43519 and one from kuwait epiisl416543 it strongly reiterates our hypothesis that the iranians introduced covid-19 to other middle eastern countries the only branchings that precede the cluster of iranian samples are four samples from wuhan nc0445122 nmdc60013002-04 nmdc60013002-08 gwhabks00000001 and one sample from the uae epiisl435141 the uae reported the first case of covid-19 in the middle east 15  here we trace the spread of covid-19 using variant and phylogenetic analysis this study reveals the structure of spread among populations we conclude that the earliest strains are found in iranian samples iran was exposed to the virus earlier than in other countries kuwait and qatar have a high frequency of novel variants due to small populations size which leads to an accumulation of mutations as bahrain also has the highest number of infections per million it is expected that bahranian genomes would also have a high variant rate as all the samples from saudi arabia are experiencing some differentiation and saudi arabia reports a high death rate more vigilance is necessary to prevent these outgroups from contributing to a more severe sub-strain with higher mortality rate   novel sars-like betacoronaviruses in bats china 2011 li yang zhiqiang wu xianwen ren fan yang guimei he junpeng zhang jie dong lilian sun yafang zhu jiang du shuyi zhang qi jin   we obtained pharyngeal and anal swab specimens of 414 insectivorous bats samples of each species were pooled and then processed with a viral particleprotected nucleic acid purification method 6 the extracted rna and dna were amplified by sequence-independent pcr the amplified viral nucleic acid libraries of the bat species were then sequenced with the illuminasolexa gaii sequencer illumina san diego ca usa those reads generated by the illuminasolexa gaii with length of 80 bases were directly aligned to the protein sequences in the national center for biotechnology information nonredundant protein database by the blastx program in the blast software package version 2222 wwwncbinlmnihgovblast with parameters -e 1e-5 -f t -b 10 -v 10 no assembly was performed before alignment sequence similaritybased taxonomic assignments were conducted as described 7 we found 1075 reads of betacoronavirus in rhinolophus pusillus bats in shaanxi and 92 reads of betacoronavirus in chaerephon plicata bats in yunnan we estimated the approximate locations of those reads on the cov genome and their relative distances on the basis of alignment results exported with megan 4metagenome analyzer httpabinfuni-tuebingendesoftwaremegan the located reads were then used for reads-based nested pcr to identify genomic sequences we established the complete genome sequences of 2 betacoronaviruses bat rp-coronavirusshaanxi2011 and bat cp-coronavirusyunnan2011 which are 29484 nt and 29452 nt respectively the gc content of bat rp-coronavirusshaanxi2011 and bat cp-coronavirusyunnan2011 is 416 and 409 respectively we conducted complete genome comparison and phylogenetic analysis on the basis of polymerase and spike protein pairwise genome sequence alignment was conducted by using emboss needle software wwwebiacuktoolspsaembossneedle with default parameters the overall nucleotide sequences between bat rp-coronavirusshaanxi2011 and bat cp-coronavirusyunnan2011 indicated 887 nt identity they shared 874895 nt identity with sars-cov 88899 nt identity with the bat sars-like cov bat sars-cov rm1 and 876896 nt identity with the civet sars-like cov civet sars-cov sz16 on the other hand comparison between the betacoronavirus genomes and human betacoronavirus hcov-oc43 showed only 499504 nt overall identity whereas the betacoronavirus genomes and hcov-emc showed 521 nt overall identity the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp the 12th nonstructural protein codified to open reading frame 1ab is a highly conserved gene of covs which is frequently used for phylogenetic comparison 89 mega50 wwwmegasoftwarenet was used to construct the phylogenetic trees on the basis of the nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acid sequences first we used the muscle package and default parameters wwwmegasoftwarenet to construct the alignment the best substitution model was then evaluated with the model selection package implemented in mega5 finally we used the maximum-likelihood method with an appropriate model to process the phylogenetic analysis with 1000 bootstrap replicates we constructed a phylogenetic tree based on the nucleotide sequences of the rdrp gene to show the evolutionary relationship between these 2 betacoronaviruses and other covs figure 1 reference cov genome sequences were downloaded from genbank and aligned with the fragments of the newly discovered covs the rdrp genes of bat rp-coronavirusshaanxi2011 and bat cp-coronavirusyunnan2011 were highly similar sharing 931 nt identity the phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that betacoronaviruses and the bat sars-like covs in our study are clustered 931934 nt identity and are close in distance to sars-covs 929948 nt identity and civet sars-like covs 931948 nt identity but that bat cov btcov-hku9 and hcov-oc43 are placed among the relatively distant groups 658659 and 629635 nt identities with the betacoronaviruses respectively therefore collectively we called these betacoronaviruses and bat sars-like covs the bat sars-like cluster of covs bat rp-coronavirusshaanxi2011 and bat cp-coronavirusyunnan2011 showed little genetic similarity 662673 nt identity to hcov-emc the spike proteins of covs are responsible for receptor binding and host species adaptation and their genes therefore constitute one of the most variable regions within cov genomes 1011 the phylogenetic tree based on the amino acid sequences of spike protein figure 2 suggests that the selected betacoronaviruses were mainly divided into 5 clusters sars cluster bat sars-like cluster civet sars-like cluster human betacoronavirus cluster and emc cluster bat rp-coronavirusshaanxi2011 and bat cp-coronavirusyunnan2011 shared 894 aa identity in spike proteins which consisted of 1240 aa and 1241 aa respectively the spike proteins of the covs in our analysis have 898927 aa identity with those of bat sars-like covs with substantial similarity in the receptor-binding domain the close relationship also was observed with the sars-covs 792794 aa identity and civet sars-like covs 789791 aa identity in contrast the human betacoronaviruses and emc cluster formed separate clusters distinct from sars-related covs that showed only 278294 aa and 288305 aa identities with the betacoronaviruses respectively in our analysis the genome sequences reported here have been deposited into genbank accession nos jx993987jx993988 the recent fatal human infection caused by hcov-emc has boosted interest in the discovery of novel covs in humans and animals hcov-emc is a novel betacoronavirus and its closest known relatives are btcovs hku4 and hku5 which have been detected in hong kong only in bats 12 the same animal from which sars is believed to have originated bats are increasingly recognized as natural reservoirs of covs and may serve as intermediate hosts for interspecies transmission of sars-covs 1013 different bat populations from various countries harbor diverse covs that have a high frequency of recombination and mutation rates that enable them to adapt to new hosts and ecologic niches 1415 therefore continuous studies of covs from different bat species and different countries would help better prevent the new global pandemics resulting from novel viral infection we detected and characterized 2 novel betacoronavirusesbat rp-coronavirusshaanxi2011 in r pusillus bats and bat cp-coronavirusyunnan2011 in c plicata batsin china the high similarity shown by phylogenetic analysis confirmed the close genetic relationship among the covs sars-like covs and sars-covs that we analyzed in contrast bat rp-coronavirusshaanxi2011 and bat cp-coronavirusyunnan2011 showed little genetic similarity with human betacoronaviruses and hcov-emc although several covs are found in horseshoe bats rhinolophus spp to our knowledge the sars-like covs in r pusillus and c plicata bats in china have not been identified the description presented here will further the understanding of covs distribution in different bat species found in human habitats and provide clues for rapid response to potential public

awad shehata a   coronaviruses are enveloped single-strand rna viruses that can infect a wide range of hosts including avian wild domestic mammalian species and humans coronaviruses are well known for their ability to mutate rapidly alter tissue tropism cross the species barrier and adapt to different epidemiological situations 1 six human coronaviruses have been reported since the 1960s four of them oc43 229e nl63 and hku1 cause mild illness similar to the common cold and gastrointestinal tract infection the other two severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov have raised significant public health concerns due to their zoonotic emergence and crossing of the species barrier causing high pathogenicity and mortality in humans 2 sars- and mers-covs were reported to be transmitted from the main host bats to palm civets or dromedary camels respectively then finally to humans 345 both sars- and mers-covs were and are highly pathogenic resulting in 8096 and 2519 human cases with 96 and 343 fatality rate in 20032004 and 2012present respectively 67 several clusters of pneumonia cases of unknown causes were reported in wuhan city hubei province china in december 2019 by epidemiological investigations most of these patients were related to the huanan seafood wholesale market the causative agent of this pneumonia was confirmed as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 previously named 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov and the diseases was termed coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 89 based on phylogenetic analysis sars-cov-2 forms a distinct lineage with bat-sars-like coronaviruses that belong to the order nidovirales family coronaviridae genus betacoronavirus and subgenus sarbecovirus 9 sars-cov-2 shares 963 89 and 82 nucleotide similarity with bat cov ratg13 sars-like cov zxc21 and sars-cov respectively which confirms its zoonotic origin 1011 at the beginning of the outbreak scientists thought that the disease was initially only transmitted from animals to humans then only between people who are symptomatic until the first human-to-human transmission case from an asymptomatic carrier was documented in germany 101213 this is also now evidenced by cases of community spread in which no direct links between current patients and suspected covid-19 carriers can be made as of 13 april 2020 the disease has caused a worldwide pandemic in more than 200 countries with more than 1700000 confirmed human cases and 111600 deaths as a result of the rapid spread of the virus authorities worldwide have begun limiting international and domestic travel and large gatherings at educational institutions restaurants bars etc sars-cov-2 is reported to be transmitted between humans through direct contact aerosol droplets fecaloral route and intermediate fomites from both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients during the incubation period 914 the disease is characterized by fever dry cough dyspnea and diarrhea in 2025 of patients who do not exhibit upper respiratory signs such as sneezing or sore throat 813 in severe cases the disease is characterized by pneumonia metabolic acidosis septic shock and bleeding 1415 several control measures are being instituted by nations around the world to extinguish the sars-cov-2 pandemic including the issuance of travel advisories or even flight bans to and from infected countries strict quarantine measures and traveler screenings implementation of mitigation measures by healthcare specialists application of social distancing measures for schools and popular gatherings strict personal hygiene such as frequent handwashing and wearing face masks 16 currently world public health authorities such as the centers for disease control and prevention cdc world health organization who and other global partners are trying to control and prevent the spread of sars-cov-2 additionally who issued a guide to managing the recent pandemic including instructions for the rapid detection of the disease emergency treatment application of prevention and control strategies supportive therapy and prevention of disease complications 15 due to misleading information that is circulating and knowledge gaps about the newly emerged sars-cov-2 this review provides the most recent information about sars-cov-2 with emphasis on 1 the current status of sars-cov-2 outbreaks 2 evidence regarding its origin by phylogenetic analysis 3 epidemiological characteristics required for efficient control strategies 4 diagnosis of the disease 5 current control strategies and effective therapies and 6 challenges to control future epidemics like those caused by coronaviruses this review also provides insights for the control of pathogenic infections in humans with novel coronaviruses and spillovers in the future coronaviruses have repeatedly evolved during the past 1000 years 17 the first recovery of coronaviruses involved the identification of illnesses in animals followed by the isolation of infectious bronchitis virus ibv from chickens in 1937 18 and murine hepatitis viruses mhv from mice in 1949 19 pigs were found to carry a transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev in the united states in 1946 19 human coronaviruses were first characterized in the 1960s from respiratory tract infections 20 the two first isolated viruses were b814 and 229e 2122 since then several other coronavirus strains have been isolated from humans using tissue culture oc16 and oc43 2324 the number of identified coronaviruses has continued to increase significantly to include viruses of several additional animal species such as calves dogs cats bats sparrows rabbits and turkeys 25  in 20022003 sars-cov caused a disease outbreak with deaths in 29 countries most cases being in china and hong kong the total number of reported cases was 8096 of which 774 died corresponding to a 96 fatality rate 6 before the disease died out in part due to strict quarantine protocols based on the genome sequence sars-cov appeared to be very closely related to another virus from himalayan palm civets from which it may have emerged 3 later civets were considered an intermediate host for sars-cov with bats as the natural host 5  hu et al 26 conducted a five-year surveillance study of sars-related coronaviruses isolated from horseshoe bats in yunnan province china where 11 sars-like covs were identified genome comparisons revealed high genetic diversity among these viruses in several genes including s orf3 and orf8 despite the differences in s protein sequences all 11 sars-like covs are still able to use the same human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 hace2 receptor demonstrating a close relationship with sars-cov therefore sars-cov likely emerged through recombination of bat sars-like covs before infecting civets from which the recombinant virus spread to humans causing the sars epidemic 526 ten years later mers-cov emerged in middle eastern countries where the virus was transmitted to humans from dromedary camels 27 as of january 2020 mers-cov has resulted in 2519 laboratory-confirmed cases and 866 deaths 343 fatality rate with more than 80 of the cases reported from saudi arabia 7 the human and camel mers-cov strains share more than 99 identity with variations substitutions located in the s orf3 and orf4b genes 28 phylogenetically mers-cov is very close to bat coronaviruses hku4 and hku5 29 a comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary relationships indicated that mers-cov may have originated from bats as a result of recombination events within orf1ab and s genes 3031 to gain access into the cell mers-cov uses the human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 receptor 32 this is also the case for mers-related covs isolated from bats in china whose spike proteins are able to bind to the same receptor as mers-cov confirming the possibility of a bat origin for mers-cov 33  in december 2019 sars-cov-2 emerged in wuhan city china causing severe respiratory illness and mortality see the epidemiology section early studies reported that it may have evolved from bats as revealed by phylogenetic analysis 9 and its high identity 963 with the bat coronavirus ratg13 coronaviruses are enveloped icosahedral symmetric particles approximately 80220 nm in diameter containing a non-segmented single-strand positive-sense rna genome of about 2632 kb in size 34 coronaviruses covs are one of the largest groups of viruses that belong to the order nidovirales suborder cornidovirineae and family coronaviridae coronaviridae is classified into two subfamilies namely letovirinae and orthocoronavirinae letovirinae includes the alphaletovirus genus while orthocoronaviridae is further classified on the basis of phylogenetic analysis and genome structure into four genera alphacoronavirus cov betacoronavirus cov gammacoronavirus cov and deltacoronavirus cov which contain 17 12 2 and 7 unique species respectively ictv 2018 the most recent classification of the coronaviridae is shown in table 1 corona in latin means crown and this name was attributed to the virus due to the presence of spike projections from the virus envelope that give it the shape of a crown under the electron microscope nido means nest and refers to the ability of the viruses of this order to make a nested set of subgenomic mrna 2535 coronaviruses infect a wide range of wild and domestic animals - and covs infect mammals while - and covs primarily infect birds table 1 a human coronavirus hcov was first isolated in 1960 from hospitalized patients who suffered from common cold symptoms and was named b814 36 so far the seven different hcovs that infect humans are 229e nl63 which belong to  covs and hku1 oc43 sars mers sars-cov-2 which belong to covs in 20022003 a pandemic caused by sars-cov lineage b cov originated in china 37 in the middle east mers-cov lineage c cov emerged in 2012 27 in 2019 a newly emerged sars-cov-2 closely related to bat sars-related covs was clustered with lineage b cov chan et al 13 demonstrated that sars-cov-2 represents a distinct lineage in the subgenus sarbecovirus previously lineage 2b of cov 38 additionally other coronaviruses have caused pandemic diseases in domestic and wild mammals and birds leading to high mortality rates and severe economic losses these viruses include ibv in chickens 40 beluga whale coronavirus sw1 bwcov-sw1 41 bat coronaviruses cdphe15 and hku10 ictv 2018 porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv tgev and sudden acute diarrhea syndrome sads-cov 42  since the emergence of sars-cov-2 in wuhan city china in december 2019 many laboratories have been working on sequencing the genome of the causative agent as of 14 april 2020 there are a total of 7655 complete genomes from 67 countries in the global initiative on sharing all influenza data gisaid database 43 table 2 a reference genome is now available in the ncbi genome database 29903 nucleotide reference sequence nc0455123 44 to date there are a total of 875 sequences including one refseq sequence and 768 complete genomes at ncbi sars-cov-2 is a monopartite single-stranded and positive-sense rna virus with a genome size of 29903 nucleotides making it the second-largest known rna genome the virus genome consists of two untranslated regions utrs at the 5 and 3 ends and 11 open reading frames orfs that encode 27 proteins table 3  the first orf orf1ab constitutes about two-thirds of the virus genome encoding 16 non-structural proteins nsps while the remaining third of the genome encodes 4 structural proteins and at least 6 accessory proteins the structural proteins are spike glycoprotein s matrix protein m envelope protein e and nucleocapsid protein n while the accessory proteins are orf3a orf6 orf7a orf7b orf8 and orf10 as shown in figure 1 2133845 the 5utr and 3utr of sars cov-2 are comprised of 265 and 229 nucleotides respectively orf1ab is 21290 nucleotides and encodes either replicase proteins pp1a of 4405 amino acids aa nsp1nsp11 or pp1ab of 7096 aa nsp1nsp16 according to ribosomal frameshift of these proteins 1 nsp1 suppresses the antiviral host response 2 nsp3 is a papain-like protease 3 nsp5 is a 3clpro 3c-like protease domain 4 nsp7 makes a complex with nsp8 to form a primase 5 nsp9 is responsible for rnadna binding activity 6 nsp12 is an rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp 7 nsp13 is confirmed as a helicase 8 nsp14 is a 35 exonuclease exon 9 nsp15 is a polyu-specific endoribonuclease xendou the remaining nsps are involved in transcription and replication of the viral genome 134647  single-stranded rna viruses exhibit a faster biological mutation rate due to the lack of proofreading activity of viral rna polymerases 48 however unlike other mutation-prone rna viruses with the exception of the arenaviridae family covs do have limited proofreading capabilities with the nsp14 protein allowing for the enhanced genome size of cov family members 49 recombination is another mechanism of evolution in coronaviruses 50 a high recombination frequency was demonstrated in murine hepatitis virus during mixed infection where the majority of viruses recovered after three passages were recombinants 51 recombination was also reported for mers-cov and sars-cov seven putative recombination regions were detected in orf1ab and s protein between sars-cov and six other coronaviruses by in silico analysis of their genomes 52 similarly bioinformatic analysis of mers-cov genomic data revealed 28 recombinant sequences from humans and camels 53 recombination in sars-cov-2 is not yet clearly understood initial studies suggested that it may have occurred in the course of sars-cov-2 evolution 9 while other researchers excluded the possibility of recombination based on a full genome evolutionary analysis investigating putative recombination events 11  to better understand the evolution of sars-cov-2 we performed a phylogenetic analysis of 45 representative coronaviruses from 18 countries including sars-cov sars-cov-2 hcov bat sars cov bat sars-like cov and mers-cov the viral genomes were obtained from the gisaid and ncbi databases multiple sequence alignment was performed using kalign 3 54 a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on whole-genome sequences coding sequences of all genes in iq-tree using the maximum likelihood method ultrafast bootstrap approximation and modelfinder 5556 the tree was drawn to scale with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site the bootstrap values were determined by 1000 replicates the tree was visualized in mega x 57 figure 2  in the analysis we performed all sars-cov-2 samples from the 18 countries clustered together and were close to bat sars or sars-like coronaviruses with wuhan bat cov ratg13 being the closest virus in addition mers-cov and human cov hku1 were very distant from sars-cov-2 figure 2 within mers-cov samples the south china mers-nl13892 clustered separately from other mers-covs the two bat sars-like covs bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 were the second closest viruses from bats to sars-cov-2 figure 2 all sars-covs from china canada england and the us were in a single cluster zhou et al 9 conducted a phylogenetic analysis of sars-cov-2 against previously identified coronaviruses based on their whole-genome sequences main structural protein genes and non-structural protein genes sars-cov-2 clustering was different depending on whether the whole genome or specific genes were used in the analysis for example sars-cov-2 clustered with the members of the subgenus sarbecovirus including the sars-cov 795 identical that caused the global pandemic in 2003 and other bat sars-like viruses 96 identical at the whole-genome level but the topological position within the sarbecoviruses changed when individual genes orf1ab s e m and n were used for clustering 29  based on the whole-genome sequence alignment sars-cov-2 shares 89 identity with bat sars-like covzxc21 82 with sars-cov and 963 with bat cov ratg13 1113 alignment of the predicted protein sequences of sars-cov-2 to those of sars-cov or sars-like coronaviruses revealed a total of 380 amino acid substitutions between these viruses 2 these amino acid substitutions were distributed as follows 348 mutations in nonstructural proteins orf1ab 3a 3b 7a 7b 9b and orf14 27 in s protein and 5 in n protein no amino acid substitutions were detected in e or m proteins indicating that e and m proteins are highly conserved among these viruses  it has been reported that sars-cov-2 uses the same cellular receptor hace2 as sars-cov to gain entry into the cell 95859 the analysis of the receptor-binding domains rbd of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 s protein revealed similar binding affinities 60 wu et al 2 found a total of 27 amino acid substitutions in the s protein but not in the receptor-binding motif rbm that directly interacts with hace2 which may affect host tropism these 27 substituted residues were distributed as follows 17 in the s1 subunit 6 in the rbd and 6 in the subdomain sd and 10 in the s2 subunit wan et al 58 reported similarity in the spike protein rbd including rbm of both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 in addition to the presence of several residues in sars-cov-2 rbm that favor the interaction with human ace2 these results agree with the genomic analysis of sars-cov-2 according to which the s2 subunit of the spike protein shares 99 identity with those of two bat sars-like covs sl-covzxc21 and zc45 and of human sars-cov 13 while the sars-cov-2 s2 subunit was conserved the s1 subunit shares an overall 70 identity with those of bat and human sars-cov the rbd core domain of s1 is highly conserved with most of the amino acid differences located in the external subdomain that is responsible for the direct interaction with host receptors 13 investigators have also reported the presence of a polybasic cleavage site and predicted o-linked glycans that are unique to sars-cov-2 s protein differences in sars-cov-2 s protein and the high contagious nature of this virus suggest that sars-cov-2 has evolved via natural selection for binding to human ace2 receptor 61 orf3b also differs in sars-cov-2 orf3b deletion mutations in sars-cov do not affect viral replication in vitro 62 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity in addition to its inhibitory effects on interferon ifn expression and signaling 6364 recently a novel short putative protein was identified in orf3b of sars-cov-2 13 however the function of this novel protein is still not known sars-cov-2 orf8 is closer to those of bat sars cov zxc21 and zc45 and distant from that of human sars-cov 13 the assessment of genetic diversity among 86 complete or semi-complete genomes of sars-cov-2 viruses revealed three deletions in the genome of isolates from japan usa and australia in addition to many other substitution mutations the deletion mutations were in the orf1ab gene 3-nucleotide and 24-nucleotide deletion and at the 3 end of the genome 10-nucleotide deletion of the 93 substitution mutations 42 changed the amino acid sequence of structural and non-structural proteins 65 the 3- and 24-nucleotide deletions in orf1ab are expected to reduce the protein sequence by 1 and 8 amino acid residues respectively without changing the reading frame but the functional effects have yet to be investigated  the alignment of sars-cov-2 reference s protein gene against all sars-cov-2 sequenced genomes from china usa japan australia and taiwan revealed 9997100 identity with 100 query coverage also confirmed by our phylogenetic analysis figure 2 while the identity and coverage for sars-cov s protein gene were 745 and 91 respectively also the s protein gene from bat sars and sars-like coronavirus isolates shared 76583 identity with that of sars-cov-2 this agrees with previous conclusions regarding the evolutionary analysis of sars-cov-2 1144 in the phylogenetic analysis we performed sars-cov-2 viruses were in the same cluster regardless of the geographic region figure 2 these results strongly suggest the possibility of a recent common ancestor for all sars-cov-2 or the transmission of the same virus strain across countries  the origins of more than 75 of coronavirus infections are considered zoonotic ie animals are the main source of the outbreaks for example sars-cov was transmitted from palm civets to humans and mers-cov from dromedary camels to humans bats are currently considered a reservoir for all human coronaviruses as mentioned above 571 many coronaviruses are circulating in animals but have not yet infected humans the type of animal that sars-cov-2 originated from is still unclear at the beginning of the outbreak in wuhan china many patients were linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market suggesting animal-to-person spread after retrospectively studying case reports the number of patients that did not have exposure to animal markets has risen indicating person-to-person spread was also occurring at that time 66 sars-cov-2 is closely related to bat coronaviruses and sars-cov 8 a group of researchers reported early in the outbreak that the novel sars-cov-2 has the highest similarity of codon usage bias with snakes 7273 however this method to determine initial host origins is dubious interestingly researchers also reported one amino acid difference in the receptor-binding domain of the s protein of pangolin-cov compared to that of sars-cov-2 suggesting that pangolins might play a role as an intermediate host xiao et al data currently under review another group of researchers reported that the virus originated from bats based on the genome sequence of sars-cov-2 which is 96 identical to bat coronavirus ratg13 there were speculations that sars-cov-2 is a laboratory-engineered cov and leaked directly from a laboratory in wuhan where a bat cov ratg13 was recently reported however there is no evidence to support this allegation 74 recently a group of researchers found that sars-cov-2 replicates poorly in dogs pigs chickens and ducks but efficiently in ferrets and cats 75 scientists are still trying to find the main source of the disease outbreak and identify the definitive intermediate hosts both established sars-cov mers-cov and novel sars-cov-2 coronaviruses were reported to spread from an infected person to a non-infected person through direct or indirect contact sars-cov-2 infection was reported to be transmitted directly from person to person like most respiratory viruses via close contact with an infected person or through respiratory droplets aerosol produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes these droplets can be inhaled to reach the lung the virus can be indirectly transmitted via touching a surface or an object that was previously contaminated with the virus and then touching the face eyes or mouth 76 and possibly via the fecaloral route 7778 asymptomatic carriers during the incubation period of the virus and patients after recovery from the acute form of the disease are also considered a potential source of virus transmission to healthy persons 1012 interestingly human coronaviruses are able to survive on steel metal wood aluminum paper glass plastic ceramic disposable gowns and surgical gloves for 29 days high temperature 30 c can reduce the persistence period while low temperature 4 c increases the persistence time up to 28 days 79 transmission of the virus vertically from mother to fetus or via breast milk has not been confirmed yet 80 the transmission cycle of coronavirus among animals and humans is shown in figure 3 there are many factors that affect sars-cov-2 transmission and spread these factors include but are not limited to 1 travel to or contact with individuals who have recently visited wuhan china or other places experiencing an outbreak 2 close contact with persons who are diagnosed positive for the disease such as healthcare workers caring for patients with sars-cov-2 3 contact with droplets and secretions produced by sneezing or coughing from an infected person and eating or handling wild animals native to china such as bats additionally the risk of infection is higher for the elderly and for patients suffering from pre-existing illnesses such as cardiovascular disease hypertension diabetes and chronic respiratory disease 66 the reported fatality rate based on age is 148 for people 80 years of age 8 for people between 70 and 79 years 36 for people between 60 and 69 years 13 for people between 50 and 59 years 04 for people between 40 and 49 years 02 for people between 10 and 39 years no fatalities have been reported for children under 10 years of age notably the fatality rate is higher in males 28 than in females 17 8182  the estimated incubation period of the novel coronavirus ranges from 2 to 14 days however some cases had an incubation period of 21 24 or 27 days 83 the complete clinical picture of sars-cov-2 is still unclear the disease begins with flu-like symptoms that include fever fatigue dry cough sore throat shortness of breath headache chest tightness chest pain and muscle pain some of sars-cov-2 patients have runny nose nausea vomiting and diarrhea 84 people can be infected without showing symptoms which allows the virus to spread more effectively from person to person complications can occur due to covid-19 leading to severe infections such as pneumonia infection of the lungs kidney failure and death 8 the mild phase of the disease can last up to 2 weeks while severe or critical disease lasts approximately 3 to 6 weeks this analysis was conducted on 55924 confirmed cases additionally the time from the disease onset to the development of severe disease is one week while the time from the onset of symptoms to death ranges from 2 to 8 weeks 82 based on the data analysis of 72314 confirmed cases of sars-cov-2 in wuhan city china by 11 february 809 of the cases were mild with flu-like symptoms and patients recovered at home 138 were severe with pneumonia and shortness of breath 47 were critical with respiratory failure and septic shock resulting in organs failure and approximately 2 of the cases were fatal 85 another study was conducted on 99 hospitalized patients and symptoms were classified as follow fever 83 cough 82 shortness of breath 31 muscle ache 11 confusion 9 headache 8 sore throat 5 runny nose 4 chest pain 2 diarrhea 2 and nausea and vomiting 1 8  the strict monitoring of case history in clinically suspicious patients is considered the first step in the early diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection clinically suspicious patients are those who suffer from fever and lower respiratory tract infection symptoms for details see the clinical characteristics section and reside within or have traveled to endemic regions or had close contact with a confirmed or suspected case additionally sars-cov-2 can be transmitted by symptomatic and asymptomatic patients especially to the high-risk group mentioned above for details see the risk assessment section 13 the blood profiles of patients suffering from sars-cov-2 infection revealed the following 1 increased c-reactive protein and erythrocytes 2 increased myohemoglobin liver enzymes and muscle enzymes with a high level of d-dimer in severe cases and 3 normal or decreased white blood cell counts and lymphocytes in the early stage of the disease with advanced lymphocytopenia in severe cases 13 in icu patients high levels of plasma granulocyte colony-stimulating factor gcsf ip10 il2 il7 il10 tnf- and mip1a were reported 38  electron microscope examination of sars-cov-2 revealed the typical coronavirus morphology further sars-cov-2 was successfully isolated from human respiratory epithelial cells or balf samples of infected patients using huh7 cells and vero e6 cells the isolated strain was confirmed by immunofluorescent antibody techniques using the cross-reactive nucleoprotein np antibody serum neutralization tests snt using vero e6 cells were conducted to confirm the neutralization activity in igg-positive viral samples 87 igm and igg elisa detection kits using bat sarsr-cov rp3 np were developed with no cross-reaction against human coronaviruses except sarsr-cov 80 using these serological tools viral antibody titers were increased in sars-cov-2-infected patients 38 the procedures of elisa for the determination of sars-cov-2 igg were described before 86 nucleic acid detection is the main fastest and most sensitive test for the diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection recently two nested rt-pcr and two real-time rt-pcr assays have been developed with successful detection of the first 25 positive cases of infection in japan 88 three real-time rt-pcr techniques have been designed based on the e rdrp and n genes 89 also scientists established molecular detection tools for sars-cov-2 based on the s gene 86  chest x-ray examination in the early stage of the disease shows interstitial changes and multiple small plaque shadows chest ct scans play an important role in the diagnosis of acute respiratory disease syndrome ards and pneumonia as well as in the early detection of lung parenchymal abnormalities in patients at risk and provide an impression of secondary infection figure 4  assessing these lungs parenchymal abnormalities conveys disease severity to clinicians using artificial intelligence models in the future may be useful in mass screening to allow risk prioritization and help to minimize turnaround time 90 pan et al 91 conducted a retrospective study to elaborate the time course of lung changes during recovery from infection they described findings using international standard nomenclatures such as ground-glass opacity ggo consolidation and crazy paving patterns they established a semi-quantitative scoring system of 5 grades to quantify the degree of involvement based on an area ranging from 0 to 75 the total score ranged from 0 to 25 max and involvement was subpleural random or diffuse they found that in early stages 04 days after the onset of symptoms ggo was the main finding in lower lung lobes in progressive stages 58 days the progression of lung disease involved three patterns of ground-glass consolidation and crazy paving while in peak stages 913 days dense consolidation became the prevalent feature in absorption stages 14 days ggo was detected with no crazy paving and resolution of consolidations 91 more than 75 of sars-cov-2-affected patients suffered from bilateral lung involvement and 71 have multilobe involvement ct examinations of 21 patients showed 29 consolidation and 86 ggo in the chest 899293 another study examined 51 cases by ct and reported that 77 showed pure ggo 75 exhibited ggo with reticular andor interlobular septal thickness 59 had ggo with consolidation while 55 revealed pure consolidation bilateral lung involvement was reported in 86 of cases in 80 of the cases the posterior part of the lung was involved while in 86 the periphery was involved 94 in january 2020 the who issued guidance for the clinical management of sars when sars-cov-2 infection was suspected in this guidance the start of emergency treatments immediate implementation of prevention and control strategies early supportive therapy and prevention of sars-cov-2 complications were described in detail 15 so far there are no approved specific antiviral drugs for sars-cov-2 infection therefore preventive measures and inactivation of the virus are essential to stop and control the spread of the disease human coronaviruses can be inactivated using 05 hydrogen peroxide 6271 ethanol 01 sodium hypochlorite 071 formaldehyde 2 glutaraldehyde or 023 povidone iodine within 1 minute other disinfectants such as 002 chlorhexidine digluconate 055 orthophtalaldehyde or 00502 benzalkonium chloride are less effective 79  in light of the urgent clinical demand many drugs are approved to be used for clinical trials against sars-cov-2 infection such as lopinavirritonavir arbidol interferon-alpha favipiravir chloroquine phosphate darunavircobicistat oseltamivir and methylprednisolone the most used antiviral drugs 95 are summarized in table 5 generally coronaviruses are not sensitive to current antiviral drugs and high concentrations of drugs effective on these viruses cannot be used in vivo therefore combinations of different therapies have been used for the treatment of coronavirus infections 96 some drug combinations that could be successful for the treatment of sars-cov-2 patients are lopinavir and ritonavir 9798 lopinavirritonavir plus arbidol 99 and ribavirin and interferon 100101 the use of anti-inflammatory drugs such as glucocorticoids il-6 antagonist janus kinase inhibitors jak and choloroquinehydrocholoroquine in sars-cov-2 patients is a dilemma especially in patients suffering from an impaired immune system balancing the riskbenefit ratio is a critical issue corticosteroids may delay the elimination of the virus and increase the risk of secondary infection in addition drugs targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines can only inhibit specific inflammatory factors and thus may not be very effective in curbing the cytokine storm excessive and uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines moreover some anti-inflammatory drugs such as jak block inf- production which is important in fighting the virus 102  additionally fecal transplantation was approved for clinical trials as a therapeutic option for sars-cov-2-related pneumonia based on the promising results obtained from fecal microbiota transplantation in patients suffering from antibiotic-associated diarrhea active ulcerative colitis and other viral infections 103104105106 recently it was found that intestinal microbiota-derived ifn in lung stroma confers protection against viral diseases such as avian influenza and respiratory syncytial virus 103 moreover based on historical records of the effect of antiviral herbs on sars and influenza h1n1 chinese herbal formulas could be an alternative approach for the prevention of sars-cov-2 in a high-risk population 107 if no scientifically based therapeutics are available it was found that sambucus formasana nakai exhibited a strong antiviral effect against human coronavirus nl63 108 to date there is no vaccine to prevent sars-cov-2 infection and trials for vaccine development are in the preliminary stages of research several vaccine candidates such as live attenuated adenovirus-vectored recombinant protein and nucleic acid dna and mrna vaccines are in the pipeline 123 the epidemiology of sars-cov-2 is still unclear and data availability is limited therefore it is imperative to follow preventive measures and safety precautions issued by health authorities to limit exposure to the virus and to reduce further spread general hygienic measures should be implemented such as 1 washing hands often with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer 2 cough or sneeze etiquette recommending covering of the mouth 3 avoiding touching eyes nose and mouth if the hands are not clean 4 avoiding close contact with sick persons 5 avoiding sharing dishes glasses bedding and other household items with sick people 6 cleaning and disinfection of surfaces that are often touched and 7 staying home from work school and public areas when feeling sick  the transmission route of sars-cov-2 is probably not only through cough respiratory droplets andor contaminated surfaces 13124 but also through fecaloral transmission 78 therefore strict hygienic measures should be followed especially in dense cities or agricultural spaces 125  since the sars-cov-2 spread is primarily driven by travel screening of travelers who arrive at airports from pandemic areas for possible sars-cov-2 infection and entry-screening procedures are necessary also general hygienic precautions during travel are highly recommended travelers who suffered from acute respiratory infection should be tested and reported to the respective public health authorities 73 in addition people should be motivated to notify and report about travel history and close contacts in case of sars-cov-2 infection asymptomatic carriers during the incubation period and patients after recovery from the acute form are also considered potential sources of the virus 1213 strict hygienic measures should be implemented to avoid virus transmission to healthcare workers and other contacts ie placement of sars-cov-2 suspected or confirmed patients in single-person rooms and wearing personal protection equipment ppe such as masks goggles and protective gowns because early diagnosis and detection of asymptomatic carriers of sars-cov-2 are successful factors for the treatment and prevention of transmission health authorities should designate laboratories to implement tests for a rapid and accurate diagnosis 126 the control of coronaviruses is based on biosecurity regarding animals as well as on shifts in food habits including discouraging the consumption of bushmeat and of animal products without appropriate cooking 127 ban of wet marketplaces where live or dead animals are handled should be implemented surveillance among people who have contact with wildlife and improvement of biosecurity regarding wildlife trade are urgently needed to prevent the next pandemic outbreak 128  the epidemiology of sars-cov-2 is still unclear many unresolved questions related to sars-cov-2 epidemiology and pathogenicity pose great challenges for researchers these unresolved questions include what is the origin of sars-cov-2 what is the intermediate host that transmitted the virus from bats why does the virus cause severe disease and mortality in the elderly or those with co-morbidities while it is milder in children are aerosol saliva feces urine and foodborne the only routes of transmission what are the other unknown routes of transmission  control of the sars-cov-2 outbreak and future epidemics requires global efforts among medical and veterinary clinicians diagnosticians epidemiologists public health experts vaccinologists pharmaceutical industries economists and governments to implement a one-health approach 128129 these measures must include 1 writing policies and supporting funds required for the implementation of one health prevention and control measures 2 hiring well-trained and professional personnel 3 performing rapid and accurate diagnosis and treatment of infected persons 4 developing and providing vaccines for virus control in humans 5 conducting surveillance among wildlife for the identification and characterization of possible reservoirs and surveillance among people who are in contact with wildlife to identify risk factors in human behaviors and living environment 6 improving hygienic measures 7 assessing the social and economic impacts of covid-19 on the population 8 utilizing veterinary experience in the disinfection of premises and gatherings under the supervision of health authorities to decrease outbreaks in humans 9 providing antiviral drugs for the treatment of the disease in humans and 10 increasing public health awareness about the virus and its transmission the sars-cov-2 outbreak started in wuhan city china in december 2019 it is now a global pandemic with 1773084 confirmed cases 111652 deaths and 467074 recoveries as of 13 april 2020 the virus has the potential for rapid and extensive spread between people and countries there are a lot of misleading information and knowledge gaps on the newly emerged sars-cov-2 therefore we reviewed the latest updates about different aspects including epidemiology source of infection transmission dynamics zoonotic potential virus characteristics and discovery of novel strategies for disease control to avoid spillover of infection in the future bats play an important role in the transmission of the infection to humans coronaviruses are genetically diverse and have a high tendency towards frequent genetic mutations and gene recombination which increases the risk of interspecies transmission information about the incubation period can help in establishing an effective quarantine for asymptomatic carriers thus preventing the virus spread from our perspectives and based on the currently available information about the virus and its epidemiology the control of the sars-cov-2 requires an effective and global disease coordination effort including multidisciplinary research efforts one-health approach through collaboration between governments epidemiologists virologists health authorities veterinarians and physicians at this stage of the disease outbreak developing vaccines is crucial to limit the spread of the infection   phylodynamics of sars-cov-2 transmission in spain francisco dez-fuertes mara iglesias-caballero sara monzn pilar jimnez sarai varona isabel cuesta ngel zaballos michael thomson m mercedes jimnez javier garca prez francisco pozo mayte prez-olmeda jos alcam inmaculada casas  objectives sars-cov-2 whole-genome analysis has identified three large clades spreading worldwide designated g v and s this study aims to analyze the diffusion of sars-cov-2 in spaineurope methods maximum likelihood phylogenetic and bayesian phylodynamic analyses have been performed to estimate the most probable temporal and geographic origin of different phylogenetic clusters and the diffusion pathways of sars-cov-2 results phylogenetic analyses of the first 28 sars-cov-2 whole genome sequences obtained from patients in spain revealed that most of them are distributed in g and s clades 13 sequences in each with the remaining two sequences branching in the v clade eleven of the spanish viruses of the s clade and six of the g clade grouped in two different monophyletic clusters s-spain and g-spain respectively with the s-spain cluster also comprising 8 sequences from 6 other countries from europe and the americas the most recent common ancestor mrca of the sars-cov-2 pandemic was estimated in the city of wuhan china around november 24 2019 with a 95 highest posterior density hpd interval from october 30-december 17 2019 the origin of s-spain and g-spain clusters were estimated in spain around february 14 and 18 2020 respectively with a possible ancestry of s-spain in shanghai conclusions multiple sars-cov-2 introductions have been detected in spain and at least two resulted in the emergence of locally transmitted clusters with further dissemination of one of them to at least 6 other countries these results highlight the extraordinary potential of sars-cov-2 for rapid and widespread geographic dissemination universitario 12  the coronavirus disease 2019 covid- 19 is an ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 1  the symptom onset of the first case of covid-19 was reported in december 1 2019 in the city of wuhan china and the initial outbreak was related to the huanan seafood market 2 3 4  sars-cov-2 infections have been reported in all the countries of europe causing from hundreds to thousands deaths in almost all them 5  according to gisaid database three larger clades of sars-cov-2 have been identified so far based on marker variants 6  thus s clade is characterized by the presence of l84s in orf8 and mostly comprises sequences from north america v clade is characterized by g251v in orf3 and mostly comprises asian and european sequences finally g clade is characterized by d614g in s protein and largely comprises sequences from europe other sequences have not been included in any of these clades because they lack the mentioned markers 6  the situation in europe seems to be dominated by the three clades although g clade is the largest one in gisaid so far more than 5000 whole genome sequences of viruses collected in europe have been already sequenced with high coverage allowing the performance of phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses to better understand the transmission dynamics within the most affected countries in europe according to the european centre for disease prevention and control ecdc the first cases of sars-cov-2 infections in europe were reported in the week of 26 january-1 february 2020 with 5 cases in france one locally transmitted 4 cases in germany all locally acquired two imported cases in italy two imported cases in uk and one imported case in finland 7  in spain the first two cases were reported during the following week 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  the first one in la gomera canary islands related to a known cluster in germany and another one in mallorca balearic islands from a british citizen who was initially in contact with a confirmed case in france returning from singapore 8 9  the next 5 reported cases in spain had all a travel history to italy and were detected in tenerife canary islands catalonia castellon valencian community and madrid before 26 february 10  the following two days spain reported 18 new cases in canary islands catalonia andalusia and the valencian community and in the week of 1-7 march 2020 a total of 261 confirmed cases were reported in all the country 11  the increasing number of whole genome sequences of sars-cov-2 circulating in europe allows the development of phylodynamic studies to better understand these transmission dynamics of the virus in spain and europe and ideally to evaluate the proper functioning of surveillance systems in order to investigate the transmission dynamics of sars-cov-2 in the most affected european countries different datasets were retrieved from gisaid 6  first all the whole genome sequences 29000 bp of the virus with high coverage were obtained n1590 to evaluate how the samples from spain are distributed then another dataset was analyzed including only whole genome sequences from europe and from wuhan the city of the outbreak onset to study the viral transmission dynamics within europe the last dataset was retrieved with whole genome sequences from spain and from the countries where the first positives cases were reported ie france germany italy and finland sequences were aligned using mafft software and sequences were manually edited using aliview v126 12 13  phylogenies of large alignments were inferred by fasttree software v2111 14  rootto-tip genetic distances against sample collection dates were measured with tempest v151 and bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analyses were performed with beast v1104 to estimate the date and location of the most recent common ancestors mrca as well as to estimate the rate of evolution of the virus 15 16  beast priors were introduced with beauti v1104 including an uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock model with a lognormal rate distribution and the exponential growth coalescent model of population size and growth 16  duplicated sequences were discarded from all the datasets markov chain monte carlo mcmc runs of 100 million states sampling every 10000 steps were computed the convergence of mcmc chains was checked using tracer v171 ensuring that the effective sample size ess values were greater than 200 for each parameter estimated 17  the maximum clade credibility mcc trees were obtained from the tree posterior distribution using treeannotator after 10 burn-in 16  discrete trait evolutionary histories associated with phylogenies were analyzed with spread3 generating klm files for visualizations in virtual globe software like google earth 18  well-supported rates between locations in the phylogeographic reconstructions were identified through a bayes factor by using the bayesian stochastic search variable selection bssvs procedure implemented in beast 19  a total of 28 whole genome sequences have been obtained from samples from spain including 14 from madrid 12 of them sequenced by the university hospitals 12 de octubre la paz and ramn y cajal five from the valencian community sequenced by the fisabio foundation four from castille and leon 2 from castille-la mancha and one each from andalusia galicia and the basque country these sequences branched in 3 different phylogenetic clusters  figure 1a  13 included in the g clade two in the v clade and other 13 in the ancestral s clade  figure 1b  the phylogenies obtained for the dataset only comprising sequences from european countries revealed that the sequence epi-isl-406862 collected from a patient from munich germany in january 28 2020 was basal to the g clade and at least six sequences from spain branched in the monophyletic g-spain cluster  figure 2a  in the case of the v clade the sequences from spain are integrated in a cluster where two sequences from sweden february 7 2020 and france january 23 2020 were basal to the cluster formed by european sequences  figure 2b  the rest of the sequences from spain branched in the s clade and 11 of them were found in s-spain cluster along with a basal sequence to this cluster from a virus collected in shanghai on february 1 2020  figure 2c  the mrca estimated for the dataset including sequences from wuhan and from the first european countries reporting cases was located in wuhan pp099 around november 24 2019 95 highest posterior density hpd interval october 30-december 17 2019 bf analysis revealed highly probable diffusions from wuhan to all the european countries included in the dataset ie england bf100 pp100 germany bf100 pp100 france bf100 pp100 spain bf100 pp100 finland bf100 pp099 and italy bf291 pp093 this dataset was also used to estimate the rate of evolution of sars-cov-2 which was 147x10 -3 substitutions per site and per year 95 hpd interval 108x10 -3 -187x10 -3  results of the root-to-tip genetic distances against sample collection dates were measured for different phylogenetic clusters supplementary figure 1  the most probable origin of the s phylogenetic cluster in spain spain-s was located in shanghai pp065 around january 28 2020 95 hpd interval january 21-february 2 2020 the mrca of the s-spain cluster which also included 8 sequences from 6 other countries usa netherlands chile brazil georgia and france was located in spain pp079 around february 14 2020 95 hpd interval february 4-23 2020  figure 3  supplement s1 the bf test indicated that the only probable diffusion between asia and europe was from china to the netherlands pp  25 pp087 in a different analysis where only sequences from europe where included the mrca of this cluster was located in england pp095 and was dated around january 18 2020 95 hpd interval january 9-27 the origin of the v clade is uncertain since no location reached values of pp040 the tmrca of the v clade in our analyses was around december 23 2019 95 hpd november 26 2019 -january 11 2020 the mcc of the v-clade revealed an earlier subcluster mainly transmitted in asia and australia and a more recent subcluster dominated by sequences from europe  figure 4  sequences from spain were found in different subclusters of the v clade specifically the sequences epi-isl-418243 and -417975 from madrid and andalusia respectively were found in a subcluster where the mcra was located in england pp085 and dated around february 5 2020 95 hpd interval february 1-9 2020 the other subcluster included the sequence epi-isl-417952 from madrid although the location of the mrca of this group is uncertain between norway pp0  the mrca of g clade in europe was located in england pp093 and dated on january 20 2020 95 hpd interval january 10-29 2020 the sequence from the bavarian patient epi-isl-406862 was found at the root of the mcc confirming the results obtained by the phylogenetic analysis this clade includes approximately 50 of the whole genomes sequenced so far and the sequences from spain are distributed throughout the clade rather than being clustered all together indicating that several transmissions have been produced figure 6 supplement s3  the mrca of g-spain cluster comprising the sequences epi-isl-418251 -417963 -417954 -417978 -417956 -417967 from spain was located in spain pp095 and was dated on february 18 2020 95 hpd interval february 9-25 2020  figure 5  the global analysis on the origin of the ongoing pandemic of sars-cov-2 indicated that the tmrca was around november 24 2019 with a 95 hpd interval from october 30 to december 17 2019 this result is compatible with the epidemiologic information about the first case of covid-19 reported in wuhan which dated the symptom onset in this patient on december 1 2019 3  the estimated rate of evolution for sars-cov-2 was in the range of 108x10 -3 -187x10 -3 substitutions per site per year which is also comparable with the rates estimated for other epidemic coronaviruses ie sars-cov 080x10 -3 -238x10 -3  and mers-cov 088x10 -3 -137x10 -3  20 21  taking into account the outbreak onset in wuhan it is worth pointing out that the city of wuhan had direct flight connections with different european cities including paris six weekly flights london three weekly flights and rome three weekly flights 22  regarding the v clade five sequences from france are among the first representatives of this clade in europe and were collected on january 23-28 2020 from at least a couple of chinese tourists from wuhan 23  in the present study two subclusters containing sequences from spain were identified and the tmrca was dated at the beginning of february and the mrca of at least one of them was located in england however there is no scientific evidence supporting the association of the introduction of this clade in spain to any known transmission cluster in europe the origin of g clade in europe has been associated with a known cluster of transmission in the state of bavaria germany 24  this outbreak began in january 19-22 2020 with the contact of a healthy german businessman with a shanghai resident who tested positive for sars-cov-2 on january 26 9  this cluster comprised at least 12 cases in bavaria 24  the present study dated the tmrca of this clade on january 19 2020 which is clearly compatible with the epidemiologic information however england was estimated as the origin of this cluster in spite of the fact that one representative sequence of the bavarian cluster was included in the analysis epi-isl-406962 this possible artifact could be explained by the low number of whole genome sequences available so far from germany n8 compared with the sequences from england n58 a new cluster named g-spain comprised of at least 6 sequences from madrid spain has been identified and the mrca was located in spain and dated around february 18 2020 the mrca of the s phylogenetic cluster in spain was located in shanghai and dated around january 28 however bf analyses did not support a direct transmission from shanghai to spain suggesting that an ancestor of these viruses that are circulating in spain was transmitted some time in the past in shanghai but the introduction in spain came from a different location according to the same analysis it is probable that the virus reached different european countries including spain directly from asia the mrca of the s-spain clade was located in spain and dated around february 14 this clade includes sequences from other 6 countries suggesting its dissemination from spain to usa netherlands chile brazil georgia and france epidemiologic investigations based on positive contact tracing have recently revealed that the first case detected in europe was from a patient returning to france from shanghai airport after a business trip in various cities including wuhan in january 24 23 25  a well-traced case transmitted in europe is the cluster of the french skiing resort of contamines-monjoie this cluster includes at least 13 infected individuals who are among the first cases reported in uk france and spain between 6 and 15 february 2020 9  recently one of the sequences from this cluster has been released epi-isl-410486 and its analysis revealed that it branches outside of g v and s clades none of the sequences from spain included in the present study has this topological feature since all of them branch in one of the major clades however the second case reported in spain from mallorca balearic islands is related to this cluster so there is a possibility that a virus with these characteristics is also circulating in spain but has not been sequenced yet 8 9  the main limitations of the present study are related to the fact that genomic sequences are being generated by diverse strategies following different steps that could affect the quality of the sequences different sample preparation techniques are being used including overlapping amplicons targeted capture where the viral rna is enriched and metagenomic total rna sequencing of rrna depleted samples the first two methods require less sequencing effort but the possibility that some rna molecules could be missed cannot be ruled out on the contrary the metagenomic approach is hypothesis-free but implies a high number of sequencing reads another point to take into account is the sequencing strategies per se since several approaches are being used including sanger sequencing and next generation sequencing platforms such as iseq miseq nextseq and novaseq from illumina minion and gridion from nanopore and iontorrent from thermofisher 6  all these technologies also have their own biases finally the informatics employed to analyze the data is the step where more diversity of options are being identified for all these reasons some of the genetic differences observed between samples could be attributable to the error rate of sequencing platforms indicating that genomes may be more similar than observed on the other hand the use of a reference genome to align the reads instead of following a de novo approach could mask some real genetic differences in this sense initiatives in nf-core are trying to provide best practice pipelines for the analysis of sars-cov-2 data in a peer-reviewed platform that includes some pipelines developed by the bioinformatics unit of the instituto de salud carlos iii 26 27 28 29  moreover due to the public health threat caused by sars-cov-2 more genomic and epidemiologic data are generated every day and the results obtained in the present study should be seen as an early report about the current situation at the end of march 2020 however studies like this about the dynamics of viral transmission are crucial to mitigate the pandemic because of phylodynamic analyses could help the public health authorities identifying viral transmission routes and guiding the response measures figure 1  phylogeny

following the emergence of the causative severe acute respiratory system coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 virus in china in december 2019 during the first month of the outbreak in scotland 2310 positive cases of covid-19 were detected associated with 1832 hospital admissions 207 intensive care admissions and 126 deaths the number of introductions into scotland and the source of those introductions was not known prior to this study added value of this study using a combined phylogenetic and epidemiological approach following real-time next generation sequencing of 452 sars-cov-2 samples it was estimated that the virus was introduced to scotland on at least 113 occasions mostly from other european countries including italy austria and spain localised outbreaks occurred in the community across multiple scottish health boards within healthcare facilities and an international conference and community transmission was established rapidly before local and international lockdown measures were introduced  abstract sars-cov-2 the causative agent of covid-19 emerged in wuhan china in december 2019 and spread rapidly throughout the world understanding the introductions of this new coronavirus in different settings may assist control efforts and the establishment of frameworks to support rapid response in future infectious disease outbreaks we investigated the first four weeks of emergence of the sars-cov-2 virus in scotland after the first case reported on the 1st march 2020 we obtained full genome sequences from 452 individuals with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of covid-19 representing 20 of all cases until 1st april 2020 n2310 this permitted a genomic epidemiology approach to study the introductions and spread of the sars-2 virus in scotland from combined phylogenetic and epidemiological analysis we estimated at least 113 introductions of sars-cov-2 into scotland during this period clusters containing multiple sequences suggestive of onward transmission occurred in 4886 56 4286 51 clusters had no known international travel history indicating undetected introductions the majority of viral sequences were most closely related to those circulating in other european countries including italy austria and spain travel-associated introductions of sars-cov-2 into scotland predated travel restrictions in the uk and other european countries the first local transmission occurred three days after the first case a shift from travel-associated to sustained community transmission was apparent after only 11 days undetected introductions occurred prior to the first known case of covid-19 earlier travel restrictions and quarantine measures might have resulted in fewer introductions into scotland thereby reducing the number of cases and the subsequent burden on health services the high number of introductions and transmission rates were likely to have impacted on national contact tracing efforts our results also demonstrate that local real-time genomic epidemiology can be used to monitor transmission clusters and facilitate control efforts to restrict the spread of covid-19  the pandemic virus severe acute respiratory system coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has spread

of significant resources to contain the outbreak covid-19 was declared a public health emergency of international concern pheic by the world health organisation on 30th january 2020 and a pandemic on 11th march 2020 9 10 many countries are now responding to large outbreaks triggering unprecedented social and economic disruption and challenges to local healthcare systems the who has declared a pheic on five occasions since 2009 all as a result of rna virus outbreaks h1n1 influenza zika polio and ebola pathogen genomic sequencing is now established as a core component of the modern epidemiological response to such outbreaks driven by modern nucleic acid sequencing technologies that can immediately yield entire pathogen genomes from clinical samples 11  the integration of viral genomic data with spatial temporal and other metadata in a genomic epidemiology framework has allowed enhanced inference of the origin and transmission dynamics of disease outbreaks 12 13 14  such an approach is particularly applicable to rna viruses as their relatively low-fidelity replication cycle generates mutations in the viral genome at a rate observable over the rapid time scale of an outbreak 15  in this study we sequenced laboratory-confirmed positive cases of covid-19 in scotland and analysed them alongside available international data in order to estimate the number of introduction events and early spread of sars-cov-2 in the country we also aimed to investigate outbreaks in health-care settings in real-time during the sampling period 2310 positive cases of covid-19 were detected httpsstatisticsgovscot associated with 1832 hospital admissions 207 intensive care admissions and 126 deaths applying a genomic epidemiology approach to the data we demonstrate the outbreak is the result of multiple separate introductions of the virus associated with international travel and that community transmission was quickly established in scotland well before the introduction of lockdown countermeasures on the 23 rd march samples up to 300 samples per week were selected prospectively following ethical approval from the relevant national biorepository

this version posted june 9 2020   our study indicates that sars-cov-2 entered the scottish population through at least 113 separate travel-related introductions leading to at least 48 clusters of sustained community transmission and 38 singleton sequences with no evidence of onward transmission 4486 49 of phylogenetic clusters included sequences from individuals with a known history of international travel the majority returned to scotland from europe at the end of february and early march following travel to italy and less commonly to spain austria switzerland france england ireland poland the caribbean and thailand travel to continental europe in february and march 2020 the epicentre of the global covid-19 pandemic was a clear driver of the scottish outbreak the majority of the lineages detected in this study were related to european sequences cases with direct links to south-east asia were rare 20 lineage a sequences a lineage present in china at the beginning of the outbreak but which is now globally distributed appear to have been introduced to scotland via spain on the 28th january the uk government recommended against all but essential travel to china and for returning travellers to self-isolate for two weeks upon their return regardless of symptoms 27 however despite evidence of local transmission in italy as early as february 21st advice from the scottish government for returning travellers from italy to self-isolate was issued only on the 25 th of february and was limited to those having returned from specific lockdown areas 28-30 by the time this advice was extended to all travellers on 10 th march the covid-19 outbreak within scotland was already being driven by community transmission a lack of robust measures to manage ingress of infected travellers from emerging pandemic hotspots may have accelerated the course of the outbreak in scotland and the uk as a whole our data suggest that sars-cov-2 was introduced to scotland on multiple occasions including at an international conference held in edinburgh several days before the first scottish case was confirmed whilst multiple local cases are linked to this event the last case within the cluster in the uk occurred on the 27 th march suggesting that the local public health response to this event may have been effective and did not account for the majority of cases in scotland however the geographical distribution of other sequences is striking spanning four continents and ten countries the role of this event in dispersing the virus locally and internationally before a single case had been identified in scotland demonstrates that governments should be wary of prematurely relaxing restrictions on large gatherings and international travel importantly we identified viral lineages with no epidemiological link to travel as early as two days after the first detection of infection indicating earlier introduction to scotland than the first detected case reported on the 1 st march 2020 23  4286 49 clusters were linked to sequences within the uk but outside scotland the majority of individuals had no recorded link to travel by the 12 th march only 2 days after substantial travel and physical distancing restrictions were put in place importantly these data are suggestive of introductions and community spread before initial detection the epidemic in the uk expanded rapidly prompting the government to respond with restrictive public health measures or lockdown to disrupt transmission as the number of cases subside this phylogenetic data will provide a baseline for granular real-time sequencing of infections this will be used as a measure of the success of current measures and has the potential to contribute to decision-making around the easing or tightening of public health measures integration of genomic sequence data with traditional case-finding and contact tracing has the potential to enhance descriptive epidemiology and deliver more targeted control measures however previous interventions of this type have been largely retrospective the challenge will be to develop a framework where phylogenetic information is delivered in real-time in an easily actionable format to public health and infection control teams this study has some limitations we sampled only 20 of those detected during the initial outbreak therefore some introduction events will have been missed further public health records were not accessed to record linkage with sequence data while introduction of erroneous variation during sequencing or genome assembly is possible we estimated experimentally that such rates were extremely low and should not affect clustering patterns in phylogenetic analyses this analysis based on the available phylogeny is most likely to be an under-estimate despite dense sampling of the beginning of the outbreak linkage of sequences do not categorically prove that transmission events have occurred and require correlation with epidemiological information many events may be linked to an identical sequence because sars-cov-2 is a slowly evolving rna virus exclusion of linkage may be inferred with more certainty as the variation present in the global diversity is well-represented in scotland reflecting a high number of near simultaneous introductions tracking of the outbreak is feasible and can be used to refine public health interventions our analysis may also have been affected by a shift in sampling all symptomatic individuals to hospitalised patients only during mid-march some travel-related introductions may therefore not have been detected as evidenced by several clusters with no evidence of travel related infection after this time the utility of genomic epidemiology to inform local level policy is highlighted by the case of a healthcare worker in this study who tested positive for covid-19 whilst working on a high-risk ward the sequence from the healthcare worker was clearly distinct from those from the patients on the ward supplementary figure 2  suggesting that nosocomial transmission was unlikely such information can inform targeted infection control interventions such as the effectiveness of personal protective equipment ppe in contrast several healthcare associated clusters were detected later in the outbreak that included healthcare workers in summary the first month of the covid-19 outbreak in scotland was associated with multiple introductions related to returning travellers from europe increased evidence of ongoing non-travel related transmissions as time passed and clusters related to events and healthcare facilities since the onset of lockdown interventions introductions into the community have subsided an earlier lockdown from countries with a high burden of cases such as italy and other measures such as quarantine of travellers from high-risk areas might have prevented escalation of the outbreak and multiple clusters of

stevens matthew neave j mary tachedjian trevor drew w seshadri vasan s   the world is witnessing increasing instances of emerging and reemerging diseases caused by viruses for instance there have been six public health emergency of international concern pheic declarations by the who since 2009 viz h1n1 swine flu polio west africa ebola zika and the ongoing kivu ebola and sarscov2 coronavirus outbreaks eurosurveillance editorial team 2019 2020 two of these viruses h1n1 and sarscov2 have resulted in pandemics within 10 years who 2020 the sars outbreak of 20022004 the mers outbreaks since 2012 and the current covid19 outbreak since 2019 demonstrate the potential of coronaviruses especially batderived betacoronaviruses zhou et al 2020 to cause pheics with covid19 having escalated to a global pandemic viruses in a new host humans have the potential to evolve rapidly and present quasispecies diversity eigen mccaskill  schuster 1988 which is a hallmark of rna viruses that exist as a cloud of variants due to low fidelity high polymorphism and viral polymerases lacking the capability to correct errors drew 2011 wilke wang ofria lenski  adami 2001 as a result most variants are a random accumulation of errors useful for tracing aetiology but typically without substantial functional change grubaugh petrone  holmes 2020 unlike most other rna viruses coronaviruses express a 3to5 exoribonuclease that enables the highfidelity replication of their relatively large 2632 kb ssrna genome minskaia et al 2006snijder et al 2003 coronaviruses have a moderate mutation rate 080238  103 nucleotide substitutions per site per year for the sarscov genome zhao et al 2004 allowing a wider evolutionary space to be explored more deliberately this can complicate the outbreak response in terms of rapid development and evaluation of diagnostics vaccines antivirals and antibody therapies as many diverse strains with unknown functional differences exist figure 1 this is particularly exacerbated by increased movement of people enabled by global air travel animals and goods spreading new viruses across the worlds population and exposing them to huge variations in environment demographics age structure socioeconomic status comorbidities and equitable access to health care the sheer number of these interconnected influencing factors often makes an unfolding situation hard to comprehend fully and challenges the traditional virology and public health disciplines by rendering them less effective in coping with the spread of the virus bioinformatic approaches may be able to better inform epidemiology and responses to transboundary viruses by synthesizing complex information more effectively and systematically enabled by the advances in genomic sequencing technology eg oxford nanopore illumina and the willingness to share the sequenced information in the public domain eg genbank gisaid bioinformatic approaches developed in the human domain have enabled comparative analysis of the emerging genomic diversity of a virus as it spreads throughout a host population for the ongoing covid19 outbreak as illustrated in figure 1 applying in silico approaches can rapidly provide answers to questions like is the first sequenced sarscov2 genome often called the reference genome in gisaid genbank etc closest to the original or true reference strain which entered humans which may not have been sequenced andor which may still be circulating with minimal mutations combined with epidemiological or experimental evidence bioinformatics can help address questions like are there one or multiple circulating strains and are they different to the most virulent ones if yes can we identify the molecular basis finally can synthetic consensus sequences be used to represent the genetic diversity of individual isolates in larger circulating clusters answers to these questions are not just of academic interest they can help inform outbreak response and development and evaluation of diagnostics vaccines and countermeasures for instance outbreak response efforts including vaccine evaluation should focus on the most prevalent circulating strain lest we may end up rejecting acceptable candidates by raising the efficacy threshold too high but it would be desirable to evaluate therapeutics against the most virulent strain however with the field not yet using bioinformatic tools to their fullest potential current data collection practices are not capturing the information necessary for advanced analysis for example pathogen sequences derived from patients are typically not annotated with deidentified disease progression and other clinically relevant information and this in turn hampers the identification of the most virulent strain or associating pathogen properties with genomic modifications here we use bioinformatic analysis to identify emerging trends among the sarscov2 isolates from this we sought to identify the most representative strains for animal models and preclinical research in particular which strains among the emerging australian isolates are good choices for animal model development and which ones are not representative two australian isolates betacovaustraliavic022020 and betacovaustraliasa012020 were sequenced with the miseq platform illumina inc in brief rna was purified from each isolate using a directzol rna miniprep kit zymo research purified rna was reverse transcribed using a taqman reverse transcription kit applied biosystems with random octamers linked to a specific primer sequence followed by secondstrand cdna synthesis using klenow dna polymerase i promega complementary dna was further amplified using primers specific to the sequences added to the random octamers used for reverse transcription with a kapa hifi hotstart kit roche resulting dna was purified using a dna clean and concentrator kit zymo research fragmentation and dualindex library preparation was conducted using a nextera xt dna library preparation kit illumina inc and denatured libraries were sequenced using a 300cycle miseq reagent kit v2 illumina inc sequencing reads were trimmed for quality and mapped to the published reference sequence betacovwuhanhu12019 genbank accession number nc0455122 using geneious 1114 consensus genome sequences for the isolates were generated for analysis all available viral sequences were downloaded from gisaid on 05032020 see appendix s3 elbe  bucklandmerrett 2017 filtering for complete sequences of human origin 187 genomes in total lowquality sequences defined as sequences with an n content greater than 1 were filtered out leaving 178 strains in total we also included one recently reported viral sequence from the european virus archive global refsku 026v03883 and the two australian sequences in the full data set this data set of 181 sequences was aligned against each other using muscle v3831 madeira et al 2019 based on the alignments we could see significant variation at the ends of the sequences figure s1 likely due to sequencing artefacts and errors preventing the full viral genomes from being sequenced to reduce the impact of potential sequencing errors we wrote a custom perl script to trim the sequences such that only positions with 95 coverage were retained this trimming entailed removing the first 101 and last 72 bp from the alignments once trimmed and converting all u to t we identified 54 sequences that were identical to limit the effect of duplicate sequences on subsequent analysis we collapsed these into a single entry these collapsed sequences are summarized in table s1 to validate the methodology we have included sequences from other coronaviruses we chose a mixture of controls as follows 7 sars sequences of human origin genbank accession numbers ay2741193 ay2914511 ay5029231 ay5029321 ay5590831 ay5590841 and ay5590871 10 sars sequences of bat origin accession numbers ky4171421 to ky4171521 4 mers sequences of human origin accession numbers kj4771021 kt0061492 kt0264531 and kt0291391 and 2 mers sequences of bat origin accession numbers mg5968021 and mg5968031 the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was generated from the above alignments using raxmlng kozlov darriba flouri morel  stamatakis 2019 the evolutionary model used was a general time reversable model with gammadistributed rate heterogeneity and invariant sites gtr  g  i we use this mode since it is the most general model and has been proposed to produce equal trees to optimally selected models abadi azouri pupko  mayrose 2019 the tree was visualized using itol letunic  bork 2019 as a midpoint rooted tree and shows the likely evolutionary relationships between the sampled strains every organism and potentially isolate can have a unique genomic signature based on the composition of their genomic sequence to quantify this signature we determined the kmer frequency counting of all possible strings of length k in the sequence of the virus has emerged as an alternative to phylogenetic trees in other disciplines sims jun wu  kim 2009 the conceptual distance between all isolates can then be visualized by running a principal component analysis pca over all genomic signatures to reduce this highdimensional kmer frequency vector into a twodimensional space jolliffe  cadima 2016 please see appendix s1 for more details of this method custom scripts were used to calculate the kmer frequency for each sequence using a k of 10 sims et al 2009 kmers containing ambiguous bases ie ns were removed we then calculated the relative proportion of each kmer resulting in a frequency vector we used the pca implementation of python scikitlearn to reduce the genomic signatures containing 1048576 10mer proportions into a vector containing two principal components finally custom scripts were used to compare the genomic signatures for all aforementioned coronavirus sequences the evolutionary structure of the 181 isolates as determined by the phylogenetic tree reveals three major clusters c1c3 figure 2 the c1 cluster mainly represents wuhan and isolates captured early on c2 and c3 contain later isolates such as sydney3 australiavic01 and franceidf0372 in c2 and australiansw01 australiaqld013 australiavic02 and usawa1 in c3 the three clusters are separated by distinct mutations table 1 but contain a substantial number of other unique mutations which we define as diversity within the cluster these individual mutations are outside of the established hotspots of diversity wang et al 2020 as shown in figure s4 which are predominantly of concern for pcr primer design rather than aetiology there may also be three additional clusters emerging c46 with c4 capturing the suspected community spread from lombardy narrative genomic analysis of covid19 spread nd c5 regionally mixed asia and north amerika and c6 from australia and asia notably australiansw057 see fully annotated tree in figure s5 this finding is different to tang et al 2020 who postulate two clusters s and l their analysis was only on 103 gisaid isolates and includes betacoronaviruses from bats which roots the tree differently and merges c1 and c2 however as the aetiology is not fully demonstrated especially with the intermediate vector yet unknown artificially rooting the tree by introducing a distant relative may bias the results irrespective of the root placement both trees allow the assessment of individual isolates that are not part of major branches by being genetically divergent offshoots for example sydney2 appears to be an offshoot from wuhanhu1 upon further inspection of the sydney2 strand we discovered a 41bp deletion which overlaps the infectious bronchitis virus ibv motif at the 3 end goebel taylor  masters 2004 inspecting other isolates australiavic01 has also a 10bp deletion within the genomic location of the 41bp deletion figure s3 despite this similarity australiavic01 was placed into c2 and sydney2 in c1 since australiavic01 contains the g26144t mutation indicative of c2 which sydney2 lacks see table 2 for a list of referenced isolates a more systematic sequence analysis revealed that many isolates have deletions in their core genome table s2 while these deletions appear to be specific to each isolate figure s4 their effect on virus structure or function might be pronounced for example australiavic01 and sydney2 may have the ibv motif disrupted with implications for replication while usaca6 and japanai004 may have disruption in the nonstructural protein 1 nsp1 with implications for host gene expression figure s3 while the full impact of these genomic variations can only be confirmed through functional genomics experiments coronaviruses proofreading ability likely lifts them above random accumulation of errors as such having a methodology able to take deletions into consideration when calculating genomic distance is desirable aiming to overcome the limitations of phylogenetic tree approaches we also investigated whether an alignmentfree approach can be used to understand how the genomic content of different sarscov2 isolates changes over time and with respect to each other by also taking deletions into account we therefore calculated the frequency of all possible 10mers across each viral genome followed by principal component analysis pca to reduce the highdimensional kmer vector space into a twodimensional image for visual comparison we first demonstrate the methods ability to faithfully separate distant coronavirus strains by comparing all sarscov2 against 17 sars and 6 mers isolates as shown in figure 3 inset this alignmentfree approach separates the isolates into their three respective clusters of sarscov2 sars and mers this indicates that the genetic distance between the different isolates of the same coronavirus strain is relatively small while there are substantial differences between the different coronavirus virus strains predictably we separated mers isolates into two subclusters reflecting their different host origins human and bat to further investigate how the genomic content of different sarscov2 viruses relates to each other we reran the pca analysis on just the sarscov2 sequences here the genomic signatures of isolates that are likely to be closely related cluster together eg australiaqld01 australiaqld03 samples from close family relations while strains separated by time are far apart eg wuhanhu1 collection date 31122019 and australiansw05 collection date 2822020 of the australian isolates sydney3 and australiansw01 were the closest to wuhanhu1 which is consistent with the phylogenetic results and reflects the fact that these sequences have only mutational changes in their core sequences compared to wuhanhu1 table s2 however this alignmentfree method positions isolates with deletions viz australiavic01 and canadaonvido01 further away from wuhanhu1 than in the phylogenetic tree demonstrating the ability of the kmer method to represent deletions accurately see supplemental table 7 of the 181 isolates we found that singapore4 taiwanntu01 finland1 usail1 and shenzhenszth001 were among the furthest from wuhanhu1 data not shown for both singapore4 and taiwanntu01 this is due to these being shorter than the core sequences so the kmer fingerprint accurately reflects the missing sequences meanwhile usail1 and finland1 contained several ambiguous bases effectively shortening the length of similar sequence so the method correctly places them further from the other isolates while the kmer approach is not as suggestive as phylogenetic trees with respect to visualizing the potential transmission route eg lombardy it may more accurately reflect the fluidity of changes cloud of variants and capture recombination events graham  baric 2010 an example is italyinmi1 which has mutations in common with both sydney3 c1 cluster g26144t and chongqingivdccq001 c3 cluster g11083t making it impossible to definitively place it in the discrete phylogenetic tree it was placed in the c2 cluster figure 2 while the pca plot shows the fluid evolution placing it between the italian and australian isolate figure 3 more generally phylogenetic analysis is based on the presence of shared mutations for example two strains which share most snps are likely to be closely related and therefore exist on neighbouring branches in the phylogenetic tree in comparison an alignmentfree method such as kmer signatures is more concerned with global similarities and difference for example changes averaged across the whole genome rather than at specific locations this can be informative about highlevel similarities between genomes for example evolution of distinct genomic islands with common functions or recombination events while this does not create visually clear clades it offers a more holistic representation of pairwise distances between all isolates together with clinical information this could hence help determine the most virulent strains figure 1 currently the process of determining which isolate to use for animal models is less informed than it could be due to the lack of shared genomic information and readily available bioinformatic methodologies especially towards the beginning of an outbreak for example while china published the genomic sequence of sarscov2 zhou et al 2020 patient samples or virus isolates were not made available and with reverse genetics of a large rna virus taking time thao et al 2020 countries had to wait for imported cases australias doherty institute was the first in the world to isolate the virus australiavic01 and made it available for preclinical animal models to the authors csiro 2020 public health england etc this practical consideration dictated the initial choice however with more isolates to choose from subsequently a more informed approach can be taken figure 1 two questions are pertinent is vic01 an appropriate strain to continue with further development and characterization of the animal model if not what options are more representative and appropriate while nextstrain narrative genomic analysis of covid19 spread nd is a powerful aid in visualizing the available strains in real time it currently relies on phylogeny only and thus may be hampered in its conclusions in this section we offer a static view of the alignmentfree approach for the currently used strains for animal model research that we know of and interpret their likely representativeness with respect to future evolution of the virus according to the phylogenetic tree shown in figure 4a the main clusters are represented by the current animal models that is c1 is represented by germanybavpat1 and human 2019ncov whose core sequence is identical though they seem to be halfway to the c4 cluster suspected lombardy cluster c2 is represented by australiavic01 and franceidf0372 and c3 is represented by usawa1 note that scotlandcvr01 was removed due to its high n content 23 however with phylogenetic methods focusing on the presence of shared mutations rather than the overall genomic similarity eg shared evolved functionality the assumption that current animal models adequately cover the evolutionary space of the actively circulating virus might be misleading as the pca plot indicates figure 4b here the topleft and bottomright areas seem to be underrepresented to join the strainetiology of phylogenetic approaches with the more fluid distance measure of alignmentfree methods we created the consensus sequences of the major and emerging clusters appendix s2 and reran the pca analysis to find more robust and future relevant isolates figure 4b of the existing animal models only usawa1 is close to a consensus c3 all other clusters have different representative isolates viz c1 directly overlaps wuhanhu1 c2 is nearest to zhejiangwz01 c3 directly overlaps australiansw01 c4 directly overlaps switzerland1000477796 c5 directly overlaps vietnamvr0338142 and c6 is nearest to australiansw07 the central location of germanybavpat1 and franceidf0372 may reflect a broad representation across multiple clusters in contrast to canadaonvido01 and australiavic01 which are located further away from the sarscov2 centre marked by the rectangle in figure 4b inset in this outer view the dominant driver for placing isolates away from the centre is missing bases either due to deletions missing sequences at the tails or ambiguous bases the vertical lines hence cluster isolates with a similar number of missing bases for example australiavic01 and canadaonvido01 have 10bp deletions while koreakcdc05 and australiasydney02 have a 40bp shorter sequence and 42bp deletion respectively among the australian strains the genomic distance analysis marks australiasydney2 as a less optimal target for animal models compared to say australiavic01 australiavic02 and australiasa01 in no particular order in this context usawa1 available through bei could also be a good choice due to its central location likely ability to represent especially the newly emerging clusters and comparability of animal models with nonhuman primate studies in the united states which have chosen this on the basis of being readily available clinical observations eg severity of symptoms and mortality if applicable and experimental observations eg growth and titre can refine the choice of isolate for animal model development with further refinement based on observations from animal challenge studies such as shedding of the virus associated histopathology and clinical signs if applicable it is clear that at this early stage of the pandemic our initial questions around the number of circulating strains and their virulence cannot be answered with the currently available epidemiological and clinical data even when applying sophisticated computational analysis tools however we have demonstrated that creating synthetic consensus sequences can be used to demarcate the evolutionary space already claimed by the virus while sarscov2 does have a proofreading exoribonuclease domain in nsp14 its genetic drift remains a point of uncertainty with respect to the longlasting efficacy of a vaccine candidates currently being developed in conclusion joining bioinformatics epidemiological and experimental results can help inform animal model choice for efficient preclinical responses callaway 2020 moving away from purely practical considerations towards a more deliberate approach that assesses current and future characteristics of isolate choices will lead to a better coverage of actively circulating strains figure 1 with more sharing of isolates internationally and information collected about patientdeidentified details of case severity and outcome more sophisticated machine learning approaches can be generated to assist in triaging and treatment choices additional information such as comorbidities socioeconomic and smoking status may also help in anticipating public health demand furthermore releasing the full highthroughput sequencing data sets rather than the consensus sequences would allow a more detailed exploration of the existing quasispecies to further improve isolate selection the authors declare no conflict of

 the polyprotein 1ab pp1ab is the largest protein of coronaviruses that through proteolytic cleavage is divided into 16 mature nonstructural proteins nsps the nsps are involved in replication and transcription of the viral genome and are responsible for the cleavage of the polyprotein thus making them attractive antiviral drug targets

 pp1ab of sarscov2 has not been thoroughly analyzed despite the high similarity between pp1ab proteins it could be possible to identify distinguishable regions representing molecular signatures for the specific detection of virus strains or to track its evolutive history in this short communication we expound a comparative sequence analysis of pp1ab protein of sarscov2 the analysis was performed using the phylogeneticstructural sequence analysis sequence comparisons were made in a phylogenetic order

 the implications of this deletion are worth to be addressed however since the deletion is present in just one isolated virus this finding needs to be confirmed by other genome sequences for the second part of the analysis we compared pp1ab of sarscov2 to those of the clade 2 of sarbecoviruses batslcovzc45 mg772933 batslcovzxc21s mg772934 batslcovratg13 mn996532 the pairwise comparison performed with sdt indicated that the most related protein was the one belonging to batslcovratg13 986 also proteins from batslcovzc45 and batslcovzxc21s showed a pairwise identity above 95 to determine if the identity is preserved throughout its length we compared the pp1ab sequences from these viruses via similarity plot analysis the analysis showed that pp1ab of batslcovzc45 and batslcovzxc21s displayed three dissimilarity regions that surround residues 1000 877 4670 914 and 6590 916 figure s2 the pairwise identity between sarscov2 and batslcovratg13 is conserved throughout its length scrutiny on the alignment allowed us to note that regions of residues 4631 and 6565 of batslcovzc45 and batslcovzxc21s were more similar to those from viruses of clade 3 rather than sarscov2 or batslcovratg13 these findings explain why the orf1b of batslcovzc45 and batslcovzxc21s are clustered with those of sarbecoviruses from clade 3

 suggesting a recombination history between these viruses with clade 3 members when we analyzed the position 1000 of the pp1ab alignment we identified rich glutamine 22 amino acid signature in pp1ab of sarscov2 asscov2 this signature is 42 aa in length dsqqtvgqqdgsednqtttiqtivevqpqlemeltpvvqtie placed between the amino acids 983 and 1024 of pp1ab which correspond to the nterminal of papainlike protease 165 aa to 206 aa specifically asscov2 is located in the flexible acidicdomain ac domain rich in glutamic acid figure 1
11
 ac domain is flanked by the ubiquitinlike and the adpribose1phosphatase domains
10
 the functional implication of the ac domain extension conferred by asscov2 needs to be studied the asscov2 is partially conserved in the pp1a protein of batslcovzc45 identity 405 indels 6 and virtually missing in batslcovzxc21s identity 16 indels 27 while asscov2 is very conserved in pp1ab of batslcovratg13 identity 76 indels 0 figure 1 these results suggest that sarscov2 is closely related to batslcovratg13 rather than batslcovzc45 or batslcovzxc21s the alignment of the pp1ab from members of the subgenus sarbecovirus showed that the asscov2 is exclusive of the novel coronavirus and slightly preserved in batslcov from clade 2 figure 1 we found the same results when we compared the pp1ab of members of the genus betacoronavirus table s3 data s1 a search in the nucleotide and protein genbank databases displayed that asscov2 is codified only in genomes of sarscov2 also no proteins other than pp1ab of sarscov2 and batslcovratg13 partially have the signature because we determined that the presence of asscov2 in human coronaviruses is restricted only to sarscov2 we suggest that their respective 126 nucleotide sequence can be used to design alternative specific pcr diagnosis for sarscov2 the genome sequences of two sarbecoviruses isolated from the pangolin manis javanica were recently released in gisaid database one of them was collected in guangzhou china in 2019 pangolinbetacovguandong2019 epiisl410721 and the other one was collected in guangxi china in 2017 pangolinbetacovguangxi2017 epiisl410538 phylogenetic analysis based on genome sequence showed that both viruses collected from pangolins are clustered in the clade 2 figure 2 the pairwise comparison of pp1ab protein showed that the protein of pangolinbetacovguandong2019 is 94 identical to those of sarscov2 while the pp1ab of pangolinbetacovguangxi2017 has an identity of 92 since both pangolin viruses are grouped in clade 2 and their pp1ab proteins are identical to those of sarscov2 we analyzed the alignment of its pp1ab protein to determine if the asscov2 is present figure 1 the homologous region of asscov2 pp1ab of pangolinbetacovguandong2019 has 34 aa that showed an identity of 35 whereas the homologous region of asscov2 in pangolinbetacovguangxi2017 have 36 aa which are completely different from those of sarbecoviruses figure 1 these findings suggest that the pp1ab of sarscov2 is more closely related to pp1ab of batslcovratg13 than to pp1ab of coronaviruses isolated from chinese pangolins since the region that encodes the pp1ab protein represents about 71 of sarscov2 genome we suggest that it is less likely that the novel human coronavirus has been arising directly from the viruses isolated from pangolins first reports focused on the genetic characterization of sarscov2 suggested that this virus has a recombinant origin
2
 our results indicate that most probably a recombination event did not happen in the first half of the viral genome orf1ab under this idea an alternative explanation for sarscov2 origin is that batslcovratg13 collected 6 years ago is the progenitor of sarscov2 which has evolved since the collection date by genetic drift before infecting humans three observations support the hypothesis 1 the high pairwise identity of pp1ab from sarscov2 and batslcovratg13 is preserved throughout its length figure s2 2 the exclusive asscov2 of the novel coronavirus is conserved in batslcovratg13 figure 1 3 the high pairwise identity 963 shared by sarscov2 and batslcovratg13 is preserved in its whole genome only a slight dissimilarity region is displayed in the orf of spike protein
6

 although the origin of sarscov2 does not appear to be caused by recent genetic recombination at least acquisition of genetic material must have given place to asscov2 since members of subgenus sarbecovirus from clade 1 and clade 3 have at the minimum 25 missing aa in its homologous region of asscov2 and members of clade 2 have sequence traces of asscov2 except by betacovpangolinguangxi2017 figures 1 we suggest the viral ancestor of clade 2 members probably gained the genetic material figure 2 in this scenario the ancestral asscov2 have been changed over the time by genetic drift evolving to the actual asscov2 this probably explains why we could not infer the origin of these signature based on the available sequences from databases although there is a possibility that the organism that donated this segment has not been discovered yet regarding the pp1ab of pangolinbetacovguangxi2017 we suggest that a recombination event in the genomic region of the that encodes the first 3500 amino acids of pp1ab probably happened since the asscov2 is no present in this virus and the simplot analysis showed several dissimilarity peaks in this region when the pp1ab of pangolinbetacovguangxi2017 is compared with either of clade 2 members of sarbecoviruses figure s3 the asscov2 located in the acidicdomain of papainlike protein from sarscov2 and batslcovratg13 guided us to suggest that the novel humanpathogenic coronavirus probably emerged by genetic drift from batslcovratg13 the implication of asscov2 in papainlike protein structure arrangement and function is something worth to be explored the authors declare that there are no conflict of interests  accepted article genetic variants and source of introduction of sars-cov-2 in south america accepted article julio poterico julio poterico a orson mestanza julio  a poterico  after more than four months of the covid-19 pandemics with genomic information of sars-cov-2 around the globe there are more than 1000 complete genomes of this virus we used 691 genomes from the gisaid database several studies have been reporting mutations and hotspots according to the viral evolution our work intends to show and compare positions that have variants in 30 complete viral genomes from south american countries we classified strains according to point alterations and portray the source where strains came into this region most viruses entered to south america from europe followed by oceania only chilean isolates demonstrated a relationship to asian isolates some changes in south american genomes are near to specific domains related to replication or s protein our work contributes to global understanding of which sort of strains are spreading throughout south american countries and the differences among them according to the first isolates introduced in this region  the current emergency of covid-19 arose after the end of 2019 in wuhan china and was officially declared a pandemic by the world health organization who on march 11 2020 its causative agent was called novel coronavirus ncov with a round or oval shape of this 60 to 140 nm enveloped structure 1  then the coronaviridae study group of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses named it as sars-cov-2 2 based on genomic and phylogenetics analysis sars-cov-2 is closely related to the bat coronavirus isolate ratg13 due to its homology in phylogenetics analysis 3  hence sars-cov-2 is a betacoronavirus with more homology to ratg13 around 96 sequence identity and pangolin-cov 9102 identity than to sars-cov 79 identity or mers 518 identity viruses 13-6  sars-cov-2 genome sequences allowed us to understand the organization of this virus which has nearly 29890 base pairs genbank nc0455122 with genes that produce 29 proteins these proteins are encoded by ten open reading frames orfs the most important viral proteins are spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n proteins in addition the orf1ab can translate 16 non-structural proteins nsp 3  genomic studies from china allowed us to understand that the virus could accumulate mutations meanwhile spreading across the world with a probable moderate mutation rate 7  for instance substitutions in positions 8750 28112 were the hotspots and were useful to define two groups of strains and nt29063 was used by scientists to subdivide these groups 8  furthermore another study evaluated 95 sars-cov-2 complete genomes and reported 13 february 9th 2020 and in a position of rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp or nsp12 9  these authors also found that positions 17746 17857 and 18060 were points of recurrent mutations in viruses isolated from american or canadian patients 10  conversely little information was collected with next generation sequencing ngs methodology in these countries a huge amount of sars-cov-2 genomes has been sequenced in a short time around the globe and a lot of research was published nevertheless south american countries have poor genomic information and lack of genomic analysis to this date there is only one official report of sars-cov-2 in south america 11  and another online publication from brazil thus we aim to show a first overview of phylogenetics relationships and genetic variations of sars-cov-2 in south america analyses were performed to obtain an overview of genomic sars-cov-2 mutations of circulating strains in south america we download a total of 30 complete genomes of south this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved american countries from the gisaid httpswwwgisaidorg database the alignment was carried out with mauve 12 software using the reference nc0455122 from the initial report from wuhan china the alignment was displayed in mega6 13 to extract nucleotide and amino acid mutations for extracting the ten orfs regions the positions were assessed according to a previous study 7  additionally we downloaded 688 genomes from the gisaid database 14  the genomes were complete 29000bp and with high coverage according to this public resource furthermore to obtain representative sequences of the seven different continents we chose 5 to 7 day intervals of the first strain isolated in each continent the alignment of the genomes was performed using mafft 15  all gaps were replaced with n the inference phylogenetics was used raxml 16 with the model gtrcat with three rate categories and rapid hill-climbing to accelerate computations the treetine 17 software was used for phylodynamic analysis using an approximate maximum likelihood approach with defaults parameters and a time clock model was used finally the tree obtained from raxml was analyzed with grapetree 18 using a minimum spanning algorithm to explore the fine-grained population structure of south american genomes related to continent expansion we have analyzed a total of 691 sars-cov-2 complete genomes from a wide variety of geographical sites only 30 genomes from south american countries  this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved we aligned 30 sars-cov-2 genomes from south american isolates with the reference demonstrating high homology with 29846 sites conserved representing 9998 of identity genomes have 57 snps sites in total  phylogenetics analysis of 688 genomes figure 1  was colored according to tang et al 19  the mutation a23403g permits to assign 17 genomes related to clade g light purple and the nucleotide change t28144c classify 8 genomes in the clade s light pink on the other hand five genomes did not belong to any clade figure 2 shows that clade g diverse and contains subtypes at least one south american strain belongs to a subgroup of clade g it seems that 11  and we assume the 02 other isolates could have been sampled from relatives or close people to patient zero we hypothesize that our findings are related to the amount of samples of viral sequences which could not be done for other south american countries yet or any other bias of sample selection furthermore we were unable to include in our phylogenetic analysis viral genomes from ecuador and colombia due to genome sequence quality however the gisaid sars-cov-2 portal url at httpswwwgisaidorgepiflu-applicationsnext-hcov-19app depicts the close relationship between an isolate from oceania epi isl 417211 and the strain sequenced in ecuador this online tool also shows that one of the strains sequenced from colombian patients was related to an australian origin epiisl419834-closely related to the chilean strain epiisl414578--whereas the other closely related to european origin from germany or switzerland we were able to classify strains according to previous suggestions 19  we demonstrate that strains from clade g were the most common throughout south america with 6875 1429 50 100 of strains in brazil 1116 chile 17 colombia 12 and the latter percentage for peru 11 and argentina 33 up to this report we only have an official publication from chile and we were able to confirm analysis from this group except the change of an amino acid g196v in our analysis reported in one strain of clade s as g193v 11  currently 8571 of chilean strains pertain to s clade followed by 50 and 625 for colombian and brazilian isolates respectively all of s clade chilean strains were related this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved to asian origin whereas brazilian and colombian isolates were related to viruses from oceania infectivity and pathogenicity of sars-cov-2 is related to s protein mainly due to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 h-ace2 binding ridge structural changes of the rbd domain on residues 482-485 gly val glu gly 20  thus novel mutations on s protein especially on these residues or nearly of them could be of importance our report highlights two strains with novel variants on the s region with no amino acid change in nt24022 e1207e whereas another non-synonymous alteration in nt25182 e1207v for peru epiisl415787 and ecuador epiisl417482 respectively however these changes seem far away from the critical region of s protein for h-ace2 affinity due to its prevalence across the world as in our sample of south american isolates researchers are suggesting that clade g strains could be more contagious than other subtypes zhang et al 8 suggested that it could be related to synonymous changes due to nucleotide changes in orf1ab nt8750 and n nt29063 genes which could enhance viral replication due to higher translational efficiencies compared to other clades furthermore another study showed that there are some positions where mutations could arise more frequently in subsequent sars-cov-2 strains corresponding to nt8782 of orf1a nt28144 of orf8 and nt29095 of n region 7  we highlight differences with this report because we found variations 8 830 in both of nt8782 and nt28144 positions conversely other regions seem to be hotspots in south american strains with 113667 of these portraying changes at 5utr nt241 nsp3 nt3037 nsp12 nt14408 norf9 nt28881 nt28882 and nt28883 this is relevant because changes in nsp1 nsp3 and nsp5 could be related to some functions of the viral incubation period and immune response evasion of sars-cov-2 21  we found amino acid alterations in both of these regions such as g392d nsp1 a876t and a1043 nsp3 and nsp5 g3334s and should be tested in further studies strikingly we this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved have been correlated to more mutations 3-4 per genome than their counterparts without it 9  all south american viruses of clade g analyzed in this report have concomitantly mutations on 14408 and 23403 positions compared to the reference genome we found an average of 5 mutations per genome of the overall south american strains our study represents the first overview of sars-cov-2 strains genomic comparison and phylogenetic analysis in south america surprisingly five of the studied strains lack current classification and we were not able to track all the global distribution of this virus due to our sampling methodology however we consider that our study highlights important findings such as two novel mutations in the s region and novel hotspots positions in addition some external limitations such as primers design variations of the orf1b 23 or n regions could have influenced the sequencing process on some isolates from south america 7 24  some other limitations are the lack of epidemiological data for all patients we mostly used media information or governments official websites poor quality of some viral genome sequences and specially the limited number of viral genomes reported in south america after almost two months of the arrival of sars-cov-2 to this part of the world this must improve to identify mutations that could have an effect on the design of diagnostic and therapeutic measures including vaccines or antiviral drugs 25  we should take into account that this is a novel virus and could have higher mutation rates than currently expected 7  and genetic drift and founder effect could influence specific sars-cov-2 subsequent strains and mutations which would be geographically constrained for a while moreover south america should urgently strengthen the genomic epidemiology field for the current and further pandemics we gratefully acknowledge the authors originating and submitting laboratories of the sars-cov-2 sequences from gisaids epiflu database 14 see supplemental 1  moreover we  sars-coronavirus ancestors foot-prints in south-east asian bat colonies and the

the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov which had the potential to cause the first viral pandemic of the xxist century who 2003 jones et al 2008 sars-cov most likely originated from bats through an intermediate species that could be the masked palm civet paguma larvata viverridae or another bridge-host itself very probably contaminated by a sars-like cov from horseshoe bats song et al 2005 li et al 2006 cui et al 2007 several elements indicate that this bridge-host could presumably be a carnivora as suggested by both detections in wild animals from markets or experimental infections guan et al 2003 van den brand et al 2008 several other mammalian or avian species are susceptible to coronaviruses infection displaying enteric hepatic neurological or respiratory tropism but little is known about their viral ecology and host interactions coronaviruses are members of the order nidovirales which contains three families of single stranded positive rna viruses arteriviridae coronaviridae and roniviridae coronaviridae are divided in two subfamilies coronavirinae and torovirinae because of serological and genotypic differences coronaviruses were traditionally divided into three groups labeled group i ii and iii gonzlez et al 2003 gorbalenya et al 2004 these three groups have recently been elevated at the genus level and named respectively alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus by the coronavirus study group of the international committee for taxonomy of viruses thus invalidating the coronavirus genus name httptalkictvonlineorgmediap1230aspx as other nidovirales coronaviridae such as sars-cov possess a mutation prone rna-dependent rna-polymerase rdrp associated with high genome mutability castro et al 2005 furthermore they frequently recombine in vivo lai et al 1985 makino et al 1986 keck et al 1987 jia et al 1995 herrewegh et al 1998 lee and jackwood 2000 stadler et al 2003 this genetic variability confers to coronaviruses a high potential of evolution that allows them to sometimes overcome species barriers and host specificity baric et al 1995 baric et al 1997 thackray and holmes 2004 from a more general viewpoint these characteristics are known to account for the frequent involvement of rna viruses in disease emergence domingo and holland 1997 chomel 1998 daszak et al 2000 cleavel et al 2001 woolhouse and gowtage-sequeria 2005 until now asian sars-related coronavirus sarsr-cov from betacoronavirus-b group  fig 1
a rna has been detected in only one bat family the rhinolophidae gray 1825 table 2 therefore this monogeneric bat family is considered as the host at the origin of the deadly sars-cov outbreak lau et al 2005 however other bat families are involved in the maintenance and the diversification of a wide range of coronavirus species belonging to both alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus genera ie vespertillionidae phyllostomidae pteropodidae molossidae and hipposideridae families have been positively tested for coronavirus nucleic acid chu et al 2006 tang et al 2006 dominguez et al 2007 carrington 2008 brandao et al 2008 tong et al 2009 pfefferle et al 2009 whether or not another bat family could be involved in addition to rhinolophidae in the natural history of betacornaviruses would have been an interesting question but since the discovery of sarsr-cov in wildlife most of the attention and sampling efforts have been focusing on rhinolophidae table 2 several species from this family were shown to carry different sarsr-cov such as sarsr rhinolophidae bat coronavirus strain rp3 in rhinolophus pearsoni and sarsr rhinolophidae bat coronavirus strain rf1 in rhinolophus ferrumequinum in the chinese provinces of guangxi and hubei respectively lau et al 2005 li et al 2005 tang et al 2006 the sampling pressure on both rhinolophidae 1148 samples in 12 species  table 2 and vespertilionidae 900 samples in 17 species  table 2 has induced an over representation of these families compared to others lau et al 2005 li et al 2005 tang et al 2006 by contrast hipposideridae 206 samples in 6 species were under-represented in previous studies poon et al 2005 woo et al 2006 the higher northern distribution limit of rhinolophidae versus hipposideridae may partially explain the sampling bias in non-southern chinese provinces fig 1b this bias illustrates the need for testing other sympatric species for betacoronaviruses to study their natural history and emergence process the biogeography and the natural history of the betacoronavirus-b species among which are sarsr-covs remain poorly described however betacoronavirus have been detected in china africa europe and even australia guan et al 2003 lau et al 2005 li et al 2005 mller et al 2007 tong et al 2009 quan et al 2010 drexler et al 2010 fig 1b the biogeographical origin of the ancestors of sarsr-covs from betacoronavirus-b sub-group is therefore far more extended than the epicentre of the human epidemic southern china understanding the biogeography of this group would be essential for assessing the risk for emergence of another sars-cov like agent south-china and its pearl river delta combined various ecological and anthropic factors that have led the sars-cov to emerge but the distribution of the viral clade at the origin of sars-cov is much wider than this region and many locations still remain to be investigated emergence results from a combination of numerous factors environmental changes ecological climatic and agricultural whether they are man-driven or not schrag and wiener 1995 kuiken et al 2003 globalization trade or travel and societal changes land-use demography are among the most reported ones reperant 2010 but others have been highlighted recently like the hosts phylogenetic relationships daszak 2010 streicker et al 2010 the variation of biodiversity keesing et al 2010 and species interactions in ecological communities whether between hosts or between hosts and pathogens cleavel et al 2001 woolhouse and gowtage-sequeria 2005 reperant 2010 consequently the biogeography and host-pathogen relationships of betacoronavirus-b are pivotal to understanding their radiation the diversity of the sarsr-cov has been described by an increasing number of published studies and the number of discovered and sequenced viral taxa has improved the accuracy of the phylogenetic reconstruction of this group in this study we explored the biodiversity and the ecology of coronavirinae enriched the current phylogeny and challenged the biogeography of this clade more particularly we focused on the ecology of the betacoronavirus-b sub-group fig 1a by testing hypotheses on the origination of these viruses not only in rhinolophidae but also in their sister taxa hipposideridae considering that hipposideridae might host a diverse community of coronaviruses comparable to that of rhinolophidae because of their phylogenetic proximity and comparable diversity nunn et al 2004 simmons 2007 it is very probable that the prevalence and diversity of coronaviruses hosted by this family has been underestimated because of biased sampling table 2  lau et al 2005 li et al 2005 tang et al 2006 we hypothesize also that some bat taxa could play a refuge role for betacoronaviruses and therefore constitute a source of infection for other species consistently with the recent application of the theory of island biogeography macarthur and wilson 1967 to emerging pathogens reperant 2010 this study is particularly focused on but not restricted to betacoronavirus in hipposideridae in south-east asia table 1
 from 20062008 samples feces urine and oral swabs were collected from bats at 26 sites in thailand fig 1b and table 1 sampling locations were selected considering land cover and geological data as forests are known to enhance biodiversity harvey et al 2006 trisurat et al 2010 and limestone hills harbour numerous caves the rocky forest-covered hills surrounded by cultivated lowlands considered as potential refuge areas were particularly sought sampling sessions covered an area of approximately 800 km from north to south thailand by 300 km from west to east dates and locations are described in table 1 and fig 1b sites were sometimes sampled several times to confirm the results to screen another population or species of bats or to assess a putative long-lasting infection of a given colony table 1 samples were collected from 25 species of bats and were divided and preserved in two different media i modified minimum essential medium antibiotic supplemented viral transportation medium to preserve entire virus particles integrity and ii rnalater rna preservation medium to limit rna degradation both kept on ice before and immediately after collection prior to liquid nitrogen conservation in the field each sample was immediately aliquoted into four tubes including absolute backup and kept at 80 c before rna extraction traceability was assured by assigning a unique number to each sample handling of animals was conducted in accordance with the american society of mammalogists guidelines for the capture handling and care of mammals gannon and sikes 2007 trapping sessions were performed using harp-traps flip-nets and hand-nets bats were transferred to individual clean cotton bags immediately after being captured and kept in a dark cool and quiet place for one to a few hours immediately after sample collection bats were released where they were trapped particular attention was paid i to avoid disturbance inside the cave and near the colony ii to disinfect material and shoes between sampling sessions and study sites and iii to preserve the surroundings as first encountered qiamp viral rna mini kit qiagen was used for rna extraction following the manufacturers instructions rna was eluted in 60 l rnase-free saline buffer 7 l were immediately used for the reverse transcription reaction and the remaining 53 l were aliquoted and kept at 80 c for subsequent detection assays the amount and quality of the extracted rna was measured using nanodrop and agilent techniques prior to reverse transcription mueller et al 2004 gallagher and desjardins 2006 complement dna synthesis was performed with m-mlv reverse transcriptase bio-active and random hexamer primers random hexamer primers were used at a final ratio of 015 g for 1 g of rna then 5 l of rt products were used in 25 l final volume pcr reaction targeting a 438 nucleotide fragment of the rdrp coding region pcr primers were designed from the rdrp coding region by selecting a highly conserved region nsp12 among all coronavirinae sequences available from online public databases in august 2007 assuming a higher mutation rate for the third codon position and according to the published sequence variations degenerate primers were designed batcov pol 15197 forward primer 5-ggttgggaytayccwaartgtga-3 and batcov pol 15635 reverse primer 5-ccatcrtcmgaharaatcatcata-3 respectively at position 15197 to 15219 and 15635 to 15614 on bat sars-cov rf1 reference sequence dq412042 in order to increase both the sensitivity and the specificity of the detection a third primer were designed and combined with the previous ones in a semi-nested pcr batcov pol nested 15419 forward nested primer 5-gcnaatwstgtntttaacat-3 at the position 15419 to 15438 on the same reference sequence the first pcr produced a fragment of 438 nucleotides and the semi-nested pcr confirmed the detection and enhanced significantly the detection limit of the semi-nested pcr by amplifying a 216 base pairs fragment from the first amplicon contaminations were avoided by observing strict lab procedures carrying out at each step mix pcri pcrii in a uv cabinet and using bleached plastic-ware manipulations included extraction negative controls at the beginning and at the end of each sample series as well as several pcr negative controls per run the sequencing of the 438 nucleotides pcr products was performed in both directions using the external primers fifty microliters of sample preserved in modified minimum essential medium antibiotic supplemented viral transportation medium were inoculated into 12 wells plates where subconfluent cell monolayers were grown madindarby canine kidney mdck vero and vero clone e6 cells were used in these assays mdck were chosen because carnivora are highly suspected to have efficiently contributed to the transmission from bats to humans paguma larvata nyctereutes procyonides melogale moschata guan et al 2003 and several species are susceptible to sars-cov infection martina et al 2003 the vero cell line is known to efficiently replicate sars-cov qinfen et al 2004 cells were cultivated in minimum essential medium supplemented with 120 gml of streptomycin 120 unitsml of penicillin and 10 of ftal calf serum fcs once confluence was nearly reached the supernatant was removed and samples were added on the cell monolayer and left at 20 c on a rocking agitator for 60 min then 2 ml of the same medium 2 fcs were added to each well plates were then incubated at 37 c and daily checked on a phase contrast inverted microscope for cpe occurrence a 304 or 333 nucleotide region was selected within the sequences from both amplicons ha acov r for 304 or hl bcov t respectively the corresponding region from 60 taxa available in databases were added to the matrix used in the phylogenetic reconstructions 1 firstly a dynamic homology approach implemented in poy v412 was used wheeler 1996 janies and wheeler 2002 varn et al 2010 this method did not need any prior alignment because this step was performed during the cladogram diagnosis and therefore established the putative homology statements during the tree reconstruction poy was used under parsimony as the optimality criterion wagner algorithm complemented with the tree bisection reconnection swapping algorithm tbr perturbation injection ratcheting and fuse iterations steps nixon 1999 these combined steps provided a reasonably fast and accurate way to better explore the tree space by escaping from local optima although rdrp is a conserved gene and the matrix included a great number of taxa resampling taxa tests were used to evaluate whether this matrix was subjected to the long branch attraction phenomenon which could constitute a limitation of some phylogenetic reconstructions this limitation could be particularly true in the case of high evolution rate and very limited number of taxa when combined with static homology approach of molecular characters the over-representation of sub-groups by several similar sequences was avoided as it could artificially report changes on branches located between internal nodes leading to the long branch attraction issue 2 secondly a probabilistic approach bayesian implemented in beast drummond and rambaut 2007 was applied to the same data set sequences were previously aligned using sea-view gouy et al 2010 under the muscle algorithm edgar 2004 and resulted in a frank border matrix showing a unique gap of three codons for four sequences bulbul trush munia and asian leopard covs position 33 to 36 then the adequacy of the matrix to 88 substitution models was evaluated using jmodeltest posada 2008 the three codons partition model of evolution was specified under hyu substitution model with a gamma site heterogeneity distribution so that each of the three codon position could follow its own evolution rate yule speciation model showed similar estimates as the constant population size coalescent model thus the yule speciation model was chosen as tree prior the mcmc chain was set to 10000000 states to get an adequate posterior ess value superior to 300 the support of the nodes was evaluated via a bootstrap analysis felsenstein 1985 for the direct optimization method and posterior probabilities we assessed for the bayesian method fig 1 and s1 except for the sequences of hipposideros larvatus betacoronavirus tata hl bcov t and hipposideros armiger alphacoronavirus ratcha ha acov r which were newly identified in this study all other sequences used in phylogenetic reconstructions were downloaded from the national center for biotechnology information database httpwwwncbinlmnihgovnucleotide each genbank sequence identification number is indicated directly on trees fig 1 and s1 in the case of coronavirus phylogeny rooting with one member of the sister group bafinivirus or torovirus the two genus of torovirinae sub-family would have been a good choice to study the relation within the in-group coronavirinae unfortunately the region that we used here was too divergent and hardly comparable to torovirinae sequence however as torovirinae sequence can not be used to root the trees in this case we used the results provided by a published study snijder et al 2003 that used torovirinae as root this study based on an amino acid matrix inferred a coronaviridae phylogeny and verified the monophyly of coronavirus and the basal branching of gammacoronavirus clade according to these conclusions we chose an avian coronavirus taxa to root our trees and therefore study the alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus genera phylogeny an additional taxon from the same clade of the taxa used as root gammacoronavirus  avian coronavirus beaudette was included in the analysis to allow the polarization of the characters ancestral versus apomorphic along the tree a genome comprises ribonucleic acid fragments that can independently be submitted to various selection pressures of different intensity the history of these fragments can be deeply shaped by the function they encode eventually resulting in incongruent phylogenetic signals the only way to fully recover and clearly exploit the phylogenetic signal of a given fragment by comparison to the putative homolog fragment of other taxa is to analyze it independently therefore the combination of several fragments in a same analysis should be carefully thought and documented as mixing the information they provide can produce a blurred signal and therefore can lead to an inaccurate phylogeny here we focused on a fragment of the polymerase sequence only for phylogenetic reconstruction of coronaviruses because i the key function of this protein involved in vertical transmission and consequently in viruses filiation is likely to regulate variation and provide a phylogenetic signal that reflects the filiation and ii its relatively short length genome position and associated transcription characteristics make it unlikely to be a putative recombination site moreover the analysis of this region by the rdp3 package martin et al 2010 did not detect any putative recombination sites during the inference of a species tree the identification of the appropriate vertical transmission of information is one of the classical pitfalls of phylogenetic reconstruction therefore careful attention must be paid in the choice of a genetic fragment that reflects the species phylogeny and not only the gene history a given genetic fragment coding for a positively selected function which appeared in one species may benefit another one by horizontal transfer recombination increasing the fitness of the recombinant virus and its progeny this phenomenon have happened also between viruses that are actually recognized as members of separated families as described for the two independent recombination events that occurred between a torovirus coronaviridae torovirinae a coronavirus and an orthomyxoviridae influenzavirus c snijder et al 1991 these particular events did not involve the rdrp sequence all these reasons lead us to rely on the analysis of this rdrp fragment for the phylogenetic reconstruction of coronavirus
 according to the distribution of both the known mammalian host families the rhinolophidae gray 1825 and its sister family the hipposideridae lydekker 1891 betacoronavirus-b might be widespread over asia and most of the old world moreover the biodiversity of these two mammalian families is surely higher than what has been currently described sj puechmaille unpublished data which in turn induces a potential greater coronavirus diversity than is currently described in discordance to what has been reported to date and based on the phylogenetic proximity of these sister families hipposideridae might harbour an equal or richer diversity of coronaviruses at least of the betacoronavirus genus compared to the rhinolophidae furthermore the fragmentation of the forested habitat produced by human activities such as land use practices and agriculture leads to the isolation of preserved biodiversity spots surrounded by cultivated fields that have the potential to maintain both host and viral populations preserving by this way the footprints of the natural history of coronaviruses in wildlife the ha acov r was detected in bat feces from a unique colony hipposideros
armiger hodgson 1835 among 10 bats tested four were positive 36  study site 4  table 1 the blast 78 identity value indicated that the sequence was related to a bat alphacoronavirus reported to infect rhinolophus

pearsoni in the chinese shandong region in 2005 table 2 and tang et al 2006 for this sequence 30 bases from the 5 side of the pcr products were ambiguous and therefore removed from the analysis because the sequencing with one degenerated primer gave low quality results concerning hl bcov t the sequences were free of ambiguous sites and identical among the molecular isolates amplified from feces collected from 22 specimens of bats from the same colony table 1 the 391 nucleotides long sequences obtained showed that this new virus was related to the sars-cov clade and shared 75 nucleotide identity online blast analysis with the bat sarsr coronavirus rf1 from rhinolophus
ferrumequinum hl bcov t was detected in fecal samples from one colony of hipposideros larvatus hipposideridae lydekker 1891 in one sampling site among 26 in this colony estimated to 250 individuals 311 27 bats tested were positive then eighteen months later 2140 52 this is the first evidence of sarsr-cov long-lasting infection in a bat colony table 1 besides the detection of ha acov-r in one site no other alphacoronavirus was detected from the other study sites hipposideros armiger individuals positive for ha acov-r shared their roost with hipposideros
larvatus individuals which were negative for the detection of ha acov-r similarly besides hl bcov-t detected in one site no other betacoronavirus-b was detected from the other study sites even if they were populated by the same species as the positive site and in two instances cave 3 and 14  table 1 with comparable sample sizes the other species sampled taphozous

aurantia even paraphyletic hipposideridae betacoronaviruses mainly grouped together and rooted the rhinolophidae betacoronaviruses among which is the sars-cov fig 1a and s1 sampling bias could explain the uneven distribution of coronavirus detection among bat families more specifically concerning sarsr-cov in rhinolophidae versus hipposideridae in contrast with other studies the hipposideridae family in our study was the most sampled family with five times more samples than those collected from rhinolophidae only two sampling sites among 28 site 17 for hl bcov-t and site 4 for ha acov-r explored with various sampling intensity gave positive results for some site the low level of sampling might be insufficient to detect any coronavirinae table 1 we cannot exclude that betacoronaviruses are hosted by others hipposiderid bat colonies and could circulate around thailand or south-east asia moreover it is likely that other yet unknown betacoronaviruses circulate in hipposideridae and even in other bat families around south-east asia an appropriate sampling would be able to test these hypotheses chu and collaborators have repeatedly detected alphacoronaviruses in miniopterus miniopteridae colonies from hong kong positive detections in bat colonies were obtained over a period ranging from 3 months in a miniopterus
pusillus colony to 6 months in a miniopterus
magnater colony chu et al 2006 these results suggested that alphacoronaviruses were able to persist through time in bat colonies another study on alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus  sarsr-rh-batcov  infected rhinolophus sinicus bats modulated this conclusion no significant persistence was observed in rhinolophus sinicus bat colonies and the viral clearance was estimated between 2 weeks and 4 months lau et al 2010 moreover the authors reported a significant loss of body weight in bats infected by betacoronavirus sarsr-covs that was not observed in alphacoronavirus infected bats this loss of weight could be the sign of a loss of fitness associated with betacoronavirus infection in rhinolophus sinicus without presuming that it would be a promoting factor or a consequence of betacoronavirus infection even though i betacoronavirus persistence was not observed in rhinolophus
sinicus colonies and ii the loss of body mass correlated with betacoronavirus infection might reduce the fitness of rhinolophus we report here that a betacoronavirus was persisting for 18 months in a hipposideridae bat colony this suggests that a hipposideridae colony might be more tolerant to betacoronavirus than rhinolophidae over a long period of time or that betacoronavirus of rhinolophidae might have acquired virulence factor limiting long-lasting infection in this host further investigations are needed to confirm and describe this suspected difference this betacoronavirus detected so far in hipposideros
larvatus in thaland is restricted to a single cave thus betacoronavirus long-lasting infection in a bat colony might be a rare event although rare long-lasting infection can promote cross-species transmission by the emergence of new properties in viral populations baric et al 1999 despite the coincidence of several promoting factors in study site 17 the long-lasting infection  table 1  the sharing of the same small-sized cave by three bat species and the phylogenetic proximity of the two hipposideros species none of the other species were detected positive for betacoronavirus
hipposideros
armiger and taphozous
longimanus were negative  table 1 interestingly we noted that the taphozous
longimanus negative colony was roosting separately from the hipposideros
larvatus positive cluster whereas the hipposideros
armiger negative colony occupied also another specific area of the cave similarly in site 4 table 1 the hipposideros
armiger colony infected by acov-ha was roosting separately from the other negative species again this typical spatial segregation within a roosting site eg cave limits direct contacts between species and is suspected to account for a behavioral barrier to cross-species transmission in the wild as previously described for lentivirus and felidae troyer et al 2008 vandewoude et al 2010 nevertheless we mentioned these observations here but these mechanisms still remain to be precisely described in the complex relationship between rhinolophoidea and betacoronaviruses by contrast previous studies of asian coronaviruses that focused on the species level suggested that there was no strict association between bat species and alphacoronavirus species chu et al 2006 tang et al 2006 and other studies on betacoronavirus in africa reached similar conclusions quan et al 2010 species-barrier crossing has been reported occasionally for betacoronavirus in asian european and african rhinolophidae or hipposideridae but more frequently in miniopteridae chu et al 2006 tang et al 2006 tong et al 2009 drexler et al 2010 moreover miniopterus species exhibit an aggregative behaviour and mixed species colonies are commonly observed as described in literature benda et al 2003 mixed species roosting inducing direct contact between species and therefore promoting transmission in synergy with viral persistence in a colony and the phylogenetic proximity of the hosts is likely to promote cross species transmission of alphacoronaviruses as a result a non-specific host-virus association for alphacoronavirus in miniopterus follows the same model as what has been described for these bats and their ectoparasites bruyndonckx et al 2009 the apparent higher frequency of cross-species transmission or the absence of strict virus-host association in miniopteridae compared to hipposideridae and rhinolphidae might partially be explained by their different roosting behaviour the two methods of phylogenetic reconstructions employed here supported comparable relationships within coronavirinae fig 1 and s1 the uncertainty associated with some relationships was often similarly reported by each method these phylogenetic issues might be reduced by increasing the size of the analysed fragment that would increase the number of informative characters and therefore provide more information to support nodes adding new taxa would also improve the phylogeny by providing probable currently lacking information within or around groups that are not yet well supported i betacoronavirus sub-groups relationships might be improved by looking for new taxa related to the group hku9bat cov philippine dilim weak posterior probability 059 and bootstrap value 024 are reported for this node ii other sequences from new betacoronavirus or taxa from a new group might help to clarify the relationship between betacoronavirus
alphacoronavirus and putative new groups as discordance is observed between phylogenies and none of the method provide significant support to the nodes that link betacoronavirus and alphacoronavirus posterior probability 069 and bootstrap values 021 006 024 interestingly our study revealed that the betacoronavirus detected in hipposideridae in south-east asia was related to those that currently circulate in africa according to the analysis of a rdrp fragment our analyses strengthen the diversity of betacoronavirus-b clade and extend their broad distribution indeed sars-cov emerged from this betacoronavirus-b clade fig 1a which is present in africa europe asia and even australia quan and collaborators pushed forward the possible occurrence of migration events from africa to asia to explain the basal phylogenetic position of an african betacoronavirus compared to asian rhinolophidae sarsr-cov together with the apparent absence of sarsr-cov in asian hipposideridae quan 2010 with the detection of betacoronavirus in hipposiderids in asia this hypothesis while still possible becomes less necessary to explain phylogenetic and geographic patterns of hipposideridae and rhinolophidae betacoronaviruses the clustering of betacoronavirus-b that correlates with the host phylogeny rather than with virus geolocalization suggests that the phylogenetic relationships between betacoronaviruses-b is mainly driven by the host phylogeny fig 1 and s1 accordingly the phylogenetic relationships of the hl bcov detected here from south-east asia with the sarsr-cov from africa and other betacoronaviruses support the following hypothesis betacoronaviruses-b ancestors meaning sarsr-covs ancestors could have been historically hosted by the common ancestor of the rhinolophidae and hipposideridae and could have later evolved independently in the lineages leading towards rhinolophidae and hipposideridae betacoronaviruses this point of view is supported by the topology of betacoronavirus clade that exhibits the monophyly of rhinolophidae betacoronaviruses despite their broad geographic distribution from africa and central europe to south-east asia and northern australia  fig 1 and shows the close relationship of hipposideridae betacoronaviruses nevertheless it is unlikely that putative host switching between rhinolophidae and hipposideridae betacoronaviruses ancestors eventually associated with ancient migration events would still be detectable more investigations are necessary to address these points and test corresponding hypotheses as well new investigations would be necessary to confirm this suggested predominant influence of the host phylogeny on betacoronavirus-b clustering and whether other lineage would exist in hipposideridae as suggested by the report of a betacoronavirus from australia c smith pers com  fig 1 the position of the hipposideridae betacoronavirus from australia basal to the rhinolophidae betacoronaviruses suggests the existence of an intermediary subgroup fig 1 and s1 between hipposideridae and rhinolophidae betacoronaviruses that survived within a rare endemic australian bat species the phylogenetic status of this host rhinonicteris
aurantia is not well defined but this species is described as intermediary between hipposideridae and rhinolophidae while considered an hipposideridae hand and kirsch 1998 simmons 2007 armstrong 2006 armstrong com pers albeit this putative intermediary betacoronavirus group count a unique member to date and its associated posterior probability is weak its phylogenetic position correlates with that of its host therefore we are looking forward new investigations that would address these elements and screen betacoronaviruses in other hipposideridae and rhinolophidae the ecological niche of these bats and their behaviour provide them with frequent opportunities to spread viral variants among other nocturnal mammals such as other chiroptera or carnivora viverridae civet family song et al 2005 guan et al 2003 gonzalez et al 2008 many factors have been suggested to explain the occurrence of emerging viruses in bats such as diversity in term of species and ecology ability to fly immunology physiology seasonal migration and roosting behaviour dobson 2005 kunz and fenton 2005 calisher et al 2006 another stated that population genetic structure correlates with viral richness turmelle and olival 2009 in the case of betacoronavirus the role of i the fragmented biotope observed today the thai forest biotope has drastically reduced over the past decades leading to the formation of species refuge areas promoting species interactions harvey et al 2006 trisurat et al 2010 and ii the segregation behaviour and the mobility patterns of bats metapopulations migrations should be investigated for their impact on the mosaic pattern of betacoronavirus this study suggests that hipposideridae have been underestimated in the study of coronaviruses in the wild both an alphacoronavirus and a betacoronavirus more precisely the sub-group b that includes sars-cov were detected in hipposideridae in south-east asia thailand in contrast to what is reported for rhinolophidae hipposideridae are able to host betacoronavirus close to sars-cov over long periods of time suggesting that they could be a source of virus for other species under specific circumstances moreover the phylogeny of the rdrp when compared to the biogeography suggests that these two bat families may share an ancient relationship with independent lineage of betacoronavirus consequently and by contrast to what have been generally reported for coronaviruses we suggest that the host phylogeny globally drive the pathogen clustering in the particular relationship between betacoronavirus and rhinolophoidea as for other emerging viruses interactions between wildlife refuges whether considered in spatial or organic dimensions and human populations likely enhanced by fragmentation changes cultural behaviour and secular

tassoni pamela priori dino scaravelli gianpiero zamperin paola de benedictis   since the isolation of hendra virus from pteropid bats in 2000 halpin et al 2000 bats have been implicated in the emergence of a number of other human infectious diseases most notably nipah severe acute respiratory syndrome sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers and ebola calisher et al 2006 moratelli and calisher 2015 in turn the notion that these viral diseases likely have their ultimate ancestry in bats triggered a major increase in the sampling of bat viruses leading to the progressive uncovering of a diverse bat virome and further fueling the idea that these animals are major reservoirs of emerging pathogens moratelli and calisher 2015 young and olival 2016 successful cross-species transmission and emergence depends on a variety of biological ecological and epidemiological factors although rna viruses commonly jump species boundaries in part reflecting their ability to rapidly generate important adaptive variation geoghegan et al 2017 holmes 2009 woolhouse and gowtage-sequeria 2005 coronaviruses covs seem to exhibit a strong zoonotic potential and demonstrated by the emergence sars-cov and mers-cov in humans in 2002 and 2012 respectively graham et al 2013 coronaviruses are single-strand rna viruses of the order nidovirales that are classified in four genera alpha- beta- gamma and deltacoronavirus among these gamma and delta covs are largely associated with avian hosts while alpha and beta covs include several pathogens of humans and domestic animals and whose emergence is likely associated with cross-species transmission events drexler et al 2014 both sars-cov and mers-cov belong to the genus betacoronavirus and are associated with severe lower respiratory tract infection characterized by mortality rates of 10 and 35 respectively hu et al 2015 the sars pandemic was promptly controlled through an unprecedented global containment effort and the virus has not been reported in humans since may 2004 graham et al 2013 despite this rapid eradication sars-cov caused almost 800 deaths in 27 countries with sustained outbreaks in 18 countries on three continents who there is increasing evidence that rhinolophid bats act as natural reservoirs for sars-related covs with direct spill-over to non-flying mammals for example like the sars coronavirus some bat covs are able to utilize the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a cell receptor ge et al 2014 menachery et al 2016 yang et al 2016 zeng et al 2016 conversely the role of bats in the epidemiology of mers-cov is less well understood as the human viruses are clearly mostly related to those viruses found in dromedary camels sabir et al 2016 indeed although related viruses have been found in bats these are divergent in their spike sequences and seem to be inefficient in the use of human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 as cell a receptor anthony et al 2017a reusken et al 2016 yang et al 2014 the mers epidemic is ongoing in the middle east and travel-associated cases have been reported in 27 countries worldwide who 2017 finally alphacoronavirus 229e and nl63 which cause a mild influenza-like syndrome in humans share a common ancestor with viruses sampled from the bat genus hipposideros and triaenops respectively corman et al 2015 corman et al 2016 tao et al 2017 bats are known to harbor high levels of cov diversity with impressive geographical range and prevalence in almost every species investigated again supporting the idea that they have played a major role in cov evolution anthony et al 2017b drexler et al 2014 in addition bat covs are phylogenetically interspersed with those associated with other mammals including humans and domestic species compatible with the idea that bats are an important genetic reservoir tao et al 2017 woo et al 2012 the long-term evolutionary interactions between bats and coronaviruses is also supported by phylogenetic evidence that covs exhibit some species- and genus-specific tropism cui et al 2007 vijaykrishna et al 2007 and that phylogenetically related viruses are found in related bat species independent of sampling location in contrast that covs are not always shared among bat species that co-roost suggests that there are some barriers to cross-species transmission anthony et al 2013 corman et al 2013 cui et al 2007 drexler et al 2010 smith et al 2016 tang et al 2006 because of the topological similarity between the phylogenetic trees of covs and their mammalian hosts it has been suggested that the diversity of covs largely reflects the long-term co-divergence between bats and covs cui et al 2007 however recent studies on specific bat taxa from particular locations suggests that the role of virus-host co-divergence in the evolutionary history of covs may have been overestimated relative to other events including host-jumping anthony et al 2017b lin et al 2017 tao et al 2017 indeed as well as strict virus-host co-divergence topological congruence could also arise from preferential host switching in which viruses most often successfully jump from closely related hosts de vienne et al 2013 the analysis of the long-term evolutionary history of bat covs is also complicated by frequent multiple substitution at deep evolutionary distances that prevents the accurate estimation of divergence times wertheim et al 2013 to obtain a more complete picture of the evolutionary history of alpha and beta coronaviruses in their natural hosts which is essential for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of virus emergence we performed a statistical analysis of co-phylogenetic relationships on a large data set of mammalian covs not only did this suggest that cross-species transmission has played a major role in the evolution of alpha and beta covs in bats but also that differences in bat host ecology biology and geographical range have a strong impact on coronavirus evolution we retrieved all bat cov sequences representing the partial orf1b that encodes the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp available on genbank as of march 2017 these were combined with 109 cov sequences from other mammals two gamma covs were used to root the phylogeny only sequences 350 bp in length and associated with a bat genus for which at least two sequences were available were retained unique sequences associated with a particular species were included but solely used for analyses based on the host genus similarly we retrieved cov sequences encoding the spike s protein including those from bats and 46 cov sequences sampled from other mammals for each cov sequence we recorded the collection date location and host genus and species based on information available in genbank andor in the associated literature cov sequences for which the sampling location andor host genus were unavailable were discarded sampling locations were retrieved at the country level and were categorized according to their large-scale geographic area of sampling europe africa north america latin america central and south america asia south east asia and australia the most comprehensive cov data set encoding the rdrp denoted rdrpcov1 comprised 541 cov sequences from bats plus 111 sequences from other mammalian genera including three randomly chosen representatives of known monophyletic groups of covs as well as all unclassified mammalian sequences this data set was used for the phylogenetic and host clustering analyses see below cov sequences encoding the spike protein comprised a data set denoted spikecov which included 199 sequences from bats plus 46 cov sequences from other mammals we also constructed sub-sampled data sets from the comprehensive rdrpcov1 data set based on results from the genus-specific clustering see below to minimize errors associated with the non-independence of data specifically reduced data sets cov n  58 cov n  34 and cov n  24 included the longest sequence for each genus-specific cluster these reduced data sets were used in the co-phylogenetic analysis see below to help assess the validity of our results we constructed a second group of data sets data sets2 which only included sequences from bat hosts whose species was confirmed genetically and hence more confidently thereby removing any error due to host misclassification these data sets were termed rdrpcov2 n  42 sequences which was used for phylogenetic and host clustering analyses and cov2 n  11 cov2 n  8 cov2 n  3 and host2 used in the co-phylogenetic analysis see below host sequences targeting the full mitochondrial cytochrome b cytb gene were also retrieved from genbank and visually inspected to ensure that they agreed with previously published bat phylogenies the host data set denoted host included one cytb gene sequence for each genus associated with the cov data set all sequences were aligned with mafft utilizing the l-ins-i routine katoh et al 2002 manually adjusted longer sequences were then trimmed to 935 bp rdrp and 1440 bp spike protein using mega6 tamura et al 2013 sequence alignments utilized nucleotide sequences for the host cov cov and cov data sets and all the data sets2 amino acid sequences for the spikecov data set and both nucleotide and amino acid sequences for the comprehensive data set rdrpcov1 best-fit models of nucleotide and amino acid substitution for each data set were determined using mega6 tamura et al 2013 pairwise genetic distances among nucleotide and amino acid sequences were computed using the maximum composite likelihood method in mega6 maximum likelihood nucleotide phylogenetic trees were inferred using phyml version 30 employing the gtr  4 substitution model a heuristic spr branch-swapping algorithm and 1000 bootstrap replicates dereeper et al 2008 similarly amino acid ml trees were estimated for data sets rdrpcov1 and spikecov using raxml version 8117 assuming the lg  4 and the lg  4  i models of amino acid substitution respectively and 1000 bootstrap replicates topological congruence between the rdrp and spike-based amino acid trees was determined based on the phylogenies of rdrp and spike sequences derived from the same host taxa to implement the phylogeny trait methods which require a posterior distribution of phylogenetic trees see below we inferred non-clock bayesian trees for data set rdrpcov1 using mrbayes v324 ronquist and huelsenbeck 2003 and assuming the gtr  4 nucleotide substitution model this analysis was run for 70 million generations 25 discarded as burn-in and sampled every 500 generations the resultant tree was then edited using itol letunic and bork 2016 finally the degree of temporal signal ie clock-like structure in these cov data was explored by plotting root-to-tip genetic distances on the ml trees against year of sampling using the method implemented in tempest rambaut et al 2016 we first investigated whether coronaviruses showed significant clustering by bat host genusspecies or sampling location using the association index ai parsimony score ps and maximum monophyletic clade mc phylogeny-trait statistics available in the bats package parker et al 2008 this analysis compared the posterior distribution of trees for data set rdrpcov1 described above to a null distribution of 100 trait-randomized trees with bat large-scale geographic area and country of sampling bat genus and bat species assigned as the character states of interest the extent of clustering associated with the characters host genus and host species was investigated also in the reduced data set rdrpcov2 in addition we used the phylogenetic tree to identify bat rdrp genus-specific clusters of covs defined as a minimum of two monophyletic rdrp sequences associated with the same bat genus supported by bayesian posterior probabilities 090 and differing no 48 and 51 at the amino acid level for the genera alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus respectively see below the taxonomy of cov clusters was determined based on pairwise amino acid distances calculated using 816 bp of the rdrp when available and reflecting the rdrp group units rgu defined previously for covs drexler et al 2014 following these criteria we assigned distinctive rgus to sequences differing by at least 48 and 51 at the amino acid level for the genera alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus respectively drexler et al 2014 to assess the extent of virus-host co-divergence in the data we reconciled the cov and host phylogenies using jane 40 conow et al 2010 which infers the nature and frequency of different evolutionary scenarios by finding the reconciliation with the lowest total cost accordingly we assigned event costs  1 for virus lineage duplication host shift and virus loss or failure to diverge following host speciation and costs of both 0 and 1 for co-divergence jane was run for 45 generations g with a set size of 23 s this analysis used the tree topologies based on rdrp and cytb for coronaviruses and their hosts respectively in addition the congruence between the phylogeny of bat genera and their cov clusters was depicted graphically using the tanglegram function of the decipher package wright 2016 from the r environment to exclude the impact of possible host misclassification this analysis was also run for datasets2 in which hosts are assigned genetically sequences included within bat rdrp genus-specific clusters of covs but associated with different host genera were considered as likely cross-species transmission events for each such event we determined whether cross-species transmission was associated with the following variables host taxonomy genus family and superfamily of the donor and recipient hosts cov lineage sampling location sampling year sampling location and sampling year and location of the most closely related sequence to tentatively determine whether there may have been a sustained chain of cov transmission in the new host species as opposed to transient spill-overs we assessed whether sequences associated with cross-species transmission events were significantly divergent from the donor cluster accordingly for each putative cross-species transmission event we compared the median nucleotide distance among sequences from the donor host with the median nucleotide distances between the donor sequences and those from the novel ie recipient host using a one-tailed wilcoxon rank sum test genetic distances were again calculated using mega6 tamura et al 2013 as described above although this analysis was based on the rdrp spike protein sequences were also used when available the spearman coefficient rs was used to determine the strength of the correlation between cov diversity expressed as number of detected cov clusters and the species richness or geographical range of cov samples for each host genus to test the influence of sampling effort on cov diversity the same correlation coefficient was determined between cov diversity and the number of genbank submissions and the total number of sequences per genus absolute values were arbitrarily interpreted as follows 000039 weak correlation 040059 moderate correlation 060079 strong correlation and 08010 very strong correlation coefficients were considered significant for p-value  005 a total of 650 cov rdrp sequences were analyzed in this study among these 541 were from bats 307 alphacoronavirus and 234 betacoronavirus representing most of the cov diversity currently described in bats and 111 from other mammalian species 57 alphacoronavirus 50 betacoronavirus and two gammacoronavirus with the latter used as outgroups data set rdrpcov1 sequence lengths generally ranged from 350 bp to 816 bp n  352 although a number n  298 were longer and trimmed to 935 bp prior to analysis table 1
 similarly we analyzed 245 spike protein sequences including 199 sequences from bats and 46 from other mammals sequence lengths ranged from 678 bp including the receptor-binding domain rbd and 4000 bp corresponding to the full length sequence for 94 bat covs both the rdrp and the spike protein sequences were available table 1 although bat sequences obtained were identified worldwide most came from asia n  252 in five countries africa n  170 in six countries and europe n  116 in nine countries fig 1
 bat-derived cov sequences either rdrp or spike were sampled from 82 different species belonging to 25 genera table 1 importantly information on the criteria used for the classification of bat species in the data set was often lacking 695 in some cases classification was based on morphology 554 and to a lesser extent on genetic identification 171 of note 36 of the bats under study representing 12 genera are considered cryptic species as they are morphologically indistinguishable from other sympatric species table s1 in 18 cases the host classification provided with the cov sequence identified the host genus only while in one case h cafferruber the exact species was not defined pfefferle et al 2009 therefore to help assess the robustness of our results we performed a second analysis on 42 sequences for which the bat host species was confirmed genetically data set rdrpcov2 among which 26 were alphacoronavirus and 16 were betacoronavirus phylogenetic analyses revealed a structuring of bat coronavirus diversity dependent on both their host taxa and the large-scale geographic area of sampling fig 2 with the exception of cov sequences associated with alphacoronavirus 1 mink coronavirus 1 human coronavirus hku1 and betacoronavirus 1 all other covs from non-flying mammals formed clades that either exhibited sister relationships with bat-associated viruses or were nested within them fig 2 regression analyses revealed no correlation between sampling times and root-to-tip genetic distances for both the rdrp and spike proteins r2  00078 and 00075 for the rdrpcov1 and spikecov data sets respectively thereby precluding any molecular clock dating fig s1a b 
phylogeny-trait analyses based on rdrp sequences using the bats program provided statistical support p  001 for the clustering of covs in all the traits investigated the percentage of individual traits significantly ie 005 supporting cov clustering was 100 for large-scale geographic area of sampling 8846 for bat genus 774 for country of sampling and 754 for bat species table s2 individual traits represented by unique sequences eg single countries always gave non-significant results and were excluded from the overall percentages given above a similar trend was confirmed for sequences associated with genetically defined host species data set rdrpcov2 for which clustering was significant in 80 of host genera and 50 of host species table s3 our phylogenetic analyses identified 44 rdrp bat genus-specific clusters 28 in the alpha covs denoted c1-c28 and 16 in the beta covs denoted c29-c44 fig 2 as expected sequences from nl63 cov 229e and sars cov from other mammalian hosts fell within bat-associated clusters between c26 and c27 within c26 and within c36 and associated with bats belonging to the genera trianops hipposideros and rhinolophus respectively fig 2 conversely it was not possible to identify species-specific or geographically structured clusters across all bat genera this was particularly evident for clusters of covs found in the bat genera miniopterus rhinolophus and hipposideros associated with different host species sampled from different geographical macro-areas fig 2 that these results were not due to errors in host classification was confirmed by phylogenetic analyses of data set rdrpcov2 which also revealed a clustering by host genus rather than host species fig s2 a single cov phylogenetic cluster was associated with most bat genera however two or three clusters were observed in artibeus rousettus hipposideros triaenops rhinolophus eptesicus and miniopterus and more than three clusters were present in myotis and pipistrellus the bat genera pipistrellus eptesicus rhinolophus and hipposideros were associated with both alpha and beta covs while all genera of fruit bats the pteropodidae were found to only harbor beta-covs assigned to lineage d table 1 fig 2 the number of host species included within genus-specific clusters varied between one and 10 with the most observed in rhinolphus n  10 miniopterus n  7 and hipposideros n  4 table 2
 a strong correlation was observed between the number of rdrp specific clusters described for each bat genus and either its species richness rs  069 p  00001 or geographic distribution rs  067 p  00002 however the correlations between cov diversity and the number of genbank submissions and the total number of cov sequences within each bat genus were also very strong rs  064 p  00006 rs  073 p  00001 hence it is possible that these sampling biases have had a strong impact on the results the majority of genus-specific clusters 3244 originated from a single large-scale geographic area of the remaining 1244 clusters showing a broader geographical spread 11 were identified in two or three geographic areas and one in more than three geographic areas table 2 fig 2 of note is the frequent clustering of coronaviruses from asia and south-east asia china and thailand associated with miniopterus c10-11 hipposideros c9 c27 and schotophilus c16 table 2 the availability of rdrp sequences 816 bp enabled the classification of 2744 genus-specific clusters using the rdrp group units rgu previously defined for covs drexler et al 2010 c2-c5 c7-c11 c15-c16 c18 c20 c25-c28 c30 c33 c35-c40 c43-c44 table 3
 the taxonomy of all other clusters was not resolved due to short fragment lengths in all but two cases the pairwise amino acid distance between sequences 816 bp was consistent with the association between rdrp genus-specific clusters identified in this study and distinct rgus the exceptions c18 and c20 both associated with myotis bats and c43 and c44 associated with pipistrellus and eptesicus respectively shared 96 similarity at the amino acid level in 816 bp of rdrp and hence should be classified as a single rgu table 3 mean nucleotide divergence between sequences from eptesicus and pipistrellus was 393 se  011 compared to only 16 se  0005 mean divergence within sequences from pipistrellus bats only interestingly our analyses identified these rdrp genus-specific clusters as belonging to the same putative species of mers-cov with amino acid identities of 982 and 963 respectively table 3 spike protein sequences were available for 1744 rdrp genus-specific clusters c2 c7 c9-c11 c16 c18 c25 c28 c30 c33 c35-c40 all of which were taxonomically resolved based on rgu classification table 3 mean amino acid divergence in spike sequences from covs included within the same rgu ranged from 046 c39 to 4829 c37 table 3 tree topologies based on the spike protein sequences were largely consistent with rdrp clustering detected in this study fig s3 however there were discordant tree topologies between the rdrp and spike proteins for the two clusters associated with miniopterus bats which did not cluster together in the latter with mean amino acid divergence of 424 se  001 in the spike protein compared to only 68 0013 for the rdrp fig s3 fig 2 table 3 furthermore three sequences from miniopterus fuliginosus accession numbers kj473800 kj473799 kj473797 belonging to rdrp genus-specific cluster c10 fell into spike protein cluster c11 fig s3 a similar pattern was observed for c30 associated with rousettus bats these fell within cluster 33 on the rdrp tree but were distinct from it in the spike protein tree fig s3 fig 2 finally our analyses confirmed a different evolutionary history for the spike protein of human coronavirus nl63 this grouped with covs from hipposideros bats c28 and human coronavirus 229e rather than being nested within sequences from bats of the genus trienops rdrp genus-specific cluster c26 and c27 as seen in the rdrp phylogenies fig s3 fig 2 despite the likely antiquity of covs in bats genus-specific clusters showed a low level of phylogenetic congruence in respect to their hosts fig s4 indeed a full reconciliation analysis using jane suggested that the evolutionary history of covs was best explained by more frequent cross-species transmission than co-divergence with the latter accounting for 0183 of all the events observed table 4 for example across the covs as a whole there were 011 co-divergence events compared to 3847 host-shift events importantly this result was independent of the cost associated with co-divergence assigned as either equal or lower than that associated with cross-species transmission and was the same when the alpha and beta covs were analyzed independently such that there was no difference in the frequency of cross-species transmission between these viral groups equivalent results were obtained using the genetically confirmed hosts in data sets2 table s4 
a total of 27 cov sequences were identified as likely cross-species transmission events based on rdrp topology as they were nested within clusters associated with a different host genus with strong bootstrap support fig 2 these cross-species transmission events involved 20 different combinations of recipient and donor hosts 13 recipient and eight donor genera respectively among which the association between cynopterus and hipposideros was bi-directional in five cases cross-species transmission events involved more than one highly similar cov from the same recipient bat species up to six cross-species transmissions were recorded for a single donor host with the highest frequency in clusters associated with the genera miniopterus hipposideros and rhinolophus table 5
 in 1727 cases recipient and donor hosts belonged to different bat superfamilies notably the bats involved in cross-species transmission were largely sampled from the same geographic location with a sharing of roosts between host species documented in only 627 cases and possible in 1327 table 5 in only two cases did cross-species transmission involve related hosts from different geographical areas namely phyllostomidae bats of the genera carollia and artibeus sampled in costa rica and panama respectively and bats of the genera miniopterus and eptesicus from china and usa both belonging to the superfamily vespertilionoidea unfortunately the host classification was not confirmed genetically for any of these events so that more accurate analyses could not be performed sequences identified as likely cross-species transmissions were generally located at tree tips and were not significantly divergent from those of their putative donor cluster suggesting that they most likely represent recent host jumps p 005 in 2127 cases table 5 among sequences exhibiting divergence from the donor cluster 46 were sampled from related hosts belonging at least to the same superfamily spike sequences were available for 327 covs identified as cross-species transmission events involving jumps from the bat genera hipposideros to rousettus and from rhinolophus to chaerepon interestingly spike protein sequences from rousettus bats were significantly divergent from hipposideros covs and constituted a sister group to those from this genus table 5 although this is compatible with host adaptation this clearly needs to be investigated in greater detail alpha and beta coronaviruses exhibit both substantial genetic diversity and a wide geographical range in bats such that these mammals are important virus hosts anthony et al 2017b drexler et al 2014 our data indicate that bats are indeed associated with several distinct clusters of alpha and beta covs and that most covs from non-flying mammals also fell within these clusters on phylogenetic trees however we also noted the existence of monophyletic groups of covs associated with mammalian species other than bats such as alphacoronavirus 1 and betacoronavirus 1 interestingly we revealed a positive association between cov diversity and the species richness and geographical distribution of samples from each bat genus with more virus clusters in genera for which more species have been sampled across a wide geographic area such as myotis pipistrellus rhinolophus and hipposideros this suggests that the high phylogenetic diversity of covs likely reflects the large number of different bat species and their global distribution fenton and simmons 2015 woo et al 2012 and supports the central role for these animals in cov evolution furthermore we detected a strong impact of sampling effort on cov diversity suggesting that this still likely underestimated in bats as a whole anthony et al 2017b our data also provide evidence for the close phylogenetic relationship of coronaviruses from hosts of the same genus with distinct putative cov species tending to be associated with different bat genera indeed single rgus which are considered indicative of distinctive cov species were associated with more than one bat species particularly in those bats that live sympatrically or that belong to the same genus similarly despite the evidence for geographical structuring covs belonging to the same rgus were also described in different locations as previously described leopardi et al 2016 hence as a general rule covs exhibit genus-specificity rather than species-specificity conversely cov clusters associated with bat genera pipistrellus and eptesicus showed low divergence at the amino acid level based on the 816 bp fragment suggesting their classification within the same cov putative species interestingly these clusters were also highly similar to mers-cov such that they may be included within a single cov species although more data are needed to confirm this hypothesis it was notable that co-specific miniopterus rousettus pipistrellus rhinolophus and hipposideros bats sampled from the same location harbor more than one cov cluster which will increase the likelihood of virus recombination parrish et al 2008 this hypothesis is supported by our finding of discordant topologies between trees estimated using the rdrp and the spike protein for covs detected in rousettus and miniopterus bats and thereby supporting previous results huang et al 2016 wu et al 2015 in this context it is noteworthy that bats from the genera pipistrellus rhinolophus and hipposideros are also those that show the highest identity with three human coronaviruses namely mers cov sars cov and hcov 229e respectively a key observation of our study was the frequency with which cross-species transmission has occurred in the evolution history of coronaviruses reflected in the general incongruence between the virus and host phylogenies the lack of species-specificity and the presence of phylogenetically divergent viruses in some bat genera suggesting multiple introductions of covs cui et al 2007 this hypothesis is consistent with the finding of highly related covs in different species non-flying mammals for example feline coronavirus fcov and canine coronavirus ccov define two sister clades within the alphacoronavirus 1 species and are likely a result of recent interspecies jumping woo et al 2009 despite the frequency of cross-species transmission it was striking that only one recent host-jump between different bat genera was confirmed in our data set this involved two distinct clusters of covs from closely related vespertilionid bats from the genera pipistrellus and eptesicus likely associated with the same cov species the availability of spike sequences also allowed us to identify a clear diversification of covs in bats of the genus rousettus following their jump from a donor cluster associated with the co-roosting bat genus hipposideros conversely however our data suggest that cross-species transmissions between distantly related hosts often result in transient spill-over infections reflected as an absence of daughter lineages in phylogenetic trees although this may also reflect a lack of appropriate sampling the multiple introductions of covs in rhinopomatidae bats suggests that cross-species transmission events may be favored by their ecology of sharing roosts with different species including myotis miniopterus and rousettus bats however it is important to note that we also detected cross-species transmission events between species for which no interaction is suspected based on their ecologies such as the fruit bats eidolon helvum that mainly roost in big colonies in trees and the cave dwelling insectivorous bat miniopterus natalensis fenton and simmons 2015 although this suggests that we have not sampled the key intermediate species we necessarily cannot exclude cross-contamination or incorrect classification of hosts as confounding factor in these cases overall our results confirm the long-term evolution of mammalian coronaviruses within bats seemingly representing a complex interplay between co-divergence and cross-species transmission a pattern that is seeming common among rna viruses geoghegan et al 2017 in addition we found evidence that likelihood cross-species transmission increased with sympatry despite its large-scale this study has several limitations mostly related to the quality of the available data of particular note is the short length of most fragments of coronaviruses used for analyses with less than half compressing the 816 bp necessary for rgu classification drexler et al 2010 and which obviously limit phylogenetic resolution similarly the uncertain classification of certain host species should not be underestimated due to variable species assignments as well as the cryptic nature of several bat species that cannot be readily identified based on obvious morphological features but whose correct assignation often require the use of genetic or echolocation studies kingston et al 2001 table s1 indeed the hosts included in our database represent only about 20 of the bat species 6 of the bat genera described worldwide studies of cov diversity have mainly been performed in china and europe while important hot spots for bat biodiversity richardson 2002 such as south east asia and latin america are under-represented furthermore sequences collected from different areas are generally weakly representative for their specific continent with for example most african samples being collected from ghana and kenya fig 1 while the reliability of our conclusions was confirmed by analyses performed on a much smaller data set with more accurate host assignments we encourage a more comprehensive sampling the collection of longer cov sequences and the accurate genetic attribution of the host species all of which provide the information needed to better reveal the evolution and ecology of coronaviruses in bats the following are the supplementary data related to this article




  sarscov2 structural diversity phylogeny and potential animal host identification of spike glycoprotein siarhei dabravolski alexander yury kavalionak kazimirovich   the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 is associated with the current pandemic outbreak of covid19 the virus emerged in wuhan china and it can be transmitted from person to person
1
 the patients visited a local seafood market selling various live animals from where this zoonotic disease was suspected to have spread
2
 till date there have been 1 812 734 confirmed cases and 113 675 deaths across 202 countries according to who httpswwwwhoint successful drug and vaccine development require a deep understanding of the virus phylogeny evolutionary origin and the source of zoonotic transmission also it should be a toppriority task for researchers to prevent outbreaks of this type in the future substantial efforts have been made to identify the animal source of sarscov2 several recent studies have revealed the origin of sarscov2 from bats
3
 however some other intermediate hosts were also suggested such as snake
4
 pangolin
5
 or some mammals and birds
6

 the genome of sarscov2 contains two open reading frames orfs orf1 and orf2 encoding two polyproteins which are responsible for viral genome maintenance after cleavage there is also a set of socalled structural proteins such as spike glycoproteins an envelope protein membrane proteins and the nucleocapsid one of the structural proteins the spike surface glycoprotein spike glycoprotein is one of the primary therapeutic targets this protein plays an important role in binding to receptors on the host cell fusion of the host and viral membranes and as a target for antibodies reviewed in fung and liu
7
 in this study we examined 137 genomes to establish the relationship between spike glycoproteins from different coronaviruses this was done with a combination of the phylogenetic tree analysis reconstructed from the translated sequences and a comparison of the structural models the phylogenetic study has confirmed close relatedness of sarscov2 to bats coronaviruses in contrast a comparison of the structural models has found yak bos grunniens betacoronavirus as the closest match recently released complete genome sequences were downloaded for the analysis from ncbi listed in table s1 furthermore spike glycoprotein orfs nucleotide and protein sequences were retrieved from ncbi orffinder httpswwwncbinlmnihgovorffinder and conserved domains were checked with cdsearch ncbi respectively complete translated orfs were used for multiple sequence alignments performed using muscle the tests of substitution models and phylogenetic analysis were carried out using the mega x software
8
 the neighborjoining method and jtt substitution models were selected assuming an estimated proportion of invariant sites and 4gammadistributed rate categories to account for rate heterogeneity across sites the gamma shape parameter was estimated directly from the data reliability for the internal branch was assessed using the bootstrapping method 1000 bootstrap replicates two spike glycoproteins from the gammacoronaviruses were used as an outgroup structural models of the spike glycoproteins table s1 marked with  were built using swissmodel
9
 predicted structures were refined with an online tool 3drefine httpsysbiornetmissouriedu3drefine and verified using qmean httpsswissmodelexpasyorgqmean ipba web server was used for pdb structure alignment httpswwwdsimbinsermfrdsimbtoolsipbaindexphp the quality of the structure alignments was evaluated using root mean square deviation and normalized score chimera software
10
 was used for structure visualization altogether 137 genomes were analyzed our primary focus was on the severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus 92 genomes released from 2019 till 25 march 2020 ncbi the middle east respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus genomes n  18 further shortened to mers were used to check the reliability of our in silico approaches a set of different coronaviruses taxonomical origin hosts and release date was used in our analyses table s1 four conserved domains were identified spike glycoprotein nterminal domain pfam16451 spike receptorbinding domain pfam09408 coronavirus s1 glycoprotein pfam01600 and coronavirus s2 glycoprotein pfam01601 listed from nterminal to cterminal direction figure s1 surprisingly none of the analyzed genomes exhibited such domain architecture as is known for example for the viruses studied earlier top line in figures s1 and s2 as a common feature we noticed that alphacoronaviruses and gammacoronaviruses share domain architecture represented by two domains coronavirus s1 glycoprotein along with coronavirus s2 glycoprotein in contrast all analyzed betacoronaviruses have a full or partial spike receptorbinding domain interestingly only betacoronaviruses with humans and yaks as hosts have spike glycoprotein nterminal domain which is absent in all other analyzed hosts to gain insight into the phylogenetic relationships between spike glycoproteins from alphacoronaviruses betacoronaviruses and gammacoronaviruses of different hosts a robust phylogenetic tree after multiple alignments of the 137 extracted sequences figure s3 was generated the tree was rooted in the outgroup gammacoronaviruses as expected all sarscov2 spike glycoproteins with humans as a host were almost identical and formed separate clusters similarly all the mers with humans as a host were nearly identical and clustered together with camels mers isolates from kenya with closely related mers isolates from the egyptian camel two betacoronavirus isolates from bats hku5 and hku4related mn6115201 pipistrellus abramus and mn6115191 tylonycteris pachypus respectively were located between sarscov2 and mers clusters two other branches formed two welldistinguished clusters for alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses isolates alphacoronaviruses have hostdependent subclusters humans and bats in contrast other betacoronaviruses hku1 and oc43 are closely related to the yak isolate furthermore to better understand the relationships between spike glycoproteins on the structural level we built protein models with homologybased server swissmodel
9
 table s1 marked with  obtained models were evaluated and verified table s2 in the next step ipba web server with a local backbone conformation comparison similarity algorithm was used to match human hostdelivered sarscov2 and mers spike glycoproteins to models delivered from other coronaviruses and hosts table 1 mers betacoronavirus was used as a control data set as it is wellstudied in both hosts human and camel and as their close genetic relationship is wellcharacterized
11
 as expected human hostdeliveredmers showed the highest similarity to that from camels sarscov2s spike glycoprotein on the contrary has shown the highest similarity to the yakdelivered betacoronavirus table 1 and figure 1b proper domain classification and identification remain to be a matter of discussion earlier papers refer to the spike glycoprotein as cleaved in the middle and forming s1 and s2 domains further subdividing them into nterminal and cterminal domains in each
12
 based on the current conserved domain database cdd output we concluded that nterminal s1 corresponds to the spike glycoprotein nterminal domain pfam16451 cterminal s1 corresponds to the spike receptorbinding domain pfam09408 and s2 domain contains coronavirus s1 glycoprotein pfam01600 and coronavirus s2 glycoprotein pfam01601 as subdomains figure s1 canonical spike glycoprotein contains four domains each of which plays a specific function it is known that both spike glycoprotein nterminal domain pfam16451 and spike receptorbinding domain pfam09408 participate in specific receptor binding the nterminal domain binds to carcinoembryonic antigenrelated cell adhesion molecule 1 ceacam1 in mouse hepatitis coronavirus and binds sugar in porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus
13
 spike receptorbinding domain binds to the aminopeptidase n or angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 in coronaviruses
14
 an interplay between coronavirus s1 glycoprotein pfam01600 and coronavirus s2 glycoprotein pfam01601 is required for the attachment of spike to susceptible tissues and subsequent fusion
15

 the phylogenetic data reported above show that the new humandelivered sarscov2 spike glycoproteins cluster with two betacoronaviruses hku4 and hku5related delivered from the hosts t pachypus and p abramus respectively also as seen from the phylogenetic tree figure s1 these two sequences deviate from the other bat coronavirus sequences suggesting that these bat coronaviruses are homologous and genetically more similar to humandelivered sarscov2 than to the other bats coronaviruses in general these data support phylogenetic results obtained by previous researches based on a wholegenome b nonstructural proteins ns7b and ns8 c spike glycoprotein and d nucleocapsid protein
16

 for the next experiment based on the alignment and comparison of the structures mers has been set as a control data set due to the wellcharacterized close relationship between human and cameldelivered strains
11
 
17
 in contrast alignment and comparison of the sarscov2 structural models have revealed close relationship to the yak betacoronavirus b grunniens table 1 while batdelivered hku4 and hku5related betacoronaviruses had a lower matching score bovine coronavirus is a worldwide spread zoonotically transmissible infection in domestic and wild ruminants that is known to cause severe diarrhoea in neonatal dysentery in adult and respiratory diseases in animals of all ages and could also infect humans
18
 our conclusion is also wellsupported by a recent report
19
 on the ace2spike glycoprotein complexes which suggests bovidae as one of the potential intermediate hosts interestingly the identified bovine coronavirus strain strain yakhy24ch2017 has unique amino acid variation in the s gene that represents an uncommon adaptive evolution pathway with unknown biological meaning
20

 it should be noted that many bat species have been identified in europe that are natural hosts for many viruses including coronaviruses in particular sarslike
21
 unexplored natural reservoirs of viruses could pose potential threats for public health
22
 this possibility also raises the question of unique transmission channels specific for each region
23

 in conclusion the results of our phylogenetic study support the fact that the infection originated from bats additionally results from the comparison structural models propose an additional intermediate host yak b grunniens that could transmit bat coronavirus to human hosts we also wish to emphasize the importance of further investigations into the evolution of the spike glycoprotein such work could render a positive impact on the current sarscov2 transmission and prevent zoonotic disease outbreaks of this type in the future the authors declare that there are no conflict of interests  phylogenomics and bioinformatics of sars-cov pietro li nick goldman   recent work although reporting impressive insights into the mechanisms of pathogenesis of sars-cov has assessed the phylogeny of proteins of this virus using overly simple algorithms 2 3 the distance methods used to assess sars-cov phylogeny present several disadvantages first by converting a sequence alignment to pairwise distances we necessarily lose some of the evolutionary information contained within the analysed sequences 1 second distance methods are known to compromise the accuracy of estimates of evolutionary divergence which are fundamental to understanding the rate and mode of viral evolution third there are no known methods to test evolutionary models and estimated trees produced using the pairwise distance methodology 1 here we use state-of-the-art phylogenetic methods to analyse all the available coronaviridae and sars-cov sequence datasets to gain an insight into the origin and evolution of sars-cov and to narrow down the list of potential regions of its genome that might be interesting targets for drug design the statistically most robust method that can be used to achieve these aims is to consider the phylogenetic inference problem in a likelihood framework using a valid model of evolution for viral genomes 1 the choice of such a model for single-stranded rna virus genomes is difficult a parametric model based on chemical or biological properties of rna might underestimate or completely miss important unknown constraints for example packaging of single-stranded rna genomes that requires interaction with coat proteins 4 an alternative approach is to use empirical models that are generated through comparisons of observed sequences for example simply counting apparent replacements between closely related sequences given that sequence databases are biased towards mammalian and bacterial dna sequences there are relatively few coding single-stranded rna sequences to be aligned and non-coding rna sequences such as rrna or trna might be subjected to different selective eg structural constraints because the proteins encoded by rna genes might be subjected to functional constraints in a similar manner to non-viral proteins it might be better to use empirical amino acid substitution models that describe the probability of fixation of amino acid changes rather than rna models furthermore relative to primary structure the secondary structure of homologous proteins persists long after any statistically significant sequence similarity has vanished sequences with 25 amino acid identity probably have the same secondary structure 5 amino acid models of evolution that incorporate protein structural information perform better than simple amino acid models 6 moreover selection pressures act on protein function which in turn is closely related to structure therefore incorporating structure information into evolutionary analysis can assist in incorporating selective constraints here the programme passml-tm which implements protein secondary structure-based models of evolution has been used for analyses 7 8 the first undertaking is the determination and rooting of the coronavirus phylogeny that is the putative origin of the sequences of interest a large fraction 70 of the sars-cov genome encodes a replicase polyprotein which has significant sequence homology to all of the replicase polyproteins that have been sequenced to date from the order nidovirales comprising the coronavirus torovirus okavirus and arterivirus genera therefore this protein is a good choice for investigating the phylogenetic relationships among the family coronaviridae viral sequences have high mutation rates and consequently alignments are usually difficult to prepare here clustalw is applied using standard parameters 9 followed by careful refinement of the alignments both by eye and by using the protein secondary structural information for each nidovirus sequence as predicted by phd httpcubicbioccolumbiaedupredictprotein 10 and psi-pred httpbioinfcsuclacukpsipred 11 figure 1
shows the maximum likelihood tree produced using a set of homologous replicases from five sars-cov strains 12 other coronaviruses representing both groups 1 and 2 of the genus 2 3 one torovirus breda virus and one okavirus yellow head yh virus which were determined to most closely represent the consensus coronavirus sequence by a psi-blast search 12 the coronavirus sequences allow the determination of the root of the sars-cov strains whereas the torovirus and okavirus sequences provide insights into the rooting of the family coronaviridae phylogeny which is closer to group 1 than group 2 of the coronavirus genus as found previously by marra et al
2 and rota et al
3 the root of sars-cov is closer to coronavirus group 2 all sars-cov strains are almost completely identical in sequence 99 dna sequence homology and therefore it is not possible to get any meaningful phylogeny within the sars-cov group the avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv which causes respiratory disease in chickens and the turkey virus tcv which causes enteric disease are clustered together their ancestor divides groups 1 and 2 of the mammal-infecting coronaviruses the close clustering of the chicken and turkey viruses suggests that the difference between enteric and respiratory tropisms might require only a few amino acid changes experiments have shown that just two point mutations in the spike s glycoprotein can change porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus tgev a mostly enteric virus that can kill piglets into a non-deadly virus that excels at the respiratory route but replicates poorly in the gut 13 14 15 to infect enteric tract cells with tgev two different domains of the s protein of tgev mapping to between amino acids 522 and 744 and close to amino acid 219 are involved 13 the first domain binds to aminopeptidase n papn many viruses use co-receptors and it is probable that the second domain maps a co-receptor essential for the enteric tropism of tgev 14 15 the clustering of murine hepatitis virus mhv and rat coronavirus rtcov might reflect the relatively close proximity in which the hosts reside and perhaps the similarity of murine and rat target receptors note that mhv receptors including ceacam1 have recently been identified 16 17 the clustering of the human oc43 hcov-oc43 bovine bcov and porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis hev coronaviruses might reflect conditions contributing to cross-infection in farming the breda torovirus is enteric whereas the yh okavirus infects gill tissue in prawns this indicates that the switch between enteric and respiratory tropism is a general characteristic of the order nidovirales coronaviruses attach to host cells through the s glycoprotein 15 18 this protein is translated as a large polypeptide that is subsequently cleaved into a receptor-binding peripheral subunit s1 that remains non-covalently associated with a fusion-inducing membrane-spanning s2 fragment 18 studies have shown that the entry of the porcine coronavirus tgev into cells is mediated by the interactions of s1 with papn an ectoenzyme abundantly expressed at the apical membrane of enterocytes covering the villi of the small intestine 19 the fact that the s protein mediates the first interaction of the virus with human cells suggests that it might represent an excellent target for effective anti-sars-cov drugs unfortunately structural information is only available for the 3clpro proteinase which is part of the coronavirus replication complex pdb accessions 1q2w 1p9u 1p9s and 1lvo 20 the s protein shows relatively high sequence homology within two of the major coronavirus groups 60 within group 1 38 within group 2 whereas the homology between groups is lower 1521 between groups 1 and 2 1521 between sars-cov and group 1 or 2 comparative sequence analysis between the sars-cov sequences and sequences from groups 1 and 2 of the coronavirus genus reveals three regions of varying sequence conservation from amino acid positions 1 to 400 401680 and 6811255 interestingly the first two regions correspond to the s1 fragment we subsequently refer to these regions as s1a and s2a and the third to the s2 fragment figure 2a
shows a cartoon of the gene for the s protein the region s1a is poorly conserved between groups 1 and 2 and sars-cov whereas s1b is flanked by two very well conserved motifs making it easier to align the internal sequences notably this region is homologous to a tgev spike region that is reported to contain determinants for tissue tropism 13 14 15 the region s2 is more conserved than s1a and s1b and consequently the alignment is easily determined passml-tm which uses the evolutionary relationships of the sequences analysed to improve its predictions of secondary structure and accessibility predicts a transmembrane helix at location 11961218 of the s protein the maximum likelihood trees of s1b and s2 are shown in figures 2b and 2c respectively the length of the trees and the distances between sequences reflect the sequence homologies according to the model of evolution explaining why the s2 tree is much shorter than s1b tree the phylogenetic tree produced from the analysis of the spike s2 fragment from several coronaviruses indicates that sars-cov is closer to group 2 of the coronavirus genus than to group 1 phylogenetic analysis of the s1 fragment from several coronaviruses indicates that sars-cov has an even closer relationship to group 2 viruses than the previous analysis suggests phylogenetic analysis of a 300 amino acid region at the terminus of s1 which we denote s1b indicates that sars-cov belongs to group 2 and is closely related to mhv and rtcov the differences between these results might be a result of recombination events involving sars-cov or convergent evolution or they might also be caused simply by chance however it is apparent that sars-cov is most closely related to group 2 of the coronavirus genus because the s1 fragment of mhv binds to ceacam1 we suggest that the s1b region of the sars-cov spike might bind to a human ceacam1 receptor instead of papn holmes and collaborators who have identified receptors for mhv murine ceacam1a hcov-229e human papn and feline coronaviruses feline papn 16 17 are currently investigating this hypothesis k holmes pers commun in support of the proposal that s1b is involved in receptor-binding is the fact that this region is homologous to a domain of the tgev s protein which is located between amino acids 522 and 744 and is also involved in receptor-binding 13 16 notably tgev mutants that lack sialic acid-binding activity contain single point mutations in the s protein cys155phe met195val arg196ser asp208asn or leu209pro 21 22 sialic acid-binding activity might help tgev to resist detergent-like substances encountered during gastrointestinal passage and therefore facilitate infection of the intestinal epithelium 23 we found that only cys155 is conserved in sars-cov this is in agreement with clinical findings that show that 2050 of sars patients present gastrointestinal symptoms 24 the low conservation of the s1a region among coronavirus sequences suggests that once more strains of sars-cov or other closely related species are available it will become possible to use innovative comparative sequence analyses to examine positive selection that acts in this region 1 several important functional determinants have been discovered in fragment s2 it contains a cytoplasmic tail enriched in cysteine residues 12171236 figure 2a this is a common feature among coronaviruses and appears to be related to membrane fusion 25 several authors have discovered that sars-cov s2 contains two conserved regions of heptad repeats 9131000 and 11511185 figure 2a 26 27 see also a press release by wr gallaher and rf garry httpwwwvirologynetsarss2modelhtml these heptads suggest that sars-cov uses mechanisms to gain entry to a cell that are similar to those used by human immunodeficiency virus hiv the virus that causes aids acquired immunodeficiency syndrome orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses and also ebola it is known that peptides derived from these repeat regions in hiv and the paramyxoviruses can specifically inhibit virus entry and subsequently viral replication 26 currently sars treatment is modeled after the drug known as t20 httpwwwhivmedicinecomtextbookdrugst20htm this drug is a complex peptide that is difficult to manufacture has a short half-life in the human body and must be injected this suggests that other regions of the genome such as s1b which might be of some interest for drug design should be described we report in figure 2d the consensus protein structure estimate of s1b obtained using passml-tm phd 10 and psi-pred 11 passml-tm also estimates the distribution of mutation rates along the protein and the sitewise mutation rate figure 2d the sars-cov genome is at rich 59 asymmetries in strand composition can reveal mutation bias for example cytosine deamination or selection 28 we found that the gc gcgc002 and at skew atat0037 in the sars-cov genome are smaller than those of the hiv genome gc skew is 015 and at skew is 023 which has a double-stranded rna genome with a similar at content this suggests the existence of some selection on g and c distribution along the sequence to control the types of rna secondary structure that form 29 cg is the only dinucleotide statistically under-represented fcgfcfg046 where fcg is the frequency of cg dinucleotides and significance is assessed according to refs 30 31 because this depletion is also found in the hiv genome but not in that of tobacco mosaic virus it might occur as a result of mutational bias in vertebrate cells comparison of the mutation patterns in the sars-cov genome sequences from 16 patients shows that a large number 3884 of the base substitutions detected at 84 sites occur within or near to single base and dinucleotide repeat stretches despite the absence of a pairing rule the ratio of rates of transition and transversion mutations is 2 as is often found in double-stranded dna the low gc and at skews and the low number of mutations suggest that evolvability of sars-cov might be restricted by selective constraints acting on the rna structure and packaging of the genome and therefore it might also be restricted by the low fitness of its mutational neighbours sequence features that form stems and loops that are potentially involved in coronavirus genome packaging have been described 32 33 mutational neighbours with different fitness might explain why although some rna viruses evolve at high rates some rna viruses are highly stable 34 35 interestingly the ease of tropism switching as exemplified by the closeness between turkey and chicken coronaviruses figure 1 is favoured by the large number of viral particles in each host by their mutation rates by the large populations of hosts birds and other species and by the aerial mode of viral spread for instance through sneezing and faeces these factors suggest that birds might act as powerful engines for virus evolution in this review we have highlighted that the s1 and s2 fragments of the sars-cov s protein have different mutational patterns on the basis of phylogenetic evidence figure 2b and the homology with the tgev 522744 region it is suggested that a short region of the s1 fragment which we denote s1b located at positions 400680 might be of particular interest to virologists structural biologists and biotechnologists the sitewise secondary structure solvent accessibility and mutation rate of this region have been estimated our work in progress includes further structural characterization and fold family determination at the moment sars appears to be under control despite doctors having neither drugs nor a vaccine to protect against it because it could reappear in the future research should proceed and hopefully our findings might assist in maintaining a feed-forward loop on sars-cov research between bioinformatics analysis and experimental work from microbiologists and virologists as a final comment it is notable that in all the phylogenies human coronaviruses hcov-229 and hcov-oc43 always cluster with porcine coronaviruses because ericsson and collaborators 36 reported the identification of two homologous human proteins that act as receptors for porcine endogenous retrovirus the benefits and risks of porcinehuman xenotransplantation should be carefully balanced  sars-cov-2 whole genome amplification and sequencing

zulfa deesi norbert nowotny alawi alsheikh-ali ahmad abou tayoun ahmad tayoun abou ahmad tayounajch  ae  these authors contributed equally to this work with the gradual reopening of economies and resumption of social life robust surveillance mechanisms should be implemented to control the ongoing covid-19 pandemic unlike rt-qpcr sars-cov-2 whole genome sequencing cwgs has the added advantage of identifying cryptic origins of the virus and the extent of community-based transmissions versus new viral introductions which can in turn influence public health policy decisions however practical and cost considerations of cwgs should be addressed before it can be widely implemented we performed shotgun transcriptome sequencing using rna extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs of patients with covid-19 and compared it to targeted sars-cov-2 full genome amplification and sequencing with respect to virus detection scalability and costeffectiveness to track virus origin we used open-source multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tools to compare the assembled sars-cov-2 genomes to publicly available sequences we show a significant improvement in whole genome sequencing data quality and viral detection using amplicon-based target enrichment of sars-cov-2 with enrichment more than 99 of the sequencing reads mapped to the viral genome compared to an average of 063 without enrichment consequently a dramatic increase in genome coverage was obtained using significantly less sequencing data enabling higher scalability and significant cost reductions we also demonstrate how sars-cov-2 genome sequences can be used to determine their possible origin through phylogenetic analysis including other viral strains sars-cov-2 whole genome sequencing is a practical cost-effective and powerful approach for population-based surveillance and control of viral transmission in the next phase of the covid-19 pandemic  the covid-19 pandemic continues to inflict devastating human life losses 1 and has enforced significant social changes and global economic shut downs 2  with the accumulating financial burdens and unemployment rates several governments are sketching out plans for slowly re-opening the economy and reviving social life and economic activity however robust population-based surveillance systems are essential to track viral transmission during the re-opening process while rt-qpcr targeting sars-cov-2 can be effective in identifying infected individuals for isolation and contact tracing it is not useful in determining which viral strains are circulating in the community autochthonous versus imported ones and -if imported -it is important to know the origin of the strains which in turn influences public health policy decisions in addition it is vital to identify super-spreader events as they can be influenced by the virus strain 3  sars-cov-2 whole genome sequencing cwgs on the other hand can detect the virus and can delineate its origins through phylogenetic analysis 4 5 in combination with other local and international viral strains especially given the accumulation of thousands of viral sequences from countries all over the world wwwnextstrainorg figure 1  however practical considerations such as cost scalability and data storage should first be investigated to assess the feasibility of implementing cwgs as a population-based surveillance tool here we show that cwgs is cost-effective and is highly scalable when using a target enrichment sequencing method and we also demonstrate its utility in tracking the origin of sars-cov-2 transmission all patients had laboratory-confirmed covid-19 based on positive rt-pcr assay for sars-cov-2 in the centralized dubai health authority dha virology laboratory this study was

manufacturers instructions a sample was considered positive if the cycle threshold ct values were less than 40 for each of the sars-cov-2 targets n1 and n2 and the extraction control rp to estimate the viral load relative to human rna we calculated the ct value for each target as follows ct  ctnn -ctrp where nn is either n1 or n2 the average of the n1 and n2 target ct values was then negated to reach a relative estimate of viral load which is inversely correlated with ct value rna libraries from all samples were prepared for shotgun transcriptomic sequencing using the truseq stranded total

variant calling was performed by gatk v38-1-0 and was followed by sars-cov-2 genome assembly using bcftools v131  figure 2b  all tools used in this study are freely accessible for laboratories without bioinformatics support several publicly accessible end-to-end bioinformatics pipelines insaflu httpsinsafluinsapt genome detective httpswwwgenomedetectivecomapptypingtoolvirus 7 8  composed of the above tools can be used to generate viral sequences from raw fastq data for downstream analysis a general quality control metric was implemented to ensure assembled sars-cov-2 genomes have at least 20x average coverage sequencing reads q30 across most nucleotide positions 56-29797 for target enrichment and shotgun sequencing comparisons in table 1  we used data from 7 samples uaep12020 l0287 l1189 l4711 l5857 l6841 l9119 generated using both methods data from patient l5630 were not included in this analysis since unlike the above 7 samples significantly more sequencing data was allocated for the target enriched sample in this patient supplemental table 2  which can overestimate the efficiency of the target enrichment protocol all new sars-cov-2 sequences n7 generated in this study were submitted to gisaid global initiative on sharing all influenza data under accession ids epiisl463740 and epiisl469276 to epiisl469281 we used nexstrain 9 which consists of augur v643 pipeline for multiple sequence alignment mafft v7455 10 and phylogenetic tree construction iqtree v1612 11  tree topology was assessed using the fast bootstrapping function with 1000 replicates tree visualization and annotations were performed in figtree v144 12 shotgun transcriptome sequencing was used to fully sequence sars-cov-2 rna extracted from patients n17 who tested positive for the virus 4 analysis of the sequencing data showed that this approach required on average 471gb of data per sample yielding 317 million total reads of which approximately 063 of the reads 199000 reads mapped to the sars-cov-2 genome with an average coverage of 173x table 1  this is attributed to the fact that most of the shotgun data 99 is allocated to the human transcriptome while a minority of the reads align to the sars-cov-2 genome table 1  in addition to cost and storage considerations discussed below this approach is not highly sensitive for detecting sars-cov-2 genomes in general and specifically in samples with low viral abundance in fact despite high viral abundance relative to human rna most samples had less than 100x sequencing coverage across the sars-cov-2 genome samples with seemingly very low viral loads failed to yield full sars-cov-2 genome sequence using this approach table 1 and figure 3a  to enrich viral sequences and minimize sequencing cost and data storage issues addressed below we describe an alternative approach where the entire sars-cov-2 genome is first amplified using 26 overlapping primer sets each yielding around 15kb long inserts figures and supplemental table 1  all inserts were then pooled and fragmented to 250-750bp inserts which were then prepared for short read next generation sequencing figures   2a and 3c  rna extracted from eight covid-19 patients which were first sequenced by shotgun transcriptome table 1 and supplemental table 2  were sequenced using the enrichment protocol as expected we observed significant enhancement in virus detection using this protocol where on average 993 of the reads now mapped to the sars-cov-2 genome leading to tenfold increase in coverage relative to shotgun transcriptome avg 440x versus 455x respectively despite generating a two hundred fold less sequencing data avg 002gb versus 428gb respectively table 2 and figure 3d  on average 37x coverage per 1gb of sequencing data was generated using shotgun sequencing  table 1  compared to 23000x per 1gb using target enrichment  table 2 suggesting the latter method is more cost effective and is highly scalable we calculate the table 3  therefore target enrichment sequencing is still more cost-effective and scalable than shotgun transcriptome sequencing even at higher sequencing throughputs another factor impeding scalability of the shotgun approach is data storage even with higher throughput sequencing novaseq sp flowcell shotgun sequencing requires an allocation of 1tb of data for 250 sequenced samples on the other hand with 1tb of data a total of around 80000 samples can be sequenced using the enrichment method and the miseq micro flowcell  table 3  therefore long term data storage allocations and cost are significantly higher and perhaps formidable when using the shotgun sequencing approach to illustrate the utility of sars-cov-2 whole genome sequencing we tracked the origins of the virus in seven patients uaep12020 l0287 l1189 l4711 l5857 l6841 l9119 by comparing their assembled sequences to virus strains n25 identified during the early phase of the pandemic between january 29 and march 18 2020 in the uae 4 all seven patient samples were collected between march 28 and april 5 2020 and are therefore good candidates to determine whether transmissions were community-based due to the previously documented 25 strains or were independent external introductions multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis figures 2b and 4 showed that the new isolates from patients l0287 l4711 l1189 and l5857 clustered with earlier strains of iranian origin or clade a3 while that from patient l9119 belonged to the early european or clade a2a cluster figure 4  this information suggests that transmissions for all those five patients were most likely community-based which we then confirmed from patient medical records where no recent travel history was reported by any of those individuals sars-cov-2 isolates from patients p1uae2020 and l6841 were on the other hand closer to the earliest asian strains which are more diverse due to fewer but distinct mutations  figure 4  hence with the available sequencing data it is challenging to ascertain whether the p1uae2020 and l6841 transmissions were community-based or due to early independent introductions however patient l6841 did not have any recent travel history before symptoms onset suggesting the case for community-based transmission related to an asian strain on the other hand travel history in patient p1uae2020 was not known and the corresponding isolate appeared to match closely to five other strains from the united states and taiwan figure 4  therefore transmission in patient p1uae2020 was unlikely to be community-based from the early 25 strains 4 but rather due to an independent travelrelated introduction of the virus genomics-based sars-cov-2 population-based surveillance is a powerful tool for controlling viral transmission during the next phase of the pandemic therefore it is important to devise efficient methods for sars-cov-2 genome sequencing for downstream phylogenetic analysis and virus origin tracking towards this goal we describe a cost-effective robust and highly scalable target enrichment sequencing approach and provide an example to demonstrate its utility in characterizing transmission origin our target enrichment protocol is amplicon-based for which oligonucleotide primers can be easily ordered by any molecular laboratory next generation sequencing ngs has also become largely accessible to most labs and in our protocol we show that highly affordable low throughput sequencers such as the illumina miseq system can be used efficiently to sequence up to 96 samples at 400x coverage each at a cost of 87 per sample  table 3  this cost is likely comparable to rt-pcr testing for the virus one possible limitation is the use of ultra-sonication for fragmentation of pcr products after sars-cov-2 whole genome amplification several labs might lack sonication systems due to accessibility and affordability issues in such situations our protocol can be easily modified to use enzymatic fragmentation instead provided by commercial kits such as the agilent httpswwwgenomedetectivecomapptypingtoolvirus 7 8 which can take raw sequencing fastq files to assemble viral genomes and to perform multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis for virus origin tracking in addition the described approach does not require significant data storage or computational investment as shown by our cost data and scalability calculations  table 3  our phylogenetic analysis demonstrates how sars-cov-2 genomic sequencing can be used to track origins of virus transmission however data should be carefully interpreted and should be combined with other epidemiological information such as travel history to avoid inaccurate conclusions the major limitation facing genomic-based sars-cov-2 surveillance includes the lack of virus sequencing data representing most strains in any country nonetheless sars-cov-2 strains are continuously being sequenced by government private and academic entities all over the world and the sequencing data is being shared publicly this proliferation of sequencing datasets will empower genomic-based surveillance of the virus and the availability of cost effective sequencing options like the one described in this study will contribute to democratizing sars-cov-2 sequencing and data sharing in summary we show that sars-cov-2 whole genome sequencing is a highly feasible and effective tool for tracking virus transmission genomic data can be used to determine community-based versus imported transmissions which can then inform the most appropriate public health decisions to control the pandemic disclosures authors do not have any conflicts of interests to disclose   sars associated coronavirus has a recombinant polymerase and coronaviruses have a history of host-shifting joshua rest s david mindell p   the sudden appearance and potential lethality of severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus sars-cov in humans has focused attention on understanding its origins the host reservoir from which humans were infected remains to be determined however molecular phylogenetics can be used to assess sars-covs evolutionary origin and history of change by analyzing genes from sars-cov with homologous genes from other coronaviruses though surveys and sampling of coronaviruses from both wild and domestic host-species are limiting comparative phylogenetic analyses for viruses and hosts is important in elucidating the history of host associations as well coronaviruses have been divided into three groups based on serological and genetic criteria siddell 1995 to date group 3 coronaviruses have been found only in birds group 1 coronaviruses have been found in carnivores cetartiodactyls and primates and group 2 coronaviruses have been found in cetartiodactyls perissodactyls rodents and birds previous phylogenetic analyses all of which were unrooted suggested that sars-cov represents a relatively early diverging coronavirus lineage equally distantly related to the three groups of coronaviruses noted above on this basis sars-cov was proposed as representing a fourth distinct group within the genus coronavirus marra et al 2003 rota et al 2003 these previous studies which focused on characterizing and sequencing sars-cov did not yield evidence for recombination within the sars-cov genome although marra et al 2003 commented that the s2m motif within the sars-cov utr may be the product of horizontal transfer given the disjunct presence of s2m in many if not all astroviruses a picornavirus erbv and only one group 3 coronavirus avian infectious bronchitis viruses ibv here we use phylogenetic analyses of sars-cov and other coronaviruses rooted with diverse viruses from the family artiviridae to show that the rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp of sars-cov is a recombinant we also compare phylogenetic trees for known coronaviruses and their hosts to assess the history of host associations for sars-cov and other coronaviruses to identify and align three sars-cov proteins with homologs in the non-redundant genbank cds translations also includes pdb swissprot and pir 20 april 2003 we used pfam hidden markov models hmm bateman et al 2002 with the software hmmer eddy 1998 the hmms we used are pf05183 for rna dependent rna polymerase pf00937 for nucleocapsid n and pf01601 for spike s for identical rdrp sequences we only retained a single representative for n and s we used blastclust to retain a single representative from 95 identity groups to reduce the abundance of these sequences for computational efficiency envelope and membrane proteins were not analyzed because of their short size and lack of conservation across coronaviruses to detect recombination within rdrp s and n genes we used sliding window phylogenetic analyses where windows of 100 amino acids in 25 amino acid intervals were analyzed using bayesian inference bi mau et al 1999 yang and rannala 1997 this approach is analogous to bootscanning eg salminen et al 1995 however we use bayesian inference rather than neighbor joining nj and amino acid sequences rather than nucleotides for bi four chains were run for 200 k generations with a 100 k generation burn-in using a  distribution of rates and the transition matrices wag for s and n and rtrev for rdrp dimmic et al 2002 in mrbayes v3b4 huelsenbeck and ronquist 2001 and summarized as a 50 majority rule consensus tree we used the differential phylogenetic position of different sars-cov gene fragments windows with respect to other coronavirus groups to identify potential recombination breakpoints and to divide the alignment into segments for additional phylogenetic analyses fig 2a for rdrp with bi and nj bootstrap for the analysis of these segments bi parameters were as above except each chain was run for 1 million generations for nj bootstrap we used 1000 bootstrap replicates and nj searches under default parameters in paup summarized as a 50 majority rule consensus tree we used the approximately unbiased au test shimodaira 2002 to assess the validity of these breakpoints by determining whether alternative phylogenetic placements for different sars-cov gene regions can be statistically rejected using the program consel shimodaira and hasegawa 2001 with branch lengths and model parameters estimated in paml yang 1997 in order to evaluate the types of evolutionary events codivergence duplication sorting host switching that explain the fit between coronavirus evolution and host evolution we considered the nucleocapsid coronavirus phylogeny and its host phylogeny where mammalian relationships in the host tree follow murphy et al 2001 we used treefitter v1 ronquist 2000 which incorporates differential costs to the four types of potential events of a hostparasite association codivergence c duplication d sorting s and host switching h we used various event costs to test a variety of situations see desdevises et al 2002 ronquist and liljeblad 2001 significance of fit was determined by comparing the cost of the observed tree with 10000 random permutations of the coronavirus tree terminals the rdrp hmm detected 27 unique sequences in genbank related to sars-cov from arteriviridae and coronaviridae the relationship between sars-cov and these other coronaviruses for each 100 amino acid window in rdrp as indicated by bi phylogeny is shown in fig 1a
 three contiguous overlapping windows spanning 150 amino acids in the 5 region of the sars-cov rdrp are sister to a clade including groups 13 all other known coronaviruses alternatively seven contiguous windows spanning 259 amino acids in the 3 region are sister to group 3 coronaviruses using this diagram fig 1a we split rdrp into two fragments 5 and 3 to assess the significance of this inference we performed extensive phylogenetic analyses on each fragment the optimal tree for the 5 region fig 1b and the 3 region fig 1c mirrored the results of the sliding window analysis fig 1a to assess the potential impact of the outgroups on these results we also analyzed both regions for the 12 coronavirus taxa alone these unrooted topologies not shown are compatible with the rooted topologies indicating that the results for sars-cov in fig 1 are not due to long branch attraction involving the outgroup we then used the approximately unbiased au tree selection test shimodaira 2002 to see if the alternative competing trees for each gene fragment can be statistically rejected in favor of the optimal tree or if the conflicting results between the 5 and 3 regions are not statistically significant as shown in fig 2
 the optimal sister relationship for the 5 region with sars-cov as sister to a clade including groups 13 combined is rejectable for the 3 region and the optimal sister relationship for the 3 region with sars-cov sister to group 3 is rejectable for the 5 region additionally sars-cov rdrp as sister to group 1 rdrp is rejectable in both regions and sars-cov as sister to group 2 is rejectable in the 3 region to assess the impact of the outgroups on these results we repeated the au tests with only the 12 coronavirus taxa all alternative topologies for both regions were rejectable in favor of the optimal topology according to the au test for s the hmm detected 120 unique relatives of sars-cov which we reduced to 24 by 95 identity clustering for n the hmm detected 93 unique relatives of sars-cov which we reduced to 32 by identity clustering for s and n we were not able to reject alternative topologies for segments when following the above procedure results not shown and thus considered each gene as a historical unit for further analysis according to their hmms both s and n are too variable to allow inclusion of an outgroup in alignment and phylogenetic analyses therefore their phylogenies are unrooted for n fig 3
 and s not shown coronavirus groups 13 are each monophyletic with respect to sars-cov however we cannot say with statistical confidence according to the au test which group 1 2 or 3 is most closely related to sars-cov examination of the fit of the n virus tree to the host tree was performed in treefitter v1 ronquist 2000 under default settings h2 s1 d0 c0 nine host switches p0001 describe a significant fit p0001 of the virus and host trees while codivergences duplications and sorting events are rare p005 as further evidence of this when the program settings are changed to maximize codivergence events h0 or h0 and c1 the global fit between the two trees is no longer significant p005 together these results indicate that given current sampling host switches have been extremely important in the evolution of coronaviruses and their hosts the difference in the phylogenies inferred from the 5 fig 1b and 3 fig 1c rdrp regions and the significant differences in support and rejectability of alternative trees for each gene region all strongly support the hypothesis of an ancient recombination event between two co-infecting viruses we say ancient to denote that both regions are sister to clades of other sequences rather than to any single recently diverged sequence these results indicate that the two sars-cov rdrp regions do indeed represent two unique histories thus it is preferable not to analyze them together as has been done in previous analyses marra et al 2003 rota et al 2003 because their history cannot be represented by a single tree these previous analyses used distance methods nj less able to accommodate heterogeneity in rates of sequence character change and found rdrp as a whole to be closest to group 2 coronaviruses this may result from conflicts within the data stemming from recombination andor from effects of rate heterogeneity the authors do not report whether alternative trees could be rejected based on their analyses of multiple genes though it seems unlikely as when we performed similar analyses for the s and n proteins we were not able to differentiate between alternative sars-cov sister relationships using the au test we note that the approach for detecting recombination implemented here is rigorous in comparison to traditional bootscanning in that it analyzes more conserved amino acids using bayesian inference rather than nj and explicitly tests the significance of alternative topologies using the au test it is possible and likely that more recombination events have happened within rdrp n s or other sars-cov genes than we have detected here although the evidence for recombination generally becomes more difficult to discern over time inclusion of an outgroup as we have done with rdrp from 15 arteriviridae taxa fig 1 allows inference of the sister relationships and the relative age and timing of coronaviridae coronavirus and torovirus divergence events missing from the previous unrooted analyses which only could assess distance between clades our rooted analyses indicate that the 5 rdrp fragment diverged from other coronavirus taxa prior to divergences between and within groups 13 fig 1c indicates that the 3 rdrp fragment diverged from other coronavirus homologs more recently after divergences between and within groups 13 interestingly fig 1c also shows non-monophyly for group 1 coronaviruses this is not surprising given that groups 13 were initially distinguished based on serological tests rather than phylogenetic analyses and given the capacity for recombination the sister relationship between the more recently diverged sars-cov 3 rdrp fragment and group 3 avian infectious bronchitis viruses fig 1c suggests that potential horizontal transmissions of s2m to sars-cov marra et al 2003 and the 3 region of rdrp are correlated they may have even been incorporated concomitantly perhaps on transmission from an ancestor of ibv the only coronavirus with s2m jonassen et al 1998 as the 5 region of rdrp and the s2m motif are disjunct in the sars-cov genome putative replication-dependent recombination would have involved several consecutive template switches as was inferred for the transfer of s2m to ibv jonassen et al 1998 alternatively horizontal transfer from astroviruses or a picornavirus cannot be ruled out as horizontal transfer of s2m accounts for its presence in three different virus families jonassen et al 1998 phylogenetic indication of recombination for sars-cov makes sense as coronaviruses are unique among single-stranded non-segmented rna viruses in their propensity for recombination a mechanism purportedly useful in eliminating frequent deleterious mutations in large rna viruses lai 1996 coronavirus genomes generally appear resilient and able to tolerate deletions insertions and rearrangements de haan et al 2002 similar to our findings decimo et al 1993 suggested that n genes from murine hepatitis viruses were the result of double recombination and several authors have reported evidence for recombination among natural isolates of ibv eg jia et al 1995 wang et al 1993 recombination can be important in gain of novel functions for example in hiv recombination is considered to be a powerful adaptive mechanism for antiviral agent resistance and cytotoxic t-cell escape eg morris et al 1999 the combination of horizontal transfer and recombination results in complex phylogenies that may blur the evolutionary history of genes eg keeling and palmer 2001 rest and mindell 2003 especially since horizontal transfer and recombination are often associated processes despite the limitations imposed on inference of historical host association by the restricted sampling of hosts and coronaviruses to date some preliminary observations can be made coronaviruses have been shown to be particularly host specific lai 1990 sturman and holmes 1983 and it had been assumed by some that they coevolved diversified in tandem with their hosts decimo et al 1993 however based on current sampling and analyses summarized in fig 3 some host switching events are implicated in accounting for incongruence between the host and coronavirus phylogenies for example chicken and turkey are sister taxa within the host phylogeny yet isolates from each do not form host-specific monophyletic groups rather some isolates from chicken are most closely related to turkey isolates suggesting host-shifts for coronaviruses between these two bird species fig 3 a third avian species the manx shearwater puffinus puffinus is the host to a group 2 coronavirus kirkwood et al 1995 which are otherwise known only from mammals the phylogenetically nested position of this avian coronavirus within mammalian-host isolates suggests a possible birdmammal host-shift coronavirus host-shifts between mouse and rat are implicated in the same manner as for chicken and turkey isolates from the two rodent species are not reciprocally monophyletic similarly isolates from pig are not monophyletic including two group 1 and one group 2 coronavirus in fig 3 with the outbreak of sars coronavirus isolates from humans are also non-monophyletic using an earlier and more limited sampling of host species n6 and coronaviruses n9 decimo et al 1993 suggested a host-shift between cats and pigs inclusion of additional host and virus sampling in fig 3 including two isolates from dogs implicates potential host-shift between dogs and pigs rather than cats and pigs this demonstrates sensitivity to sampling although the implication of host-shifting as a phenomenon remains the emerging picture of coronavirus host associations is increasingly indicative of host-shifts this is supported in fig 3 by the observations mentioned above as well as 1 the sister relationship between human coronavirus 229e and porcine pig epidemic diarrhea virus and 2 non-monophyly for human coronavirus 229e and sars-cov further according to statistical tests in treefitter allowing host-shifts to occur results in significant fit while duplication codivergence and sorting play no detectable role depending on the assigned costs treefitter estimates between 9 and 15 host-shifts in reconciling the host and coronavirus phylogenies shown in fig 3 though the actual number is unknown in light of the genomic disparity among diverse coronaviruses from some individual host-species eg humans pigs it seems unlikely that increased sampling of coronaviruses will yield monophyly for all isolates from each of the individual host-species in fig 3 the finding of recombination for sars-cov rdrp the relatively early phylogenetic divergence for rdrp fragments prior to the most recent divergences within coronavirus groups 13 as well as the inference of multiple coronavirus hosts switches suggests that sars-cov belongs to an old potentially diverse and changeable coronavirus lineage that remains to be discovered in its natural hosts demonstration of recombination in the sars associated coronavirus lineage indicates its potential for rapid unpredictable change a potentially important challenge for public health management and for drug and vaccine development the known non-human coronaviruses come from only nine mostly domestic mammal or bird species and searches for the zoonotic reservoir might reasonably focus on other species including non-domesticated animals that are used as food for humans in the geographic region of the sars outbreak  molecular evolution and multilocus sequence typing of 145 strains of sars-cov zhi-gang wang

of china which had high mortality and morbidity and was termed severe acute respiratory syndrome sars it affected 8096 people and led 774 patients to death around the world within a very short span of time 1 several studies have shown that sars is caused by a new member of the coronavirus family the sars coronavirus sars-cov was supposed to be transmitted from wild animals 2 3 4 this hypothesis was then supported by the identification of a sars-cov-like virus in civet cats sold in markets in south china this isolate had more than 99 sequence identity with sars-cov indicating that the virus was recently transferred from animals to human beings 5 however according to a recent report there is no direct evidence that the civet cat virus is the origin of the sars-cov 6 although unlikely the possibility that sars-cov positive animals were infected from humans cannot be formally excluded and it was indeed reported that sars-cov was transmitted from man to pig 7 the mechanism how the pathogen broke the barrier between its natural reservoir and man is still unclear 8 after the first sars epidemic there were three incidences of laboratory infections in singapore taiwan and beijing 9 10 11 furthermore in guangdong china sars patients were observed to suffer from mild clinical symptoms 12 it is therefore important to further explore the characteristics of the sars-cov genome and trace the source of the epidemic there were several studies on sars-cov phylogeny and genotyping published immediately after sars was identified according to 4 polymorphism sites ruan et al 13 first genotyped 14 previously published sars-cov genomes at the beginning of may 2003 subsequently li et al 14 proposed genotypes of c and t in 17 sars-cov genomes based on 5 polymorphism sites regional and international transmission types were also proposed 15 16 sars-cov su-10 and cuhk-w1 were genotyped into two different groups even though they were all isolated in hongkong 17 based on the 7 loci of 44 sars-cov genomes c and t genotypes were further modified and named as the yexin and xiaohong genotypes 18 according to 5 polymorphism sites 63 sars-cov genomes were divided into early middle and late phase genotype groups 19 the polymorphism sites analyzed in these papers were almost the same three successful examples have been reported where infection chains have been traced by comparing variations in sars-cov genomes the first sars-cov laboratory infection incidence was confirmed by identifying 13 variant loci in the sars-cov genomes 9 secondly it was found that the sars-cov isolated from the patient with mild clinical symptoms and the sars-cov or sars-cov-like virus isolated from animals resembled each other in the sequence encoding the spike protein 19 this study indicates that virus-carrying animals may be a risk for the investigator thirdly sequence analysis confirmed the laboratory infection of a technician who was working with sars-cov 20 up to date there are already 295 complete or partial sars-cov genome sequences available in genbank a new method of genotyping is proposed in this study the results show that all sars-cov genomes are clustered into three groups and that sars-cov genomes in the second group belong to genotypes c and t these two genotypes can be further divided into 8 sub-genotypes in this study we also analyzed the sars death rate sars-cov origin and population genetics sars-cov zj01 accession no ay297028 was isolated in zhejiang province china 14 other sars-cov genome sequences were downloaded from ncbi genbank database two hundred and ninety-five complete or partial sars-cov genomes were searched after removing shorter and repeated records 101 complete genomes and 44 partial genome sequences were collected for final analysis by

 as can be seen in fig 2a most sars-cov were clustered in accordance with their genotypes some partial genome sequences were situated in this tree such as cuhk-l2 sz1 gz43 hsz-a gd03t0013 bj302-1 hku-65806 and ly could not be properly located in the phylogenetic tree based on 174 loci the genomes of gz-c and qxc1 showed intercrossing features between genotype c and t some sub-genotypes such as c1 c2 t2 and t3 were easily recognized in the spike protein gene tree but some sub-genotypes were intercrossed in the phylogenetic tree of complete genomes the clusters of genotype c and t and 8 sub-types are obvious fig 2b one of the reasons for this might be that the spike protein genes were less informative than the complete genomes 
fig 3
shows that the genetic distance of recent sars-cov genome of gd03t0013 was closer to the first epidemic sars-cov gz02 than to the animal-origin sars-cov sz3 the genetic characteristics of the genotypes were further analyzed based on the sequence polymorphism of the spike protein genes table 4

 based on the new concept of dividing all the 145 sars-cov genome sequences into three groups the origin of group 2 and group 3 assuming group 1 as outer source group was estimated eight candidates including four animal origin genomes of group 1 identified in april to may 2003 three early genomes of hgz8l1-a zs-b and gz02 in sub-genotype c1 of group 2 in january to february 2003 and the genome of gd03t0013 of group 3 in december 2003 were selected to analyze the date when their most recent common ancestor was existed based on analysis of the diversities of spike protein genes the synonymous mutation rate k

  000321 from january 2003 with one month intervals and the date for the most recent common ancestor was estimated to lie in may 2002 range between early march 2002 and late july 2002 information about sars fatality rate and genotypes from all regions are shown in table 5
 comparing sars fatality rates of different regions it was found that sars-cov genomes of genotype t had the highest case fatality rate several studies on sars-cov genome genotyping and grouping have been published 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 some presented the regional and international transmission types according to the epidemic regions and some divided the viruses into early middle and late phase groups according to the time of the sars epidemic in a certain region guangdong of china based on genome characteristics of 145 sars-covs a new concept of three groups two genotypes and eight sub-types was established the genotype c of group 2 in this work was almost compatible with the regional transmission type and the early middle phase groups while genotype t of group 2 was compatible with the international transmission type and the late phase group as well 16 19 one of the advantages of the new classification is that it fits global and regional epidemic feature analysis such as for sars-covs in taiwan and singapore up to date all the genomes from clinical samples in the early middle and late phase of the sars epidemic in these regions belonged to genotype t the concept of dividing all sars-covs into three groups was mainly based on the phylogenetic analysis and the positive darwinian selection because of the limited virus number in group 1 and 3 this grouping has to be further confirmed the source of sars-covs was traced it was clear that genotype t was derived from genotype c 14 18 19 the origins of each sub-genotype were also elucidated 22 23 24 and are consistent with our results but the origin of the sars-cov remains a question and needs further investigation zhao et al 25 analyzed 16 sars-cov genomes and proposed that the closest common ancestor might have existed during the spring of 2002 which is consistent with the date may 2002 estimated by the spike gene synonymous mutation rate of the three groups in this work it is very probable that the three groups originated from an unknown common ancestor the genotype classification of sars-cov plays an important role in tracing and controlling sars prevalence according to genome sequence variation analysis genotype shifts of sars-covs in the main epidemic regions during the first epidemic were obvious the sub-genotypes c1 and c2 that have a closer relationship to the virus of animal origin first appeared in guangdong and then appeared the sub-genotype c3 the dominant viruses in hongkong were of genotype t but genotype c also appeared there similarly although sub-genotype c4 dominated in beijing genotype t also existed there in singapore they had all the genomes of genotypes t mostly of sub-genotypes t1 and t2 the viruses in taiwan were all of genotype t mostly of sub-genotype t4 with more sars-cov genome sequences and more complete epidemiological data released the characteristics of the sars-covs variations in the genotypes as well as the features about the epidemic phases the epidemic regions the clinical symptoms and the viruses adaptation to the human host will become clearer and clearer the genotype was apparently correlated with virulence of the sars-cov sars-cov gd03t0013 was from the patient with mild clinical symptoms and its genome sequence was similar to that of the sub-genotype c1 experiments have also demonstrated that sars-covs of the genotype t had a stronger ability to cause cyto-pathogenic effects cpe than those of the genotype c the cpe of the genotype t remained stable during passages in cell cultures 26 in the first epidemic sars patients in guangzhou seldom suffered from diarrhea and the sars-cov genomes were mainly of the genotype c 27 the majority of sars patients in hongkong however suffered from diarrhea and it turned out that sars-covs of the genotype t dominated 28 sars-covs of different genotypes might have different virulence moreover the serum from mice immunized with inactivated sars-cov bj01 of genotype c is able to neutralize the invasiveness of sars-cov bj01 itself into vero cells 29 further investigations are required to demonstrate whether this serum could prevent the cells from the invasiveness of the sars-cov pumc01 or others of the genotype t if in the future a sars-cov epidemic appears again after rounds of random mutations it might cause slight clinical symptoms at the initial stage of the infection through positive darwinian selection a virus with greater virulence might cause more severe clinical symptoms a period of neutrality selection and negative selection might follow and different symptoms and case fatality rates might appear on the other hand different epidemic features might occur if there are stable intermediate hosts for sars-covs of the group 2 such as sars-cov of genotype t after the first epidemic and these viruses might cause epidemics in man again  identification of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-like virus in a leaf-nosed bat in nigeria

neurological diseases 1 2 coronaviruses were originally divided into three groups based on their antigenic cross-reactivities and nucleotide sequences 3 they have been recently reclassified by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses into 3 genera designated alphacoronavirus former group 1 betacoronavirus former group 2 and gammacoronavirus former group 3 4 whereas the alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses are associated with diseases of mammals including humans the gammacoronaviruses are implicated chiefly in diseases of birds interest in coronaviruses was largely focused on their impact on domestic porcine and avian husbandry and their utility in animal models of virus-induced demyelination 5 until the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome

explore the genetic diversity of coronaviruses and their host range intensified 12 bats are suggested to be important reservoir hosts of many zoonotic viruses with significant impact on human and animal health including lyssaviruses henipaviruses filoviruses and coronaviruses 1317 viruses of bats may be transmitted to humans directly through bites or via exposure to saliva fecal aerosols or infected tissues as well as indirectly through contact with infected intermediate hosts such as swine 18 in the course of a project focused on pathogen discovery in situations where human-bat contact might facilitate more efficient interspecies transmission of emerging viruses we surveyed bats in nigeria through consensus pcr cpcr and unbiased high-throughput pyrosequencing uhts of bat tissue samples we identified a coronavirus that is most closely related to the genus betacoronavirus subgroup 2b which includes sars-cov and sars-cov-like viruses however the genomic organization of this coronavirus obtained from a commersons leaf-nosed bat hipposideros commersoni is unique in that it is comprised of three overlapping open reading frames orfs between the m and n genes and two

glycosylation sites the s protein of zbcov displays major sequence differences compared to that of subgroup 2b covs especially in the s1 domain involved in receptor binding the critical residues suggested to be important for the cleavage of the sars-cov s protein are present in the s protein of zbcov 2325 see fig s1a in the supplemental material motifs at the carboxyl terminus of the s protein that are conserved among coronaviruses are also found in the zbcov s protein including the conserved motif yxkwpwywviwl present as y1237ekwpwyiwl and the cysteine-rich cytoplasmic tail 10 see fig s1b in the supplemental material in addition to the five genes present in all genomes coronaviruses also have several group-specific genes between the s gene and the 3 end of the genome that encode accessory proteins fig 2 26 27 an orf orf 3 encoding a putative 250-aa protein was observed between the s and e proteins of zbcov table 1 orf 3 corresponds to the genomic position of orf 3a in

glycosylation sites in zbcov orf 3 contains only a portion of the cysteine-rich domain identified in the orf 3a protein of sars-cov however the cysteine potentially involved in orf 3a protein polymerization 28 is present in orf 3 no signal peptide yxx or diacidic motifs were identified in orf 3 of zbcov 29 zbcov has a set of orfs located between the m and n genes that are not shared by any of the known coronaviruses these orfs orf 6 orf 7 and orf 8 encode predicted proteins of 49 79 and 218 aa respectively table 1 a trs was identified upstream of orf 7 and orf 8 but not orf 6 orf 6

between the m and n genes is significantly shorter than those observed for subgroup 2b covs see table s8 in the supplemental material alignment of the region between the m and n genes of zbcov with those of subgroup 2b covs indicated large deletions in zbcov see fig s2 in the supplemental material another distinctive genomic feature of zbcov is the presence downstream from the n gene of two conserved motifs corresponding to the conserved stem-loop ii motif s2m 31 a unique s2m is observed in coronaviruses from subgroups 2b 3a and 3c and in astroviruses and in the picornavirus equine rhinitis b virus erbv 3133 see fig s3a in the supplemental material alignment of the 3 end of zbcov with subgroup 2b covs showed deletions in the genome of subgroup 2b covs where the second s2m of zbcov is identified see fig s3b the s2m of zbcov are almost identical in sequence and are separated by 19 nt see fig s3b mfold prediction 34 of rna secondary structure indicated that both s2m fold into rna stem-loop motifs see fig s3c phylogenetic trees constructed from 3clpro rdrp hel s m and n amino acid sequences of zbcov and representative coronaviruses show that zbcov is most closely related to but distinct from the subgroup 2b covs which include sars-cov and sars-cov-like viruses fig 3 this finding is in accord with results obtained from pairwise amino acid comparisons of zbcov and other coronaviruses httpcaitcumccolumbiaedu88deptgreeneidlabidentificationofasars-coronavirus-likevirusinaleaf-nosedbatinnigeriahtml to further define the phylogenetic position of zbcov an additional phylogeny was constructed using a conserved 659-nt sequence of rdrp and the time to the most recent common ancestor tmrca between zbcov and related coronaviruses was estimated based on the best-fit model srd06 with informative rate prior the results of this analysis indicated that zbcov is most closely related to ghanabt-cov a recently identified coronavirus found in bats in ghana 35 fig 4 furthermore zbcov and ghanabt-cov together form a well-supported clade distinct from that of the subgroup 2b covs the tmrca between zbcov and ghanabt-cov was estimated at 1417 years before present ybp 95 highest population density hpd  267 to 3061 ybp the tmrca between the zbcovghanabt-cov clade and subgroup 2b covs was estimated at 3047 ybp 95 hpd  714 to 6205 ybp whereas the tmrca between sars-covs and sars-cov-like viruses was only 515 ybp 95 hpd  132 to 1067 ybp estimates of the tmrcas between subgroup 2b covs and the rest of the coronavirus groups are not provided due to the potential for nucleotide site saturation at deeper phylogenetic levels to artificially create too recent tmrca estimates whereas the mean pairwise nucleotide similarity of the partial rdrp gene region was 85 standard deviation sd  975 within coronavirus subgroups excluding zbcovghanabt-cov the mean pairwise similarity between coronavirus subgroups was 66 sd  514 see fig s4 in the supplemental material based on the results of the mann-whitney u test these distributions are statistically different p  00001 additionally whereas the mean pairwise similarity within the clade zbcovghanabt-cov was 85 sd  901 the pairwise similarity between the clade zbcovghanabt-cov and subgroup 2b covs was only 73 sd  084 based on the results of the mann-whitney u test these distributions are statistically different p  00092 together these findings indicate that the clade containing zbcov and ghanabt-cov should be considered a separate subgroup within group 2 covs distinct from subgroup 2b covs see fig s4 in the supplemental material differences in phylogenetic relationships and genomic organization and the low amino acid similarities of orf 3 and the s protein of zbcov compared to the orf 3a and s proteins of subgroup 2b covs suggest that zbcov represents a new subgroup of coronaviruses within the group 2 covs although zbcov has features found in subgroup 2b covs including the trs a unique plpro orfs between the m and n genes and the presence of the s2m zbcov forms a unique branch distinct from subgroup 2b covs in all phylogenetic trees analyzed furthermore it differs from subgroup 2b covs in that zbcov contains three versus four to five orfs between the m and n genes and has two versus one s2m whereas the s proteins of subgroup 2b covs share 78 to 98 aa sequence identity the s protein of zbcov has only 36 to 38 identity in the deduced amino acid sequence with those of subgroup 2b covs despite limited primary sequence conservation of the spike protein among zbcov and subgroup 2b covs particularly in the s1 domain pfam analyses indicated the presence of a receptor domain that binds to the receptor ace2 the cellular receptor for sars-cov 36 however the residues in sars-cov that interact with the human ace2 molecule are not conserved in zbcov suggesting that human ace2 is not a bona fide receptor for zbcov 37 orf 3 located between the s and e proteins of zbcov is slightly shorter than the 3a proteins of subgroup 2b covs and has at most only 22 aa identity to the 3a proteins of subgroup 2b covs in contrast the 3a proteins of subgroup 2b covs share 81 to 98 aa identity orf 3 is predicted to contain four transmembrane domains with extracellular n and c termini in contrast orf 3a of sars-cov is predicted to contain three transmembrane domains with extracellular n termini and intracellular c termini 28 29 whereas four o glycosylation sites are predicted in the orf 3a protein of sars-cov 38 only two putative o glycosylation sites were identified in the orf 3 of zbcov the 3a protein of sars-cov has a cysteine-rich region important for polymerization and ion channel activity 28 as well as yxx and diacidic motifs suggested to be involved in the intracellular trafficking 29 these domains were recently suggested to be important for the proapoptotic function of orf 3a of sars-cov 39 however orf 3 of zbcov contains only a portion of the cysteine-rich domain and has no yxx diacidic motifs in contrast to human and civet sars-cov and bat rf12004 there is no orf 3b in zbcov the 3b protein may function as an interferon antagonist 40 zbcov contains a unique set of orfs located between the m and n genes in subgroup 2b covs orf 6 orf 7 and orf 8 between the m and n genes do not overlap in contrast the three orfs between the m and n genes overlap in zbcov alignment with subgroup 2b covs indicated deletions in zbcov and as a result one continuous orf orf 8 is present in zbcov in place of orfs 7a 7b 8 8a and 8b of subgroup 2b covs similar to sars-cov the putative products of orf 6 orf 7 and orf 8 of zbcov show no sequence homology to other viral proteins no trs upstream of orf 6 is found suggesting that if orf 6 encodes a bona fide protein that protein is likely expressed by the subgenomic rna m there is precedent in sars-cov for functional bicistronic rnas in the expression of orf 3b orf 7b orf 8b and orf 9b 26 41 coronaviruses possess accessory genes the size and location of which are group specific 2 by analogy to sars-cov orf 6 orf 7 and orf 8 of zbcov may encode accessory proteins important for virus-host interactions that may contribute to virulence and pathogenesis 26 recent studies suggest that the sars-cov accessory proteins 6 and 7b are incorporated into virus particles and that 3a 7a and 9b are structural components of the virion 26 41 42 the sars-cov accessory proteins are suggested to have biological functions that include virus release interferon antagonism apoptosis induction and inhibition of cellular protein synthesis 26 41 another unique feature of zbcov is the presence of two highly conserved rna sequences s2m downstream of the n gene a single s2m is identified at the 3 end of the genomes of members of several rna virus families including the coronaviridae and astroviridae as well as the picornavirus erbv 3133 recent data suggest that the sars-cov s2m rna is a functional molecular mimic of the 530 stem-loop region in small-subunit ribosomal rna which could facilitate viral hijacking of the hosts protein synthesis machinery 43 the presence of a second s2m in zbcov may further increase the efficiency of this process interestingly secondary structures downstream of the n gene including bulged stem-loop and pseudoknot structures are also identified in the genomes of subgroup 2a and 2c covs 44 45 lagos bat virus family rhabdoviridae genus lyssavirus was initially identified in nigeria in the 1950s the discovery of zbcov in a bat of the genus hipposideros family hipposideridae is the first identification of a coronavirus in wildlife from nigeria recently bat coronaviruses closely related to zbcov were isolated from roundleaf bats hipposideros caffer and hipposideros ruber in ghana a country that is close to nigeria 35 phylogenetic analysis indicates that zbcov and ghanabt-cov form a unique clade that is distinct from those in subgroup 2b covs however as the only sequence available for ghanabt-cov is a fragment of the rdrp gene a comparison of the genome organization between zbcov and ghanabt-cov is not possible our findings and recent published data wherein a sars-cov-like virus was found to lack orf 8 suggest that there is considerable diversity in the genome organization of sars-cov-like viruses 46 sars-cov-like viruses have been isolated from various rhinolophid bats family rhinolophidae genus rhinolophus common insectivorous bats found in africa and eurasia however despite extensive studies no sars-cov-like viruses have been reported in hipposideros sp bats in china 32 the rhinolophus species suggested as reservoirs of sars-cov-like viruses are not present in africa a sequence fragment of a sars-cov-like virus was identified in kenya in bats of the chaerephon genus family molossidae 47 and antibodies reactive with sars-cov antigen have also been detected in the sera of seven different genera of insectivorous and fruit bats sampled in central and southern africa 48 in concert these findings suggest that there may be no strict species-specific host restriction of sars-cov-like viruses in african bats our phylogenetic analysis indicates that the clade containing zbcov and ghanabt-cov occupies an ancestral position to the group 2b covs which include sars-cov and sars-cov-like viruses similar to previous estimates the tmrca of these two clades was estimated at 3047 ybp although with large 95 hpds although sars-cov-like viruses have been identified exclusively in bats in china a recent sequence fragment 120 bp recovered from a kenyan bat was found to occupy a position just outside subgroup 2b and may represent the ancestral african lineage of all subgroup 2b covs 47 together with the position of the african clade of zbcovghanabt-cov relative to subgroup 2b covs this finding suggests that a migration event from africa to china within the last 100 to 1000 years may have resulted in the subgroup 2b lineage of covs indeed the geographic distribution and the phylogenetic relationships of bat coronaviruses seen both here fig 4 and in previous work 35 suggest the presence of multiple independent migration events between africa and asia throughout the history of bat coronaviruses additional sequence data for the bat coronaviruses identified in kenya along with increased sampling for coronaviruses in africa as well as central and eastern asia will likely be necessary to unveil the timing and origin of this diverse group of coronaviruses bats are important reservoir hosts of zoonotic viruses with significant impact on human health including rabies nipah virus hendra virus zaire ebola virus marburg virus and sars-cov the wide genetic diversity that exists among zoonotic viruses in bats may allow an increased emergent potential of interspecies variants that may cause outbreaks of disease in humans and domestic animals the giant leaf-nosed bat hipposideros commersoni is widespread in sub-saharan africa from gambia to ethiopia mozambique and madagascar but little is known concerning its ecology population biology or vector competence clearly in order to enhance our knowledge of the diversity and cooccurrence of potential reservoir hosts it is essential to better understand emerging pathogen dynamics and public health relevance as a means to prevent and control future disease outbreaks during june 2008 bats were collected with mist netting in caves and around human dwellings or manually from roost locations near idanre and zaria nigeria all bats appeared clinically normal captured bats were anesthetized by intramuscular inoculation with ketamine hydrochloride 005 to 01 mgg of body weight and euthanized under sedation by intracardiac exsanguination and cervical dislocation the species of each captured bat was recorded as well as the sex forearm and body lengths in cm and weight all samples were initially stored transported on ice packs and stored thereafter at 20c until shipment on dry ice and final storage at 80c no lyssavirus-specific antigens were identified in bat brains by use of direct fluorescent

the genomic footprints of sars-cov-2 transmission tommy tsan yuk lam  49 words there is considerable public and scientific interest on the origin spread and evolution of sars-cov-2 a recent study by lu et al 1 conducted genomic sequencing and analysis of bayesian framework 8 it is anticipated that such integrative analysis of sars-cov-2 including the work by lu et al 1 and a more recent one in belgium by dellicour et al 9 could greatly promote our understanding of virus dynamics and interaction with hosts and environments and might pave the way for genomic surveillance studies of sars-cov-2 in the near future despite the usefulness of genomic data and phylogenetic analysis the resolution of the sars-cov-2 phylogeny in the early phase of pandemic remains low possibly due to the slower genetic drift of the virus as well as the relatively higher intensity of sampling in some regions many lineages are defined by only one mutation and hence the phylogenetic  sars-cov-2 in guangdong revealing its early transmission out of hubei and shedding light on the effectiveness of controlling local transmission chains the outbreak of sars-cov-2 causing the disease known as covid-19 was initially reported in wuhan city of hubei province of china in december 2019 and soon swept across the nation and then over the world within two months leading to its declaration as a pandemic by world health organisation who on 11th march 2020 as of 20th may 2020 the death toll of covid-19 reached 318789 with a total of nearly five million confirmed cases across all continents 2  the enormous health and economic impacts caused by this virus at such an unprecedent speed has raised considerable public interest fuelling research on its origin spread and evolution genomic data and its analysis have been key tools in studying emerging pathogens as such 3  the recent identification and genomic characterisation of coronaviruses in bats and pangolins that are evolutionarily related to human sars-cov-2 have suggested the former could act as the zoonotic origins for the latter 4 5  other pressing questions for understanding the ongoing pandemic include identifying means by which sars-cov-2 spread across china and the world from its starting place and whether the disease control measures effectively suppress the introduced infections against further transmission several studies using mathematical modelling of the covid-19 incidence and other coronavirus infections have suggested the effectiveness of disease control such as social distancing and city lockdown 6 7  but these methods seldom assess individual transmission it is evident in literature that genomic information of pathogens provide valuable empirical information about their transmission histories 2  such as the identification of transmission chains through phylogenetic analysis of the genome sequences as illustrated in the work done by lu et al 1  in addition to revealing the evolutionary process of the pathogen and acting as a proxy of disease transmission history phylogenetic trees also serve as versatile frameworks for comparative analysis of virus genetics and phenotypes disease epidemiology and clinical manifestations and population demography and environment thus facilitating identification of a possible interplay between these various aspects in disease dynamics  figure 1  there has been active research in the methodology for integrating multidimensional data related to pathogen and disease for statistical inference especially in j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f structure could be easily distorted by including sequences that carry high number of sequencing errors or mutations introduced over longer passage history in virus culture another issue is the variable intensity of virus genome sampling in different regions this has been seen in the sars-cov-2 data set used by lu et al which has relatively few genomes outside guangdong provinces eg 32 genomes from hubei province which has over 60000 cases at the time such undersampling in the regions with high disease incidence could result in phylogenetic analyses that underestimate the virus exportation from these regions to other regions 10 such as guangdong and hence the extent of local transmission in guangdong might be overestimated 1  notably the sars-cov-2 genome data set publicly available at the time of this writing remain highly uneven across different countries for instance the gisaid database httpswwwgisaidorg had only 5 full genome sequences from iran where over 120000 cases have been reported in contrast it has about 1300 genomes from around 7000 cases reported in australia therefore any interpretation in the phylogenetic analysis involving those undersampled regions has to be highly cautious all these sequence limitations undermine the confidence of the interpretations using phylogenetics and particularly require a conservative approach to explain the results estimated from the complex phylogenetic models and multidimensional data with many countries investing their efforts into the genomic surveillance of sars-cov-2 the data sharing on the gisaid public database has now reached 25995 full genomes with an unprecedent speed although there is no doubt that the challenges of low phylogenetic resolution and biased sampling will remain it is anticipated that future research of these sars-cov-2 genomes will take on these challenges with more robust statistical methods and cautious data interpretation and will potentially provide important insights into sars-cov-2

was found in palm civets from live animal markets in guangdong province guan et al 2003 however the initial hypothesis that civets may act as animal reservoir of sars-cov was soon overturned by several observations firstly sarsr-cov was only detected in civets from the market but not those in the wild kan et al 2005 tu et al 2004 secondly the high ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutation rates kaks ratios of the spike s open reading frame orf 3a and non-structural protein nsp genes in civet sarsr-covs collected in both the 2003 and the minor 2004 outbreaks suggested that the virus was undergoing rapid evolutionary gene adaptation in civets song et al 2005 thirdly compared with sars-cov collected from human during the 2003 epidemic functional changes have been observed in the s protein of civet sarsr-cov and the sars-cov isolated from the 2004 minor outbreak the latter showed less efficient use of the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor li et al 2005b and demonstrated resistance to antibody inhibition yang et al 2005 finally while significant levels of antibody to sars-cov were detected in 80 of the civets from one animal market in guangzhou low seroprevalence rates in civets from various civet farms in china suggested that civets were largely brought to the animal market infection-free guan et al 2003 tu et al 2004 the sarsr-cov was likely

nine sarsr-cov genomes have been sequenced from 2003 to 2018 these include 274 genomes from human 18 from civets and 47 from bats the human sars-cov and civet sarsr-cov were collected in 20032004 while bat sarsr-covs were continuously detected even after the cessation of the sars epidemic in this article we review our current understanding of the molecular epidemiology evolution and phylogeny of sarsr-covs based on analysis of these 339 genomes the genome size of the sars-cov varies from 290 kb to 302 kb its genome structure follows the characteristic gene order of other known covs the 5 two thirds of the genome comprises orf1ab encoding replicase polyproteins while the 3 one third consists of genes encoding structural proteins including s envelope e membrane m and n proteins fig 1
 both the 5 and 3 ends of the sars-cov genome contain short untranslated regions the translational product of orf1ab is cleaved by proteases encoded by sars-cov itself into 16 nsps which include major enzymes such as papain-like proteases plpro chymotrypsin-like protease 3clpro rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp and helicase hel fig 1 in contrast to the genome of viruses belonging to lineage a betacoronavirus recently renamed as subgenera embecovirus haemagglutinin-esterase gene is absent from the genome of sars-cov in addition sars-cov contains 67 accessory proteins encoded by orf3a orf3b orf6 orf7a orf7b and orf8 or orf8a and orf8b as a result of a 29-nucleotide nt deletion this is unique to lineage b betacoronavirus a subgenus recently renamed sarbecovirus and contains all sarsr-covs fig 2

cytokines such as rantes regulated on activation normal t cell expressed and secreted also known as c-c motif chemokine ligand 5 ccl5 and cxcl8 c-x-c motif chemokine ligand 8 protein 3b inhibits type i interferon and also induces apoptosis protein 6 inhibits interferon signaling and stimulates dna synthesis protein 7a activates nf-b nuclear factor kappa b and mapk8 mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 for cxcl8 and rantes production the function of protein 7b is not well characterized yet orf8 is present in all sarsr-cov genomes in bats and civets as well as in sars-covs isolated from human during the early phase of the epidemic protein 8 activates the atf6 activating transcription factor 6 branch of unfolded protein response in the genomes of sars-covs isolated from human during the late phase of the epidemic there was a signature 29-nt deletion in orf8 splitting it into two separate orfs 8a and 8b protein 8a includes caspase-dependent apoptosis whereas protein 8b modulates cellular dna synthesis before the sars epidemic there were just around 10 covs with complete genome sequences available these covs were classified into three groups group 1 group 2 and group 3 in 2011 the coronavirus study group of the international committee for taxonomy of viruses renamed these three groups into three genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus de groot et al 2011 when sars-cov was first discovered in 2003 phylogenetic analysis of the sars-cov genome showed that it occupied a unique position in betacoronavirus which was subsequently placed into the subgenus sarbecovirus the traditional betacovs eg mouse hepatitis virus human cov oc43 bovine cov were classified as embecovirus fig 2 after the sars epidemic an unprecedented number of novel covs were discovered lau et al 2016 lau et al 2007 lau et al 2012a lau et al 2012b lau et al 2014 woo et al 2005 woo et al 2014a woo et al 2014b this led to the description of lineage c betacoronavirus which comprises important members such as tylonycteris bat coronavirus hku4 pipistrellus bat coronavirus hku5 hypsugo bat coronavirus hku25 and middle east respiratory syndrome cov lau et al 2013 lau et al 2018b woo et al 2007 woo et al 2006a and lineage d betacoronavirus lau et al 2010b as well as a novel genus deltacoronavirus lau et al 2018a woo et al 2012 woo et al 2017 fig 2 lineage c and lineage d betacoronavirus were now renamed as subgenera merbecovirus and nobecovirus since its first discovery in chinese horseshoe bats in 2004 lau et al 2005 sarsr-covs have been continuously found in various horseshoe bat species in the last 13 years drexler et al 2010 ge et al 2013 he et al 2014 hu et al 2017 lau et al 2005 lau et al 2010a li et al 2005a tang et al 2006 wu et al 2016 yang et al 2013 yang et al 2015 zeng et al 2016 this is in contrast to the case for civets and human where sarsr-covs were only found in 20032004 and never reported afterward for the 47 bat sarsr-cov genomes 30 are from chinese horseshoe bats 9 from greater horseshoe bats 2 from big-eared horseshoe bat 2 from least horseshoe bat rhinolophus pusillus rp and 1 each from intermediate horseshoe bat rhinolophus affinis ra blasiuss horseshoe bat rhinolophus blasii rb stoliczkas asian trident bat aselliscus stoliczkanus as in the neighboring family hipposideridae and wrinkled-lipped free-tailed bat chaerephon plicata cp in the genetically more distant family molossidae sarsr-covs have also been detected in countries other than china including thailand italy luxembourg bulgaria slovenia hungary japan kenya etc however only partial sequences were available for these isolates nevertheless the immediate progenitor of sars-cov has not been pinpointed among the 45 sarsr-cov genomes from bats in china 11 of them were from hong kong 2 were from guangdong 2 from guangxi 5 from hubei 20 from yunnan and one each from shaanxi shanxi jilin guizhou hebei respectively overall it is observed that the sarsr-cov genomes from bats in yunnan possess relatively higher whereas those from guangdong jilin shanxi and hebei possess relatively lower nt identity to those from civets fig 3a this is an interesting phenomenon since the sars epidemic that emerged in late 2002 was first noticed in guangdong province as an outbreak of acute community-acquired atypical pneumonia syndrome severe cases were later retrospectively traced back to five cities around guangzhou with the index case reported in foshan a city 24 km away from guangzhou the second case was a chef from heyuan who worked in a restaurant in shenzhen who contacted with wild game-food animals regularly this mismatch between clinical events and apparent gradient of nt identity could either be due to a missing link during evolutionary adaptation among the sarsr-covs in different provinces or simply as a result of sampling error the high frequency of homologous rna recombination is one of the major factors contributing to a plastic genome underpinning the evolutionary force in covs this has resulted in different genotypes or even different covs adapted to new hosts herrewegh et al 1998 lau et al 2011 terada et al 2014 woo et al 2006b as for sarsr-covs it is evident from both multiple alignments and phylogenetic analyses that some genes of a particular sarsr-cov from bats may possess higher while other genes possess much lower nt identity to the corresponding genes of sarsr-cov genomes from humancivets resulting in shifting of phylogenetic position in different phylogenetic trees this phenomenon is frequently observed in sarsr-covs and likely explains the generation of novel sarsr-covs that could jump from bat to civet and subsequently to human trimers of s protein form spikes on the surface of covs particles it comprises two functionally distinct subunits  s1 and s2 domains which are involved in receptor binding and fusion respectively like other class i viral fusion proteins the s protein undergoes a series of events including receptor recognition proteolytic cleavage to shed the s1 subunit and conformational changes in s2 that ultimately lead to fusion of the viral and host membranes it has been well established that human sars-cov utilizes ace2 as a functional receptor the receptor-binding motifs in the c-terminal domain of s1 are implicated in receptor recognition substitutions within the s1 receptor-binding domain rbd confers adaptability to new or orthologous entry receptors thus altering the viral tropism hulswit et al 2016 undoubtedly the ability to bind human ace2 is an indispensable step in establishing cross-species transmission as we have previously hypothesized the five amino acid aa deletion twelve aa deletion as well as aa substitutions at 5 critical residues for binding serve as determining factors for the s protein-ace2 interaction table 1
 a critical pre-requisite for reliable ace2 utilization is the absence of 5 aa and 12 aa deletions and preferably the presence of at least two out of five human-adapted residues based on these analyses sarsr-rs-batcov wiv1 is one of the strains most advantageously conformed genotypically for ace2 utilization it has been shown to be able to directly infect well-differentiated primary human airway epithelial cell cultures menachery et al 2016 in addition neutralization assays using convalescent sera from sars-cov infected patients showed robust neutralization against tissue culture infectious dose 50 of wiv1 ge et al 2013 sarsr-rs-batcov rsshc014 a strain discovered in chinese horseshoe bats in 2012 contains two of the five aa residues in civet strain civet007 but none of the five human-adapted residues it retains both the 5 aa and 12 aa deletion sites this genotype is shared by sarsr-rs-batcov rs4231 and rs4084 recombinant mouse-adapted sars-cov expressing the s protein of rsshc014 was still able to utilize ace2 for viral entry causing cytopathic changes in vero cells and weight loss in mice model despite the apparent failure in pseudovirus infectivity assay menachery et al 2015 however significantly slower viral replication rate was observed suggesting that deletions in rbds were more critical in receptor recognition while the presence of ace2-adapted critical residues modulated entry efficiency in contrary to the wiv1 strain neither neutralizing human monoclonal antibody nor existing double-inactivated whole sars-cov vaccine provided protective effect against infection caused by shc014-harboring recombinant virus strain indicating key difference in aa sequences determining antigenicity menachery et al 2015 a phylogenetic tree was constructed from the rbds of sarsr-covs fig 4
 surprisingly sarsr-ra-batcov lyra11 a strain discovered in intermediate horseshoe bat in baoshan yunnan he et al 2014 around 375 km from kunming sits closest to the civethuman sarsr-covs despite its lower overall nt identity this is likely due to the presence of 7 nt in civethuman sars-cov that is found exclusively in sarsr-ra-batcov lyra11 such a unique s gene in relation to civethuman sars-cov would therefore challenge the previous hypothesis that the origin of rbd was solely from chinese horseshoe bats in kunming nevertheless the s proteins of the majority of bat sarsr-covs found in chinese horseshoe bats in various part of china including yunnan resemble the genotype of sarsr-rs-batcov hku3 but not the human ace2-utilizing genotype of sarsr-rs-batcov wiv1 this raises question on how sarsr-batcovs manage to have two distinct genotypes of s infecting the same host rs there is a possibility that two cellular receptors for sarsr-covs are present in chinese horseshoe bats interestingly two novel sarsr-rp-batcov strains zxc21 and zc45 isolated from least horseshoe bat in zhoushan zhejiang province in eastern china were shown to be able to infect suckling rats causing inflammation in the brain tissue and histological changes in the lung and intestine despite failed viral isolation in veroe6 cells phylogenetically these two strains represented a separate clade lying between the susceptible clade of sarsr-ra-batcov lyra11 and the non-susceptible clade of sarsr-rf-batcov rf1 however the mechanism of such infectivity in suckling rats was not investigated further especially in light of the two retained deletion sites in the s genes of zxc21 and zc45 which should have imposed inter-species barrier in terms of receptor specificity based on previous discussion hu et al 2018 among all the horseshoe bats sarsr-covs are most commonly found in chinese horseshoe bats and greater horseshoe bats detailed analysis of their genomes revealed several intriguing phenomena firstly orf1a and orf1b in sarsr-rf-batcov ynlf31c isolated from greater horseshoe bats in lufeng yunnan by our group has the highest nt identity to civet sarsr-cov especially at the regions nsp5 nsp10 nsp12 and nsp13 fig 3a this raised the possibility that lufeng yunnan could be a potential gene pool for the progenitor of orf1 of sars-cov secondly as previously illustrated for most regions along the genome of sarsr-cov except orf8 sarsr-rs-batcovs from chinese horseshoe bats are predominantly closer to civet sarsr-cov however the orf8 of sarsr-rf-batcov has higher aa identity to civet sarsr-cov orf8 in addition v90 and i113 are the two rf-specific residues present in the orf8 of sarsr-rf-batcov rf4092 which could evolutionarily bridge the orf8 of sarsr-rf-batcov to sarsr-rs-batcov that had very high identity to civethuman sars-cov fig 5
 sars-rf-batcov was thus hypothesized to be the origin of human sars-cov orf8 gene through recombination events in fact at least three genotypes of orf8 have been found to circulate in nature wu et al 2016 type i is genetically closest to orf8 of civet sarsr-cov 962981 nt identity there are eleven such strains isolated from bats so far with eight of them originating from chinese horseshoe bats and three from greater horseshoe bats type ii orf8 has lower 708828 nt identity to orf8 of civet sarsr-cov it is prevalent only in sarsr-rf-batcov and demonstrates genetic stability regardless of geographical distribution with similar orf8s detected in korea shanxi hubei and hebei sarsr-rs-batcov has not been found to process type ii orf8 yet another strain the sarsr-rp-batcov f46 isolated from least horseshoe bats processes an orf8 with a phylogenetic position right between type i and type ii orf8s with 932 nt identity to civet sarsr-cov further complicating the analysis fig 6
 the rest of the orf8 genes from sequenced sarsr-batcov strains belong to type iii these type iii orf8 genes possess 539577 nt identity to the orf8 of civet sarsr-cov and have the greatest genetic distance observed over the whole genome of sarsr-cov fig 3b they are detected across a wide range of bat species including r sinicus r macrotis r pusillus r affinis a stoliczkanus and c plicata except r ferrumequinum in which type iii orf8 has not been found in short the orf8 of sarsr-rf-batcov from greater horseshoe bats is phylogenetically closer to orf8 of humancivet sars-cov as mentioned above orf8 in the late-phase human epidemic was split into 8a and 8b due to a unique 29 nt deletion a similar 5-nt deletion was observed in the type i orf8 isolated from the strain sarsr-rs-batcov rs4084 however since the majority of sarsr-rs-batcovs orf8 genes belong to the type iii orf8 genotype it raises the speculation that this minority of type i orf8 plays a non-essential role in the chinese horseshoe bats host environment in a recent study recombinant sars-cov carrying three forms of orf8 were constructed including complete orf8 as seen in the early phase of the 2003 human epidemic and civets orf8 that contained the characteristic 29 nt deletion and a variant strain with orf8 replaced by a 5 nt spacer sequence replication assay in verofm cells demonstrated a phenotypic hierarchy that the infectious clone with full type i orf8 exhibited significantly more efficient growth than other variants the same hierarchy of viral replication was observed in human airway epithelial cell cultures and several non-host cell lines transduced to express human ace2 including r alcyone lung epithelial cell line cotton rat airway epithelial cell line and goat and sheep lung cell lines this study suggests that the 29 nt deletion actually conferred a loss of viral fitness during the initial phase of human-to-human transmission contradicting the previous belief that the truncated products orf8a and orf8b favored adaptation to human muth et al 2018 complete genome analysis has been carried out for all sequenced sarsr-cov with respect to civet sarsr-cov the importance of civet sarsr-cov is underlined by its close genetic relationship to human sars-cov along the entire genome and especially at the rbd region where nt identity approaches 988998 moreover the genetic diversity within the group of civet sarsr-cov strains is minimal further supporting that civets are only recently infected adaptation of sarsr-batcov to civet as intermediate amplification host is likely needed which is further corroborated by the phylogenetic position of civet ace2 in-between bat and human ace2 recently direct bat-to-human transmission of sarsr-cov was proposed by some groups in view of the fact that some sarsr-batcovs could utilize human ace2 receptors in vitro and that seropositive sera against sarsr-batcovs were detected in yunnan residents menachery et al 2015 wang et al 2018 despite the fact that humancivet sars-cov has never been reported in yunnan our findings provide substantial evidence against this hypothesis from a phyloepidemiologic point of view and demonstrated the significance of an intermediate host during the transmission cascade fig 3 referring to fig 3a sarsr-rs-batcov rs4084 was one of the two strains that possess the highest genome identity to civethuman sarsr-cov it is so far the only sarsr-batcov that possessed at least 70 nt identity in all parts of the genome including the four hypervariable regions the region sharing lowest similarity to civethuman sarsr-cov was the n-terminal domain ntd of the s protein which was likely non-critical as mentioned above sarsr-rs-batcov rs4084 was predicted to be able to utilize human ace2 as functional receptor since its rbd region is genetically similar to rsshc014 sarsr-rs-batcov rs4084 has not been studied either as whole virus or in the form of recombinant virus in terms of accessory protein function tissue infectivity assay and replication kinetics leaving a potential field for future investigations animal experiment using civet model would offer great promise in the studying of such virus along with other sarsr-batcovs that could utilize human ace2 the 300 genome sequences of sars-cov in human civets and bats accumulated in the last 15 years allowed us to understand the cause of such a highly fatal epidemic that affected us in a global scale in 2003 after 15 years of work we are now much closer to fully understand the origin of sars-cov and its evolution as genomes with fragments that contain gene sequences with higher and higher nt identities to the sars-cov found in human were observed our current model on the origin of sars is that the human sars-cov that caused the epidemic in 2003 was probably a result of multiple recombination events from a number of sars-cov ancestors yunnan is the province in china with the largest diversity of horseshoe bat species it is also the area shown to have a high variety of sars-cov ancestors further in-depth molecular epidemiology studies in this and other provinces in its proximity including guangxi and guangdong will hopefully give us an even clearer picture on the origin and early evolution of sars-cov  strong evolutionary convergence of receptor-binding protein spike between covid-19 and sars-related coronaviruses yonghua wu  coronavirus disease 2019 and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-related coronaviruses eg 2019-ncov and sars-cov are phylogenetically distantly related but both are capable of infecting human hosts via the same receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and cause similar clinical and pathological features suggesting their phenotypic convergence yet the molecular basis that underlies their phenotypic convergence remains unknown here we used a recently developed molecular phyloecological approach to examine the molecular basis leading to their phenotypic convergence our genome-level analyses show that the spike protein which is responsible for receptor binding has undergone significant darwinian selection along the branches related to 2019-ncov and sars-cov further examination shows an unusually high proportion of evolutionary convergent amino acid sites in the receptor binding domain rbd of the spike protein between covid-19 and sars-related cov clades leading to the phylogenetic uniting of their rbd protein sequences in addition to the spike protein we also find the evolutionary convergence of its partner protein orf3a suggesting their possible co-evolutionary convergence our results demonstrate a strong adaptive evolutionary convergence between covid-19 and sars-related cov possibly facilitating their adaptation to similar or identical receptors finally it should be noted that many observed bat sars-like covs that have an evolutionary convergent rbd sequence with 2019-ncov and sars-cov may be preadapted to human host receptor ace2 and hence would be potential new coronavirus sources to infect humans in the future  the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov also called severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov-2 has caused the current outbreak of coronavirus disease covid-19 which has emerged as a serious public health concern the clinical and pathological features caused by 2019-ncov resemble those seen in sars 1-3  which is caused by sars coronavirus sars-cov both 2019-ncov and sars-cov have been determined to be of bat origin with possible intermediate hosts prior to infecting humans 45  phylogenetic studies have shown that 2019-ncov and sars-cov belong to the subgenus sarbecovirus but they are distantly related 5-8  with a sequence identity of 796 at the whole-genome level 5  one recent study showed that 2019-ncov is more similar to a bat coronavirus ratg13 with a sequence identity of 962 at the whole-genome level than many other coronaviruses from different hosts suggesting a phylogenetic affinity of 2019-ncov to bat coronavirus compared with sars-cov 5  despite their relatively distant phylogenetic relationships 2019-ncov and sars-cov are both known to be capable of infecting humans using the same cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 56910  and their protein structures of receptor-binding protein spike s are found to be highly similar to each other 1011  suggesting their phenotypic convergence the spike protein is responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion and it is important for host tropism and transmission capacity 6  the spike protein of coronaviruses comprises two subunits s1 and s2 the s1 subunit contains a receptorbinding domain rbd which harbors a receptor-binding motif rbm to make complete contact with the receptor ie ace2 1213  considering that 2019-ncov and sars-cov are distantly related but show high similarity in the rbd protein structure and can use the same cell receptor ace2 5-11  an evolutionary convergence may have occurred between them in the present study we employ a recently developed molecular phyloecological approach 14-16  which uses a comparative phylogenetic analysis of functional gene sequences to determine the genetic basis of phenotypic evolution and we examine the possible molecular basis underlying the phenotypic convergence between 2019-ncov and sars-cov our results reveal positive selection signals and evolutionary convergent amino acid sites of the spike protein in both 2019-ncov and sars-cov and their related coronaviruses providing new insights into understanding the evolutionary origin of their phenotypic convergence we used likelihood ratio tests based on the branch and branch-site models implemented in the codeml program of paml 17 to examine the possible darwinian selection of all 11 genes annotated in the 2019-ncov genome nc045512 positively selected genes psgs were found by the branch-site model  table 1  independent of the initial value variation of parameters kappa and  specifically for the branches leading to 2019-ncov and sars-cov no psgs were found nor were psgs found along the branches leading to their sister coronaviruses however we detected psgs along the ancestral branch branch c of 2019-ncov and its sister taxon ratg13 as well as along the ancestral branch branch k of sars-cov and its sister taxa wiv16 and rs4231 table 1  fig 1  for branch c three psgs s orf1ab and n were found and for branch k only one gene s was found to be under positive selection table 1  orf1ab encodes replicase and n encodes nucleocapsid 18  intriguingly the s gene was subject to darwinian selection in both branches c and k this gene encodes the spike protein which mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion 6  the finding of darwinian selection on the spike protein may suggest its adaptive evolution to the host receptors to further examine the possible adaptive evolution of 2019-ncov and sars-cov to a human host we used relax 19 to analyze the relative selection intensity change of the 11 genes along the branches leading to 2019-ncov and sars-cov compared with their most recent ancestors branches c and k respectively tables s1-2 among the 11 genes examined gene s along the 2019-ncov branch exhibited a significant selection intensification signal k  3054 p  0000 table s1 fig s1  and this remained robust in four independent runs we also found that the orf6 gene showed slight selection intensification k  181 p  0000 along the sars-cov branch table  s2  while its statistical significance only received two supports among five independent runs for the selectively intensified gene s along the 2019-ncov branch 046 of the amino acid sites about five amino acids were under positive selection while most sites 8663 were under purification selection table s1  this may suggest that 2019-ncov was subject to an adaptive evolution during its adaption to possible intermediate andor human hosts given the positive selection of the s gene in both branches c and k we further examined its positive selection signals using branch-site model along all other main branches  fig 1 to test whether the positive selection uniquely occurred along the branches related to 2019-ncov and sars-cov our results showed positive selection signals along 10 out of 45 branches examined fig 1 table s3  this may suggest that the s gene was widely subject to darwinian selection in different coronavirus strains indicating that it may be crucial for the successful survival of coronaviruses further analyses of positive selection sites showed that most positive selection sites among all 12 branches under positive selection were located within subunit 1 of s gene  table 1 table s3  which is used for receptor binding this may suggest that there are strong selection pressures of different coronavirus strains for their own receptor binding given the selection intensification of s gene in 2019-ncov since its evolutionary divergence from ratg13 we conducted comparative sequence analyses between the two we found that there were more than 20 amino acid differences between them and most of them were located within rbd especially rbm fig s2  suggesting a high variability of rbm given the importance of rbm for receptor binding we further conducted a comparative sequence analysis among all the coronavirus strains studied to examine its variability the results showed high sequence variability with insertion andor deletion and amino acid substitutions among the coronavirus strains studied fig 2  despite the high variability of rbm strikingly we found that sars-cov and its phylogenetic relatives-including wiv16 kt444582 rs4231 ky417146 rs7327 ky417151 rs9401 ky417152 and btrs-betacovyn2018b mk211376 called sars-related cov here shared many identical or nearly identical amino acids with their phylogenetically distant coronavirus strains including 2019-ncov and ratg13 which we called covid-19-related cov fig 2  these shared amino acids were clearly distinct from bat sars-like cov that were phylogenetic intermediates between them fig 2  further analyses showed that such identical amino acids shared between sars-related cov and covid-19-related cov were not restricted to rbm but rather they were scattered throughout the spike protein with a total of 32 such sites which were centered on rbd 28 sites in total fig s3  to further examine whether such similarity occurred in other proteins we analyzed all 11 genes studied among these coronaviruses and we found that one additional gene orf3a contained eight such sites fig 1  the existence of these shared amino acids between sars-related cov and covid-19-related cov may suggest their high sequence similarity in support of this we reconstructed maximum likelihood and neighbor-joining phylogenies using full-length rbd protein sequences and both showed that sars-related cov and covid-19-related cov were grouped in the same clade with relatively high support which is consistent with two previous studies 67  at the same time their phylogenetic intermediates were clustered in distinct clades fig 3  fig s4  the phylogenetic uniting of sars-related cov and covid-19-related cov provide evidence of their high similarity of rbd protein sequences given their genome-level phylogenetic disparity the high similarity of rbd protein sequences between sars-related cov and covid-19-related cov may suggest their evolutionary convergence in the spike protein to test this possibility we used an empirical bayes approach in paml 17 to reconstruct ancestral  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license authorfunder it is made available under a the copyright holder for this preprint which was not peer-reviewed is the  httpsdoiorg10110120200304975995 doi biorxiv preprint amino acid sequences along internal nodes and our results showed there were up to 35 evolutionary convergent sites including 3 convergent and 32 parallel amino acid substitutions that were shared by two ancestral branches leading to sars-related cov and covid-19-related cov respectively fig 1  it should be noted that the 35 evolutionary convergent sites of spike protein were apparently underestimated since those amino acid sites with alignment gaps were not considered by the approach used still these 35 sites represented an unusually high incidence of evolutionary convergence sites which have rarely been found in previous studies related to molecular convergent evolution 20-26  this suggests a strong evolutionary convergence between sars-related cov and covid-19-related cov on completion of our data analyses one of the most recent studies showed that the rbd of the spike protein of pangolin-cov is nearly identical to that of 2019-ncov with only one amino acid difference 27  suggesting that pangolin-cov also belongs to the clade of covid-19-related cov it should be noted that the rbd sequences of two other coronavirus strains bm48-31 gu190215 and btky72 ky352407 were grouped with sars-related cov and covid-19-related cov fig 3 fig s4  suggesting an evolutionary convergence among them in addition to these evolutionarily convergent coronavirus strains intriguingly we found the evidence of evolutionary convergence of the spike protein between the ancestral branch leading to sars-related cov and the ancestral branch of covid-19-related cov and its sister strains covzc45 and covzxc21 which harbored 9 evolutionary convergent amino acid sites fig s5  these results suggest that the spike protein may have been subjected to a successive evolutionary convergence among ancestral coronavirus strains leading to sars-related cov covid-19related cov and covzc45 and covzxc21 previous studies show that spike protein interacts tightly with a related protein orf3a and they likely coevolved 28 29 30  if their coevolution does occur we may expect that the evolutionary convergence of the spike protein found may have led to the occurrence of the evolutionary convergence of orf3a as well to test this we reconstructed ancestral amino acid sequences of orf3a along internal nodes and our results revealed 6 parallel amino acid substitutions shared between the ancestral branch leading to sars-related cov and the ancestral branch of covid-19-related cov and its sister strains covzc45 and covzxc21 fig s5  and we also detected a parallel amino acid substitution of orf3a between the two ancestral branches leading to sars-related cov and covid-19-related cov fig s6  considering that these evolutionary convergent branches of orf3a also showed evolutionary convergence in spike protein as mentioned above fig 1 fig s5  it may suggest that spike protein and its partner protein orf3a may have been subjected to a co-evolutionary convergence evolutionary convergence may occur by chance or by darwinian selection our results showed that the evolutionary convergent sites found in this study were mainly restricted to two genes s and orf3a fig  1  and in particular they were centered within the rbd of the s gene this biased distribution of evolutionary convergent sites is difficult to explain according to chance rather darwinian selection would be favored as a plausible explanation in support of this we used converg2 31 to evaluate the probability of the occurrence of our observed convergent sites of spike protein between the two ancestral branches leading to sars-related cov and covid-19-related cov and the results showed high statistical significance p  0000000 regardless of whether the jtt model or poisson model was used this result apparently rejects chance or neutral evolution as a possible explanation rather it indicates a  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license authorfunder it is made available under

apparently accelerated evolution of rbd of sars-related cov and covid-19-related cov related to their phylogenetic intermediates fig  3  and we detected a significant darwinian selection of the s gene along two branches branches c and k of sars-related cov and covid-19-related cov fig 1  table 1  these lines of evidence may strongly support the evolutionary convergence found in this study as a result of adaptive evolution regarding the possible adaptive evolutionary convergence previously proposed causes such as gene duplication and horizontal gene transfer 213233  are less likely because only single-copy s genes were found in all 35 genomes examined and evolutionary convergent sites presented an apparently biased distribution pattern parallel andconvergent evolution which occur through point mutation could contribute to our observed evolutionary convergence but it could not account for the unusually high incidence of convergent sites observed in this study representing a rare finding in previous studies 20- 26  recent studies have shown a relatively high likelihood of occurrence of homologous recombination in spike protein 73435  and especially it is considered that the rbd of 2019-ncov may be derived from a recombination event between that of human sars-cov and another unsampled sars-like cov 35  if this is the case the homologous recombination if any may have occurred between the ancestors branches c and k of sars-related cov and covid-19-related cov accounting for their unusually high incidence of convergent sites observed in this study given the strong evolutionary convergence of rbd of spike protein between the two clades covid-19related cov and sars-related cov the coronaviruses of the two clades may have more likely adapted to similar or the same receptor to date 2019-ncov and sars-cov have been known to be capable of using the ace2 receptor in human host 56910  but the receptors of their phylogenetic relatives from the two clades covid-19-related cov and sars-related cov are less clear 453637  regarding the bat sarslike cov rs4231 and rs7327 are known to be able to use human ace2 receptor 37  while wiv16 is capable of using the ace2 receptor from humans civets and chinese horseshoe bats rhinolophus sinicus 4  the receptors of rs9401 btrs-betacovyn2018b and batcov ratg13 remain to be explored further studies on the receptors of these bat sars-like covs in their natural reservoirs are badly needed to determine whether ace2 or other candidates if any represent their shared cell receptor leading to their strong evolutionary convergence of spike protein our molecular phyloecological study demonstrates that spike protein shows significant darwinian selection along two ancestral branches related to sars-cov and 2019-ncov suggesting their adaptive evolution to recognizing their own cell receptors comparative sequence and phylogenetic analyses indicate a high similarity of rbd sequences of spike protein between sars-related cov and covid-19related cov subsequent ancestral sequence reconstruction and convergent evolution analyses reveal an unusually high incidence of parallel and convergent amino acid substitutions between them suggesting an extremely strong adaptive evolutionary convergence in spike protein in addition to spike protein we also found evolutionary convergence of its partner protein orf3a suggesting their possible co-evolutionary convergence finally considering that sars-cov and 2019-ncov have posed serious concerns to public health and safety it should be noted that many other bat sars-like cov strains that were evolutionarily convergent with sars-cov and 2019-ncov recognized in this study may be potential novel coronaviruses to infect humans in the future the copyright

published studies 56  including 2019-ncov sars-cov and their phylogenetic relative bat sars-like cov please see fig 1 for details for all these coronavirus strains we downloaded their full-length genome sequences from genbank except for five 2019-ncov and ratg13 strains which were downloaded from gisaid we aligned these genome sequences using mafft httpsmafftcbrcjpalignmentserver the coding sequences of 11 genes fig 1  annotated in the genome of 2019-ncov nc045512 were used as a reference sequence to obtain the homologous gene sequences of the 35 coronavirus strains we aligned these homologous gene sequences using the online software webprank httpwwwebiacukgoldman-srvwebprank 38  which is considered to create a more reliable alignment to decrease false-positive results in positive selection analyses 39  we employed the branch and branch-site models implemented in the codeml program of paml 17 to examine the adaptive evolution of our focal genes for this a codon-based maximum-likelihood method was used to estimate the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions per site dnds or  and likelihood ratio tests lrts were used to calculate statistical significance a statistically significant value of   1 suggests positive selection upon analysis an unrooted taxon tree fig 1 was constructed based on two published studies 56  for branch model analysis we used a two-rate branch model and our focal branches were labelled as foreground branches while others were treated as background branches the two-rate branch model was compared with the one-rate branch model which assumes a single  value across the tree to determine statistical significance if a statistically significant value of   1 in a foreground branch was detected the two-ratio branch model was then compared with the two-ratio branch model with a constraint of   1 to further determine whether the   1 of the foreground branch was statistically significant in addition to the branch model we also used a branchsite model test 2 to detect positively selected sites for a particular branch test 2 compares a modified model a with its corresponding null model with a constraint of   1 to determine the statistical significance positively selected sites were found using an empirical bayes method for result robustness we evaluated the dependence of the signal of positive selection on parameter variation for this we used two different initial values of kappa kappa  05 30 and of omega   05 20 and eventually several independent runs were conducted for each of the positively selected genes found we analyzed relative selection intensity using the relax 19 program available from the datamonkey webserver httptestdatamonkeyorgrelax relax is a hypothesis testing framework and it can be used to test whether selection strength has been relaxed or intensified along a certain branch or lineage for analyses relax calculates a selection intensity parameter value k and k  1 shows an intensified selection while k  1 indicates a relaxed selection assuming a priori partitioning of the test branches and reference branches we would expect that an intensified selection shows  categories away from neutrality   1 while a relaxed selection is expected to show  categories converging to neutrality   1 statistical significance was evaluated by lrt by comparing an alternative model with  cc-by-nc-nd

acid substitution model according to the bayesian information criterion all amino acid sites with an alignment gap were included for analyses for nj analyses jttg was selected as the best model for the ml and nj analyses the bootstrap value was set to 1 000 other parameters were used as defaults in the program we used the amino acid-based marginal reconstruction implemented in the empirical bayes approach in paml 17 for ancestral sequence reconstruction in the analyses the character was assigned to a single interior node and the character with the highest posterior probability was used as the best reconstruction we used two different amino acid substitution models jtt and poisson to examine the consistency of our results the jtt model assumes different substitution rates of different amino acids while the poisson model assumes the same substitution rate of all amino acids for the analyses we obtained the full-length spike protein sequences of our focal coronavirus strains and used their phylogeny as given in fig 1  the amino acid substitutions along our focal branches were analyzed the results based on the jtt and poisson models were generally identical for convenience only the results based on the jtt model are shown we used the converg2 31 program to evaluate the probabilities that the observed convergent and parallel substitutions were due to random chance a statistical significant p-value may suggest the observed evolutionary convergent sites are less likely attributable to random chance but instead favor darwinian selection as a possible explanation for the analyses two different amino acid substitution models jtt and poisson were used the rbd amino acid sequences of our focal 35 coronavirus genomes were abstracted and aligned using

linlin hua yaohe wang qi zhang xueyong huang xiaoju zhang xinxin li chunguang chen jiancheng guo wenxue tang jianbo liu  sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is a novel coronavirus causing an outbreak of covid-19 globally in the past six months a relatively higher divergence on the spike protein of sasr-cov-2 enables it to transmit across species efficiently we particularly believe that the adaptive mutations of the receptor-binding domain rbd of spike protein in sars-cov-2 might be essential to its high transmissibility among humans thus here we collected 2142 highquality genome sequences of sars-cov-2 from 160 regions in over 50 countries and reconstructed their phylogeny and also analyzed the interaction between the polymorphisms of spike protein and human ace2 hace2 phylogenetic analysis of sars-cov-2 and coronavirus in other hosts show sars-cov-2 is highly possible originated from bat-cov ratg13 found in horseshoe bat and a recombination event may occur on the spike protein of pangolin-cov to imbue it the ability to infect humans moreover compared to the s gene of sars-cov-2 it is more conserved in the directbinding sites of rbd and we noticed that spike protein of sars-cov-2 may under a consensus evolution to adapt to human hosts better 3860 amino acid mutations in spike protein rbd t333-c525 of sars-cov-2 were simulated and their stability and affinity binding to hace2 s19-d615 were calculated our analysis indicates sars-cov-2 could infect humans from different populations with no preference and a higher divergence in the spike protein of sars-cov-2 at the early stage of this pandemic may be a good indicator that could show the pathway of sars-cov-2 transmitting from the natural reservoir to human beings  coronavirus is commonly found in nature and infects only mammals and birds 1-3  among 46 species only seven of them are human-susceptible 4 5  aside from sars-cov and mers-cov that cause deadly pneumonia in humans by crossing the species barrier 367  sars-cov-2 is now bringing a global pandemic of respiratory disease within six months after the first case has been confirmed in wuhan city of china 8  it has been identified as a novel coronavirus that is a member of -coronavirus in the family coronaviridae which is a positive single-stranded rna virus with a protein envelope 2  up to date covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 results in more than six million people infected and over 380 thousand deaths worldwide compared with sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 spreads more rapidly and being highly infectious to humans 8 9 10  it is crucial to understand the origin of this coronavirus and its strategy in adapting to human hosts so efficiently moreover to apply this knowledge for controlling this pandemic and developing effective therapeutics and vaccines against covid-19 by reconstructing phylogenomic relationships among various coronavirus 11  it showed around 70 genome sequence similarity with sars-cov 11  and more closely related to bat coronavirus ratg13 in the spike s gene 1  given closely related to sars-like coronaviruses the genome structure of sars-cov-2 is similar to other beta-coronaviruses which composed in order with 5replicase orf1ab-s-envelopee-membranem-n-3 with numbers of open reading frames orfs function resembles those of sars-cov 12  it is noted that ratg13 is highly similar to sars-cov-2 especially between genes while they differed in some crucial genomic structures one of the most notable features is that a polybasic furin cleavage site insertion prra residue at the junction between two subunits s1 s2 of s protein 1 2 12 13  although some studies show bats could be the reservoir host for many coronaviruses including sars-cov the reservoir host of sars-cov-2 remains unclear 4 10 14  given the global spread of this epidemic it draws a lot of attention to reveal the origins of the pandemic event the evolutionary of sars-cov-2 may explain its infectiousness and transmissibility among different animal hosts and provide evidence about whether this virus is natural or artificial spike glycoprotein on the surface of sars-cov-2 is the key to enter the target cells which forms homotrimers protruding from the surface to recognize host cell receptor and cause membrane fusion 15  spike protein contains s1 and s2 subunits and the receptor-binding domain rbd exists on s1 which can bind to the peptidase domain pd of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 while s2 is responsible for membrane fusion during viral infection 14 16  in sars-cov rbd in spike protein is the most diverse part of the whole genome of which six amino acid y442 l472 n479 d480 t487 and y4911 have been found to play a key role in binding to ace2 receptor and further in transmissibility across species boundary 16  similar to sars-cov rbd mutations acquired during adaption to different host cells along transmission have also been observed in sars-cov-2 thus dissection of the key mutations in spike protein rbd that affect binding to the ace2 receptor would be important for understanding the molecular mechanism of how sars-cov-2 infect human cells recent studies show the ace2 receptor in host cells would mediate the entry ability of sars-cov-2 by interacting with spike protein and its binding capacity to spike protein of sars-cov-2 determines the transmissibility of this coronavirus across species particularly among humans 14 17  the present study intends to 1 reveal the phylogenetic relationship of sars-cov-2 identified in the different population at the genomic level and provide genetic evidence based on the structural protein-coding genes s m n e for identifying the nucleotide variations of sars-cov-2 collected from different regions amid covid-19 pandemic 2 provide a prediction for revealing the adaptive mutations on spike protein of sars-cov-2 based on the specific variation of s gene and finding the differences of stability of spike protein mutants and their affinities with the human ace2 receptors 3 explore whether there are variants of ace2 in different populations which may affect the infectivity of covid-19 to this end we analyzed the variants of ace2 in a large cohort including 1000 chinese local people and other human populations and identified polymorphisms that may influent on the binding between ace2 and spike protein of coronaviruses furthermore we predicted the affinities of spike protein to binding ace2 variants to understand whether those changes would render individuals resistant or susceptible to sars-cov-2 at the molecular level herein our study could explain part of the origin of sars-cov-2 at a phylogenetic level based both on whole genome and multiple key genes to allow the elucidation of population risk profiles and also help advance therapeutics such as a rationally designed soluble ace2 receptor for the management of covid-19 was carried out by kimura two factor correction method for nucleic acid level calculation to avoid the prediction error caused by the selection of outgroups with a far evolutionary relationship the complex outgroup was adopted in this study and the sequence of mers-cov and sars-cov were selected as outgroups to predict the genetic relationship  the maximum likelihood ml phylogenic trees were constructed based on 2147 genome sequences of sars-cov-2 with sars-cov and mers-cov were selected as the out-groups  figure 1  after alignment we merged identical sequences into one clade with labels kept as one the genomic tree showed all sars-cov-2 was closely related to the sars-like virus found in the horseshoe bat from yunnan ratg13 and a coronavirus from pangolin collected in guangdong province was the sister taxon with ratg13 which is closer to the virus from bat than to other pangolins from guangxi sars-cov-2 is not related closely with sars-cov at the nucleic level australia european countries and usa and the case document showed this patient was confirmed after his seven-day trip to italy and he didnt show any symptoms before his journey some branches were poorly supported by the bootstrap values and exhibited polytomies which indicated sars-cov-2 was adapting the human hosts globally and it is hard to determine the origin of sars-cov-2 solely based on nucleic data furthermore same to the genomic tree multiple genes sequences of sars-cov-2 are divergent from outgroups and we detected some mutations according to s gene sequences comparison  figure 3  as shown in figure 3  we extracted and aligned the s gene sequences from sars coronavirus in different hosts the one from pangolin that closer to sars-cov-2 and ratg13 was from a horseshoe bat rhinolophus spp and we found no big fragment shift in s genes of pangolin and it was less similar to s in sars-cov-2 compared with ratg13 but the insertions exhibited in pangolin indicated potential recombination in spike protein of coronavirus would occur during its cross-species hosts manumission according to s gene sequences in different strains we found the similarity between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-bat 98 is higher than it compared with coronavirus from pangolins 85 it showed more solved of the phylogenetic tree based on s gene fig 4 compared to the trees based on genomic sequences and multiple genes nevertheless the phylogeny reconstructed based on genome s gene and multiple genes all indicate the sars-cov-2 is closely related to ratg13 and the virus isolated from pangolin s gene has been studied as the key gene for sars-cov-2 binding to host cells receptor and this gene shows less conserved compared to the genome sequence of sars-cov-2 and some studies suggest that the high divergence found in spike protein rbd and specifically the direct bonding sites to ace2 receptor play an important role to sars-cov-2 adapting to different animal hosts or the populations in different regions combined with the phylogeny based on the s gene we also detected all mutationson the s gene and their binding capacity with ace2 receptor in human beings 23 point mutations were predicted to significantly influence the affinity and stability of the spike protein fig 5  among which 9 polymorphisms exhibited increased affinity and stability while 14 ones showed decreased affinity and stability table 1  all analysis outcomes of over 3000 polymorphisms in spike protein were shown in supplementary table 1 figure 5 and table 1 showed the missense mutation in spike protein rbd that has significant changes cutoff 3 of the affinity and stability with ace2 receptors interestingly residues l455 q498 and n501 would have two potential mutations that leading to contrary affinities including increased affinity in leucine changed to methionine on aa455 glutaurine changed to tryptophan on aa498 and asparagine changed to tyrosine on aa501 reduced affinity in leucine changed to alanine glutamine changed to alanine asparagine changed to glycine the polymorphisms on the same residue causing two opposite effects of affinity suggested that mutations on those positions may lead to different adaptation directions on sars-cov-2 to fit in different hosts furthermore phe456 gln493 and phe486 showed two mutations that both result in affinity reduction the stability of spike protein with different mutations was showed in table 1  we found only 5 mutants increased the stability of spike protein including g446w g496a q498w n501y and g502y which is not consistent with the affinity to match the mutations of spike protein that reported by sars-cov-2 database of china national center for bioinformation httpsbigdbigaccnncov with our predictions a total of 1150 polymorphisms in spike protein were collected from the database and 643 missense variants were selected and run analysis about their affinity and stability binding to ace2 supplementary table   2  we focused on 76 missense variants in region t333-c525 of spike protein and 9 variants bring significant changes on the affinity of it to ace2  figure 6a  moreover 13 variants cause structural stability changes in spike protein rbd  figure 6b  we calculated the population frequency of 388 missense variants in ace2 collected from gnomad supplementary table 3  and the local population  table 2  analysis of their stability and affinity to spike protein of sars-cov-2 were performed in this study and the results showed no significant differences in both affinity and stability revealing the evolutionary origin of sars-cov-2 is of great value to understand its transmission pathway cross-species and provide a guide to long-term infection prevention of zoonotic coronavirus since it is a novel coronavirus the extremely limited morphological information of sars-cov-2 could be used in the phylogenic analysis genomic data of sars-cov-2 nowadays provide a helpful approach to identify its divergence along with the transmission among  to most sars-coronavirus 5 17  and the s gene is more divergent in coronavirus at a genetic level relative to other genes 14  along adapting to the human host cellular environment mutations occur in spike protein in some of which enable to enhance the binding affinity and stability of spike protein-hace2 complex and the enhancement would increase the transmissibility of sars-cov-2 among human and bring more severe disease 16 table 1  23 variants of spike protein rbd that causing significantly higher or lower affinity to ace2 and stability were focused in this study the cutoff we set up was three for determining significance table 1  among 9 of the mutations that highly enhance the binding between spike protein and ace2 the residue g446 figure 7  was also reported cdc up to date combined 1150 variants 634 missense mutations in total in the spike protein of sars-cov-2 reported by cdc we found their affinity and stability in our analysis outcomes among 76 missense variants that locate in the region between t333-c525 five variants in spike protein enhance its affinity binding to hace2 table 3  and only three of them increase the stability of spike-hace2 complex table 4  additionally we collected the genome sequences of sars-cov-2 that harbor those variants in spike protein and found the variants v483a occurs in 26 strains from the usa v367f occurs in 12 strains from hong kong australia and other european countries and a variant g446v that highly enhance the affinity were identified in a strain from australia supplementary table 2  we mapped those strains onto our genomic phylogenetic tree and found they were dispersed distributed in the position close to the sars-bat and sars-pangolin as covid-19 widespread globally several studies tried to find where this novel coronavirus came from but few reports analyze the origin of sars-cov-2 according to the divergent pattern in spike protein in our study the multiple variants in spike protein found in different countries and clustered in the ancestral direction on phylogeny which might suggest sars-cov-2 infection start to occur at multiple sites but not only in wuhan city however due to the limited detection capability and restricted availability of samples from infected animals the variants available in the national database are uncompleted more data needs to be collected for further studies furthermore since the sars-cov-2 strains have variants on spike protein relative to a reference sequence of sars-cov-2 nc0455122 were found more divergence on the phylogenetic position that closer to sars-bat and sars-pangolin it might indicate a consensus evolution occurred in s gene and enable sars-cov-2 to adapt to human hosts well however since it is difficult to determine the exact time the zero patient who got infected by sars-cov-2 the date of the sample collection and data extracted could mislead the results we believe further clinical information from all the countries would be needed for research and this is a global concern that requires more cooperation and collaboration but not political games or constant blames we shared all the analysis of over 3000 variants on spike protein in this study to help the world tracking the mutations of sars-cov-2 and also can be useful to select the potential druggable targets and neutral inhibitors to prevent the further damages may be brought by the pandemic of covid-19 aside from mutations in spike protein for adapting to new hosts the hace2 also represents polymorphisms in the binding region host-virus interaction over time makes a natural selection on both virus and host cells 30  therefore the variants in hace2 receptor would also play a role in sars-cov-2 infection cao and his colleagues 2020 31 researchers found three unique variants in hace2 in the italian population that might be corresponding to the high fatality including p389h w69c and l351v 33  we compared the unique variants found in local and italian population by mapping them on the hace protein structure  figure 8  and found the italian ones were closer to the binding region than local ones but in silico simulation indicated that none of them change the affinity and stability of spike protein of sars-cov-2 and hace2 complex table 2  generally we did not find any variants in ace2 that would significantly increase or decrease the affinity

million confirmed human cases including more than 68000 deaths the genomes of sars-cov-2 strains isolated from different parts of the world are now available and the unique features of constituent genes and proteins have gotten substantial attention recently spike glycoprotein is widely considered as a possible target to be explored because of its role during the entry of coronaviruses into host cells we analyzed 320 whole-genome sequences and 320 spike protein sequences of sars-cov-2 using multiple sequence alignment tools in this study 483 unique variations have been identified among the genomes including 25 nonsynonymous mutations and one deletion in the spike protein of sars-cov-2 among the 26 variations detected 12 variations were located at the n-terminal domain and 6 variations at the receptor-binding domain rbd which might alter the interaction with receptor molecules in addition 22 amino acid insertions were identified in the spike protein of sars-cov-2 in comparison with that of sars-cov phylogenetic analyses of spike protein revealed that bat coronavirus have a close evolutionary relationship with circulating sars-cov-2 the genetic variation analysis data presented in this study can help a better understanding of sars-cov-2 pathogenesis based on our findings potential inhibitors can be designed and tested targeting these proposed sites of variation  wuhan hubei province of china in december 2019 the death toll rose to more than 68000 among 1250000 confirmed cases around the globe until april 4 2020 1  the virus causing covid-19 is named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 based on the phylogenetic studies the sars-cov-2 is categorized as a member of the genus betacoronavirus the same lineage that includes sars coronavirus sars-cov 2 that caused sars severe acute respiratory syndrome in china during 2002 3  recent studies showed that sars-cov-2 has a close relationship with bat sars-like covs 4 5 7  interestingly s glycoprotein is characterized as the critical determinant for viral entry into host cells which consists of two functional subunits namely s1 and s2 the s1 subunit recognizes and binds to the host receptor through the receptor-binding domain rbd whereas s2 is responsible for fusion with the host cell membrane  8  9  10  mers-cov uses dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp4 as entry receptor 11 whereas sars-cov and sars-cov-2 utilize ace-2 angiotensin converting enzyme-2 12  abundantly available in lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes suggesting s glycoprotein as a potential drug target to halt the entry of sars-cov-2 13  according to recent reports neutralizing antibodies are generated in response to the entry and fusion of surface-exposed s protein mainly rbd domain which is predicted to be an 4 important target for vaccine candidates  10  14  15  however sars-cov-2 has emerged with remarkable properties like glutamine-rich 42 aa long exclusive molecular

1273 amino acid long glycoprotein having multiple domains possibly plays a major role in sars-cov-2 pathogenesis viral entry to the host cell is initiated by the receptor-binding domain rbd of s1 head

into close proximity to the transmembrane anchor tm the tm domain facilitates membrane destabilization required for fusion between virus-host membranes  20  21  insights into the sequence variations of s glycoprotein among available genomes are key to understanding the biology of sars-cov-2 infection developing antiviral treatments and vaccines in this study we have analyzed 320 genomic sequences of sars-cov-2 to identify mutations between the available genomes followed by the amino acid variations in the glycoprotein s to foresee their impact on the viral entry to host cell from structural biology viewpoint all available sequences 320 whole genome and surface glycoprotein sequences of sars-cov-2 related to the covid-19 pandemic were retrieved from ncbi virus variation resource

likewise a number of studies targeting sars-cov-2 spike protein have been undertaken for the therapeutic measures 41  but the unique structural and functional details of sars-cov-2 spike protein are still under scrutiny we also found a variant r408i at receptor binding domain rbd that mutated from positively charged arginine residue to neutral and smaller sized isoleucine residue fig 4 i  this change might alter the interaction of viral rbd with the host receptor because the r408 residue of sars-cov-2 is known to interact with the ace2 receptor for viral entry 42  similarly alterations of rbd g476s v483a h519q and a520s also could affect the interaction of sars-cov-2 spike protein with other molecules which require further investigations qia98583 and qis30615 variants were found to have an alteration of alanine to valine a930v and aspartic acid to tyrosine d936y respectively in the alpha helix of the hr1 domain previous reports have indicated that hr1 domain plays a significant role in viral fusion and entry by forming helical bundles with hr2 and mutations including alanine substitution by valine a1168v in hr1 region are predominantly responsible for conferring resistance to mouse hepatitis coronaviruses against hr2 derived peptide entry inhibitors 43  this study hypothesizes the mutation a930v found in that of sars-cov-2 might also have a role in the emergence of drug-resistance virus strains also the mutation d1168h found in the heptad repeat 2 hr sars-cov-2 could play a vital role in viral pathogenesis the sars-cov-2 s protein contains additional furin protease cleavage site prrars in s1s2 domain which is conserved among all 320 sequences as revealed during this study  supplementary fig 3  this unique signature is thought to make the sars-cov-2 more virulent than sars-cov and regarded as novel features of the viral pathogenesis ref 11 according to previous reports the more the host cell protease can process the coronavirus s can accelerate viral tropism accordingly in influenza virus 9  44  45  46  apart from that this could also promote viruses to escape antiviral therapies targeting transmembrane protease tmprss2 clinicaltrialsgov

being barraged by newly emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens as evidenced by sporadic outbreaks of a variety of different viruses that have occurred in recent years 1234 between late 2002 and 2004 the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov a member of the coronaviridae family in the nidovirales order emerged as a new human pathogen causing a worldwide epidemic with more than 8000 infections and 700 known deaths 56 while the primary host reservoir responsible for harboring the immediate ancestor of sars-cov has yet to be identified evidence of direct transmission of the virus between civets in close proximity to humans has been observed and reported in at least two distinct events 789  the world health organization who became involved in responding to this outbreak by using modern communications technologies to establish a worldwide collaborative multi-centre research project on severe acute respiratory syndrome sars diagnosis tasked with identifying the etiological agent of the outbreak multiple labs worked concurrently to determine the sequence of this new pathogen 10 investigate the structure of virions by electron microscopy 11 and generate other data that contributed to the correct identification of the causative agent 12 meanwhile public health specialists implemented control measures and mitigation procedures to prevent the spread of the disease 13 in order to support research focused on these newly emerging pathogens the division of microbiology and infectious diseases dmid of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid at the us national institutes of health nih is supporting a variety of resources for researchers httpwwwniaidnihgovlabsandresourcesresourcesdmidpagesdefaultaspx including the genomic sequencing centers for infectious diseases structural genomics centers for infectious diseases systems biology for infectious diseases research 14 and bei resources repository programs to increase public availability of genome sequence data 3d protein structures systems biology models isolated organisms and experiment reagents the bioinformatics resource centers brc for infectious diseases 151617 were created to serve as database resources for the integration of research and surveillance data being generated by these dmid-sponsored resources and by other primary investigators working on infectious diseases caused by different groups of human pathogens and their insect vectors the objective of the brc program is to provide a one-stop-shop for data and analytical tools to support data mining and analysis workflows for both basic and applied research the virus pathogen database and analysis resource vipr brc wwwviprbrcorg supports virology researchers studying select agents and other significant public health pathogens belonging to 14 virus families including coronaviridae 16 cross-referencing data and integrating computational tools into the online vipr resource allows complex analyses to be easily performed by researchers regardless of their bioinformatics training or expertise the layout of the vipr home page at wwwviprbrcorg highlights the three major functions of the resource figure 1 first vipr captures different types of data from both external and internal sources and makes them accessible through custom search pages vipr stores these data for virus families categorized as containing either human priority pathogens or possible public health threats including 6 families of single-stranded positive-sense rna virusescaliciviridae coronaviridae flaviviridae hepeviridae picornaviridae togaviridae 5 families of single-stranded negative-sense rna virusesarenaviridae bunyaviridae filoviridae paramyxoviridae rhabdoviridae 1 family of double-stranded rna virusesreoviridae and 2 families of double-stranded dna virusesherpesviridae poxviridae although vipr is focused on supporting human infectious disease research related viruses within these families isolated from other host species are also accessible to allow comparative genomics research second vipr has assembled a suite of data analysis and visualization tools so that users can perform custom correlative analyses third datasets and analysis results can be saved in private workspaces in the vipr workbench for subsequent retrieval and sharing  vipr aims to provide a single resource to access multiple types of data from various public resources for the virus research community vipr stores sequence records manually-curated immune epitopes 3d protein structures and other types of public records together with the relevant metadata ie structured information associated with a given record from genbank 18 uniprot 19 protein databank pdb httpwwwrcsborgpdb 20 immune epitope database iedb wwwiedborg 21 pubmed and gene ontology consortium go wwwgeneontologyorg 22 all of these data are regularly updated and are easily retrievable by selecting search criteria within the intuitive web-based user query interfaces implemented throughout vipr for coronaviridae there are currently sequence and related data from 8635 different virus strains in vipr as of september 2012 table 1 following import into vipr these public data are further processed to produce novel derived data through the use of various automated bioinformatics and comparative genomics algorithms implemented by vipr and run behind the scenes as well as information from manual curation such pre-calculated data includes molecular weight isoelectric point and pfam and other domainsmotifs determined using interproscan 23 for all proteins predicted cd8 t-cell epitopes using the netctl algorithm 24 nearest blastp hits predicted ortholog groups using orthomcl 25 and all linked pubmed references table 1 vipr utilizes the national center for biotechnology and information ncbi refseq strains 26 to extend the manually-curated refseq annotations to the rest of the strains belonging to the same taxon strain records that lack protease cleavage site information for nonstructural proteins are analyzed using custom prediction pipelines that use multiple sequence alignment to map homologous sequence regions and cleavage sites from closely-related refseq sequences sequence-based methods are also used to construct virus ortholog groups and the associated annotations which are provided throughout the resource to easily identify proteins having similar function within the virus family even when the geneprotein names or symbols do not match in an effort to add information that is not included in the genbank records vipr has also manually-curated the scientific literature to glean information regarding the country year and host of isolation for many of the clinically-relevant sars-cov strains recently we have implemented a sequence feature variant type component within vipr that captures the location of characterized regions found in viral proteins while this functionality is based on previous work in human hla and influenza virus proteins 2728 it has been extended to the various taxa within vipr sequence feature sf definitions are obtained from the scientific literature genbank uniprot and iedb records and are categorized as structural eg alpha-helices functional eg active sites immune epitopes or sequence alteration sf types sf definitions are currently available in vipr for dengue serotypes 1-4 hepatitis c subtype 1a and pox vaccinia viruses however functionality exists that allows researchers to add new definitions for any other virus species in vipr through community annotation efforts such crowd-sourcing efforts are essential to provide the custom sequence feature definitions for each taxon which can then be useful in performing data mining comparative genomics andor evolutionary analyses by the community as a whole in order to maintain highly accurate definitions within vipr all community-proposed sfs are inspected and validated by domain experts prior to becoming publicly accessible through vipr for each sf all vipr amino acid sequence records for viruses in the same taxon are searched in order to identify all unique sequence variations observed all strains containing the same sequence variation pattern are then assigned to the same variant type vt category each defined sf has a dedicated sequence feature details page in vipr that displays information about the protein and strain from which the region was characterized and reported the reference citations all observed vts a list of all strains bearing each of the vts hyperlinks to any homologous 3d protein structures and a search interface for finding a particular vt based on the user-input sequence by performing comparative genomics analyses on unique sets of sequence variations in the short well-characterized regions found in the sfvt component of vipr researchers can easily identify candidate positions that correlate with a given phenotype at a finer level of granularity and with less noise than is possible using whole-protein sequence analysis approaches outside institutions and programs including the niaid-funded genome sequencing centers gsc for infectious diseases submit coronaviridae sequence metadata that may not be available in the corresponding genbank sequence record directly to vipr sequence metadata can be used in various vipr search interfaces as query criteria to identify all strain records andor genome sequence data that match the specified constraints and in selected comparative genomics analysis tools data from experiments interrogating host genes and proteins that respond to viral infection are currently being generated and submitted by laboratories associated with the niaid-supported systems biology for infectious diseases research program and the brc driving biological projects program and have recently been included within the new host factor component in vipr the intent of these studies is to identify host factors that positively- andor negatively influence virus replication across a range of experimental variables using high-throughput -omics methods including gene expression microarrays proteomics and rna interference technologies for each set of experimental variables the lists of host factors called biosets that are identified as being significantly different when compared to controls are submitted to vipr the aim of this component is to provide easy access to the processed data establish an automated approach for users to perform a rapid comparison of their own genes of interest against those that have previously been identified through virus-host response experiments and to offer the analytical tools necessary to interpret such data currently vipr contains data from multiple host factor experiments involving sars-cov and influenza a virus infections in cell culture and in experimental animals and provides a boolean search function to identify shared unique or combined lists of factors found to be significant between such experiments additional datasets from experiments using other viruses will be imported in the future access to data in vipr together with the integrated analysis and visualization tools begins by clicking on the coronaviridae family name on the vipr home page the system was designed to separate data by family to ideally manage the genome structure data requirements and other specific nuances that are unique to each virus family constructing a custom query for any data type including sequence records is both fast and easy using the custom interfaces designed to reflect the contents in the vipr system whole and partial genome sequence records can be searched with user-specified criteria including genera species virus host and geographical andor temporal point of isolation currently the coronaviridae component in vipr contains sequence data for viruses annotated as being isolated from 68 different host types across 59 countries between 1941 and 2011 keyword searches can be used to retrieve database entries based on any available metadata more advanced pattern-matching search capabilities also exist to retrieve sequence records that contain specified sequence strings search results are reported in tabular format on a genome search results page which provides hyperlinks to strain details pages for each respective strain the strain details page figure 2 is specific to each virus strain and contains various annotations including strain name and taxonomy as well as a description of the host and geo-temporal point of specimen isolation genome-level information such as genbank record name and accession number sequence length and number of proteins encoded by the genome are also displayed on the strain details page together with genome image map graphics and protein information tables choosing a specific protein from either the graphic or the table will load a geneprotein details page figure 3 that displays additional information obtained from public archives including experimentally-determined immune epitopes and go annotations and data derived from vipr analysis procedures including predicted molecular weight isoelectric point domainsmotifs predicted immune epitopes blastp results and ortholog information once the desired sequence records are obtained from the search results page an integrated collection of tools is provided to perform various comparative genomics analyses and visualization tasks the suite of tools currently available in vipr includes multiple sequence alignment msa calculation using either muscle with uclust or mauve 293031 msa visualization and modification with jalview 32 msa format conversion with readseq 33 phylogenetic tree reconstruction using the fastme phyml or raxml algorithms 343536 evolutionary model selection using either modelcompare or prottest 37 phylogenetic tree visualization and manipulation with archaeopteryx 38 3d protein structure visualization and exploration using jmol 39 metadata-driven comparative genomics statistical analysis using meta-cats nucleotide and amino acid sequence search against custom databases using blast 40 sequence variation calculation using the weblogo algorithm 41 short peptide search with exact fuzzy or pattern match annotation mapping for new sequences using the genome annotation transfer utility 42 and custom pcr primer design using the primer3 algorithm 43 table 2 the use of a subset of these tools will be described in more detail as part of an exploratory scientific use case described below the vipr workbench is a relatively unique feature that allows users to save search criteria and results selected sequence records as working sets and analysis results for future access any user can register for their own free private workspace for each virus family in the vipr system simply by providing an email address and password to enable future log in working sets of nucleotide sequences can be converted into sets of amino acid sequences and vice versa using integrated sequence type conversion tools the workbench also facilitates the virtual sharing of user-selected content with collaborators around the world regardless of their physical location when saving search criteria in the workbench the system can automatically notify the user via email whenever new records that match the original query are added to the database selected sequence records from multiple searches can be merged using boolean logic and can be combined with user uploaded data to be analyzed with the integrated suite of tools in vipr while keeping the uploaded data private results from multiple sequence alignments sequence variation analysis and phylogenetic tree inferences can be saved for quick future retrieval we begin by searching for all sars-cov sequences in vipr derived from isolates taken from either humans or civets as of september 2012 this query returned 79 complete genome records consisting of 62 human records from 9 annotated countries and 17 civet records from 2 annotated countries isolated between 2003 and 2004 including strains taken during the height of the main and recurrent sars-cov outbreaks query results are displayed on the genome search results page with contents sortable by clicking on the column headings desired records from the search results page can then be directly analyzed by selecting any of the integrated tools accessible as menu options under the run analysis pull-down tab or saved as a working set in the users personal workbench for the purposes of this use case the sequence set was additionally filtered to remove fifteen genome records that did not have metadata for the year of isolation two genome records that were derived from passaging of a virus strain already in the list and one duplicate record for the refseq strain already in the list all 61 genome sequence records matching the search and passing the filtering criteria were selected and saved to the workbench for more in-depth analysis by clicking the add to working set button on the search results page this filtered dataset consisted of 15 isolates taken from civets and 46 isolates taken from humans sequence data in fasta format can be used as input for performing a fast customized multiple sequence alignment msa in real-time data sources for this analysis can include search results working sets andor uploaded custom sequences sequences for rna viruses are aligned with the muscle algorithm on the vipr server with the ability to download the msa results in fasta format andor save the msa results to the workbench once the alignment is finished the integrated jalview tool allows the viewing and editing of the sequence and label information associated with the alignment to assist in interpreting the results for the current use case the nucleotide sequence alignment for the selected sars-cov strains confirms that these genomes are extremely well conserved across the entire length of the alignment even though they are derived from two very different host species figure 4a nucleotide or amino acid sequence data can be used to construct phylogenetic trees in vipr sequence data can be obtained from search results working sets or custom data uploaded either to the workbench or directly to the phylogenetic tree input page alternatively phylogenetic trees can be constructed through the run analysis pull-down tab on the multiple sequence alignment results page directly once a phylogenetic tree is completed the results can be saved in the workbench or downloaded in the phyloxml or newick formats 44 vipr provides the fastme algorithm for constructing minimum evolution phylogenetic trees from the selected sequence data using the quick tree option the phyml and raxml maximum likelihood tree inferencing algorithms with bootstrapping have also been included in vipr together with the modelcompare software to determine the evolutionary model best suited for use with any individual dataset when the phylogenetic tree construction is finished the integrated archaeopteryx phylogenetic tree viewer can be used to easily visualize explore interpret and manipulate the tree using built-in functions such as re-rooting branch swapping selecting sub-trees etc 38 this visualization tool has been further customized to take advantage of the extensive metadata associated with the various sequence records stored in the vipr database to allow user-driven coloration of the labels at the terminal nodes ie leaves of the phylogenetic tree according to the host country or year of isolation a high-resolution image of the customized phylogenetic tree display can be exported in a variety of formats to enable more in-depth interpretation andor inclusion in presentations or publications for the current scientific use case raxml was used to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree for all sequence records that matched the original search and filtering criteria which was subsequently colored based on the host of isolation figure 4b the tree topology for this phylogenetic reconstruction shows two major clades that separate largely according to both the year and host of isolation the majority of strains from the first clade were taken in 2003 with all but two members of this clade being isolated from civets hereafter referred to as the civet-predominate clade for the second clade almost all of the strains were sampled in 2004 with all but two members isolated from humans hereafter referred to as the human-predominate clade this topology confirms that at least two species-jump events between civet and human have occurred 9 it also suggests that this species barrier does not appear to be a significant bottleneck for sars-cov the metadata-driven comparative analysis tool for sequences meta-cats is an automated analysis workflow developed and implemented by the vipr team to support the calculation of user-driven comparative genomics statistical analyses this tool allows users to not only take advantage of the numerous sequence records in vipr but also the wealth of accompanying metadata for these records stored in the vipr database such metadata may include date andor geospatial point of specimen collection host species severity of disease etc since this tool examines both the sequence and the associated metadata statistically significant genotype-phenotype correlations can be detected input for this tool can include sequence search results working sets or custom upload of both sequence data and the associated metadata once the desired sequences are selected the tool guides the user through the necessary steps of 1 assigning the sequences to up to five different groups based on metadata or other user criteria 2 aligning all assigned sequences 3 performing automated statistical analyses on the sequences and 4 viewing the results for the current use case the original sequence search results were automatically divided into two groups by the vipr system based on the annotated host of isolation human vs civet the meta-cats results page displays the significant residues differing between the specified groups figure 4c identifying 117 nucleotide positions in the entire sars-cov genome that significantly differed between the civet and human isolates these positions were scattered throughout the genome and had calculated p-values ranging from 433x10-12 to 002492 supplementary table 1 when this list was compared against the 26 nucleotide positions that differed between civet and human isolates reported in a previous study 8 all 26 of the previously identified positions were also found to be significant in this meta-cats analysis vipr has integrated the jmol protein structure viewer application to facilitate the exploration and visualization of 3d protein structures either for custom uploaded data or for protein data bank pdb structures from any taxa present in vipr the application has been enhanced to allow users to highlight active sites immune epitopes and ligands customize the appearance of the protein structure and quickly save an image or animated video of the structure in addition residues from the 3d protein structures for each pdb file are mapped to the homologous positions in the stored uniprot records to facilitate quick and accurate comparison between structural data and amino acid sequence data for the current use case we decided to explore the sars-cov spike protein structure pdb id 2ghv in more detail since multiple residues were found to significantly differ between the civet and human isolates in the spike coding region two of these significant nucleotide positions 22942 and 22965 located in codons for amino acids 479 and 487 respectively were particularly interesting since they were found to lie within the receptor-binding motif of the sars-cov receptor-binding domain of the spike protein and had been reported to influence species-specific binding affinity for the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 45 the selected 3d structure includes most of the sars-cov receptor-binding domain of the spike protein which is located between residues 318-510 4647 secondary structures were displayed as ribbons and spike amino acid positions 479 and 487 were highlighted in blue to confirm that they are exposed on the exterior surface of the protein in a position accessible for host receptor binding figure 4d  the workflow that was followed throughout the scientific use case confirms and extends results obtained through previous comparative genomics analyses and demonstrates the power of the vipr system specifically our phylogenetic tree corroborates the theory that there were at least two separate human outbreaks from viruses closely related to two separate clades isolated from civets during the time of the sars-cov epidemic our tree also shows a strong correlation between host and year of isolation although this observation is not true for all strains included in the tree the meta-cats analysis identified significant p-values for 117 nucleotide residues that were identified as having significant variation between the civet and human isolates the positions that are located within the sars-cov spike protein receptor-binding motif which were identified by meta-cats appear to reflect virus sequence variations that affect binding to host-specific receptor proteins additional wet-lab experimentation will be required to elucidate the specific function of the remaining significant sequence variations and whether they alter the fitness of the virus mapping residues and regions of interest onto a 3d protein structure can yield additional insight into their functional role the scientific use case that was explored here serves as an example of the ability of vipr to support data exploration and the generation of biologically relevant hypotheses that can then be subjected to more in-depth laboratory testing through experimentation the virus pathogen database and analysis resource vipr httpwwwviprbrcorg supported by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid bioinformatics resource centers brc program is a freely-available website that provides an intuitive search interface to access data about human pathogenic virus families including coronaviridae obtained from public repositories custom algorithms and direct-submission these data are integrated with a suite of unique analytical and visualization tools for exploratory analysis the vipr resource provides researchers with an easy mechanism to not only perform complex analytical workflows but to save the results and share them with collaborators to expedite discovery through the generation of experimentally-testable hypotheses such experimental discoveries can then be translated from the bench to the bedside in the form of diagnostics prophylactics vaccines and treatments for viruses belonging to the coronaviridae family   comprehensive variant and haplotype landscapes of 50500 global sars-cov-2 isolates and accelerating accumulation of country-private variant profiles lishuang shen jennifer dien bard jaclyn biegel a alexander judkins r xiaowu gai  understanding the genetic etiology of covid-  comprehensive analysis of sars-cov-2 genomes is critically important to determine transmission patterns and identify haplotype and variant signatures that may be associated with evolving pathophysiology and virulence the rapid accumulation and sharing of sars-cov-2 genome sequences at an unprecedented speed have greatly facilitated such efforts since the first sars-cov-2 genome sequence was reported in january of 2020 as of june 18th there have been over 48000 sequences deposited to gisaid httpswwwgisaidorg elbe and buckland-merrett 2017 shu et al 2017 and 8000 sequences submitted to ncbi virus httpswwwncbinlmnihgovgenbanksarscov-2-seqs the china national center for bioinformation cncb 2019 ncov resource httpsbigdbigaccnncov zhao et al 2020 and other data repositories these data have been used to generate phylogenetic studies most of which have been country-private while others have focused on global virus phylogenetic and transmission analyses however the full-scale characterization of sars-cov-2 genomes reported to date at the time of this writing exceeding 50000 worldwide has not yet been reported in our previous study we established a comprehensive covid-19 genomic resource chla card httpscovid19cpmbiodevnet by harmonizing data from gisaid ncbi virus cncb and other resources  using chla card we performed a comprehensive analysis of all publically available sars-cov-2 genome sequences at the time of study we called variants from each genome sequence and annotated each isolate and variant with associated demographic data and functional predictions our categorical analyses of variants and haplotypes provided a snapshot of sars-cov-2 viral genetics globally six months into the covid-19 pandemic the functional and pathophysiological importance of these variants and haplotypes remains to be determined however based on the differential selections of variants in different genes there is the potential for emergence of a number of different strains at least some of which might differ in their transmissibility and virulence continuous monitoring of the country-private variant and haplotype profiles will lead to in-depth understanding of how the covid-19 pandemic evolves from the viral genetic perspective and will be critical as countries across the world move to re-open often with variable degrees of control of covid-19 such an approach may hopefully aid in the timely identification of variants and haplotypes that are potentially associated with significant changes in transmissibility and virulence as they emerge the merged sars-cov-2 collection as of june 18 2020 consisted of 50500 isolates after removing duplicates among data sources these were complete or near complete genome sequences  29600 bases with over 97 of the isolates originating from asia europe and usa non-human host sequences were excluded sars-cov-2 genome sequences of 700 isolates were identical to the reference genome nc0455122 the remaining isolates carried at least one variant when compared against the reference and were included in the subsequent variant and haplotype analyses the number of variants per isolate ranged from 0 to over 30 and isolates with 30 or more variants were excluded from the analysis because they were regarded as likely low-quality sequences the remaining 49637 isolates belonged to 93 geographic locations 22068 445 isolates in the united kingdom uk and 10397 209 isolates in the us notably underrepresented were isolates from african 578 and south american 647 countries table 1  a total of 459 isolates were classified as imported based on the reported country of exposure being different to the country of the resident iceland had a highest number of imported isolates 198 followed by india 34 and china 30  a total of 17100 variants and 24633 potential haplotypes were detected from any isolate however the submitted genome sequences were generated by a variety of laboratories and sequencing technologies not all of which provided the same or uniform coverage across the viral genome to account for this variation we further filtered the variants and haplotypes by requiring their presence in at least 3 isolates to be included in downstream analysis table 1 4  a total of 6070 variants and 2513 haplotypes were identified in at least three global isolates independently and were deemed reliable and less likely to be sequencing artifacts  table 1  in total these 6070 variants included 3486 missense 2167 synonymous 336 intergenic 12 inframe deletionsinsertion 10 frameshift 41 stop gainedlost and several other noncoding variants  table 2  the number of missense variants was significantly higher than that of synonymous variants overall across all genes and for each individual gene the number of missense variants was 77 more than synonymous variants but less than the in silica predicted ratio of 30 based on random chance the gene level numbers were 279 vs 135 20x in n gene and 384 vs 239 16x in s gene for the global isolates  table 3  the four most common mutations 241-c-t5utr-orf1ab 3037-c-torf1abpphe924phe 14408-c-torf1abppro4715leu 23403-a-gspasp614gly  were each present in 703-718 of non-us isolates and 675-693 of us isolates figure 1  the multi-nucleotide variant 28881-g-a 28882-g-c 28883-g-a causing a 2-amino acid variant nparg203204lysgly - nparg203204lysarg was present in 320 of the non-us isolates with a significant presence in isolates from the uk 413 other european countries 240 and australia 135 but not in the isolates from the usa 34  figure 1  across geographic locations the total number of variants was highest in the uk isolates 3649 followed by usa 2481 while asia 1593 and oceania 965 collections had far fewer variants it is worth noting however that rates of sequencing vary significantly across these geographies the largest three haplotypes were the 1771-isolate haplotype 241-c-t 3037-c-t 14408-c-t 23403-a-g 28881-g-a 28882-g-a 28883-g-c the 1458-isolate haplotype 241-c-t 1059-c-t 3037-c-t 14408-c-t 23403-a-g 25563-g-t and the 727-isolate haplotype 241-c-t 3037-c-t 14408-c-t 23403-a-g they were all predominantly present in europe and usa the missense variants predicted in silica based on random chance were about 3 times that of synonymous variants per gene in the range of 2738  table 3  the observed ratios of variant ranged from 103 for m gene to 330 for orf3a gene but all the ratios were lower than the in silica predicted ratios based on random chance the ratio of isolates with at least one missense variant in a gene versus isolates with at least one nonsynonymous variant in the same gene was 093 in the m-gene chi-squared test p-value of depletion  22e-16 suggesting the possibility that this gene was undergoing strong purifying selection purifying selection could have affected the m gene whose missense variant-carrying isolates were significantly less frequent than expected from the in-silica predicated variant types in contrast the ratios of isolates were 206 in orf8 140 in orf3a gene and 61 in s-gene with the chi-square p-values of enrichment for missense variants all below 22e-16 suggesting the possibility that these genes may have been under positive selection for missense variants further analysis including functional validation would be required to confirm the significance of these changes in-depth analyses that take into consideration of emergence timing geographic location founder effect and ancestral haplotype are needed before any conclusion can be reached ultimately questions about the fitness of variants require in vitro functional studies there have been speculations that some supercontagious lineages of sars-cov-2 may be evolving towards higher transmissibility 25563-g-t orf3ap57qh is a noteworthy candidate it emerged first in france on 2212020 later in usa on 02272020 figure 3  and quickly dominated the usa isolates since 03022020 present in 600 of isolates it also appeared in 22 and 114  of isolates from asia and european union but was rare in the uk in france the frequency of this allele had continued to change and the allele was rare in isolates since mid-april tracing this allele in the context of haplotype evolution may help clarify whether it was imported or spontaneously occurred again in usa isolates the 23403ag sp614dg mutation which quickly dominated usa and europe caused 4-time increase of higher transmissibility in vitro  the 25563-g-t orf3ap57qh variant that has become dominant in usa is worthy of in vitro validation twenty-six percent of the variants 1583 present in at least 3 isolates were country-private variants  table 4  country-private variants and similarly country-private haplotypes were defined as variant where at least 98 of the variant-carrying isolates are from the same country and at most 2 isolates come from other countries no matter the total isolates a single isolate could carry 2 or more country-private variants they were identified in 10238 isolates from 50 countries with 25 countries having at least 10 isolates carrying the country-private variants the uk had 896 private variants involving 614222068 288 sequenced isolates whereas the usa had 329 private variants involving 216610402 208 sequenced isolates each of these private variants occurred in on average 300 isolates in the usa to 406 isolates in uk most other countries had less than 100 reported isolates carrying country-private variants for instance australia had 52 private variants involving 4282169 197 of sequenced isolates and iceland had 12 private variants involving 82 596 138 sequenced isolates this number is much lower than reported in a study comparing iceland isolates against the 1300-isolate gisaid march 22 collection gudbjartsson et al 2020  because a larger 50k-isolate global collection was used for comparison in this study variants mentioned in that report may have strictly kept its iceland-private status ie 5142-c-t gene orf1ab pthr1626ile 25958-a-g gene orf3aptyr189cys or subsequently observed in other countries when more viral genome sequences were available ie 24054-c-t gene spala831val  italy a early covid-19 epicenter has only one private variant 2269-a-t that was seen in 4 isolates by variant functional annotations the majorities of country-private variants were missense variants totaling 896 variants involving 6904 isolates which were about 77 more frequent than the 586 synonymous variants affecting 3893 isolates high impact nonsensestop gained variants affected only 86 isolates for the genes affected orf1ab ranked the first as expected because of its large size with 899 variants from 6015 isolates followed by s gene with 149 variants from 1432 isolates the n gene ranked the 3 rd with 80 variants in 515 isolates regarding the emergence timeline of country-private variants and associated isolates the numbers were low before mid-march when sequences genome numbers were less than 1000 the new emergence peaked between mid-march and mid-april followed by a plateau that may be attributed to fewer genome sequences released since april 19 th figure 2 figure 2  country-private haplotypes were identified in 39 countries when we limited it to haplotypes shared by at least 5 isolates and required that at least 99 of the isolates were clearly from the same country and at most 2 isolates from other countries a total of 802 haplotypes from 8372 isolates were classified as country-private private haplotypes represented 224 4492 166 1728 and 164 356 of uk usa and australia isolates respectively iceland and thailand private haplotypes also represented 126 75 and 337 68 of the nations sars-cov-2 genome sequences respectively iceland is geographically isolated from other countries all members of the 74-isolate iceland-private 6-variant haplotype 241-c-t 3037-c-t10323-a-g 14408-c-t 20268-a-g 23403-a-g and the 34-isolate private 5-variant haplotype 5142-c-t 11083-g-t 14805-c-t 17247-t-c 26144-g-t and all their 27 descendent isolates were only seen from iceland although they were present at about the same period of mid-to late-march 2020 their potential immediate ancestral haplotypes with 5 and 4 variants were inferred with chla card genome tracker  and they were observed widely from asia to europe and america which was mostly sampled from late march this may imply the importation of these haplotypes or their ancestors to iceland and then followed by localized outbreak without re-exportation to other countries austria had a 36-isolate private haplotype 241-c-t 3037-c-t 12832-g-a 14408-c-t 23403-a-g 28881-g-a 28882-g-a 28883-g-c and its 2 austria -private descendent haplotypes in 9 isolates the isolates were collected from february 26 to late march this haplotypes earliest isolate originated from italy epiisl419656 the immediate ancestral haplotype was present in multiple european countries including austria itself since february 24 uk isolates had 464 private haplotypes from 4942 isolates which was 224 of all uk isolates the 4 largest uk-private haplotypes were 1440-g-a 2891-g-a 28851-g-t uk-h1 97 isolates and its immediate descendant 1440-g-a 2891-g-a 28851-g-t and 1440-g-a 2891-g-a 25669-c-t 28851-g-t uk-h2 110 isolates and 241-c-t 3037-c-t 10798-c-a 13862-c-t 14408-c-t 23403-a-g 28836-c-t uk-h3 109 isolates and 241-c-t 3037-c-t 14408-c-t 22879-c-a 23403-a-g uk-h4 97 isolates with chla card genome tracker and offline analysis we found that the immediate ancestor of uk-h1 2-variants 1440-g-a 2891-g-a was widely circulating in multiple european countries including uk and germany all but one of the 986 isolates carrying these 4 haplotypes or any of their 403 immediate and remote descendent haplotypes were uk-private their evolutionary context was inferred from the closest ancestral and descendant isolates with genome tracker tool and then combined with a randomly sampled representative global isolate collection for joint phylogenetic analysis the result showed that these country-private clusters formed distinct clades figure 4  as the more comprehensive global summary 700 of the 807 country-private haplotypes had 8151 smaller decedent same-country private haplotypes each with fewer than 5 isolates per haplotype the total isolates from them was 14061 together with the major private haplotypes 22171 458 isolates carried country-private haplotypes globally the percentage of isolates carrying private haplotypes were 299 282 464 and 596 in january-february march april and may 2020 respectively it stayed low till march but increased rapidly in april and may there were relatively fewer private haplotypes or related isolates from asia it should be noted that the asia private haplotypes were usually on the ancestral side consisted of mostly 1 to 3 variants this could reflect the earlier emergence and the gradual extinction of such private haplotypes as sars-cov-2 rates significantly declined in asia 21707-c-t was only seen in 21 isolates with china exposure and 1 singapore isolate and its identical and immediate descendant haplotypes were all sampled during the earlier phase january to early february 2020 except for one china isolate epiisl454976 on march 4 th  whereas most of the closest european or north american isolates carrying the 21707-c-t variant had 2 to over 10 extra variants which were evolutionarily remote and were sampled later between mid-march to late april at least one month later similarly limited to a single country the 8782-c-t haplotype was present only in 13 singaporean isolates between jan 27 to match 2 but in no other country despite the fact that 3965 other isolates across the world also carried this variant along with other variants clear patterns of geographic specific distributions were evident at both variant and the haplotype levels from our stratified phylogenetic analysis geographic specific haplotypes were present in 8372 of 20414 isolates carrying haplotypes seen at least 5 times 410 the uk usa australia and iceland together contributed 7213 86 of the 8372 isolates carrying countryprivate haplotypes these countries are all geographically isolated from mainland europe and asia where the initial outbreaks occurred there were 19 private haplotypes that each had from 50 to 311 isolates they were often continuously sampled across months but yet not exported to other countries despite the large numbers of isolates in circulation over 20 in contrast only three country-private haplotypes with over 30 isolates were identified from the mainland european countries one 35-isolate haplotype was from austria 241-c-t 3037-c-t 12832-g-a 14408-c-t 23403-a-g 28881-g-a 28882-g-a 28883-g-c the other one is a very young 36-isolate haplotype from netherlands only sampled between may 18 to 22 241-c-t 1594-c-t 3037-c-t 11109-c-t 13458-c-t 14408-c-t 22206-a-g 23403-a-g 25563-g-t 27654-c-t and the third is spain-private with 43 isolates 8782-c-t 9477-t-a 14805-c-t 25979-g-t 28144-t-c 28657-c-t 28863-c-t 29870-c-a and its 4 spain-private descendent haplotypes other country-private haplotypes from mainland european countries usually had lower numbers of isolates under 30  table 6  the uk-private haplotypes figure 4  colored in red were mostly on different major clades than the usa-private haplotypes figure 4  colored in blue this suggests reduced country-to-country transmissions potentially associated with travel restrictions the global isolates were assigned to major gisaid clades according to the diagnostic variant signatures and existing gisaid clades designations  table 7  the largest clades were gr g and gh clades the smallest was the o clade examining the variants from the o clade isolates confirmed that there was no dominant variant or haplotype where the most frequent haplotype 6312-c-a 11083-g-t 13730-c-t 23929-c-t 28311-c-t presented in 36 isolates 772138 and the more frequent variants presented in the o clade isolates were 11083-g-t at 467 28311-c-t at 227 and 13730c-t at 204 isolates carrying the country-private haplotypes were less frequent for the o-clade 347 but not far from other clades between 40-50 among the haplotypes seen in 3 or more isolates for per country clade ratios usa has more gh 553 and s 172 clade isolates whereas uk has more gr 442 and g 253 clades isolates but only 62 of gh and 11 of s clades table 8  the generous and collaborative joint efforts by laboratories world-wide in generating and sharing sars-cov-2 genomes have made available a large amount of viral genome sequences and associated meta-data for research diagnosis treatment development we characterized the variants and haplotypes from all 50500 viral genome sequences available from multiple resources as of june 18 2020 6070 variants were found to be present on 3 or more isolates and 1386 268 of them were country-private the per gene variant density was quite consistent despite few hotspots the comprehensive set of variants and haplotypes was integrated with demographic data timeline of collection and functional annotation and made accessible at chla card web resource for searching browsing and phylogenetic analysis the global isolates were assigned to major gisaid clades  table 7  but the clades were large with over 10000 isolates in the ggrgh clades thus lacked resolution there was an attempt to provide granularity for fine-scale lineage assignment rambaut et al 2020  but a lineage classification system may need to handle the hierarchical structure with natural variant and haplotype profiles along the virus evolution as well as the reversal mutation and independent co-evolution in our opinion a system similar to the mitochondrial haplogroup such as modeled in the phylotree httpwwwphylotreeorg is worthy of consideration the travel restrictions between countries were mostly enforced in late march march had the lowest percentage of isolates carrying country-private variants 142 when compared to january and february 166 and the percentage quickly doubled in april 284 and tripled in may 398 figure 2  sars-cov-2 may appears to have been spreading freely across countries through passenger traveling until late march allowing for the spread of virus variant profiles to multiple countries with the imposition of strict global travel bans in late march the newly occurred variants were largely restricted to individual countries or even local regions as we observed in the us  it is concerning that over 40 of the recently sampled isolates carried country-or even provincestate-private variants which suggests a significant number of new variants are emerging and accumulating in a matter of months the real-time monitoring of new viral genomes and in silica modeling of mutation effects are critical to timely identification of mutation similar to 23403ag sp614dg which quickly dominates and cause 4-time higher transmissibility in vitro daniloski et al 2020  it will be worthwhile to integrate the sars-cov-2 genotype and haplotype data with clinical data and the national level transmission and morbidity data to search for potential highly transmissible haplotypesgenotypes or conversely high-morbidity but less-infectious ones the host-virus genotype interaction possibility can also be assessed through multifaceted data integration such information can aid in the development of covid-19 clinical management guided by both viral and host genotypes in summary we performed an up-to-date and comprehensive variant and haplotype characterization of all reported sars-cov-2 sequences and isolates using the chla card httpscovid19cpmbiodevnet sign of positive and purifying selections were detected for further computational and experimental verification there were a significant number of strongly localized outbreaks as evident from the country-private haplotypes and genotypes that involved multiple continents their locations temporal transmissions and timings of countrywide lock-down together demonstrated the effectiveness of existing travel restriction policies which may have been greatly enhanced by the natural geo-isolation and the public health measures in controlling the transmission of sars-cov-2 the discovery of such a large number of country-private variants and haplotypes in a matter of 6 months raises legitimate concerns about the potential emergence of novel strains with increased virulence andor transmissibility source of sras-cov-2 sequences the major external resources of sars-cov-2 isolates genome sequences and variants were gisaid genbank cncb and nextstrain data was downloaded in various formats depending on the exact implementations of these external resources eighty-three viral sequences from the center for personalized medicine childrens hospital los angeles chla were also included the viral genome sequences and metadata were cross-examined to identify and to remove duplicate entries present in multiple resources variant  haplotype analysis variants were called against the sars-cov-2 reference sequence nc0455122 using dnadiff from mummer marais et al 2018 v4  the analysis was automated with custom batch scripts variant functional annotation was carried out by snpeff v431t the ribosome slippage region positions in cdna and protein were manually adjusted to account for the coronavirus programmed translational frameshift the combination or constellation of all variants called in an isolate constitutes the haplotype of the isolate the isolates with excessive numbers of variants 30 per isolate were excluded from the down-stream analysis as they likely represented low-quality sequences all raw sequence metadata and analysis results were loaded into a mysql database for integration and summarization phylogenetic analysis evolution inference or relatedness analysis of viral isolates was carried out with full-length sars-cov-2 sequences using the virus genome tracker tool of chla card  an isolates variant profile was compared against the global collection of over 50500 viral sequences in card the closest isolates with identical or the most similar variant profiles were identified and classified into identical ancestral or descendent categories for comprehensive and representative phylogenetic analysis to profile the over 50000 viral genomes 2 to 6 best quality sequences per haplotype were picked more sequences were picked from the larger haplotypes a total of 4044 sequences were included in the final analysis leading and trailing missing bases nnnn were trimmed off genome sequences multiple sequence alignment msa was done with mafft version 7460 katoh et al 2002 katoh and toh 2008 using speed-oriented method fft-ns-i iterative refinement method two cycles optimized for large data-sets of thousands of full-length viral genomes the original multiple sequence alignment msa was manually examined in bioedit to remove obviously low quality or outlier sequences the resulting msa was trimmed off 55 bases from the start then 65 bases from the end to exclude these likely low coverage regions internal gaps over 5 bases in length or ones caused by missing bases were removed the final trimmed msa was used in mega-x kumar et al 2018 for evolutionary inference via the maximum likelihood method assuming protein-coding sequences and under the general time reversible model nei and kumar 2000  positions with over 2 alignment gaps missing data and ambiguous bases were excluded the closest coronavirus sequence from bat epiisl402131mn996532 batyunnanratg132013 was included in msa and tree building as the outgroup

residential and exposure counties along with the date of sample collection sequence technology and quality and other demographic data such as patient gender and age enrichment tests among groups defined by meta-data were carried out with the chi-square test for missense vs synonymous variant analysis the in-silica predicted missense and synonymous variant numbers were used as the background assuming neutral selection on all coding sites then the observed variant and isolated numbers were used in the pearsons chi-squared test with yates continuity correction to identify enrichment and depletion by function types the clade assignments from the gisaidorg were included when available and used in stratification of the haplotypes from the matching isolates  table 7  the clades were g gh

china in december 2019 the death toll rose to more than 68000 among 1250000 confirmed cases around the globe until april 4 2020 who world health organization 2020 the virus causing covid-19 is named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 based on the phylogenetic studies the sars-cov-2 is categorized as a member of the genus betacoronavirus the same lineage that includes sars coronavirus sars-cov gorbalenya 2020 that caused sars severe acute respiratory syndrome in china during 2002 ksiazek et al 2003 recent studies showed that sars-cov-2 has a close relationship with bat sars-like covs li et al 2005 zhou et al 2020 though the intermediate hosts for zoonotic transmission of sars-cov-2 from bats to humans remain undiscovered sars-cov-2 has been identified as an enveloped single-stranded positive-sense rna virus with a genome size of approximately 299 kb encoding 27 proteins from 14 orfs including 15 non-structural 8 accessory and 4 major structural proteins two-thirds of the viral rna harbours the first orf orf1ab dedicated for translating polyprotein 1a pp1a and polyprotein 1ab pp1ab which later undergo proteolytic cleavage to form 15 non-structural proteins spike glycoprotein s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n are the four major structural proteins of sars-cov-2 wu et al 2020a wu et al 2020b interestingly s glycoprotein is characterized as the critical determinant for viral entry into host cells which consists of two functional subunits namely s1 and s2 the s1 subunit recognizes and binds to the host receptor through the receptor-binding domain rbd whereas s2 is responsible for fusion with the host cell membrane wrapp et al 2020 walls et al 2020 chen et al 2020 mers-cov uses dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp4 as entry receptor raj et al 2013 whereas sars-cov and sars-cov-2 utilize ace-2 angiotensin converting enzyme-2 li et al 2003 abundantly available in lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes suggesting s glycoprotein as a potential drug target to halt the entry of sars-cov-2 letko et al 2020 according to recent reports neutralizing antibodies are generated in response to the entry and fusion of surface-exposed s protein mainly rbd domain which is predicted to be an important target for vaccine candidates chen et al 2020 hoffmann et al 2020 tian et al nd however sars-cov-2 has emerged with

date few genomic variations of sars-cov-2 are reported ceraolo and giorgi 2020 lu et al nd there is growing evidence that spike protein a 1273 amino acid long glycoprotein having multiple domains possibly plays a major role in sars-cov-2 pathogenesis viral entry to the host cell is initiated by the receptor-binding domain rbd of s1 head upon receptor-binding proteolytic cleavage occurs at s1s2 cleavage site and two heptad repeats hr of s2 stalk form a six-helix bundle structure triggering the release of the fusion peptide as it comes into close proximity to the transmembrane anchor tm the tm domain facilitates membrane destabilization required for fusion between virus-host membranes bosch et al 2003 liu et al 2004 insights into the sequence variations of s glycoprotein among available genomes are key to understanding the biology of sars-cov-2 infection developing antiviral treatments and vaccines in this study we have analyzed 320 genomic sequences of sars-cov-2 to identify mutations between the available genomes followed by the amino acid variations in the glycoprotein s to foresee their impact on the viral entry to host cell from structural biology viewpoint all available sequences 320 whole genome and surface glycoprotein amino acid sequences of sars-cov-2 related to the covid-19 pandemic were retrieved from ncbi virus variation resource repository httpswwwncbinlmnihgovlabsvirus hatcher et al 2017 among the protein sequences 11 were discarded due to incomplete sequence coverage in addition all 40 s glycoprotein sequences from different coronavirus families were retrieved for phylogenetic analysis the ncbi reference sequence of sars-cov-2 s glycoprotein accession number yp009724390 was used as the canonical sequence for the analyses of spike protein variants variant analyses of sars-cov-2 genomes were performed in the genome detective coronavirus typing tool version 113 which is specially designed for this virus httpswwwgenomedetectivecomapptypingtoolcov cleemput et al 2020 for multiple sequence alignment msa genome detective coronavirus typing tool uses a reference dataset of 431 whole genome sequences wgs

 the phylogenetic analysis of a total of 66 sequences 26 unique sars-cov-2 and 40 different coronavirus s glycoprotein sequences was performed the evolutionary distances showed that all the sars-cov-2 spike proteins cluster in the same node of the phylogenetic tree confirming the sequences are similar to refseq yp009724390 fig 2
 bat coronaviruses has a close evolutionary relationship as different strains were found in the nearest outgroups and clades bat coronavirus bm4831 bat hp-beta coronavirus bat coronavirus hku9 conferring that coronavirus has vast geographical spread and bat is the most prevalent host fig 2 in other clades the clusters were speculated through different hosts which may describe the evolutionary changes of surface glycoprotein due to cross species transmission viral hosts reported from different spots at different times is indicative of possible recombination the s glycoprotein sequences of sars-cov-2 were retrieved from the ncbi virus variation resource repository and aligned using clustalw the position of sars-cov-2 spike protein domains was measured by aligning with the sars-cov spike protein fig 3
 yuan et al 2017 gui et al 2017 from the sequence identity matrix 26 unique variants among unique sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein sequences were identified to have 25 substitutions and a deletion fig 4a and supplementary table 3 215 sequences were found identical with sars-cov-2 s protein reference sequence yp009724390 while 64 sequences were identical with the same variation of d614g supplementary table 4 5 among all the variations twelve y28n t29i h49y l54f n74k e96d d111n y145del f157l g181v s221w and s247r were located at n-terminal domain ntd another 6 variations a348t r408i g476s v483a h519q a520s were found at the receptor-binding domain rbd while only two variations a930v and d936y were found at heptad repeat 1 hr1 domain single variations were found in signal peptide l5f domain sub-domain-2 d614g sub-domain-3 a1078v heptad repeat 2 domain d1168h and cytoplasmic tail domain d1259h each notable that the substitution of cystine by phenylalanine was observed at 19 amino acids upstream of the fusion peptide domain fig 4a the mutation of aspartic acid to glycine at position 614 was observed 71 times with entropy value over 05 among the available 320 sars-cov-2 spike protein sequences supplementary fig 2 alterations of amino acid residual charge from positive to neutral h49y r408i h519q negative to neutral d111n d614g d936y negative to positive d1168h d1259h and neutral to positive n74k s247r were seen in variants qhw06059 qhs34546 qis61422 qis61338 qik50427 qis30615 qis60978 qis60582 qio04367 and qhr84449 respectively due to substitution of amino acid that differs in charge the remaining 15 variants were mutated with the amino acids that are similar in charge fig 4 a the sars-cov-2 spike protein variants were superposed with the cryo-electron microscopic structure of sars-cov-2 spike protein wrapp et al 2020 l5f n74k e96d f157l g181v s247r g476s v483a d1168h and d1259h variants were excluded from superposition due to absence of respective residues in the 3d structure of template pdb 6vsb the superposition showed that most of the residual change was causing incorporation of bulky amino acid residues t29i h49y l54f s221w a348t h519q a520s a930v d936y and a1078v in place of smaller size residue except y28n d111n r408i d614g and f797c fig 4 bp the sequence comparison of spike glycoprotein between sars-cov-2 variants and sars-cov uniprot id p59594 revealed nearly 7746 similarity and identified the presence of additional 22 amino acids in sars-cov-2 spike protein variants resulting from a total of 5 insertions supplementary fig 3 among these the major insertion consisting of 7 amino acids gtngtkr at position 7278 followed by 4 amino acids nksw at position 149152 and 6 amino acids syltpg at 247252 occurred in n-terminal domain insertion of glycine at 482 was found in receptor binding domain preceding another insertion of 4 amino acids nspr at position 679682 just upstream of s1s2 cleavage site that leads to form a furin-like cleavage site prrars in the s protein variants of sars-cov-2 supplementary fig 3 the s2 subunit of spike protein especially the heptad repeat region 2 fusion peptide domain transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail were found to be highly conserved in the sars-cov and the sars-cov-2 variants while the s1 subunit was more diverse specifically the n-terminal domain ntd and receptor-binding domain rbd the spatial distribution of s protein sequences having different variation over time reveals that most of the variants 17 out of 240 s glycoprotein sequences were reported from the us followed by 3 out of 2 sequences including y145 deletion and 2 out of 50 sequences from india and china respectively fig 5
 only one variant was found out of only one available sequence in the repository from sweden australia south korea and peru interestingly all sequences are unique among countries from the sequence reported except d614g which was found in the us and peru fig 5 moreover we have also analyzed sequences from brazil italy nepal pakistan spain taiwan and vietnam but there is no variation in the s glycoprotein sequence was found when compared to refseq yp009724390 covid 19 is one of the most contagious pandemics the world has ever had with 1250000 confirmed cases to date april 4 2020 and the cases have increased as high as 5 times in less than a month who world health organization 2020 phylogenetic analysis showed that the sars-cov-2 is a unique coronavirus presumably related to bat coronavirus bm4831 hp-betacoronavirus during this study we investigated the available genomes of sars-cov-2 and found variations in 483 positions resulting in 130 synonymous and 228 non-synonymous variants out of them 25 non-synonymous variants were observed in the spike protein of sars-cov-2 viral spike protein is thought to have a crucial role in drug and vaccine development as reported previously in managing the viruses like sars-cov and mers-cov tian et al nd kapadia et al 2005 elshabrawy et al 2012 du et al 2013 likewise a number of studies targeting sars-cov-2 spike protein have been undertaken for the therapeutic measures xia et al 2020 but the unique structural and functional details of sars-cov-2 spike protein are still under scrutiny we also found a variant r408i at receptor binding domain rbd that mutated from positively charged arginine residue to neutral and smaller sized isoleucine residue fig 4 i this change might alter the interaction of viral rbd with the host receptor because the r408 residue of sars-cov-2 is known to interact with the ace2 receptor for viral entry ortega et al 2020 similarly alterations of rbd g476s v483a h519q and a520s also could affect the interaction of sars-cov-2 spike protein with other molecules which require further investigations qia98583 and qis30615 variants were found to have an alteration of alanine to valine a930v and aspartic acid to tyrosine d936y respectively in the alpha helix of the hr1 domain previous reports have indicated that hr1 domain plays a significant role in viral fusion and entry by forming helical bundles with hr2 and mutations including alanine substitution by valine a1168v in hr1 region are predominantly responsible for conferring resistance to mouse hepatitis coronaviruses against hr2 derived peptide entry inhibitors bosch et al 2008 this study hypothesizes the mutation a930v found in that of sars-cov-2 might also have a role in the emergence of drug-resistance virus strains also the mutation d1168h found in the heptad repeat 2 hr sars-cov-2 could play a vital role in viral pathogenesis moreover we found that 20 variants including one deletion out of 26 were located within s1 especially within ntd and rbd region of glycoprotein s fig 4a which region is responsible for the preliminary interaction with the host cell receptor ace2 this indicates that the ntd and rbd are very prone to mutations however the ntd and rbd portions harbour potential epitopes that might serve as potential peptide vaccine candidates against sars-cov-2 as reported in different studies bhattacharya et al 2020 rasheed et al 2020 rahman et al 2020 the reason behind choosing the sequences from s protein domain ntd and rbd is they are situated in the outer surface of the virus that could be more accessible for the immune system fig 3c so the variations reported herein within the outer domains of s glycoprotein could help to design effective epitope-based vaccines or antivirals the sars-cov-2 s protein contains additional furin protease cleavage site prrars in s1s2 domain which is conserved among all 320 sequences as revealed during this study supplementary fig 3 this unique signature is thought to make the sars-cov-2 more virulent than sars-cov and regarded as novel features of the viral pathogenesis walls et al 2020 according to previous reports the more the host cell protease can process the coronavirus s can accelerate viral tropism accordingly in influenza virus walls et al 2020 klenk and garten 1994 steinhauer 1999 millet and whittaker 2015 apart from that this could also promote viruses to escape antiviral therapies targeting transmembrane protease tmprss2 clinicaltrialsgov nct04321096 which is well reported protease to cleave at s1s2 of s glycoprotein fehr and perlman 2015 comparative analyses between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein showed 77 similarity between them where the most diverse region was the n-terminal domain and receptor binding domain the insertion of 17 additional amino acid residues in the n-terminal domain of sars-cov-2 and its high sequence diversity suggests that it may have a role in binding with other cell receptors in humans this is because the n-terminal domain could function as the receptor-binding domain of various coronaviruses receptor recognition mechanisms of coronaviruses a decade of structural studies 2020 yuan et al 2017 a similar phenomenon has been observed in mouse hepatitis coronavirus mhv and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus tgev where the n-terminal domain is reported to be attached with the host entry receptor williams et al 1991 delmas et al 1992 the spatial distribution of variations in amino acid sequences of s glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 showed that 17 variations out of 26 found among the sequences deposited from the us but there are 7 unique variations found among sequences from 5 countries from 4 continents namely australia europe latin america and asia out of 6 sequences available during the study period fig 5 although the number of sequences analyzed herein is too small to speculate the exact trend of s glycoprotein evolution these variants might play a vital role in adaptation to a new geospatial environment the variation analyses in amino acids indicated the structural features of different domains of the sars-cov-2 spike proteins the variations have multiple effects on the structure resulting in change in stability favoring various interactions and conformational diversity an augmented infection kinetics and viral spreading may have association with the structural changes and composition of residues in the viral spike protein however to identify the actual role of involvement of s glycoprotein a larger dataset regarding genomics and proteomics of sars-cov-2 is required as this protein is vital to understand the viral pathogenicity evolution and development of therapeutics further analyses of all the s glycoprotein and sars-cov-2 genomes with different epidemiological aspects is warranted to get the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 syed mohammad lokman draft writing visualization formal analysis data curation writing

applying machine intelligence and beyond shashata sawmya arpita saha sadia tasnim naser anjum ali toufikuzzaman muhammad haisam mohammad rafid saifur m rahman sohel  rahman  covid-19 pandemic caused by the sars-cov-2 strain of coronavirus has affected millions of people all over the world and taken thousands of lives it is of utmost importance that the character of this deadly virus be studied and its nature be analysed we present here an analysis pipeline comprising phylogenetic analysis on strains of this novel virus to track its evolutionary history among the countries uncovering several interesting relationships followed by a classification exercise to identify the virulence of the strains and extraction of important features from its genetic material that are used subsequently to predict mutation at those interesting sites using deep learning techniques in a nutshell we have prepared an analysis pipeline for hcov genome sequences leveraging the power of machine intelligence and uncovered what remained apparently shrouded by raw data  covid-19 was declared a global health pandemic on march 11 2020 1  it is the biggest public health concern of this century 22  it has already surpassed the previous two outbreaks due to the coronavirus namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov the virus acting behind this epidemic is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or in short sars-cov-2 virus it is a single stranded rna virus which is mainly 26000 to 32000 bases long in average 2  the novel coronavirus is spherical in shape and has spike protein protruding from its surface these spikes assimilate into human cells then undergo a structural change that allows the viral membrane to fuse with the cell membrane the host cell is then attacked by the viral gene through intrusion and it copies itself within the host cell producing multiple new viruses 3  as of mid-april 2020 about 10000 of high-quality complete genome sequences were present in the gisaid initiative database 23 collected from clinicians and researchers from around the world to understand the viral evolution and its nature of spread among the different countries we present an analysis pipeline of the genome sequence leveraging the power of machine intelligence this paper makes the following key contributions a an alignment-free phylogenetic analysis is carried out with a goal to uncover the evolutionary history of sars-cov-2 the resulting phylogenetic tree is able to highlight evolutionary relationships that can be explained by facts and figures and has further identified some mysterious relationships b several machine learning and deep learning models are used to identify the virulence of the strains ie to classify a virus strain as either severe or mild additionally from the classification pipeline important features are identified as sites of interest sois in the virus strains for further analysis c several cnn-rnn based models are used to predict mutations at specific sites of interest sois of the sars-cov-2 genome sequence followed by further analyses of the same on several south-asian countries d overall we present an analysis pipeline that can be further utilized as well as extended and revised a to study where a newly discovered genome sequence lies in relation to its predecessors in different regions of the world b to analyse its virulence with respect to the number of deaths its predecessors have caused in their respective countries and c to analyse the mutation at specific important sites of the viral genome figure 1  the whole analysis pipeline consisted of three phases in the first phase the genome sequences are divided into subsets based on country and a phylogenetic tree is constructed considering only the representative sequences of each such subset using an alignment-free sequence comparison approach in the second phase we employed state of the art classification algorithms leveraging both traditional and deep learning pipelines to learn to discriminate the viral strains of many countries as either mild or severe we also identify the features that contributed the most as the discriminant factor in the classification pipeline finally we use the identified features from the previous stare to predict the mutation of the interesting sites in the viral strain using a deep learning model figure 1 presents our overall analysis pipeline below we present the details of the pipeline we have collected 10179 hcov genome sequences upto the date 24 april 2020 cut-off date from the gisaid initiative dataset 23  these are high quality complete viral genome sequences submitted by the scientists and scientific institutes of individual countries we also have collected country wise death statistics upto cut-off date from the official site of who 6  the label was assigned based on a threshold of deaths which is the estimated median of the number of deaths in the data points any genome sequence of a country having deaths below above the threshold were considered a mild severe strain ie assigned a label 0 1 a sample labelling is shown in the supplementary table 1 informatively we have also considered some other metrics for labeling  purposes albeit with unsatisfactory output please see supplementary file for details  we divided the whole dataset into training and testing subset in 8020 ratio with a balanced number of data points per class for traditional machine learning pipeline and for deep learning classification routine we created the subsets trainingvalidationtesting in 681220 ratio figure 2  the viral genome sequences were divided into subsets of sequences based on country for each subset each viral genome sequence is converted into a vector representation and pairwise euclidean distance was calculated among the vectors to create the distance matrix as the matrix is very highdimensional we used principal component analysis to find the principal component matrix from the distance matrix representative sequences were identified through k-means clustering on the pca matrix and a phylogenetic tree was constructed from the representative sequence of each country we aim to identify and interpret the evolutionary relationships among the hcov genome sequences uploaded at gisaid from different regions around the globe  figure 2  to do that we have used an alignment-free genome sequence comparison method as proposed in 5 as briefly described below notably we do not consider any alignmentbased method since it is not computationally feasible for us to align thousands of viral sequences for analysis and clustering purposes 4  at first the sequence set is divided into subsets of sequences based on the location all sequences are converted into representative  18 vector pairwise distance among vectors derived from the fast vector method 5 are computed using euclidean distance due to the high dimensionality of the resulting distance matrix we resort to principal component analysis pca technique 9 to reduce the dimension of the matrix subsequently we use k-means clustering 43 to identify the corresponding cluster centers for the k-means clustering algorithm we have used the implementation of 38 and used the default parameters except for the number of clusters which were set to 1 for determining the cluster center for each of the subsets for each location-based cluster the representative sequence ie the centroid of the cluster is then identified and used in the subsequent step of the pipeline the evolutionary relationship among the representative sequences of different clusters from section 22 has been estimated by constructing a phylogenetic tree we have used the neighbor joining algorithm 37 for phylogenetic tree construction since it is more reliable 25  we have used euclidean distance among the vectors as described in the section 22 to prepare the distance matrix while we predominantly have used the alignment-free method of 5  in this stage we have only 67 representative sequences and hence we have also attempted a few other alignment-free and alignment-based methods to estimate the phylogenetic tree however these didnt produce satisfactory results more details are in supplementary file  for traditional machine learning we use a pipeline similar to 12 see figure 3 in supplementary file we extracted three types of features from the genomic sequence of novel sars-cov-2 inspired by the recent works 12 14 64 65 that focus only on sequences we also extract only sequence-based features these features are position independent features n-gapped dinucleotides and position specific features see details in section 3 of supplementary file we use the gini value of the extremely randomized tree extra tree classifier 13 to rank the features subsequently only the features with gini value greater than the mean of the gini values are selected for training a lightgbm classifier model 15 with default parameters and performed 10-fold cross validation lightgbm is a highly efficient and fast gradient boosting framework which uses tree-based algorithms we use shap values and univariate feature selection to compare the importance of the features shap shapley additive explanations is a game theoretic approach which is used to explain the output of a model 44  univariate feature selection works by selecting the best features based on univariate statistical tests 50  we use selectkbest univariate feature selection to get the top k highest scoring features according to anova fclassif feature scoring 56 function we leverage the power of 3 different deep learning dl classification models namely vanilla cnn 7  alexnet 40 and inceptionnet 41  we transform the raw viral genome sequences into two different representations namely k-mers spectral representation 7 and one hot vectorization 8 to feed those into the dl networks in a seamless manner details of these representations are given in section 52 of the supplementary file for k-mers spectral representation we experimented with different values of k k  357 for vanila cnn and k  3  5 only for the rest due to resource limitation for one hot vectorization we have trained inceptionnet for 150 epochs for both 3-and 5-mers and trained alexnet for 135 100 and 100 epochs for 3-4-and 5-mers respectively we design a pipeline to predict mutation on specific sites chosen in an earlier stage of the pipeline in the sars-cov-2 genome figure 4  we follow a similar protocol followed by 10 and adopt it to fit our setting as follows we divide all the available countries and the states of the usa into different time-steps by the date of the first reported incidence of sars-cov-2 infected patients of that location thus every resulting time-step represents a date tk for cluster k and contains the clusters of genome sequences of the countriesstates then the time series samples are generated by concatenating sites from different time-step one-by-one that represent the evolutionary path of the sars-cov-2 viral strain for example t1 is the very first date when the virus is discovered in china so the time-step 1 contains only one country china likewise time-step t2 contains clusters for those countries where the virus is discovered on date t2 and so on check table 3 in supplementary file for more details we generate 300000 time series sequences by concatenating genome sites from t1t2tn in our case n  40 and then fed the samples to the model which consists of a convolutional one dimensional layer and a recurrent neural network layer 34  we experiment with both pure lstm and bidirectional lstm as our rnn layer see section 43 of supplementary file the model has a dense layer of 4 neurons in the end which predicts the probability of the next base pair of the next time-step so in a nut-shell the model takes concatenated genome sequences from t1t2tn-1 as input and predicts the mutation for time tn we further use our mutation prediction pipeline to identify and analyze possible parents of a mutated strain for this particular analysis we trained the models specifically for some south-asian countries namely bangladesh india and pakistan we only used the best performing model for this analysis and generated five time series samples at the time of generating these samples the countrylocation having the minimal euclidean distance was taken for each time-step we have implemented our experiments mostly in python we have used scikit-learn library 38 for clustering and plotting the graphs for deep learning models scikit-learn tensorflow and keras neural network libraries are used and for lightgbm classifier python lightgbm framework has been used the phylogenetic trees are constructed using the dendropy library of python 57 keeping default parameters we use the tree visualizer tools dendroscope 11 and evolview 24 for tree visualization and annotation the experiments have been conducted in the following machines a clustering and phylogenetic analyses have been carried out in a machine with intelr core tm i7-6500u cpu  250ghz ubuntu 1904 os and 8 gb ram b experiments involving the deep learning pipelines ie both classification and mutation prediction have been conducted in the work-stations of galileo cloud computing platform 35 and the default gpu provided by the google colaboratory cloud computing platform 36  c the lightgbm classifier model was trained in a machine with intel core i5-4010u cpu  170ghz x 4 windows 10 os and 16 gb ram all the codes and data except for the genome sequences of our pipeline can be found at the following link httpsgithubcompythonloaderanalyzing-hcov-genome-sequence the genome sequence data have been extracted from and are publicly available at gisaid 23  we identify the representative sequence of each of the 67 countries as present in the gisaid dataset upto cut-off date the estimated phylogenetic tree constructed from the representative sequences is shown in figure 5  in what follows we will be referring to this tree as the sc2 sars-cov-2 tree the phylogenetic tree generated is expected to reveal the evolutionary relationship of the viral strains however with careful scrutiny we have some apparently unusual but interesting observations for example it is generally expected that the countries sharing open borders eg countries in europe should be either neighbours or at least in the same clade in the tree however surprisingly from the tree we do not notice geographically adjacent countries in europe as neighbors rather we see for example that china and italy are immediate neighbors it is to be noted that these two countries are also the first countries to get hit by the first pandemic wave in addition to that although the usa and canada share the longest un-militarized international border in the world representative strains do not appear to be sister branches as they should have been also we notice that the usa uk canada turkey and russia are in the same clade which have a higher number of deaths than most of the other countries all our classifiers are trained to learn whether a given strain is mild or severe the classification accuracy of the lightgbm classifier 91 is superior to that of the deep learning classifiers 84-89 which while is somewhat surprising is in line with the recent findings of 12  it should be noted that lightgbm had produced better results in significantly less time than deep learning models for this dataset the results of the classifier models are shown in figure 6  quantitative results aside we also have applied our classifiers on the sequences that have been deposited at gisaid after the cut-off date ie april 18 2020 since the cutoff date the country wise death statistics 6 has certainly changed significantly and this has pushed a few countries particularly from asian regions and several states of the united states of america transition from mild to severe state based on our predefined threshold interesting our classifiers have been able to predict the severity of the new strains submitted from these countriesstates correctly table 6 in the supplementary file shows a snapshot of a few such countriesstates with the relevant information we preliminarily identify the top 10 features of shap and selectkbest feature selection with k10 from these features as sois we have selected the features that are also biologically significant ie cover different significant gene expression regions  figure  7  in particular we have selected the position specific features pos84458449 pos1961019614 pos2406524069 and pos2382523829 as the sois for the mutation prediction analyses down the pipeline here posxy indicates the site from positions x to y of the virus strains the reason for selecting these features as sois are outlined below according to gene expression studies 62 63 our sois namely pos84458449 and pos1961019614 encode to two non-structural proteins nsp3 and nsp11 respectively and our other two sois namely pos2406524069 and pos2382523829 correspond to the spike protein of sars-cov-2 nsp3 binds to viral rna nucleocapsid protein as well as other viral proteins and participates in polyprotein processing it is an essential component of the replicationtranscription complex 51  so the mutation in this protein is expected to affect the replication process of the sars-cov-2 in host bodies on the other hand the spike protein sticks out from the envelope of the virion and plays a pivotal role in the receptor host selectivity and cellular attachment according to wan et al there exists strong scientific evidence that sars and sars-cov-2 spike proteins interact with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 52  the mutation on this protein is expected to have a significant impact on the human to human transmission 53  therefore it is certainly interesting and useful to predict the mutation of such sois cnn-lstm and cnn-bidirectional lstm performed in a similar manner for different sois of the genome registering 9498 and 95 accuracy respectively considering all sois together for detailed results please check table 7 and table 8 of the supplementary material for the model involving only bangladesh we applied the cnn-bidirectional lstm model as this is the best performer among the two and achieved almost 100 accuracy then we analyzed the ancestors in the time series test samples and noticed that some of the states of the usa are present in these samples these states are california massachusetts texas new jersey and maryland for india and pakistan we got similar results for some sites but for other sites accuracy was not as high as bangladesh check table 9 of the supplementary file for details our analyses reveal a very close evolutionary relationship between the genome sequences of china and italy also similarity was found among the virus strains of the usa germany qatar and poland these countries have similar numbers of deaths and although not geographically directly adjacent except for germany and poland they have strong air connectivity among them in fact a number of interesting relationships can be inferred from the estimated phylogenetic tree as follows chinese tourists 26  this relationship is clearly portrayed in the sc2 tree where the two strains appear to be immediate siblings 2 polands strain is in the same clade as that of germany which can be explained by the fact that its strain through polands patient zero came from germany 27  3 taiwan is geographically very close to china the virus was confirmed to have spread to taiwan on january 21 2020 through a 55-year-old woman who had been teaching in wuhan china 28  the virus strains from these regions are also close together as can be seen from the sc2 tree about 6 branches apart similar relationship can also be inferred from the tree between china and south korea the strain of the virus in south korea is believed to be transmitted from china firstly through a 35-year old chinese woman and secondly by a 55-year old south korean national 29  interestingly from the sc2 tree it can also be deduced that the south korean strain is very close to that of taiwan and also near to the strain from china the incident of a taiwanese woman being deported from south korea after refusing to stay at a quarantine facility can be a probable explanation as to how the south korean strain might have found its path to taiwan 46  4 on march 2 2020 the virus was confirmed to have reached portugal when it was reported that a portuguese 33 year-old man working in spain was tested positive for covid-19 after returning home 49  subsequently within a span of 9 days 5 more cases were reported all originating from spain 49 61  the fact that the first cases of covid-19 in portugal originated from spain is clearly captured in our sc2 tree 5 the sc2 tree suggests that indias strain is closely related to that from china and also italy around 4 branches and that it is also connected to that from saudi arabia these relationships can be explained as follows a 7 turkeys first identified case was a man who was travelling europe 33  turkey also announced a huge number of cases and subsequent deaths which were originating from europe 47  in our inferred relationship we can see that the turkish representative strain is quite close to several central and western european countries like russia iceland and ireland which can be backed up by the two facts stated above 8 it is visible from the sc2 tree that the strain of germany is very close to the strains of both poland and the usa it might be the case that the community transmission occurred concurrently in both usa and poland from germany which hit the peak of pandemic before both usa and poland 42  9 qatar has the second highest number of covid-19 patients in the middle-east 48  the first case of qatar was reported on february 272020 to be a man working in iran 55  qatar introduced a travel ban to and from germany and the usa as precautionary measures in mid-march quite a while later following the first occurrence qatar has 5 air-routes with germany and usa with more than 10 airlines operating in that route 59 60  though the first case has originated from iran it might be the case that subsequent patients were found to be travelling from the aforementioned countries as a result of which the travel ban was introduced our estimated sc2 tree places qatar very close to both the usa and germany 10 while we can certainly explain many of the relationships identified by the estimated sc2 tree a above there are some relationships which are not that apparent one such example is the direct relationship between vietnam and greece while apparently there exists no direct relationship when investigated further we identified something interesting patient zero of greece is believed to have been contaminated during her trip to the milan fashion week which took place during february 18-24 2020 45  interestingly the first covid-19 patient in hanoi 16 left hanoi on february 15 to visit family members living in london england and three days later she traveled from london to milan city could she be in contact with patient zero of greece or any other who had been contaminated by the latter before returning to london on february 20 we cant be certain but our inferred relationship between vietnam and greece certainly put a lot of legitimacy to that question 11 finally we are unable to find any apparent explanation analyzing the reported news sources for a few other strong relationships inferred by the tree eg congo-iran panama-malaysia sweden-singapore japan-australia etc this could be because of the inherent inaccuracies of the distance matrices as well as the limitations of the tree estimation algorithms none of these algorithms are 100 accurate from another angle perhaps the tree did identify these relationships correctly but the relevant incidences were not accurately identified or not documented in recent times the number of deaths is increasing rapidly in india we have been closely following the change in the virus strains of india before and after the cut-off date a genome sequence epiisl435050 was collected on april 13 2020 before our cutoff date from a patient in ahmedabad gujrat india it was predicted to be a severe strain with low confidence even though at that time we trained the classifier to consider the indian sequences as mild according to our evolutionary relationship india is very close to both italy and china so we calculated the distance between the representative sequence of both italy and china with this strain we considered another strain epiisl437447 which was collected from another patient from the same place in india on april 26 2020 after our cut-off date and predicted the severity thereof the classifiers declared this isolate to be severe with very high confidence about 98 we did the distance calculation like before interestingly it was identified that this isolate is closer to both italy and chinas representative sequence than the previous less severe one this strongly suggests that there were some mutations that turned the indian sequences from mild or less severe to severe or highly severe respectively also the sequences from the us states of pennsylvania maryland indiana illinois and florida that were collected on may 25 2020 about one month after our cut-off date were analyzed and our classifiers could correctly capture the severity of the genome sequences see table 4 in the supplementary file we conduct an analysis to predict possible parents of the mutated virus strains of the south asian region bangladesh india and pakistan our mutation prediction pipeline suggests that the strains of some states of the usa namely california massachusetts texas new jersey and maryland could be the parentsancestors of these south asian strains now the total deaths in these states up to june 1 2020 are 4240 6846 1686 11711 and 2532 respectively 58 and the strains thereof are also classified to be severe by our classification pipeline it thus seems quite likely that the sars-cov-2 situation in these south-asian countries will worsen in near future bangladesh india and pakistan are ranked 88 th  112 th and 122 nd in global health performance compared to the united states of america which is at the 37 th position 54  in the majority of lower middle-income countries such as bangladesh india and pakistan available hospital beds are  1 bed per 1000 population and icu beds are  1 bed per 100000 population 39  additionally an uncontrolled epidemic is predicted to have 6000220 deaths having a duration of nearly 200 days in the majority of these countries 39  these predictions coupled with our findings call for stern actions ie interventions on part of these countries bibliography  emergence of novel coronavirus and covid-19 whether to stay or die out asim biswas uttaran bhattacharjee alok chakrabarti kumar devendra tewari nath hasina banu shanta dutta   towards the end of the first decade of the 21st century during december 2019 numerous pneumonia incidences of unidentified cause appeared in wuhan hubei china with clinical presentations greatly resembling flu and viral pneumonia after virus isolation and analysis of viral genome sequence from infected patients samples a novel coronavirus named as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 or sars-cov-2 initially designated as novel coronavirus or ncov-2019 was identified from an unknown source sars-cov-2 is the causative agent of respiratory disease which is recently named as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by the world health organisation who human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 is a major concern for the health care workers and a preliminary r0 reproductive number as the number of new infection one infected person generates on average throughout its infectious period measure of 1425 was reported by the who httpswwwwhointhealth-topicscoronavirus since its appearance within a months time enormous number of new cases are piling up and the actual r0 value may be quite higher than previously calculated wu et al 2020 epidemiological data suggest that approximately as of february 29 2020 79251 people infected with this virus in mainland china and multiple cases also reported from other parts of the world httpswhosprinklrcomhttpswwwmedpagetodaycominfectiousdiseasepublichealth84698 so far 60 other countries reported sars-cov-2 infection although most of the cases are migrants of china indicating a single introduction of this virus among the other countries south korea 3150 cases italy 889 cases japan 234 cases iran 388 cases singapore 96 cases hongkong 94 cases and usa 64 cases reported significant number of cases and the situation is getting complicated with time current findings indicate that various subtypes of coronaviruses are in circulation within the bat population including other species such as birds cats dogs pigs mice horses whales before they acquire the ability to cross the species barriers to cause human infection it is still unanswered that how sars-cov-2 has caused an outbreak in wuhan the initial wave of infection found associated with the seafood market of wuhan strengthening the hypothesis that close contact between the live or dead animal with an individual may be responsible for the initiation of the outbreak in the recent past there are examples of zoonotic transmission of bird flu which directly jumped from avian species to human but no transmission between the humans were established which kept the disease under control however the ability to spread among human to human upon close contact makes sars-cov-2 as a very important contagious agent to study and monitor whose devastation has already been established in wuhan hubei china covid-19 is one of the most alarming diseases in the globe at this moment the number of patients infected with sars-cov-2 is increasing in almost steady rate although in some days less number of cases was reported total number of cases reached to 20000 in first 12 days 40000 in next 7 days and more than 80000 in just 33 days infections are causing varied clinical manifestation from mild symptoms to severe respiratory attacks although there is possibility of asymptomatic infection it has spread in many other countries beyond china therefore proper handling and management of the disease is critically important to prevent a pandemic history has taught several lessons regarding the endemic nature of emerging viral infections virus faces major challenges from pre-existing immunity to remain in the population other important factors such as case fatality rate cfr r0 and the reservoir hosts are crucial in influencing viral endemicity by analysing cfr of different rna viruses and their longevity in circulation throughout the globe it was found that viruses with higher cfr cfr 5 die out after few passages of infections sooner or later whereas viruses with low cfr remain endemic with a seasonal outbreak like common flu caused by influenza viruses figure 1 although it is very difficult to calculate actual cfr until the outbreak ends an initial estimate suggests that cfr for sars-cov-2 is 258 much closer to seasonal flu than the other coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov of the recent past ie 10 and 35 respectively httpswwwwhointemergenciesmers-coven indicating the ability of the sars-cov-2 to remain in circulation with low cfr throughout the world as per the recent data covid-19 has already claimed 2924 lives mainly in china although few deaths reported from other parts of the world however as of february 29 2020 39556 infected individuals already recovered from sars-cov2 infection who will eventually acquire immunity to the virus httpswwwmedpagetodaycominfectiousdiseasepublichealth84698 the covid-19 recovered population increases day by day with herd immunity of the population a virus may re-infect a person with pre-existing immunity either in its present form which is very unlikely or with acquired mutations to persist in the circulation sars-cov-2 recovered populations may enable the selection of mutant viruses and their spread in the community in this review we will discuss the critical factors influencing the continued viral appearance and periodical infection we will also discuss the novelty of this virus and its potential threat to cause periodic infection we have collected data from different studies and also analysed the genome sequence to define the evolutionary relationship of this virus moreover we have predicted the reason for the severity of this disease with literature support coronaviruses are enveloped and belongs to the family coronaviridae which is further subdivided into four genera alpha beta gamma and delta coronaviruses woo et al 2007 lefkowitz et al 2018 they possess a long positive-sense single-stranded rna genome ranging between 264 kb to 317 kb which is largest for any rna virus big rna genome of coronavirus provides additional flexible power in host adaptation and genome modification the genome organisation is overall same in all coronaviruses figure 2 two short untranslated regions utr are present at the 5 and 3 end of the genome and the coding genes are present in between the utr the arrangement of the coding gene is 5-replicase orf1ab spike s envelope e membrane m nucleocapsid n3 however variable numbers of additional orfs are present in between spike and nucleocapsid genes in different strains of coronaviruses the transcription regulatory motif trs is present at the 3 end of the genome which plays an important role in rna replication and recombination lai et al 1985 the complete genome size of the sars-cov-2 is approximately 29 kb 29825 nt-29903ntthe orf1ab gene is the largest gene segment of the coronavirus and it constitutes two orf ie orf1a and orf1b the position of the orf1ab gene in sars-cov-2 251-21541 nt slightly changes to starting codon position as compared to sars-cov 265-21486 nt and mers-cov 279-21514 generally a slippery sequence uuuaaac followed by a putative pseudoknot structure sequence is present in between the orfs the replicase orf1ab is cleaved by papain-like protease plpro and 3 c-like protease 3clpro the orf1ab gene of the coronavirus genome encodes1516 non-structural proteins nsp at the consensus cleavage site the nsp 12 and nsp 13 encode the rna-dependent rna polymerase and helicase protein respectively the newly emerging sars-cov-2 possesses a single point mutation at a slippery sequence a haemagglutinin esterase he gene is present downstream to orf1ab and upstream to the s gene which is absent in coronaviruses infecting humans three surface glycoproteins are found in all classes of coronaviruses ie spike s envelope e and membrane m the s proteins are type i membrane glycoproteins responsible for the formation of spikes present on the surface of coronaviruses the s proteins are cleaved into the receptor binding s1 domain and cell membrane fusion s2 domains the sars-cov-2 s2 domain represents higher identity with bat derived coronavirus strains than the s1 domain therefore the receptor-binding domain of sars-cov-2 is more similar to that of sars-cov 2002-03 and it has found that it uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as cellular receptor lu et al 2020 however some key amino acid substitution at positions 439 501 493 485 and 486 were observed in the sars-cov-2 receptor-binding domain those were thought to be important in sars-cov lu et al 2020 the e and m genes are conserved among all the coronaviruses these two genes encode two small transmembrane proteins associated with the envelope of all coronaviruses the coronavirus nucleocapsid n protein is a virion structural protein the n protein interacts with the viral genomic rna and helps in packaging of rna genome into virus particles by recognising a specific sequence the n protein-dependent assembly of the viral rna packaging signal is already established in sars-cov intracellular co-localization of n with replicase components is required for rna synthesis variable numbers of small orfs are present between the various conserved genes downstream to the n gene the 3a protein of sars-cov modulates virus release by forming a transmembrane homotetramer complex within channel protein other than the virus release the 3a protein helps in sars-cov-induced cell death golgi fragmentation and the accumulation of intracellular vesicles like the sars-cov and mers-cov the sars-cov-2 virus possesses several other small orfs orf9 orf13 orf14 orf10 at the downstream to n gene marra et al 2003 the function of the n gene and small orfs of sars-cov-2 is not yet known before the emergence of sars-cov in 2002 construction of phylogenetic tree for coronaviruses based on the pol or n gene was a standard practice using this method initially sars-cov was proposed as a member of gammacoronavirus marra et al 2003 rota et al 2003 however further analysis of the amino-terminal domain of the spike protein of the sars-cov revealed that 19 out of the 20 cysteine residues was spatially conserved within the betacoronavirus group rota et al 2003 on the other hand only five residues were found conserved within the alphacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus group rota et al 2003 furthermore the subsequent whole genome-based phylogenetic analysis concluded that sars-cov is a member of the betacoronavirus lineage phylogenetic analysis based on rdrp gene of sars-cov-2 revealed that it belongs to the genus betacoronavirus eickmann 2003 we have constructed a phylogenetic tree of the sars-cov-2 based on available sequences in genbank and gisaid data bank figure 3 phylogenetic analysis based on the spike gene of the sars-cov-2 represents that it belongs to the genus betacoronaviruses from the analysis of the sequences published since the emergence of sars-cov-2 it is evident that this virus is stably spreading without any noticeable mutation as they are clustered in a single group analysis from the phylogenetic tree represents that all the sars-cov-2 strains are distinctly separated from previously reported coronavirus endemic strains sars-cov and mers-cov hence the sars-cov-2 is termed as novel coronavirus analysis performed in our study also revealed that this virus is very similar to the bat derived coronavirus strain the sars-cov-2 and bat derived yunnanratg132013 coronavirus strain derived from common ancestor although they differs in in the size of the spike genes spike gene size in ratg133809 bp sars-cov-23822bp since sars-cov and mers-cov also derived from the bat bat originated human infecting coronavirus strain is not a novel event as shown in earlier studies that sars-cov and mers-cov used civets and camel respectively as an intermediate host to gain infection potentiality towards human guan et al 2003 alagaili et al 2014 it may be predicted that in case of sars-cov-2 transmission there may be one or more intermediate host present in between bats and human previous cases of human coronavirus infection commenced by sars-cov and mers-cov was accountable for severe pneumonia leading to high mortality the mechanistic explanation of their high morbidity and mortality is inadequately explained rapid virus replication reaching to high titres and associated enhanced inflammation is believed to be a cause of disease severity initial data from china shows that the sars-cov-2 produced observable symptoms primarily ards acute respiratory distress syndrome in elderly populations similar to human cases of h7n9 infection in china table 1 an earlier study with h7n9 infection also found the clinical exhibition of disease with high fever and rapidly progressive pneumonia that did not respond to antibiotics chen et al 2013 a recent study on sars-cov-2 infection showed that all the 41 patients had pneumonia and manifestations of a critical respiratory ailment similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus and was associated with icu admission and high mortality huang et al 2020 it is known that coronaviruses such as human sars-cov and bat sars-like cov sl-covzxc21 utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as their receptor and recent reports suggest that sars-cov-2 also uses the identical receptor for entry into the host cell zhou et al 2020 ace2 is an essential enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system ras that plays a significant role in regulating blood pressure and maintaining electrolyte and fluid homeostasis ace2 also protects an individual against severe acute lung damage that can be triggered by sepsis acid aspiration severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and the lethal avian influenza a h5n1 and h7n9 virus infection kuba et al 2005 yang et al 2014 zou et al 2014 moreover recent studies have shown that ace2 negatively regulates inflammatory responses during bacterial or viral infections yang et al 2014 sodhi et al 2019 sars-cov-2 infection utilizes ace2 for viral attachment and subsequent entry into cytosol therefore rapid replication of sars-cov-2 may reduce the surface expression of ace2 in the lung tissue which may cause further intensification of the inflammation and severity of the disease pathology glowacka et al 2010 figure 4 a recent study have found that smoking is associated with higher expression of ace2 when compared with the non-smokers which may be one of the reasons of some population for the vulnerability towards novel sars-cov-2 infection liu et al 2017 cai 2020 the pathophysiology of disease outcome depends on the extent of inflammatory responses within the host in absence of any specific antiviral drugs the primary therapeutic strategy to treat sars-cov-2 infection should be managing the inflammatory responses with anti-inflammatory drugs such as corticosteroids previous studies on sars patients have found a positive outcome when treated with corticosteroids chen et al 2006 who recommendations for managing this novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 infection discourage the application of corticosteroids the explanation for not using corticosteroids could be delayed viral clearance from the respiratory tract or blood with other corticosteroid-induced complications in the treated patients previously infected with sars and mers lee et al 2004 arabi et al 2018 russel et al 2020 during the pandemic in 2009 of influenza a infection a prospective cohort study showed reduced mortality in patients with h1n1 pdm09 viral pneumonia when treated with mild doses of corticosteroid li et al 2017 therefore these disparities in findings suggest that randomized controlled trials must be carried out to conclude the beneficial effect of corticosteroid medication in coronavirus-induced inflammation associated difficulties however doctors from the chinese thoracic society have recommended the application of corticosteroids to critically ill patients with sars-cov-2 pneumonia with a low to moderate dose 051 mgkg per day methylprednisolone or equivalent for short term 7 days zhao et al 2020 viruses face potent challenges from the host pre-existing immunity before they establish periodical infection the role of pre-existing immunity broadly studied for influenza virus infection biswas et al 2020 host immunity also allows the selection of mutant viruses to cause a new round of infection within the host with pre-existing immunity towards the earlier strains if the sars-cov-2 can withstand the new mutations and remains flexible to infect its host towards disease progression it will persist in circulation the primary wave of sars-cov-2 infection is under progress at present the majority of the exposed population will acquire some immunity eventually and the real hurdles for the viruses to defeat or bypass existing immunity will reflect with the acquired mutations within the virus in future to defeat host immunity viruses must mutate without losing their infectivity so far there are no published data regarding infection ability of sars-cov-2 and their mutation potential under robust immunological selection pressure within the host previous data from sars-cov and mers-cov infected individuals indicated that antibody response tends to be short-lived but remain longer depending on the severity of the infection t cell responses often target highly conserved internal proteins and are long-lived channappanavar et al 2014 alshukairi et al 2016 sars-cov-specific memory t cells but not memory b cells or antibody could be detected six years after infection in sars survivors tang et al 2011 in conclusion these studies present some ideas regarding selection pressure from the host immunity ie milder coronavirus infection may produce a short-lived humoral immune response as of february 29 2020 sars-cov-2 infected 85406 people and the infection turns into fatality for more than 2924 cases however as per the available data 39561 individual got recovered after infection percent recovery from this population indicates that  93 of the population already recovered from sars-cov2 infection this percentage was calculated as below within infected population total no recoveredtotal no of recovered  total no of death it can be predicted that at least 93 of the total population which may likely to go higher with the end of this outbreak will develop immunity towards this novel virus so far there is no vaccine available although in future vaccinated individual will also acquire some immunity the possibility of the future outbreak by sars-cov-2 will depend on the longevity of host immunity and bypassing of existing or pre-existing immunity by the mutant virus figure 5 the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases critically depend on reservoir hosts which can sustain the pathogen with a moderate or asymptomatic infection in the population even in the presence of resistance from primary hosts coronaviruses are found widely within bat pig cow and several other species previous reports also suggest that this virus is also presents in birds molecular phylogenetic analysis performed in this study showed that neighbouring virus to sars-cov-2 was from bats with 96 similarity suggesting novelty of sars-cov-2 we dont know how this virus mutated and its time frame however recent estimates with bedfords analysis predicted that sars-cov-2 and ratg13 derived from a common ancestor sometimes between 25 and 65 years ago httpswwwsciencemagorgnews202001mining-coronavirus-genomes-clues-outbreak-s-origins these observations are indicative of the existence of intermediate host or reservoir before the sars-cov-2 gained entry into the human population figure 4 it is utmost important to find out its intermediate host to control the ongoing and future outbreak based on the gene bank data apart from the lung and oropharyngeal fluid this virus also isolated from faces and blood this observation represents that sars-cov-2 transmitted through droplet and human to human might be through the orofecal route but immune-pathogenesis of this novel virus is probably different from the previous endemic strain of coronaviruses the faecal oral route is very common in birds for transmission of avian viruses migratory birds play a very important role in the dissemination of avian influenza viruses from different parts of the globe during seasonal migrations bailey et al 2018 coronaviruses such as human sars-cov and bat sars-like cov sl-covzxc21 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as their receptor and recent reports suggest that sars-cov-2 also uses the same receptor for entry into the host cell we have compared the ace2 gene from avian species and the data suggest conservation of amino acids of ace2 protein within most of the birds data not shown we examined the interacting residues of the receptor-binding domain rbd of the spike protein of sars-cov-2 with critical residues of ace2 from different species from human poultry gallus gallus mallard anasplatyrhynchos swan goose ansercygnoidesdomesticus shelduck tadornacana and we found limited amino acids conservation in comparison to human counterpart table 2 moreover there is no experimental proof for betacoronavirus like sars-cov and sars-cov-2 infection in the birds although a recent study has shown the significant presence of alpha and gammacoronaviruses in ducks shorebirds and herons in australia chamings et al 2018 these observations allow us to believe that the birds are less prone to betacoronavirus infection or the least chance of bird infection from betacoronaviruses significantly the bird poses alpha and gammacoronaviruses that are incompetent to infect a human hence the risks of spread of the sars-cov-2 through bird to human are very unlikely at its present form qinghai lake in china is one of the biggest breeding sites for different migratory bird species there may be a possibility that this novel virus may acquire the ability to infect other animals including the migratory birds therefore it is extremely important to find out the reservoir of this novel coronavirus within the other animals including the migratory birds if there are any figure 6 one of the most worrying things about any outbreak is the spreading of viruses from mild or asymptomatic individuals which is probably happening in case of sars-cov-2 infection if this trend continues then the virus may establish itself in the population and quarantine will be very difficult to stop the virus spread phylogenetic analysis based on the spike gene nucleotide sequence performed in this study has shown that all the sars-cov-2 sequences are forming a single cluster without any branching indicating sars-cov-2 conservation throughout this ongoing outbreak earlier studies have shown that spike protein was a target of a robust humoral immune response in case of sars or mers viral infection these findings advocate that virus that caused the initial outbreak of sars-cov-2 is still in circulation without any major changes very little or absence of pre-existing immunity in the community or selection pressure within the population probably allowed sars-cov-2 to remain in circulation in its original form moreover sars-cov-2 has very limited cfr as opposed to sars-cov and mers-cov without killing its host table 1 will able to produce new virus particles alongside some mutations till now most of the deaths have occurred in the elderly population due to novel coronavirus infection whereas children and young adults exhibit relatively milder disease therefore sars-cov-2 infection will enable the host to develop humoral and cell-mediated immunity and simultaneously the immune selected viruses may acquire mutations with higher infection potential or altered antigenicity this will likely empower them to evade pre-existing immunity towards their predecessor counterpart in the host during the subsequent waves of infection as depicted in figure 1 current estimates based on the available information suggest that more than 93 individual have recovered from this novel coronavirus infections the virus may adapt itself to produce infection within the recovered population in future to sustain its presence in the environment the ability of the virus to cause infection in the host with pre-existing immunity will be the most important criteria to establish itself in the circulation the recovered population may keep under monitor to find if any reinfection leads to the creation of any mutant strain due to the selection pressure therefore we must prepare ourselves for mutant strains of this novel virus to avoid future devastation since there is no antiviral and vaccine to fight against sars cov-2 a vaccine or therapeutics is a primary need at this moment currently several companies have started preparing vaccines for this novel virus although efficacy will depend on the selection of antigen and the viruss ability to bypass the vaccine-induced immunity we must look at the conservation among different epitopes in immune selected strains while choosing the right vaccine candidates structurally spike protein carries rbd like haemagglutinin ha of the influenza virus with a similar function we must look at the amino acid conservation in different domain of the spike protein mutation in the immune dominance region of the vaccine candidate will make them ineffective for future outbreaks recently physicians from china are urging recovered patients to donate plasma which may be useful to protect covid-19 something like a 100 years old practice during 1918 flu in case of pandemic 1918 influenza infection three waves of infection killed more than 50 million worldwide in two years where the second wave was the most devastating the first wave of the 1918 flu pandemic flu had resembled common flu epidemics people most at risk were the weak and elderly while younger healthier people recovered easily apparently resembling covid-19 in its present form most of the studies have found an analogy between covid-19 and influenza disease pathophysiology time will tell us whether sars-cov-2 and associated covid-19 will be established as the new flu of 21st century  evolutionary relationships between bat coronaviruses and their hosts jie cui naijian han daniel streicker gang li

are shown in the table for virus phylogeny studies sequences from a 440-bp fragment of the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene which is highly conserved among different covs were obtained and analyzed 10 multiple alignments of the 440-bp rdrp partial sequence of bat covs were conducted in clustalx version 181 23 bayesian analyses were conducted with mrbayes version 312 24 neighbor-joining analyses with the jukes-cantor model were used to validate the bayesian result in mega3 25 a total of 67 unique cov sequences figure 1 were analyzed with mrbayes version 312 in the generalized time reversible model of evolution as determined by the akaike information criterion in modeltest version 37 26 four consecutive metropolis-coupled markov chain monte carlo computations were run for 2

bisection and reconnection branch swapping followed by 100 bootstrap iterations for robustness of the ml tree bayesian analysis was also used to construct a tree with 4 simultaneous markov chains for 1 million generations trees were sampled every 20 generations and the first 5000 trees were discarded before the consensus tree was made on the basis of practical values of stabilizing likelihood we compared the genetic diversity of covs isolated from rhinolophids and vespertilionids and the corresponding diversity among bat taxa by using the index of nucleotide diversity  described by nei 28 in arlequin version 31 29 analyses were performed on uncorrected pairwise genetic distances between sequences by combining information derived from the phylogram of bat covs together with data on the geographic origin of viruses we were able to describe the phylogeographic distributions for known covs from bats in china figures 1 2 table bat sars-like covs formed a monophyletic clade species-specific host restriction was found for covs in 4 of 7 bats species myotis ricketti m magnater p abramus and t pachypus sampled from 1 geographic location and these clustered with high bayesian posterior probability overall phylogenetic relationships between virus lineages were similar across our analyses and well-supported genetic structure was observed within some cov lineages for example covs isolated from m magnater were monophyletic but formed 3 well-supported clades with no evidence of geographic structure bayesian posterior probability pp  10 for each a similar pattern was apparent in covs from myotis ricketti which formed 2 geographically overlapping independent clades pp  099 and 10 respectively one t pachypus was infected by a virus that clustered with moderate statistical support pp  091 within the larger clade associated with p abramus which indicated a potential interspecies transmission event or recent evolutionary host shift defined as interspecies transmission followed by establishment and long-term persistence in the new host species 18 figure 1 phylograms of host sequences were also constructed and were essentially of the same topology with high support whether derived by using mrbayes version 312 or mega3 data not shown when we mapped host phylogram to virus virus phylogeny did not always track host phylogeny figure 3 when separate host-virus phylograms were constructed for the 2 bat families verspertilionidae and rhinolophidae different corresponding relationships were evident verspertilionids and their covs showed phylogenetic congruence and rhinolophids and their covs showed incongruous phylogenies figure 4 we found evidence for evolutionarily divergent relationships for some vespertilionid viruses and their hosts when analyzed at the family scale figure 4 panel a for example divergence between viruses harbored by p pipistrellus and p abramus is congruent with their hosts the divergence among other viruses was incongruent with divergence of host species eg those from s kuhlii and myotis ricketti rhinolophid bats and their viruses were analyzed at a different taxonomic scale within genus in this co-phylogeny viral host shifts were the evident virus-host feature figure 4 panel b except for r macrotis all rhinolophidae bats had 2 distinct lineages of covs and host shifts were found among viruses carried by r ferrumequinum r pearsoni and r sinicus genetic diversity of covs harbored by rhinolophids and vespertilionids was similar vespertilionids   027  013 rhinolophids   025  013 in contrast genetic diversity of cyt b sequences from bats was much higher among the vespertilonids   017  0007 than among the rhinolophids   009  0006 covs sequenced from different bats of the same species clustered together even when bats were collected in locations 10002000 km apart this pattern was found for covs from p abramus t pachypus myotis ricketti and m magnater bats of the genus miniopterus are known to migrate long distances 30 which explains why the phylogeny of viruses isolated from m magnater sampled in distant places guangxi anhui fujian and hong kong lacks geographic structure in nonmigrating species such as bats of the genera pipistrellus and tylonycteris intimate physical contact of bats in same cave or the same bamboo roost site as well as periodic exchange of bats among neighboring colonies may facilitate virus transmission among populations despite the co-roosting of many bats species we found little evidence of host shifts for some viruses for example covs from m magnater and myotis ricketti sampled in the same cave in guangxi were divergent although sample size was limited although myotis ricketti has a closer phylogenetic relationship with t pachypus p pipistrellus and p abramus than with m magnater and s kuhlii its behavior and habits are closer to those of the last group for example myotis ricketti and s kuhlii bats roosts in caves although s kuhlii also roosts under palm leaves whereas t pachypus roosts inside bamboo and p abramus roosts almost entirely in old buildings thus it seems plausible that the close phylogenetic relationship between viruses harbored by myotis ricketti and s kuhlii reflects the similar behavior and ecology of their hosts the phylogenetic and phylogeographic associations we found suggest that there may be a coevolutionary relationship between some bat covs and their hosts for example sister taxa within the genus pipistrellus independently maintained 2 distinct viruses that share a most recent common ancestor a similar relationship was apparent among the viruses of some closely related genera eg pipistrellus and tylonycteris whereby divergence of each genus was mirrored by divergence in viral phylogeny however viruses are usually thought to have evolved more recently than their hosts 31 thus apparent coevolutionary patterns may reflect either a high frequency of host shift among closely related bat species or simultaneous lineage splitting of hosts and viruses host shifts among related bats might be favored by a variety of mechanisms including preadaptation to overcome immune defenses or greater rates of interspecific contact relative to distantly related bat species phylograms with better resolution would enable statistical comparison of phylogenetic congruence and estimation of divergence times in the vespertilionids close phylogenetic concordance between host and virus suggests a close possibly evolutionarily divergent relationship however there are different scales of comparison between the vespertillionidae in which all but 1 cov came from separate genera and the rhinolophidae in which we examined a co-phylogeny of multiple species within 1 genus genetic diversity in the vespertilionids sampled was nearly double that of the rhinolophids which was probably due to the greater number of species sampled and their broader taxonomic range despite this greater genetic diversity among vespertilionid bat hosts the genetic diversity of covs did not differ between vespertilionids and rhinopholids this diversity suggests that vespertilionids may maintain undiscovered covs or that rhinolophids might harbor disproportionate cov diversity relative to diversity of their genus we propose that future work may identify more vespertilionid bat covs which would enable an accurate comparison of propensity for host shifts within this group in the rhinolophids the host phylogram demonstrated genetic divergence between r ferrumequinum and other species as shown by the division of rhinolophus bats into 2 groups each of these groups harbors covs from 2 clusters sars-like covs and other covs which suggests multiple introductions of covs into these species lack of concordance between phylogenies of rhinolophid bats and their covs can be interpreted as evidence for host shifts between bats of the genus rhinolophus different species of rhinolophus are often observed roosting inside the same cave which facilitates virus transmission between species however the degree of host shifting of rhinolophid bat covs may not be particularly high relative to other genera of bats this observation will be clarified when a greater diversity of covs from other bat genera is reported and the sequences are analyzed these requirements support the need for further research on bat viruses 3233 host-shifting within the genus rhinolophus would likely be promoted if these bats shed covs in a way that makes them more available to other rhinolophus spp had behavioral traits that lead to increased contact with other rhinolophus spp or if covs harbored by these bats have structural biologic or other traits that make them more readily transmitted to other rhinolophus spp two lines of evidence suggest that host traits are the most parsimonious explanation for host shifts within the genus rhinolophus first sars-like covs and other rhinolophid covs rfv1 and rpv1 show evidence of interspecies transmission second covs from other bat groups that are phylogenetically much closer to rfv1 and rpv1 than to the sars-like covs do not show evidence of successful host shifts thus the ability to jump hosts is unlikely to be a strictly viral trait the phylogeography of bat covs suggests that the bat sars-like covs form a monophyletic clade that is both phylogenetically distinct from other bat covs and geographically isolated although we acknowledge that this interpretation may be limited by sample size it may also indicate that rhinolophid bats the hosts of a cluster of sars-like covs within which human and civet sars cov nestle phylogenetically 67 are more likely to foster the host shifts of covs than are other bat species the potential for close contact between bats civets and humans in the wildlife trade in southern china coupled with a possible propensity of these bats to foster cov host-shifts could explain sars-like covs as the source of sars-cov this potential supports molecular results on bat covs that suggest a recent host shift from bats to civets or other animals and humans 34 such host shifts may indicate a risk posed by other bat covs for novel disease emergence finally the ability of sars-like covs to be transmitted between and establish in new species ie to undergo host shifts is consistent with other covs this has been shown for several covs of livestock species 35 and has been used to support their inclusion as 1 of the groups of viruses most likely to be responsible for emerging zoonoses even before the emergence of sars 36 the total diversity of covs including sars-like covs in bats has likely not been fully described the genus rhinolophus 8 contains 77 bat species distributed in asia europe and africa the recent discoveries of bat covs in the united states 37 and sars-covs in african bats 38 support the hypothesis that covs are diverse and widespread in bat species given the diversity of covs in this group and their propensity for host shifts further viral discovery in rhinolophids may assist in understanding and ultimately controlling the emergence of zoonotic viruses bats are increasingly recognized as reservoirs of many highly lethal zoonotic agents 32 understanding their diversity behavior and mechanisms of virus transmission may play a key role in preventing future outbreaks of both known and unknown zoonotic diseases of bat origin  a doubt of multiple introduction of sarscov2 in italy a preliminary overview marta giovanetti silvia angeletti domenico benvenuto massimo ciccozzi   coronaviruses covs are enveloped positivesensed singlestranded rna viruses belonging to the coronaviridae family
1
 they have been categorized based on antigenic properties and phylogenetic analyses in three main groups
2
 a alphacovs mainly responsible for gastrointestinal disorders b betacovs that include i bat coronavirus ii the human severe acute respiratory syndrome sars virus iii the middle eastern respiratory syndrome mers virus c gammacovs that mainly infect avian species some variants of covs are associated with outbreaks some others are continuously circulating and cause mostly mild respiratory infections eg the common cold the most well known of these covs is the sarscov which between 2002 and 2003 was responsible to cause an outbreak that spread around the world and resulted in over 8000 cases and 774 deaths with a case fatality rate of around 9 to 11
3
 in 2012 a novel cov merscov causing severe respiratory symptoms was identified
4
 very recently in december 2019 a novel betacov was responsible of a new illness first detected in wuhan china
5
 we now know this to be another outbreak of cov in humans the 7th that was recently renamed as sarscov2 the origin of the virus is still unclear however genomic analysis suggests ncov is most closely related to viruses previously identified in bats
6

 in the first week of march 2020 over 98192 confirmed cases and 3380 deaths have been reported globally
7
 the case counts are dramatically rising in part due to increased surveillance and testing while the outbreak seems to be centered in wuhan which is now under quarantine the virus has spread throughout china and abroad including western and southeastern pacific regions european regions eastern mediterranean regions as well as many states in the united states of america
8
 it comes amid signs of the viruss shift away from its origins in china with italy iran and south korea emerging as the other countries hit hardest by the deadly disease italy is the worst affected country in europe with more than 4636 cases a rise of 778 in a day and a death toll of 197 an increase of 49
9
 nevertheless there is still limited information about the genomic epidemiology of the sarscov2 circulating in italy from genomic surveillance studies that impairs our understanding of the virus introduction establishment and dissemination in the country thus to better understand the emergence of the recent sarscov2 epidemic in italy we analyzed a larger and updated dataset of recently released data of the covid2019 epidemic to improve more effective intervention strategies the dataset comprised n  141 complete genomes sequences from the current 20192020 sarscov2 epidemic retrieved from gisaid httpswwwgisaidorg database the alignment was performed using mafft online program
10
 the complete dataset was assessed for the presence of phylogenetic signal by applying the likelihood mapping analysis implemented in the iqtree 168 software httpwwwiqtreeorg
11
 a maximum likelihood ml phylogeny was reconstructed using iqtree 168 software under the general timereversible nucleotide substitution model with a proportion of invariant sites gtri which was inferred in jmodeltest httpsgithubcomddarribajmodeltest2 as the best fitting model
12

 to better understand the establishment and transmission of the novel sarscov2 in italy the recent italian genomes available on the gisaid database were added to a dataset of 138 sarscov2 genomes from the global epidemic an ml phylogenetic tree figure 1 was built to explore the recent italian genomes relationship with previous worldwide isolates ml phylogenies suggested that the three italian strains grouped into two different wellsupported phylogenetic clades bootstrap score bs 080 099 respectively we found that two isolates from italy epiisl410546 a chinese tourist from hubei province and epiisl412974 the first italian case isolate in rome italy fall within a clade bs  94 figure 1a clade 1 including sequences from several countries as china japan singapore england australia and canada however it is important to note that sequences from china are positioned basally to this first clade reinforcing the idea that the first introduction event could be mediated as suspected by china we also identified that one italian strain epiisl412973 from the province of lombardy isolated in february 2020 grouped separately into a second clade figure 1b clade 2 including isolates from germany finland switzerland and mexico phylogenetic analyses further suggest that the cov epidemic might have been reintroduce to the country via germany since the basal sequence of this clade is a case that emerged in munich in germany in january 2020 highlighting a complex dynamic of transmission and a tight connection within european countries in this study we investigate the transmission path of the novel sarscov2 in italy our results indicate that the sarscov2 circulation in italy likely started from different multiple introductions from china and germany figure 1 clades 1 and 2 suggesting a possible european linkage followed by autochthonous transmission within italy moreover more genomic data will be fundamental to shed light on the epidemiological dynamics of the virus in the country helping to understand how the virus is spreading both around the world and thought time more genomic surveillance efforts during epidemics should be undertaken to provide enough data to make reliable inferences on the molecular epidemiology of the rapidly evolving virus phylogenetic inference robustness will be improved if other genomic sequences will be available to build an even more informative dataset despite the low heterogeneity of the sequenced strains consequently this analysis has to be considered as the first preliminary report regarding the sarscov2 epidemic in italy that highlights two independent introductions probably mediated by china and germany respectively this could reinforce the tight connection within samples that have been isolated all over europe indicating that the virus is spreading quite widely in europe suggesting that it could be likely spreading in the general population in conclusion our study shows that genomic data generated in realtime can be employed to assist public health in monitoring and understanding the outbreak of novel emerging viral

a after 22nd february 2020 the daily number of locally infected reported cases in guangdong did not exceed one however since the beginning of march 2020 covid-19 cases imported into guangdong from abroad have been detected with increasing frequency as of 26th march 2020 a total of 102 imported cases were reported from 19 different countries figure 1a highlighting the risk that local covid-19 transmission could reignite in china different surveillance strategies were applied during the epidemic in guangdong figure 1a star methods more intensive surveillance was initiated on 30th january 2020 in response to the spring festival period which results in greater mobility among regions and provinces in china kraemer et al 2020 tian et al 2020 and because asymptomatic covid-19 cases had been reported guan et al 2020 this included monitoring 1 all travelers returning from hubei or other regions with high epidemic activity 2 their close contacts and 3 all hospitalized patients in clinics including those without fever or respiratory symptoms regardless of their exposure history approximately 135 million samples were screened by six third-party institutions between 30th january and 15th march 2020 surveillance commenced at guangdong airports in early march following the growth of covid-19 outbreaks outside of china in total 16 million tests were performed by 19th march 2020 identifying 1388 sars-cov-2 positive cases in 20 of 21 prefectures in guangdong province figure 1b around a quarter of cases 336 were judged to be linked to local transmission and two-thirds 1014 had a likely exposure history in hubei see star methods for locally infected cases 181 53 were linked to transmission among household members more than half of the reported cases 60 were from the cities of shenzhen and guangzhou figure 1b we note that the number of detected cases will be less than the true number of infections although the degree of under-reporting is unknown surveillance was targeted toward travelers hence these data may overestimate the proportion of travel-associated cases to understand the genetic structure of the covid-19 outbreak in guangdong we generated near-complete and partial genomes from 53 covid-19 patients in guangdong province the genomes were generated by a combination of metagenomic sequencing and multiplex pcr amplification followed by nanopore sequencing on a minion device see star methods sequence sampling dates ranged from 30th january to 28th february 2020 figure s1

a the sars-cov-2 sequences from guangdong red are interspersed with viral lineages sampled from other chinese provinces and other countries gray this pattern agrees with the epidemiological time series in figure 1a indicating that most detected cases were linked to travel rather than local community transmission despite this there were a number of instances where sequences from guangdong appeared to cluster together sometimes with sequences sampled from other regions to explore these lineages in more detail we performed a bayesian molecular clock analysis that places the phylogenetic history of the genomes on an estimated timescale a summary visualization of the maximum clade credibility tree from that analysis is shown in figure 3b and is largely congruent with the ml tree the current low genetic diversity of sars-cov-2 genomes worldwide means that most internal nodes have very low posterior probabilities we caution that no conclusions should be drawn from these branching events as they will be informed by the phylogenetic prior distribution rather than variable nucleotide sites figure 3a nevertheless five clusters denoted ae containing guangdong sequences had posterior probability support of 80 ie their sequences grouped monophyletically in 80 of trees in the posterior sample figure 3b these clusters were also observed in the ml phylogeny figure 3a some included only sequences sampled in guangdong a b others included sequences sampled in other countries and provinces c d e from the molecular clock analysis we were able to estimate the times of the most recent common ancestor tmrca of clusters ae we found that sars-cov-2 lineages were imported multiple times into guangdong during the second half of january 2020 figure 4
 three clusters c d e have earlier tmrcas that coincide with the start of the guangdong epidemic and two a b have later tmrcas around the time of the epidemic peak in the province figure 4 the average time between the tmrca and the earliest sequence collection date in each cluster was approximately 1025 days the observed duration of each phylogenetic cluster tmrca to most recently sampled sequence ranged from 949 cluster b to 452 cluster d days the clusters with earlier tmrcas contain more sequences from travelers sampled outside of china possibly reflecting a decrease in air passenger travel from guangdong after january 2020 flightradar24 2020 the median tmrca estimate of the covid-19 pandemic was 1st december 2019 95 hpd 15th november to 13th december 2019 figure 4 consistent with previous analyses rambaut 2020 the apparent clusters of guangdong sequences require careful interpretation because of the relative undersampling of sars-cov-2 genomes from other chinese provinces including hubei specifically it is known that undersampling of regions with high incidence can lead to phylogenetic analyses underestimating the number of introductions into recipient locations and overestimating the size and duration of transmission chains in those recipient locations grubaugh et al 2017 kraemer et al 2018 for example the largest guangdong phylogenetic cluster denoted a in figures 3 and 4 comprises 8 sequences none of which are placed at the root of the cluster and it is tempting to conclude that the entire cluster derived from community transmission within guangdong however 6 of the 8 genomes reported travel from hubei and therefore the cluster in fact represents multiple sars-cov-2 introductions into guangdong with dates of symptom onset around or shortly after the shutdown of travel from wuhan figure 4 our analyses of the genomic epidemiology of sars-cov-2 in guangdong province indicate that following the first covid-19 case detected in early january most infections were the result of virus importation from elsewhere and that chains of local transmission were limited in size and duration this suggests that the large-scale surveillance and intervention measures implemented in guangdong were effective in interrupting community transmission in a densely populated urban region ultimately containing the epidemic and limiting the potential for dissemination to other regions leung et al 2020 however vigilance is still required as there remains a risk that sars-cov-2 transmission could reignite in guangdong following the recent increase in the number of covid-19 cases imported to china from other countries the results also suggest that analyses of phylogenetic structure during the early phase of the pandemic should be interpreted carefully the number of mutations that define phylogenetic lineages are small often one and may be similar to the number of sequence differences arising from errors introduced during reverse transcription pcr amplification or sequencing bayesian estimates of divergence times rannala and yang 1996 such as the tmrca of the pandemic are based on aggregate numbers of mutations and informed by dense sampling through time and are thus expected to be more robust further the low and variable sampling of covid-19 cases among different regions makes it challenging to evaluate phylogenetic clusters that comprise cases from a single region although such clusters could indeed represent local transmission our results show they can also include multiple introductions from a genomically undersampled location therefore as with all phylogenetic analyses the sars-cov-2 genomes must be interpreted in the context of all available epidemiological information

 virus genomes were generated by two different approaches i untargeted metagenomic sequencing on the bgi mgiseq-2000 n  63 and illumina nextseq n  4 sequencing platforms and ii using version 1 of the artic covid-19 multiplex pcr primers httpsarticnetworkncov-2019 followed by nanopore sequencing on an ont minion n  45 untargeted metagenomic sequencing was initially attempted as it is well suited to the characterization of a previously unknown virus subsequently a protocol for sequencing sars-cov-2 using multiplex pcr with nanopore sequencing was made available which showed good performance on samples with higher ct values as described below and in table s13 thereafter most clinical samples were sequenced using this latter approach we report only those genomes for which we were able to generate  50 genome coverage and report only one genome per patient for metatranscriptomics total rnas were extracted from different types of samples by using qiaamp viral rna mini kit followed by dnase treatment and purification with turbo dnase and agencourt rnaclean xp beads both the concentration and the quality of all isolated rna samples were measured and checked with the agilent bioanalyzer 2100 and qubit for illumina sequencing libraries were prepared using the smarter stranded total rna-seq kit v2 according to the manufacturers protocol starting with 10 ng total rna briefly purified rna was first fragmented and converted to cdna using reverse transcriptase the ribosome cdna was depleted by using zaprv2 mammalian-specific the remaining cdna was converted to double

illumina nextseq 550 se 75 platform for bgi sequencing dna-depleted and purified rna was used to construct the single-stranded circular dna library with mgieasy rna library preparation reagent set

dnbs preps of clinical samples were sequenced on the mgiseq-2000 platform for the multiplex pcr approach we followed the general method of multiplex pcr as described in httpsarticnetworkncov-2019 quick et al 2017 briefly the multiplex pcr was performed with two pooled primer mixture and the cdna reverse transcribed with random primers was used as a template after 35 rounds of amplification the pcr products were collected and quantified followed with end-repairing and barcoding ligation around 50 fmol of final library dna was loaded onto the minion the nanopore sequencing platform takes less

sequences and call single nucleotide changes relative to the reference sequence snp differences were sometimes observed when the same sample was sequenced using different sequencing approaches these differences were random and not platform specific and upon close inspection of the reads most likely resulted from low coverage regions in the metagenomics data only the single highest-quality genome was retained per patient to test the precision and threshold of the multiplex pcr and nanopore sequencing method we undertook a serial dilution experiment viral rna was extracted from a cell strain of sars-cov-2 to mimic clinical samples with different viral loads we diluted this viral rna with sars-cov-2-negative rna extracted from nasopharyngeal swab specimens viral loads were estimated using rt-pcr with serial diluted plasmid as a standard at each dilution level we performed multiplex pcr and nanopore sequencing and assembly as per the approach above except that reads were assembled against the consensus genome obtained from the original sample using metagenomic sequencing as expected relative virus load  genome coverage and average read depth decreased at higher dilutions genome coverage exceeded 75 for all except the final dilution table s13 reference-based assembly of the metagenomic raw data was performed as follows illumina adaptors were removed and reads were filtered

sites were denoted n ambiguity nucleotide codes were used if i the minor variant is observed at  30 frequency and ii the minor variant is represented by 5 or more reads assembly of the nanopore raw data was performed using the artic bioinformatic pipeline for covid-19 with minimap2 li 2018 and medaka httpsgithubcomnanoporetechmedaka for consensus sequence generation for patient samples that were sequenced using both metagenomics and nanopore sequencing we retained only the sequence with the highest genome coverage all available sars-cov-2 sequences n  323 on gisaid gisaidorg on 13th march 2020 were downloaded sequences from gisaid that were error-rich those which represented multiple sequences from the same patient and those without a date of sampling were removed finally the dataset was reduced by only retaining the earliest and most recently sampled sequences from epidemiologically linked outbreaks eg the diamond princess cruise ship the resulting dataset of 250 sequences therefore represents the global diversity of the virus while minimizing the impact of sampling bias sequences were aligned using mafft v74 katoh and standley 2013 and manually inspected in geneious v1103 httpswwwgeneiouscom the final alignment length was 29923 nucleotides we used both the maximum likelihood ml and bayesian coalescent methods to explore the phylogenetic structure of sars-cov-2 the ml phylogeny was estimated with phyml guindon et al 2010 using the hky4 substitution model hasegawa et al 1985 with gamma-distributed rate variation yang 1994 linear regression of root-to-tip

 the bayesian coalescent tree analysis was undertaken with beast v1104 ayres et al 2012 suchard et al 2018 also using the hky4 substitution model with gamma-distributed rate variation with an exponential population growth tree prior and a strict molecular clock under a non-informative continuous-time markov chain ctmc reference prior ferreira and suchard 2008 taxon sets were defined and used to estimate the posterior probability of monophyly and the posterior distribution of the tmrca of observed phylogenetic clusters a-e table s12 two independent chains were run for 100 million

hall paolo piazza richard  cornall  sars-cov-2 the causative agent of covid-19 emerged in late 2019 causing a global pandemic with the united kingdom uk one of the hardest hit countries rapid sequencing and publication of consensus genomes have enabled phylogenetic analysis of the virus demonstrating sars-cov-2 evolves relatively slowly 1  but with multiple sites in the genome that appear inconsistent with the overall consensus phylogeny 2  to understand these discrepancies we used veseq 3  a targeted rna-seq approach to quantify minor allele frequencies in 413 clinical samples from two uk locations we show that sars-cov-2 infections are characterised by extensive within-host diversity which is frequently shared among infected individuals with patterns consistent with geographical structure these results were reproducible in data from two other sequencing locations in the uk where we find evidence of mixed infection by major circulating lineages with patterns that cannot readily be explained by artefacts in the data we conclude that sars-cov-2 diversity is transmissible and propose that geographic patterns are generated by transient co-circulation of distinct viral populations co-transmission of mixed populations could open opportunities for resolving clusters of transmission and understanding pathogenesis  the nature of the ongoing evolution of the sars-cov-2 coronavirus has been the topic of considerable speculation as the pandemic has unfolded studies have raised concerns that new mutations may confer selective advantages on the virus hampering efforts at control 4  5  to date attention has been focused on mutations observed in viral consensus genomes which represent the dominant variants within infected individuals understanding the full underlying within-host diversity of the virus is relevant for vaccine design and understanding pathogenesis and patterns of transmission of particular interest are loci or genetic regions that are diverse in multiple individuals since shared diversity may reveal signatures of host adaptation or indicate the presence of co-transmitted lineages phylogenetic analyses of consensus genomes have enabled tracking of patterns of viral spread both regionally 6 and across the globe 7  clear lineage-defining single nucleotide polymorphisms snps have emerged 8  and it has been postulated that some of these might represent mutations that increase the fitness of the virus raising significant concern for public health of specific importance are mutations in the spike s protein of the virus at least one of which d614g genome position 23403 has been suggested to increase transmissibility 49  5  snps at this and many other positions appear to have arisen multiple times on different lineages 4 9  the presence of such a large number of homoplasies against a background of low overall genetic diversity is puzzling and could be the consequence of recurrent mutation and selection susceptibility of specific sites to rna editing mixed infections of multiple variants or to artefacts arising from sequencing andor processing errors 9  untangling these possible explanations is vital as homoplasies can bias phylogeographic analyses giving a misleading representation of how the virus evolves and spreads the united kingdom uk has experienced one of the most severe waves of infection with 11 of the reported global death toll as of 26th may 2020 10  multiple independent sars-cov-2 introductions have contributed to substantial viral diversity 7  making the uk an important setting for understanding sars-cov-2 evolution and transmission in this study we collected and analysed sars-cov-2 samples from 405 symptomatic individuals who tested positive for covid-19 within two geographically-separate hospital trusts oxford university hospitals and basingstoke and north hampshire hospital located 37 miles 60 km apart supplementary table 1   using veseq a sequencing protocol based on a quantitative targeted enrichment strategy 3  which we previously validated for other viruses 3  11  12  we characterised the full spectrum of within-host diversity in sars-cov-2 and contextualised our findings within other high-quality publicly available deep-sequencing datasets from the uk generated on the high-fidelity illumina platform 13  14  all genomic data has been made publicly available as part of the covid-19 genomics uk cog-uk consortium cogconsortiumuk via gisaid 15 and the european nucleotide archive ena study prjeb37886 to examine patterns of within-host diversity we first considered the distribution of minor allele frequencies mafs in the mapped reads at every position along the genome this analysis was supported by data curation to ensure that only high-confidence variants were examined which included analysis of in-batch quantification controls as well as a stringent computational clean-up to eliminate any residual cross-mapping 16  previously validated for targeted metagenomics 11 see methods and supplementary text for a full description in combination with unique dual indexing udi these procedures generated highly robust minority variant calls which were reproducible in independent replicates and distinguishable from methodological noise above a threshold of 2 of reads at a given position supplementary figure 1  the distribution of mafs was a close fit to that expected under the model of an exponentially growing population supplementary figure 2  giving high confidence that mafs generated by veseq were representative of true within-sample diversity we likewise observed a good fit for data from other uk centres with slightly reduced goodness of fit consistent with some bias in maf recovered by amplicon sequencing we used a conservative threshold of 5 to define an initial set of intrahost single nucleotide variant isnv sites and subsequently examined all samples at these isnv sites for variants with maf of at least 2 we found extensive within-host diversity in sars-cov-2 samples from oxford and basingstoke figure 1  consistently higher than those observed between-host supplementary figure 3  with a median of 11 isnv sites per sample range 0 -137 consistent with previously reported levels 17  intrahost diversity was shared by multiple individuals figure 1 and supplementary table 2  and this observation was robust to batch effects supplementary figure 4  on the sars-cov-2 consensus phylogeny we found 1628 single nucleotide polymorphisms snps of which 171 11 were homoplasies supplemental table 3  of these homoplasies 18 corresponded with shared isnv sites in the oxfordbasingstoke data increasing to 56 sites when also considering data from wales and scotland supplementary table 4  that is 33 56171 of homoplasic sites are also shared isnv sites despite only 7 of the genome consisting of shared isnv sites this suggests within-host diversity is associated with a considerable proportion of the homoplasies observed in sars-cov-2 and which in turn may interfere with correct inference of the phylogeny and downstream analyses figure 1  with-host diversity of sars-cov-2 is more widespread than between-host diversity  above proportion of consensus sequences in the global alignment with minority variants at each genome position below proportion of genomes in the oxfordbasingstoke dataset with within-host diversity minor variant frequency of at least 5 at each genome position the x-axis is annotated with a map of the reading frames in the viral genome with homoplasic sites marked by black vertical lines although homoplasic sites often correspond with shared within-host variable sites isnv sites the most commonly shared isnv sites do not correspond with homoplasic sites or the most diverse between-host sites we identified 37 isnv sites shared by over ten individuals with the four most common isnvs found in over 50 individuals each  figure 1  supplementary table 2  three of these genome positions 24156 l865p 22565 l335v and 23434 synonymous fall within the s gene encoding the spike protein which mediates cell entry is a target of antibodies and is also the focus for new vaccines making mutations in this region a specific concern 4  18  19  the fourth site 26524 m1krt lies in the m gene which encodes the membrane protein overall the elevated ratio of 1st2nd versus 3rd codon position variants in sites shared by 15 or more individuals gives the appearance of positive selection by standard methods p005 binomial test supplementary figure 5  they may for example represent adaptive changes in sars-cov-2 associated with its recent change in host however a recent study has concluded homoplasies are typically neutral or mildly deleterious for sars-cov-2 fitness arguing against positive selection at homoplasic sites at least 20  moreover the appearance of homoplasies may be the result of host rna editing of viral rna at certain favoured contexts in the sars-cov-2 genome 21  22  overall the high number of individuals in which we see identical isnvs suggests their de novo generation in many individuals is unlikely  the most commonly shared isnv sites and specifically those which are closely spaced on the genome tend to be clustered within individuals with a disproportionate number of individuals variant at either all sites or no sites for the four most commonly shared isnv sites in oxfordbasingstoke 87 out of 405 individuals had isnvs at all four sites at maf 002 whilst 78 individuals had no isnvs at these sites p0001 binomial test these linkage blocks of commonly shared isnvs tend to be associated with specific locations leading to strong geographical patterns in the distributions of shared variation figure 2  supplementary table 4  to better understand the geographical patterns of within-host diversity we considered the location from which the samples were collected we found 31 isnv sites that were significantly more likely to be within-host diverse in samples from oxford compared to those from basingstoke p005 fisher exact test with holm correction and two sites more likely to be diverse in samples from basingstoke p005 supplementary table 5  since these oxford and basingstoke samples were sequenced in the same lab using the same methodology across multiple batches and within-host diversity at the same sites was observed amongst samples from multiple batches supplementary figure 4  these geographical effects are unlikely to be artefactual we next investigated whether phylogeny can explain these patterns that is whether isnvs are associated with phylogenetic lineages determined at the consensus level using a parsimony approach we found that diversity at only five of the 31 sites 357 22565 25628 25807 and 28469 is significantly associated with phylogenetic topology p005 by tip randomisation with bonferroni correction figure 3  however closer inspection reveals that even at these positions phylogenetic structure is confounded by geography with diversity at specific sites regularly occurring in numerous distinct clades that are specific to either oxford or basingstoke as it is unlikely that diversity spontaneously appeared or disappeared in multiple lineages as they moved between uk locations these results suggest that the consensus-based phylogeny lacks the resolution to uncover the geographical patterns that we observe in minor variant diversity consensus phylogenies illustrating within-host diversity in oxford and basingstoke samples for sites in the sars-cov-2 genome where an association was detected both between minor allele frequency maf  2 and sampling location and between maf  2 and phylogeny tips are sized by maf at the genomic site in each panels header and coloured by sampling location we see a large number of independent clades with shared within-host diversity each drawn largely from the same sampling location this suggests that within-host diversity is not a trait that has emerged a limited number of times on specific tree branches but rather that it is primarily associated with geography and that this confounds the apparent statistical association with the consensus phylogeny in the absence of a host effect or sequencing artefact the most parsimonious explanation is that the genomic differences between the oxford and basingstoke viral populations are not visible if the analysis is limited to the consensus genomethe single long branch is due to a complex variant at position 20716 -20726 in individual oxon-add0e a variant at the same position has been previously identified 17  suggesting either susceptibility of this locus to mutation or a cryptic recombination event we explored whether consideration of within-host diversity in addition to the consensus genome could provide further resolution for identification of transmission clusters we identified a group of 46 samples from the oxfordbasingstoke data with indistinguishable consensus genomes differing only by the presence or absence of the n ambiguity code figure 4a  red dots we selected the 15 most commonly-shared isnv sites in all oxfordbasingstoke samples using a threshold of 2 and a minimum coverage of 100 to identify diversity and calculated the proportion of those sites identical at the consensus level at which each pair from the 46 samples shared within-host diversity finding a median of 0067 iqr 0-02 a distinct clustering effect was evident most clearly in a group of 9 of the 33 samples from basingstoke figure 3  including a highly correlated triplet of samples ae81b ae417 ae893 mean proportion of shared isnv sites 0489 which on investigation we found had been collected from individuals closely linked by employment and sampled on consecutive days another triplet of clustered samples from oxford aca62 aeff8 and aefbc mean proportion of shared isnv sites 0267 had been collected from the same hospital within two days of each other as further support we identified a pair living in the same household who have the same consensus genome and shared similar minor allele frequencies mean proportion shared isnv sites 0267 supplementary figure 6  further studies are needed to confirm whether this additional diversity can be reliably used to help resolve transmission clusters even where the consensus sequences differ oxford and basingstoke samples that are indistinguishable in the consensus phylogeny highlighted by the red dots b for each pair of samples we calculated the proportion of the 15 most commonly within-host diverse sites in oxford and basingstoke that showed diversity in both samples of at least 2 this demonstrates structure in the genetic data by considering minor variants even though the consensus genomes are indistinguishable c and d highlight pairs of samples which are coming both from basingstoke c or both from oxford d the largest cluster is exclusively from basingstoke to contextualise our observation of co-transmission of variants from the oxford and basingstoke samples we analysed a larger uk dataset including additional samples whose sequences have been made available by two other cog-uk collaborating centres we again found a large number of loci diverse in multiple individuals many with a strong geographical distribution supplementary table 4  to identify patterns beyond the regional level we focussed on three common polymorphic sites in the uk the first is the d614g a-to-g base change at locus 23403 that arises on the b1 lineage 8  and has been speculated to be linked to higher rates of transmission 4  5  the other two polymorphic sites 241 and 14408 we chose since they span a large part of the genome and have previously been identified as having linked variants with 23403 23  at these loci 89 of consensus genomes in oxford and basingstoke with coverage at these sites have haplotype t-t-g sites represented in ascending order lineage b1 with the rest having haplotype c-c-g representing lineages a2 b2 and b3 only 21 individuals had isnvs at any of these sites above 2 frequency and none at all three loci suggesting we do not see mixed infections of lineage b1 with any of the other lineages among the oxfordbasingstoke samples including samples from oxfordbasingstoke scotland and wales we see a markedly different pattern overall 1446 of 1599 samples have coverage of at least 100 at all three sites of which 66 are t-t-g at consensus and 34 c-c-a plus one with t-c-a and one c-c-g haplotype potentially representing earlier recombination events as neither had minor alleles 2 at these sites of the 20 individuals with minor variants above 2 frequency at all three sites15 are c-c-a with t-t-g as the major haplotype and 5 t-t-g with c-c-a as the major haplotype within each sample the frequencies at these three sites are remarkably similar suggesting that these sites are far from linkage equilibrium even within patients supplementary figure 7  these patterns are evident in the consensus phylogenetic tree  figure 5  a possible explanation is superinfection coinfection from two different infection sources initially creating the mixed infections followed by co-transmission of these two lineages co-transmission is supported by the observation that samples that share any of these isnv sites are phylogenetically closer on the tree than would be expected by chance supplementary figure 8  these patterns also suggest the phylogenetic tree based on consensus genomes might not always reflect the transmission tree particularly when lineage defining variant frequencies are similar within individuals since we do not have linkage information we are determining putative haplotypes based on the major and minor allele frequencies and therefore cannot rule out within-host recombination however the small number of possible recombinants at the consensus level requires explanation wide transmission bottlenecks could act to keep minor variants at low frequency along transmission chains regardless of recombination alternatively epistatic effects including within-host spatial structuring due to different selective environments 24  could help to maintain the separate lineages the patterns we see are consistent with consensus genomes circulating in specific locations the b1 lineage is dominant in oxford and basingstoke and it is therefore unsurprising that mixed infections including other lineages are not observed single-coloured tips are isolates for which there was no or little within-host nucleotide diversity with at least 98 of reads having the major nucleotide or an overall depth of less than 100 these are coloured by the major nucleotide larger bi-coloured tips represent isolates with a depth of at least 100 where less than 98 of reads showed the major nucleotide in those cases the colour of the outer ring represents the major nucleotide and the inner circle the most common minor nucleotide some samples are diverse at one or two sites but not all three 20 samples are diverse at all three sites we uncovered a consistent pattern of extensive within-host sars-cov-2 diversity with shared isnv sites showing strong geographical patterns throughout we aimed to minimise sequencing artefacts and sample contamination where possible and control for it where not supplementary methods wide transmission bottlenecks enabling multi-variant transmission with these variants perpetuated along transmission chains provides the most parsimonious explanation for these observations  figure 6  transmission of minor variants has previously been reported in a small number of sars-cov-2 transmission pairs 17  24  providing extra support to our hypothesis wide transmission bottlenecks are consistent with the high transmissibility of sars-cov-2 25  particularly in light of the lack of pre-existing immunity to this novel pathogen which could enable more viral particles to establish infection we expect transmitted variant lineages to be gradually eroded through within-host evolution genetic drift stochastic loss during onward transmission and recombination leaving a residual amount of underlying diversity but without a clear phylogenetic structure restricted movement due the uk-wide lockdown imposed on 23rd march 2020 might also explain some of the more striking geographical patterns and which we predict will be eroded as lockdown conditions are relaxed although within-host selection and rna editing may be responsible for the original generation of within-host diversity the sheer number of individuals sharing identical isnvs and which are often closely linked on the genome and show strong geographical patterns suggests they are unlikely to have arisen de novo in most individuals in addition superinfection from multiple transmission events is likely to occur in sars-cov-2 26  27 and could enable the generation of some within-host diversity for example at least one superinfection event is likely responsible for the pattern of mixed infections of the b1 lineage with other major uk lineages however superinfection events are unlikely to be responsible for the bulk of the shared diversity we observe since shared isnvs often represent variants not present among individuals at the consensus level 94 figure 1  for superinfection to drive this pattern it would be expected substitutions present as minority variants in some samples would also be present as majority variants in others mixed sars-cov-2 infections could provide an explanation for many of the homoplasies observed on phylogenies due to difficulty in resolving the consensus genome at sites that are highly diverse the presence of mixed infection may also result in significant discrepancies between consensus phylogenies and the true transmission tree potentially obscuring transmission clusters particularly where variants are at high frequency our observations provide evidence that accounting for all of the diversity within individuals could prove to be a better route for defining clusters than relying on the consensus sequences alone as has been demonstrated in other viruses 28  29  30  transmission of this variation as a result of a weak or absent population bottleneck is the most plausible explanation within-host diversity might have consequences for immune-based approaches including vaccine development for example significant effort is being directed to identifying therapeutic neutralising monoclonal antibodies and it is possible that some of the variants we have defined and enumerated and others yet to be identified may affect the binding of antibodies and therefore their efficacy our observations may also be of clinical relevance particularly if infection by diverse viral populations leads to more severe andor longer-lasting infections as has been suggested for other viruses 31  3233  it is important to recognise that our sampling as well as that of the majority of the uk sampling of sars-cov-2 at corresponding calendar dates was dominated by symptomatic individuals presenting at hospitals with moderate to severe infection if mixed infections are more likely to lead to severe infection it may be no coincidence that we find extensive evidence for high diversity in these samples and these individuals might also have been exposed to high infectious doses it will be important to compare these findings with those obtained from mild or asymptomatic infection which are now increasingly becoming available due to widespread testing rollout as well as those with a broad range of other clinical outcomes our results emphasise the power of open data and the importance of integrating genomic clinical and epidemiological information to gain rapid understanding of sars-cov-2 we propose that much of this within-host diversity is transmitted between infected individuals leading to the co-circulation of lineages in this diagram we show three non-exclusive scenarios a the rare blue minor variant lineage is gradually eroded through recombination drift andor partial bottlenecking at transmission even if the transmission bottleneck is large b two high frequency lineages recombinine with one another with alleles from both lineages remaining the consensus sequence may reflect different lineages at different sites due to fluctuations in allele frequencies as in a variants can gradually be lost c two high frequency lineages co-exist but epistasis within-host structuring or other processes maintain the two distinct

samples together to make the process cost effective we sought to avoid batch effects or contamination during library preparation or sequencing which could otherwise obscure the true signal of sequence diversity all samples had unique dual indexing udi to prevent cross-detection of reads in the same pool known as index misassignment across all sequencing runs only 36 pairs of samples have colliding indices these pairs were processed one month apart sequenced on different instruments miseq and novaseq 6000 and share fewer isnvs than average to guard against contamination every batch of 90 samples was sequenced together with a series of controls in addition one sample was split and sequenced in two batches as oxon-af346 and oxon-af179  with 50x difference in read depth for all isnv sites

as additional negative controls we sequenced 6 matched clinical samples from non-covid-19 patients no sars-cov-2 sequences were detected in any negative controls or negative clinical samples in any pool no hiv reads were detected in the sars-cov-2 samples and the expected log-linear relationship between the number of reads and viral copy number was observed in the standard curve supplementary figure 9  as previously reported 2  the veseq method is quantitative and the number of sequenced reads is expected to correlate with the number of input copies we were therefore satisfied that all sequenced runs were clean to further minimise any concerns about residual contamination we performed an additional stringent computational cleanup of the read data for all reads in a pool we identified any optical duplicates that shared the same mapping coordinates start of reads 1 and 2 and template length and in each case removed the duplicate cluster from all samples except the one containing the greatest number of these reads see bioinformatics processing in this way no two samples within a run shared any duplicate reads all reads with similarity to human sequences or known kit contaminants were removed prior to mapping as detailed below bioinformatics processing de-multiplexed sequence read pairs were classified by kraken v2 4 using a custom database containing the human genome grch38 build and all refseq bacterial and viral genomes sequences identified as either human or bacterial were removed using the filterkeepreadspy script in the castanet 5 workflow

deduplicated reads per position to avoid calling consensus from optical duplicates analysis of within-host diversity was restricted only to positions with minimum minor allele frequency defined as 1 -major allele frequency of 2 and a minimum depth of 10 to focus on high-confidence variants we separately generated sequence sets for just the oxford and basingstoke sequences and for those sequences combined with the other uk data to place these data into the global phylogenetic context a collection of non-uk consensus sequences from the gisaid database 11 were also selected oxford and basingstoke samples were selected if the consensus sequence inferred from unique mapped reads consisted of no more than 25 n characters for cog uk  httpswwwcogconsortiumuk  samples this was lowered to 5 as an alignment to the reference sequence was already performed in shiver  no further alignment was necessary all gisaid 12 sequences were downloaded from the database on the 26th april 2020 and filtered to remove sequences that were less than 29800 base pairs in length were more than 1 ns or were from the united kingdom as this set had considerable overlap with our other data the remaining sequences were clustered using cd-hit-est 13 using a similarity threshold of 0995 and then one sequence per cluster picked the resulting set along with the reference genome nc045512 were aligned using mafft 14  with some manual improvement of the algorithmic alignment and removal of problematic sequences performed as a post-processing step phylogenetics phylogenetic analysis was performed on both

same score was also calculated after permuting the tip labels of the tree 1000 times and an approximate p -value calculated by comparing the true score to the distribution of shuffled scores this value was adjusted by bonferroni correction to account for the multiple testing imposed by applying this procedure to multiple genome positions to identify homoplasic sites we selected sites that changed state more than once along the tree after inferring the states at internal nodes using ancestral state reconstruction as implemented in clonalframeml 16 and rooting the tree using the reference genome nc045512 overrepresentation of shared isnvs within individuals for highly shared isnvs on a similar region of the genome we computed the number of individuals with none or all isnvs and determined the probability of each of these from 100000 randomisations to look for sites with an increased diversity in oxford we computed the fisher exact test for the number of isnvs in either oxford or basingstoke samples and either at a given site or elsewhere in the genome we repeat the test for each genomic position looking for an overrepresentation of isnvs in oxford samples at that site before applying multiple testing corrections we ignored all sites that could not reach significance at level p005 even if all diversity at the position would be concentrated in oxford we also performed the corresponding analysis to look for an overrepresentation of isnvs in basingstoke samples at each site overrepresentation of shared isnvs within clusters for each cluster we computed the average number of shared isnvs sharing the same mutation as well between two random samples from the cluster to assess its significance we compared it with the average number of shared isnvs from 1000 permutation of all variants among all clusters throughout our sequencing and analysis the possibility of sequencing artefacts andor contamination was at the forefront we first explain the protocols and controls we used to avoid andor detect artefacts during sequencing and processing of data and second how our main results are inconsistent with contamination of samples although artefacts can never be ruled out entirely they are extremely unlikely to explain the broad patterns that we observe sample collection was carried out by several geographically separated hospitals before being sent for rna extraction and testing to either ouh oxford or bsnh basingstoke laboratories alongside sars-cov-2 positive samples we processed and sequenced six sars-cov-2-negative samples from ouh laboratories and in each case found zero sars-cov-2 reads this strongly suggests the absence of laboratory-level contamination in ouh data similarly from bsnh we collected a large number of very weakly positive sars-cov-2 samples cycle threshold values  36 using rdrp as the qpcr marker these samples had near-zero sars-cov-2 reads mapped again suggesting that laboratory contamination cannot be widespread or provide an explanation for the observed diversity in the data while we cannot rule out laboratory-level contamination in other laboratories contributing samples to external cog uk datasets if such contamination was present it would have to have been pervasive in every hospital andor sequencing centre across many weeks of sequencing and many sequencing runs to explain the observation of shared within-host diversity observed in these datasets ii library prep bait capture and sequencing next-generation sequence data produced at scale typically necessitates batching of large pools of samples together to make the process cost effective we sought to avoid batch effects or contamination during library preparation or sequencing which could otherwise obscure the true signal of sequence diversity to guard against contamination every batch of 90 samples was sequenced together with a series of controls the controls comprised a negative buffer in-capture control a standard curve consisting of a dilution series of a quantified sars-cov-2 control twist synthetic sars-cov-2 rna control 1 mt0075441twist bioscience from 100 through to 05 million copies per reaction and a non-sars-cov-2 in-run control consisting of purified in vitro transcribed hiv rna from clone p92br0258 obtained from the national institute for biological standards and control nibsc 3  as additional negative controls we sequenced six matched clinical samples from non-covid-19 patients no sars-cov-2 sequences were detected in any negative controls or negative clinical samples in any pool no hiv reads were detected in the sars-cov-2 samples and the expected log-linear relationship between the number of reads and viral copy number was observed in the standard curve supplementary figure 9  as previously reported bonsall et al 2018 doi 101101397083  the veseq method is quantitative and the number of sequenced reads is expected to correlate with the number of input copies we were therefore satisfied that all sequenced runs were clean all samples had unique dual indexing udi to prevent cross-detection of reads in the same pool known as index misassignment or index hopping we avoided using the same udi series in any run of the 413 sequenced samples only 36 pairs of samples have identical indices these pairs were processed one month apart sequenced on different instruments miseq and novaseq 6000 and share fewer isnvs than average the majority of the data were sequenced on the novaseq 6000 instrument which uses a patterned flowcell which further reduces the chance of observing index hopping due to detection of hybrid optical clusters to avoid mixed base calls that may appear as a result of mis-mapping of host or contaminant reads we first screened all raw data for the presence of reads with sequence similarity to the human genome the mitochondrial genome or any bacterial genomes and removed these reads prior to mapping see methods we considered the possibility of the presence of non-sars-cov-2 seasonal coronaviruses in the samples which could cause closely-matching reads to be mapped to sars-cov-2 and appear as mixed base calls to exclude this possibility we analysed a subset of 90 samples batch cov8 for the presence of other coronaviruses using the castanet bait enrichment panel goh et al 2019 doi 101101716902 we did not find any samples positive for coronaviruses other than sars-cov-2 to eliminate any residual index misassignment we performed a stringent computational cleanup of the read data for all reads in a sequencing run consisting of up to three pools we identified optical duplicates that shared the same mapping coordinates start of reads 1 and 2 and template length and in each case removed the duplicate cluster from all samples except the one containing the greatest number of these reads see methods bioinformatics processing in this way no two samples within a run shared any duplicate reads one sample was split into two aliquots and sequenced in separate batches as oxon-af346 and oxon-af179  with 50x difference in read depth we first analysed the pre-cleaned data as expected we find strong concordance between isnv frequencies in the two replicates supplemental figure 1  with a noisier distribution for the cleaned data although cleaning of the data reduces the number of reads and consequently adds noise to isnv frequencies the importance of eliminating index misassignment outweighed concerns that we had of losing meaningful signal thus all of our results are conservative if our main finding of high within-host diversity that is geographically structured is due to contamination of samples or systematic sequencing errors there are certain patterns in the data we would and would not expect to see if patterns of diversity in the oxford and basingstoke data are due to batch effects we would expect diversity at specific sites to be clustered within batches for example for the five sites shown in figure 3  we find no sign of batch effects on patterns of diversity supplementary figure 4  and therefore batch effects are unlikely to be driving our observations more generally these isnvs are highly represented in at least two different batches the oxford and basingstoke samples were sequenced in the same lab by the same people gmc at mdc using the same protocols the identification of shared isnv sites between oxford and basingstoke suggests that contamination at the point of sample collection and rna extraction cannot explain the presence of these isnvs conversely the statistically significant differences in the distribution of some isnvs between oxford and basingstoke suggests these do not arise from lab-based contamination or other sequencing artefacts iii shared isnv sites are typically not polymorphic at the consensus level if rare isnvs arise from contamination we would expect minor variant alleles to be present in other samples at high frequency 94 of the isnvs we detected in oxford and basingstoke are not polymorphic at the consensus global scale this makes cross-contamination of samples unlikely we find strong geographical patterns with some isnv sites only found in a single location but others found in two three and four locations figure 2  main text this is unlikely to be caused by contamination among locations and if it were we would expect more isnv sites to be shared among locations this is also unlikely to be due to systematic biases in sequencing methodologies the only site that is repeatedly variant in samples is 11083 and is variant in most samples not just a subset of samples this site is a well-recognised homoplasy in sars-cov-2 in general and appears to be due to a variable truncation of a long stretch of polyt at this position which depending on the mapping software may present as a gap at the end of the homopolymer run or one position immediately afterward which can present as a tg isnv we cannot rule out systematic biases at other sites found in multiple eg 3 locations but these sites are few one of the most striking patterns we found was the repeated identification of minor variants at sites 24114408 and 23403 in apparent linkage equilibrium in both wales and scotland that is haplotype t-t-g as the major variant and c-c-a as the minor variant or vice versa  contamination cannot be ruled out but this would have to be at an unprecedented scale at two different locations moreover samples that share any of these isnv sites are phylogenetically closer on the tree than would be expected by chance  supplementary  figure 8  strongly suggesting cross-sample contamination is not the cause there are strong patterns of selection on isnvs that are not expected to arise from artefacts as revealed by the localisation of shared isnvs in codons and by their effect on amino acid sequence widely shared isnvs with frequency 5 are preferentially found in the 1st and 2nd base of each codon see supplementary figure 5  this is significantly different from the uniform pattern that would be expected from artefacts it is not observed in the controls and it is a signature of positive selection at aminoacid level oxfordbasingstoke specific variants are also under positive selection at aminoacid level as can be confirmed by a non-synonymoussynonymous comparison the ratio of non-synonymoussynonymous polymorphisms pnps among this list of variants is about three times higher than pnps for random variants at 2 frequency p0015 by fisher exact test supplementary table 1   title emergence of multiple variants of sars-cov-2 with signature structural changes debaleena bhowmik sourav pal abhishake lahiri arindam talukdar sandip paul  this study explores the divergence pattern of sars-cov-2 using whole genome sequences of the isolates from various covid-19 affected countries the phylogenomic analysis indicates the presence of at least four distinct groups of the sars-cov-2 genomes the emergent groups have been found to be associated with signature structural changes in specific proteins also this study reveals the differential levels of divergence patterns for the protein coding regions moreover we have predicted the impact of structural changes on a couple of important viral proteins via structural modelling techniques this study further advocates for more viral genetic studies with associated clinical outcomes and hosts response for better understanding of sars-cov-2 pathogenesis enabling better mitigation of this pandemic situation  the recent pandemic due to novel coronavirus disease covid-19 originated from wuhan hubei province of china has affected more than 200 countries worldwide on december 31 st 2019 china reported to who about the infection and on january 7 th the causative agent was identified as the novel coronavirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome -coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 surveillances v covid-19 situation reports on march 11 th 2020 who declared covid-19 as a global pandemic cucinotta  vanelli 2020  in india the first incidence of covid-19 was reported from the thrissur district of kerala timeline of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in india apart from china many other countries from asia europe and north america are severely affected and as per the who situation report as of 25 th april there has been 2832454 positive cases and 198532 deaths worldwide covid-19 situation reports crossed the species barrier to infect humans letko et al 2020 ye et al 2020  this singlestranded positive-sense rna virus shares about 79 and 50 genomic identity with that of the sars-cov and mers-cov respectively lu et al 2020  although it was reported that sars-cov-2 infection may be less severe as compared to that of sars-cov or mers-cov it is now apparent that the current novel coronavirus has an accelerated rate of human-to-human transmission than its predecessors huang et al 2020  sars-cov-2 genome is around 29903 nucleotides and organized in the following order from 5 to 3 orf1ab replicase structural spike glycoprotein s orf3a protein structural envelope protein e structural membrane glycoprotein m orf6 protein orf7a protein orf7b protein orf8 protein structural nucleocapsid phosphoprotein n and orf10 protein orf1ab is a large polyprotein 21291 nucleotides encoding sixteen non-structural proteins leader protein nsp2 nsp3 nsp4 3c-like proteinase nsp6 nsp7 nsp8 nsp9 nsp10 rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp helicase 3-to 5 exonuclease endornase 2-o-ribose methyltransferase and nsp11 wu et al 2020  studies have revealed that the highly mutable spike s protein of the virus is associated with the elevated human-to-human transmission rate through interaction with ace2 receptor of the host s protein is one of the well-characterized proteins of the coronaviridae family this 1255 amino acid transmembrane protein helps the virus to attach and enter the host thus analysing the structure and function of this spike protein would not only unveil the pathogenicity of the virus but also might illuminate its phylogenetic origin and diversity babcock et al 2004 zhang et al 2006 yan et al 2020  very little is known about the divergence of the sars-cov-2 genome although the earlier studies with similar rna pathogens eg hiv-1 influenza viruses sars-cov and hepatitis c virus pointed towards the rapidly evolving nature of the viral genomes and are subjected to the strongest evolutionary forces the ability to undergo host-specific adaptive changes in the viral genomes has enabled them to escape the innate as well as adaptive immune responses acquire resistance towards drugs or infect new hosts frost et al 2018  the rapid spread of sars-cov-2 around the world has enabled exposure of the virus to individuals with diverse genetic and immunological backgrounds having varied demographics age sex environmental conditions etc and thus potentially imposing significant selective pressures on the sars-cov-2 genomes therefore a study highlighting the genome divergence of sars-cov-2 would have tremendous importance during this pandemic providing better understanding of the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of sars-cov-2 pathogenesis and valuable information towards the development of drugs and vaccines a staggering number of genome sequences of sars-cov-2 are being submitted from around the world every day and with the increasing number of positive covid-19 cases in india we also intended to do a comparative genomic analysis of the indian sars-cov-2 isolates with respect to that of other countries we performed the phylogenetic and other evolutionary analyses of the sars-cov-2 genomes in order to reveal their shared ancestry determine genetic diversity and detect structural mutations this enabled us to study the divergence of this viral genome during the early phases of pandemic and identify multiple viral variants through computational analysis we predicted the impact of structural changes on spike glycoprotein s additionally we also studied the impact of the mutations on rdrp as it is considered to be one of the most promising target for drug development with remdesivir warren et al 2016 shannon et al 2020  a nucleotide analog targeting rdrp we further discussed the potential outcomes of our findings in terms of public health response in india to better control and prevent the disease we considered 109 genome sequences of sars-cov-2 isolates from different countries the main source of genomes is the epicov database of the gisaid wwwgisaidorg through valid registration we collected all the 33 genomes available from india as on april 15 th 2020 and the rest were obtained from among the earliest submissions from the respective countries of europe asia and america details of the country-wise genome selection provided in table1 of the supplementary information this working set of 109 sequences were checked for the number of ambiguous bases n50 and the presence of gaps gaps10 also the index genome of sars-cov-2 nc0455122 was considered from ncbi the genome alignment was performed using muscle aligner in default mode present in the ugene v34 edgar rc 2004 okonechnikov et al 2012  the phylogenetic tree was reconstructed by using the maximum likelihood method and the general time reversible model the initial tree for the heuristic search was obtained automatically by applying bionj algorithms tavar  miura 1986 gascuel o 1997  evolutionary analysis was performed using phyml integrated in seaview 502 guindon et al 2005 gouy et al 2010  further the tree was visualized and edited with figtree 144 rambaut 2012  the orthologous average nucleotide identity between genome sequences orthoani was measured with the help of oau command-line tool using the usearch algorithm lee et al 2016 edgar rc 2010  the resulting orthoani values were represented by a clustered-heat map using the online clusvis tool metsalu et al 2015  in order to extract all the annotated genes from all the sars-cov-2 genome sequences the isolate obtained from wuhan china nc0455122 was used as the reference genome in our analysis we used the standalone version of ncbi blast with an in-house developed perl script to fetch all the genes from each of the 109 genomes using dnasp rozas et al 2017  we calculated nucleotide diversity synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates for each gene further the timezone software was employed for phylogenetic analysis of each gene and detection of structural mutations in them chattopadhyay et al 2013  we performed a sequential analysis of s protein of the sars-cov-2 from china and india comparison of sequential alignment between wuhan isolated spike sequences with 33 sequences of indian origin was performed by multiple sequence alignment msa tool using clustal omega secondary structure prediction of the aligned sequences was carried out on the cfssp chou and fasman secondary structure prediction server in silico mutation on the sars-cov-2 associated s protein was done on the closed state conformation pdb id 6vxx the s protein is present in a homotrimeric conditions with individual chains containing some basic loop that loop building and modifications were done on the swiss-model server with respect to the wuhan isolated spike sequence followed by analysis of these mutations by mutprep server the mutation on the identified protein residues was analyzed on pymol with a pre-existing suitable rotamer library structural modification and kinetics change upon mutation were performed on dynemut server the computational analysis figures were generated in pymol phylogenomic study of sars-cov-2 reveals the appearance of distinct phylogenetic groups figure 2  the sub-group c contains the index case of sars-cov-2 with other isolates from china and other countries and seems to be the ancient group that emerged in the first phase of the pandemic this group also contains the first indian genome sequence from kerala the sub-group d comprises of many chinese isolates european states and second indian genome perhaps consolidating the hypothesis stating the emergence of multiple viral variants in china before the commencement of the pandemic most interestingly the sub-group e mostly comprises of indian isolates with genomes from iran and germany probably depicting the route of transmission of viral infection in india the whole genome based phylogenomic analysis and subsequent nucleotide identity analysis pointed towards the presence of four distinct groups of sars-cov-2 genomes it is to be mentioned here that these genomes are highly conserved as evident from 998 of ani values for any pair of genomes coronaviruses are known to have accurate nsp14 mediated synthesis of their rna genome and hence may maintain the overall conservation of their genomes although the nsp12 rdrp is not accurate ferron et al 2018  the presence of multiple variants within china indicates early divergence events in early phase of the pandemic similar type of observations was also reported in a recent work on sars-cov-2 genomes velazquez-salinas et al 2020 we also considered the available date of collection of the isolates from the metadata of the repository and observed that in sub-group c multiple early stage isolates from china are present staring from december 30 th  2019 collected from wuhan hubei province of china along with other early stage isolates from different countries are also present in this group the first reported genome sequence from kerala india is also present in this group in case of sub-group d we again found multiple isolates from china and other countries collected between january 2020 and march 2020 the second reported genome from kerala india is one of the members of this particular group some of these isolates in different countries may emerge from the ancestors of the viral isolates although the presence of multiple viral isolates collected in the second or third week of january from china indicates the emergence of multiple variants in china itself before the initiation of the state of pandemic the group b isolates were collected within the month of january to march and no isolates from china can be located these are the emergent isolates mostly originating in europe and different from the ancestral strains and were transmitted to india the group e is also devoid of any viral isolates from china and were collected in the month of march 2020 these are another variant of viral isolates transmitted to india originating in irangermany after the extraction of all the protein-coding regions from 109 genomes considering index genome nc0455122 as a reference we calculated the overall average pairwise nucleotide diversity  for each set while the regions nsp8 nsp11 and orf7b have a single variant the regions nsp2 nsp3 rdrp genes and genen are found to have more than 10 variants the  value for multivariant regions varies from 47 x 10 -4 to 88 x 10 -3  we further compared the nucleotide diversity of indian isolates with that of other isolates  figure 3a  the comparison yielded several india genome-specific changes for example nsp15 and orf7a showed mutational changes only for indian isolates on the other hand mutations happened for nsp7 nsp9 nsp10 nsp16 genee and orf10 genes for some of the isolates from different parts of the world but no changes can be seen in indian isolates next we estimated the rates of silent or synonymous ds and amino-acid changing or nonsynonymous sites dn mutations for these sets of protein-coding regions in order to determine the types of mutations that occurred in each gene as well as if any selection pressure acting on them the ds and dn profiles of the protein-coding regions depict selective mutational pressure for several of those regions  figure 3b and c the rate of non-synonymous mutation is higher for orf8 and orf10 while the opposite is true for nsp1 and orf6 we found almost similar rates of synonymous and non-synonymous case of nsp2 nsp4 and genes thus the rate of synonymous or non-synonymous mutations varies among the gene regions and for few genes the amino acid changing propensity is relatively higher than synonymous changes for all these genes the dnds values are not significantly higher than 1 and the notion of purifying selection was found nucleotide diversity ds and dn values were also calculated for group b and sub-groups c d and e figure1 of supplementary information and we have identified several protein coding regions of consistent changes these are nsp2 nsp3 nsp4 nsp6 nsp12 nsp13 nsp14 genes orf3a orf8 and genen thus these regions are consistently evolving in sars-cov-2 in different lineages and may generate multiple variants the two recently emerged groups b and e showed higher divergence of nsp9 and orf7a respectively and mostly by amino acid changes we next wanted to identify the structural mutations in all 26 protein-coding regions and map them individually onto the genome level phylogenetic tree figure2 of supplementary information for this we utilized the timezone software on individual genes for alignment phylogenetic analysis and tracking of structural mutations as mentioned earlier the protein-coding regions nsp1 nsp7 nsp8 nsp11 genee orf6 and orf7b do not experience any structural changes and are maintaining their ancient structure among them the small integral membrane protein e is important at different stages of the life cycle of this virus viz assembly budding envelope formation and pathogenesis the highly conserved nature of this protein indicates that a specific structural requirement is necessary for the proper functioning of this protein in the viral life cycle as well as in its pathogenicity several structural mutations were detected for nsp3 proteinase figure2 of supplementary information and structural glycoprotein s figure 4  apart from these two proteins nsp2 nsp4 rdrp nsp13 helicase orf3a and genen also showed a considerable number of structural changes figure 2 of supplementary information  the mapping of all these structural mutations on to the genome-based phylogenetic tree revealed the association of several of these mutations with different groups as shown in figure 1 and 2 the association of mutation is based on the four genes nsp2 nsp12 rdrp genes and orf8 table 1  the amino acid change v198i in nsp2 is associated with the emergence of group e comprising mostly of indian isolates and those from germany and iran the change p323l in the rdrp gene is a signature for all the members of group b except isolate germany003 this group is also associated with the change of d614g in spike glycoprotein s this particular group has probably emerged in the later phase of the pandemic and harbour a considerable amount of indian isolates for group d the change l84s in orf8 is present in all of its members thus in comparison to the initial isolates of group c all other groups has a unique signature of mutations which can describe the phylogenic position of any isolate our study revealed three protein coding regions nsp8 nsp11 and orf7b to be conserved throughout all the genomes we have considered among these gene products nsp8 forms a complex with nsp7 which can work as multimeric rna polymerase in order to extend primer for rdrp action te velthuis et al 2012  the diversity analysis in this study clearly indicates the conservation of such complex with no structural changes in both nsp8 and nsp7 figure 3  thus both of these partner proteins are highly conserved probably due to the proper complex formation for rdrp activity on the other hand there are seven proteins experiencing structural changes in all four phylogenetic groups these proteins are nsp3 nsp12 rdrp nsp13 helicase structural glycoprotein s orf3a orf8 and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein n among these the structural mutations in nsp12 and spike glycoprotein s are group specific and we have further studied that how these structural changes can potentially modulate its function all these proteins are important for viral life-cycle and pathogenesis and the structural changes among them may manifest phenotypic alterations and in turn change the viral pathogenesis with rigorous computational analysis we have further tried to evaluate the impact of these structural changes in spike glycoprotein functionality it is important to note that many of the mutations identified by our study are present in single viral isolate possibly this can also happen either due to presence of limited number of viral isolates in our study or due to sequencing errors whereas the cardinal mutations defining different groups are present in multiple viral isolates from different countries collected in different time points it is well established that spike s protein plays a pivotal role during viral entry into the host cell gordon et al 2020 ou et al 2020  the viral entry into the host cells is mediated by the initial binding of the receptor-binding domain rbd present at s1 subunit of the s protein to the host ace2 receptor followed by fusion of the viral spike and host membrane through s2 subunit located on the surface of the s protein rbd consists of 331-524 amino acid residues of the sars-cov-2 s protein tai et al 2020  in comparison with the s protein sequence pattern from index genome indian spike protein sequences possess five different variants arising due to 5 different structural mutations two of the protein variants are due to mutations present in the rbd at 408th r408i and 438th s438f position thus these two mutations may directly affect the structural conformation required for the receptor binding the other three mutations d614g v622i and a930v found on the indian specific sars-cov-2 s proteins are present outside the rbd the mutation r408i at the rbd involved positively charged arginine r with hydrophilic basic side chain is mutated to non-polar hydrophobic isoleucine ile amino acid with c-beta branch structurally the guanidine moiety with three amino groups has been replaced with the small methyl substitution in this mutation r408i as a result the non-polar hydrophobic side chains present in ile act as hindrance towards the accessible aqueous environment also arginine with its long sidechain has greater flexibility in comparison to the mutated ile with less to moderate side-chain flexibility which can affect the host cell bindings the basic characteristics of these two proteins are so unique that their exchange through mutation will result in conformational change in the structure which may contribute towards the host cell recognition for receptor binding according to our secondary structure prediction of india specific sequences with respect to the index s sequence we observed a change in secondary structural conformation in the 408 region of the index s protein possess a helices conformation which is changed into sheet like structures due to mutation in the indian isolated s protein apart from this tertiary structure analysis also shows changes in the structural conformation in rbd due to this mutation the protein conformational space has been reduced from 131 mlmol to the 121 mlmol as the bulky terminal guanidine moiety in arginine is replaced by a small alkyl group as a consequence the electrostatic forces also get modified the final protein binding conformational enthalpy g is 0133 kcalmol after mutation suggests much stabilized conformations change in vibrational entropy svib encom 0178 kcalmol -1 k -1  suggest increase in the molecular flexibility of the protein backbones which might affect the interactions with the host cell receptors a change in inter-atomic interaction is calculated for both wild type and mutated type in both the conformations both arg408 and ile408 were able to form stable intra-hydrogen bond interactions with glu406 and ile410 whereas ionic interaction between arg408 and gln414 is absent after the mutations  figure 5a  5b another mutation s438f at the rbd of the s1 subunit was observed in the indian isolates india026 and india028 specific s protein sequence in comparison to that of the index sequences the polar uncharged residue serine s is mutated to non-polar aromatic phenylalanine f similar to the previous mutations due to this exchange it loses the hydrophilic polar nature of the hydroxyl -oh moiety and attains a hydrophobic aromatic side chain that can repel themselves away from the aqueous environment interestingly this replacement leads to gain in the flexibility which has an impact on their secondary structure our analyses suggest that the -turn like coil conformations on the wuhan isolated structures is converted onto the more flexible sheet-like conformations at 438 position in tertiary structure analysis it is observed that since a hydroxyl group has been substituted by phenyl substituent more protein conformational space is occupied as a result the molar volume is increased from 678 mlmol to the 1211 mlmol expectedly the electrostatic and binding entropies g have been modified to the 1942 kcalmol which signify more stabilized conformations the introduction of bulky phenyl groups led to the change in vibrational entropy svib encom -0545 kcalmol -1 k -1 which implies lower molecular flexibility of the backbone protein the mutation also has impact on the structural integrity in the wild type structure the intramolecular hydrogen bonding has been observed between ser438 to the leu441 asp442 ser443 and pro507 on mutation there is a loss of ionic interactions and the hydrogen bonding has been modified between phe438 to the asn440 and pro507  figure 5c 5d  all these data suggest that the mutation s438f might affect the bindings of the s protein with the host receptor the s protein for a considerable number of indian isolates experiences another mutation at the 614 th position d614g which is located outside of the rbd at the s2 domain for entire group b isolates the negatively charged aspartic acid d containing the acidic side chain is replaced by the nonpolar glycine g residue as a consequence hydrophilic nature and flexibility are lost whereas the hydrophobic characteristic is acquired as the properties of these two amino acids are different the mutations may modify the structural conformations that can alter the functional modification towards the host cell recognition and fusion apart from the change in physical characteristics our analysis suggests that this mutation does not alter their secondary structures both the wild type and mutated structure attain sheet like conformations in their secondary structure analysis however the mutation has a significant impact on the tertiary structure as the negatively charged acidic hydrophilic group is being replaced by neutral small hydrogen hydrophobic moiety this residue is located on the water accessible surface at the s2 domain which is involved in the fusion of the viral and hosts cell membranes thus it is logical that due to loss in acidic nature and flexibility this mutation might implicate the s protein-mediated viral membrane fusion towards the host cell membrane however the interatomic hydrogen bonding with the neighboring residues remains the same after mutation  figure 6a 6b  mutation at the 622 nd v622i residue is present outside of the rbd domain specifically at the s2 subunit of the indian isolated s protein sequence the hydrophobic valine v is mutated to a similar class of residue isoleucine i with a greater aliphatic branch chain as a result of this mutation changes in the vibrational entropy svib encom  -0191 kcalmol -1 k -1  were observed which indicates a decrease in molecular flexibility causing distortion of the protein main backbones our analysis suggests that the mutation does not impact changes in their tertiary structure conformation since both valine and isoleucine have a c-beta branching headed towards the main chains it is difficult to attain -helical conformations by twisting as suggested by the change in electrostatic binding energies g  0786 kcalmol the interatomic interactions with the neighboring residues remain the same after mutation  figure 6c 6d  this restricted conformation can deform the neighboring local backbone of the protein which might affect the sars-cov-2 spike protein-mediated viral fusion with the host cell membrane we observed another mutation a930v in the indian isolated spike sequence at the s2 subunit the hydrophobic aliphatic alanine a is mutated to valine v with similar hydrophobic characteristics however the valine contains a bulkier c-beta branched side chain that is bulkier with lesser flexibility as a result of bulkier c-branching in valine the main skeletal backbone protein resists itself for twisting to attain restricted

6f  as this mutation is present on the surface of the s2 subunit of the s protein it may influence the spike protein driven fusion of the sars-cov-2 and host membrane the sars-cov-2 nsp12 is rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp consists of 932 amino acids which are located in the polyprotein from 4393 -5324 aa structurally sars-cov-2 nsp12 protein is categorized into n-terminal 1-397 aa and a polymerase domain 398-919 aa and is comparable to the previous sars-cov nsp12 pdb id 6nur the polymerase domain can be subdivided into structurally different three subunits a finger 398-581 and 628-687 aa a palm 582-627 and 688-815 aa and a thumb subunit 816-919 aa which adopts a right-handed cupped shaped conformation yin et al 2020  the active site of rdrp is present at the interface between finger and thumb subunits of the sars-cov-2 rdrp which is a conserved domain with mers and sars-nsp12 the active site is situated in the center of the substrate domain where rna synthesis takes place on the entry of the rna template from template entry channel and ntp nucleoside triphosphate through the ntp entry channel peersen ob 2017  the structural analysis of the sars-cov-2 specified nsp12 revealed the presence of seven conserved motifs a-g motifs figure 7  these motifs play crucial roles towards the binding of template and nucleotide as well as catalysis of the ntp addition poch et al 1989 bruenn ja 2003 mirza et al 2019  several antiviral drugs act by attaching onto the first replicated base pairs and terminates the chain elongation process the rdrp binding affinity towards the template rna has been increased by the association of the co-factor nsp7 and nsp8 with the nsp12 rna polymerization activity is found to be inhibited in presence of the active triphosphate form of remdesivir rtp which is under clinical trial yin et al 2020 shannon et al 2020  proper positioning of the polymerase active site is fully depended on the n-terminal structural conformations in this mutation a hydrophobic proline p has been mutated to the similar hydrophobic aliphatic leucine l secondary structure analysis revealed the structural conformation changes after mutation although proline is known as helix breakers since they interrupt the stability of the -helical conformations of the backbone protein but in this case proline is present in -turn-like conformations figure4 of supplementary information whereas mutated residue leucine contains the bulkier c-beta branched aliphatic side chains and found present as a sheet-like conformation figure4 of supplementary information in the tertiary structure analysis suggest that the mutation is present in the n-terminal region which is connected to the finger subdomain  figure   7  so this mutation on the n-terminal domain may hamper the proper folding of the sars-cov-2 rdrp backbone protein which can play a vital role for the proteins consequent degradation te velthuis aj 2010  in comparison to the wuhan strain indian isolated sars-cov-2 specified rdrp experienced two other mutations a406v and n874s as shown in figure 7  alanine 406 is not in the active site domain but this is present on the template rna entry channel in this mutation hydrophobic aliphatic alanine is converted to a similar class of non-polar valine residue as a result such mutation is not expected to cause any significant change in protein functionalities however due to the presence of the bulkier c-beta branched-chain it restricted the protein main backbone to attain the alpha-helical conformations also the heavy c-beta branching reduces the side chain flexibilities which can modify the rna template entry and if the rna template cant enters on to the catalytic domain rna synthesis finally gets hampered in another mutation n874s the polar uncharged asparagine n is replaced with similar polar uncharged serine s however there is a different polar group with asn carry an amide group and ser has a hydroxyl group also due to a slight reduction of side-chain length in ser as compared to asn flexibilities of the -turn conformation will be hampered as this mutation is observed near the ntp entry channel figure 7  any changes in the conserved -turn conformation of the backbone protein might affect the ntp channel and interfere the rna synthesis interestingly such asn to ser mutation has been found to confer oseltamivir resistance to h5n1 influenza a viruses kiso et al 2011  in this study we analyzed the whole genome as well as all the protein coding regions of 109 genomes of sars-cov-2 considered from different countries of higher incidence of covid-19 sars-cov-2 is the pathogen that causes severe pneumonia in several of the affected individuals and is responsible for about 02 million deaths worldwide with the advent of high-throughput next generation sequencing technology the researchers around the world have access to huge number of sars-cov-2 genome sequences we also took the opportunity of the availability of this resource in order to study the genome divergence pattern of this pathogenic virus for identification of emerging strains with distinct genotypes this study has potential for better understanding of the evolution and transmission of sars-cov-2 genome globally locally and even within a single host although our dataset comprises of 109 genomes we considered the isolates from various countries of the world with evidence of early viral transmission initially originating from china and with emphasis on india which is in its early stages of covid-19 pandemic our results describe the clear association of four structural changes with that of group structure from phylogenomics analysis of the sars-cov-2 isolates in this present pandemic situation also the structural studies performed here indicate the probable connection of these variants with varied level of virulence potentials of sars-cov-2 in case of india this study with considerable number of genome sequences portrays to a certain extent the population structure of covid-19 further it is apparent that multiple emergent variants of viral genomes are circulating in indian and new genome sequences can be characterised in this way obviously more sequencing of viral genomes and associated clinical outcome data may further validate the relevance of our findings and implicate the viral

yogesh kumar harvijay singh chirag patel n   the highly contagious and pathogenic novel severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 causative agent ongoing covid-19 pandemic has spread rapidly and posed a health threat of unprecedented magnitude on the global population the novel sars-cov-2 was first reported in december 2019 to have emerged in the live wildlife market in the wuhan region of hubei province where it has caused mystic pneumonia-like respiratory illnesses in the human population of the affected area 1 according to data presented by the covid-19 situation report from world health organization who as of may 15 2020 the virus has infected more than 4347935 people around the world including a staggering 297241 deaths with a cumulative mortality rate of 68 and exponentially increased in between march and april 2 despite the instantaneous and monumental research efforts from the scientific community around the globe at present no effective antiviral treatment or vaccine is available for covid-19 however significant efforts have been made to the development of vaccines and therapeutic drugs which were under small scale clinical trials 34 presently the sars-cov-2 infected patients treatments have been limited to the use of prophylactic and symptomatic management like mild symptoms such as dry cough sore throat and fever and various fatal complications including organ failure septic shock pulmonary edema severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 5 therefore there is an urgent need for the discovery of a potential treatment therapy to check and control the sars-cov-2 pandemic coronaviruses covs belong to family coronaviridae of viruses constitute an important class of pathogens for humans and other vertebrates 6 before the current sars-cov-2 only six of the covs were known to cause mild to severe illnesses in humans the novel human coronavirus hcov229e and hcovnl63 fall in genera alpha-coronavirus cause milder upper respiratory disease in adults and sometimes can also cause severe infection in infants and young children whereas the beta-coronaviruses like hcovoc43 hku1 sars-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus which has triggered an epidemic in china during 200203 and mers-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus an etiological agent of middle east coronavirus epidemic of 2012 have potential to cause infection in lower respiratory tract along with cough  fever and triggers severe respiratory illness in humans 7 the causative agent of the current outbreak sars-cov-2 also belongs to beta coronaviruses 8 and is closely related to sars-cov with an overall genomic sequence similarity of 79 all of these covs belong to the coronaviridae a family of viruses that possess a positive-sense single-stranded rna genome 9 the virion of sars-cov-2 is consists of crown-shaped peplomers 80160 nm in diameter and consists of a 30 kb long single-stranded rna molecule of positive polarity with 5 cap and 3 poly-a tail 10 the rna genome is composed of at least six open reading frames orfs of which the first orf orf1ab makes up the 5two-third and encodes two polypeptides pp1a and pp1ab both of which furthermore leads to the production of 16 nonstructural proteins nsps other orfs that make up the remaining one-third of the viral genome give rise to the production of four main structural factors of the virion spike protein s envelope protein e membrane protein m and nucleocapsid protein n 11 the sars-cov-2 virus uses the heterotrimeric spike s protein which consists of s1 and s2 subunit on its surface to interacts with the ace2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 cellular receptor abundantly expressed on many cell types in human tissues 12 upon internalization into the cell genomic rna is used as a template for direct translation of two polyprotein pp1a and pp1ab which encodes several crucial nonstructural proteins nsps including two proteases chymotrypsin-like protease 3clpro or main protease mpro -nsp5 and papain-like a protease ppro -nsp3 both of which processes the polypeptide pp1a and pp1ab in a sequence-specific manner to produce 16 different nsps 1314 the papain protease processes the polyprotein to generate nsp14 at the same time the mpro operates at as many as 11 cleavage sites by specifically recognizing the sequence leu-glnser-ala-gly  marks the cleavage site to generate rest of the critical nsps including helicase methyltransferase and rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp all of which play a critical role in the viral infection cycle by forming a replication-transcription complex rtc 15 therefore the main protease constitutes a major and attractive drug target to block the production of nonstructural viral components and thereby to hamper the replication event of the virus life cycle additionally no human protease with similar cleavage specificity is known to rule out the possibility of cellular toxicity upon the potential inhibition of the main viral protease 16 in recent years drug repurposing methodology has emerged as a resourceful alternative to fasten the drug development process against rapidly spreading emerging infections such as the one of sars-cov-2 17 the approach of drug repurposing has successfully led to the discoveries of potential drug candidates against several diseases such as ebola disease hepatitis c virus and zika virus infection 1819 recently several repurposing studies on sars-cov-2 have been performed using clinically approved drugs 20 among which a very new study comes out on a clinical trial of lopinavirritonavir drug for covid-19 which was indicated on top of our drug repurposing study 21 in the present study we have performed in silico based drug repurposing method using molecular docking studies on the spectrum of food and drug administration fda - approved antiviral drugs against sars-cov-2 mpro to this end a recently elucidated x-ray crystal structure of sars-cov-2 mpro pdb id 6y2f which have been shown with an -ketoamide as a potent inhibitor in the enzymes active site was chosen and screened for several fda approved antiviral drugs to simulate the mpro- -ketoamide interactions and thereby blocking the active pocket 16 the crystal structure of sars-cov-2 mpro in the apo form pdb id 6y2e and -ketoamide bound form pdb id 6y2f shows that the protein makes a crystallographic dimer composed of two monomers of identical conformations each protomer furthermore is made up of three domains the interface of domain i and domain ii form the active site of the protein which is composed of a cys145-his41 dyad where -ketoamide derivative 13b is bound fig 1
a the uniquely globular domain iii is linked to domain ii through a linker region and deemed essential for the catalytic activity of these chymotrypsin-like proteas 22 the -ketoamide derivative 13b is shown bound in the active site it is stabilized by several interactions with the active site residues his41  cys145 and adjacent residues in substrate binding cleft such as gly143 and ser144 16 fig 1b we have selected several existing fda approved drugs most of which are reported to be used in humans for countering certain viral infections and screened them for binding in the active cleft of mpro our results have shown that some of the drugs occupied the active site of mpro with even increased binding affinity than that of the bound -ketoamide 13b while the rest of the compounds has shown appreciable binding while holding most of the crucial active site determinants we envisage that further in vitro examination of the inhibitory potential of these drugs on the catalytic activity of the main protease could lead the way to repurpose one or more of the tested fda approved drugs in this study as a treatment therapy for sars-cov-2 induced disease to understand the evolutionary relationship between the previously known human coronavirus and the novel sars-cov-2 we have performed the phylogenetic analysis for analysis all the closely related and complete reference genome sequences of sars-cov-2 were downloaded from the ncbi genbank database a total of 50 genomes were considered for the study mega 60 was used for multiple sequence alignment and construction of a phylogenetic tree and 1000 bootstrap replicates performed using the neighbor-joining method 23 the recently elucidated x-ray crystal structure coordinates of sar-cov-2 mpro was downloaded from rcsb pdb pdb id 6y2f having 175  resolution in this structure the mpro was co-crystallized with the improved bound -ketoamide 13b inhibitor and multiple intermolecular interactions of the ligand with the active site residues are characterized 16 to further identify the potent inhibitors for sar-cov-2 mpro among the fda approved antiviral drugs we have downloaded more than 75 drug compounds from the pubchem chemical database 24 for molecular docking based drug repurposing the download 3d structures of compounds and protein were prepared the docking study was performed by autodock vina 25 which uses a lamarckian genetic algorithm ga in combination with grid-based energy estimation to check the docking accuracy of software we have performed re-docking to the co-crystal bound ligand the main aim of this molecular interaction study was to identify the highly interacting drug with sar-cov-2 protein crystal structure and to propose the drug by in-silico repurposing method all the interaction visualization analysis studies were performed by discoverystudio visualizer ds pymol molecular visualization tool and ligplot 2627 the molecular dynamics md simulations were performed by yasara version 191214w64 yet another scientific artificial reality application commercial package 28 throughout 10 nanoseconds with 101 snapshots and the amber14 force field by md we computationally see the physical movement of atoms and molecules which provides the structural level integrity and conformational changes that occur in the protein-ligand docked complex in the present study the docked complexes of virtually screened top three drugs lopinavir-ritonavir tipranavir and raltegravir with the x-ray crystal structure of sars-cov-2 mpropdb id 6y2f were analyzed through md simulations the md simulations parameters were kept as follows where the temperature is kept 298 k the pressure at the bar coulomb electrostatics at the cutoff of 786 09 nacl ph 7 solvent density 0997 1- femtosecond

mean square fluctuation rmsf evaluations 30 the sequence alignment of the sar-cov-2 genome shows high similarity with the closely related reference genomes of other coronaviruses the blastn search of the complete genome of sar-cov-2 reveals that the most closely related virus available in genbank is sl-covzxc45 mg7729331 bat sars-like coronavirus showing 95 query coverage and 8911 identity in contrast another bat sars-cov genome sl-covzxc21 mg7729341 showed 94 query coverage and 8865 sequence identity both isolated from china majorly phylogenetic tree was clustered into three clades i ii and clade iii clade i consists of 25 sars-cov and bat-sl-cov complete genome and share sequence identity range from 8818 to 100 when sequence was aligned using blastn tool whereas clade ii consists of total 12 complete genomes of sars-cov-2 and bat-sl-cov in which ten genomes are of sars-cov-2 which were isolated from patients in different countries china mn9886681 nc0455122 mn9383841 mn9752621 usa mn9944671 mn9944681 mn9853251 mn9974091 mn9887131 and nepal mt0726881 the other two genomes of bat-sl-cov were isolated from china mg7729331 mg7729341 in clade iii there are two complete genomes of bat coronavirus isolated from germany gu1902151 and kenyan bat ky3524071 the rest of the 11 complete genomes of viruses are from hibicovirus nobecovirus merbecovirus and embecovirus importantly phylogenetic analysis revealed that there is no divergence in the sar-cov-2 genome sequence of different sar-cov-2 viruses isolated from different countries during the ongoing outbreak fig 2
 coronaviruses use a chymotrypsin-like a protease along with papain protease to process and cleaves its long polyprotein precursor into individually functional nsps multiple sequence analysis of the main protease of sars-cov-2 with that of sars-cov reveals that amino acid sequence is conserved with a sequence identity of 96 fig 3
 the active site residues are thoroughly conserved and make a catalytic cys145-his41 dyad additionally there are substrate-binding subsites positioned in the active site groove of the protease the specific subsite residues located in the enzyme active site are named as s1 s1 s2 s3 and s4 depending on their relative position to the cleavage site and subsites p1 p1 p2 p3 and p4 in the polyprotein subsite p1 corresponds to the amino acid just before the cleavage site and position p1 corresponds to the residue immediately after the cleavage site 3132 in the mpro of sars-cov-2 active site region the s1 residues are contributed by cys145 gly143 and ser144 which also serve as the oxyanion hole the s1 residue is his163 while glu166  gln189 located at the s2 position bulky gln189 and pro168 make the s4 site 16 fig 4
a the main protease recognizes and binds specific residues at each subsite of the peptide substrate to determine the initiation of proteolysis and production of nsps for the formation of the replication-transcription complex the molecular docking based virtual screening of fda approved antiviral drugs against the sars-cov-2 mpro revealed the strong interaction with higher docking energy and binding affinities all the potential drugs docked with the independent confirmation in the active site of protein where the co-crystal structure ligand improved -ketoamide 13b bound molecular docking binding affinity of all the docked and analyzed drugs with their binding energy ranking is shown in table s1 the molecular re-docking was also performed to check the docking accuracy of the software autodock vina and it was observed that the co-crystal bound ligand and re-docked ligand shows rmsd value of 051  suggesting the high fidelity of docking method fig 4b in the present study we focused on the top 10 docking results for further analysis as these drug compounds showing higher binding affinity as lopinavir-ritonavir -106 kcalmol tipranavir -87 kcalmol raltegravir -83 kcalmol -ketoamide13b -83 kcalmol nelfinavir -82 kcalmol dolutegravir -81 kcalmol tenofovir-disoproxil -81 kcalmol baloxavir-marboxil -81 kcalmol letermovir -80 kcalmol and maraviroc -80 kcalmol although among the top 10 drugs the top three drug compounds were showing binding affinity even higher than that of the improved -ketoamide 13b compound fig 5

b interestingly the binding energy score of lopinavir-ritonavir in protein-ligand docking was found to be even better than that of the docked -ketoamide and the in silico inhibition constant ki was obtained to be 16 nm in silico inhibition constant ki as obtained by docking is given in table 2
 for the top 10 drugs drug tipranavir or tipranavir disodium is another nonpeptidic protease inhibitor used in combination with ritonavir to treat hiv infection 49 in our study the drug shows interaction with gln192 met165 both form hydrogen bonding gln189 asp187 met49 arg188 ser46 cys44 thr25 and his41 in different conformation from that of -ketoamide inhibitor figs 5b and 9d we hypothesize that tipranavir or its other derivatives with even improved binding affinity in combination with ritonavir could serve as the potential protease inhibitor to counter sras-cov-2 multiplication in cell-based assay another drug that has shown comparable binding affinity and binding energy with that of the docked -ketoamide in mpro active site the raltegraviris a characterized antiretroviral medication which works by inhibiting the integrase strand transfer and is used in combination with other drugs to relieve the hiv infection 42 in the present study the raltegravir drug shows interaction with his164 arg188 gln192 glu166 all residues were bonded with strong hydrogen bond met49 met165 phe140 pro168 and leu167 the drug shows four h-bonds with nearest interacting amino acids of the sars-cov-2 mpro enzyme which indicates good inhibition figs 5c and 9c this drug could also be used with other combinations like raltegravir and lopinavir for the treatment of covid-19 if found producing desirable inhibitory effect against sars-cov-2 protease in biochemical activity assay or cell-based assays additionally other drugs that were screened and docked in the substrate-binding cleft of the mpro has shown good binding energy score which is comparably similar to the original compound in the protein crystal structure many of these drugs such as dolutegravir letermovir  nelfinavir are commonly used for treating different infections ranging from hiv to cytomegalovirus by employing the different mechanisms of action 50 51 52 the identified repurposed drug and their interaction with binding amino acids in the mpro active site have been shown in table 1 after screening the different fda approved drugs the present study enabled us to understand the mode of interaction of approved antiretroviral drugs with new coronavirus sars-cov-2 main protease enzyme the top three drugs lopinavir-ritonavir raltegravir and tipranavir were further run for md simulations studies for the period of 10 ns in the results we see that all three ligands are intact and bound to its binding site later the protein backbone rmsd analysis of all the complexes was performed which reveals that nearly all three complexes were stable after 4 ns and showing rmsd calculations within the range of 152458  after starting from 05  fig 6 the total binding energies were showing that drug lopinavir-ritonavir was showing more stable energy values fig 7 in order to know the effect of ligands binding on the sars-cov-2 mpro we performed the rmsf analysis from the average rmsf of protein constituting residues atoms since all trajectories of all complexes become stable with minor fluctuations between range 102  fig 8 from the analysis it was observed that lopinavir-ritonavir shows all hydrogen bonds made with nine acceptors and two donors whereas a total number of 20 hydrogen bonds are possible fig s1 in raltegravir 11 acceptors and three donors h-bonds were formed whereas a total number of 25 hydrogen bonds are possible similarly drug tipranavir formed eight acceptors and two donors h-bonds in contrast a total number of 18 hydrogen bonds are possible fig s1 this md simulation analysis shows the promising binding stability of the drug compounds with the binding pocket of cov-2 mpro pdb id 6y2f however we believe that all the drugs studied and screened for repurposing against covid-19 in this study should furthermore be tested and their in vitro inhibitory potential needs to be investigated through robust biochemical proteolytic activity assays and other biophysical  structural studies in conclusion this study reveals the potential of repurposed antiviral drugs to bind in the active site of sars-cov-2 main protease in a highly specific binding pattern similar to that of the crystal bound -ketoamide mpro structure three of the screened drugs lopinavir-ritonavir raltegravir and tipranavir have shown the strongest binding and that md simulation study confirmed the stability and conformational flexibility of these drugs in the enzyme active site since all the drugs identified in this study are of known pharmacokinetics standards and approved by fda for human use for the treatment of respective illneses so it may be possible to move straight to clinical trials as per standard and approved by fda for new indication and therefore can fasten up the process of the therapeutics development against sars-cov-2 infection the molecular dynamics studies performed in this study for screened top three drugs also proving the binding conformational stability with cov-2 mpro our phylogenetic analysis of the available genomes of sars-cov-2 isolated from different sources also reveals that the virus is not showing any sign of severing mutation or diversification rapidly therefore the repurposed drug combinations could be used against sars-cov-2 on the pan-community level furthermore we suggest that the efficacy of the repurposed drugs in this study needs to be experimentally confirmed by carrying out the biochemical and structural studies for the prevention and treatment of covid-19 no funding

sars-cov-2 were downloaded from the gisaid database17 supplementary table i available from httpwwwijmrorginarticles20201512imagesindianjmedres20201512200281471sm5pdf multiple sequence alignment was performed using the mega software version 7018 with retrieved sequences from two of the three positive cases and the available gisaid sequences a phylogenetic tree was generated using the neighbour joining method and the kimura-2-parameter as the nucleotide nt substitution model with 1000 bootstrap replications as implemented in mega software18 per cent nucleotide divergence and amino acid aa divergence were calculated using the p-distance method18 mutations specific to the indian sars-cov-2 viruses were identified by comparing the coding regions with respect to the sars-cov-2 wuhan china wuhan hu-1 three-dimensional 3d model of the spike protein and epitope prediction the pre-fusion structure of the indian case 1 sars-cov-2 spike s glycoprotein was modelled using the swiss-model

antigenicity of the shortlisted peptide sequences was further predicted using the vaxijen online server httpwwwddg-pharmfacnetvaxijenvaxijenvaxijenhtml with a default threshold of 04 discontinuous epitopes on the modelled structure of the indian case 1 sars-cov-2 spike protein were predicted using the online servers ellipro httptoolsiedborgellipro and discotope 20 httptoolsiedborgdiscotope integrated in the immune epitope database ellipro predicts epitopes based on the protusion index pi wherein the protein shape is approximated as an ellipsoid ref for ellipro and discotope an ellipsoid with the pi value of 08 indicates that 80 per cent of the residues are within the ellipsoid and 20 per cent are outside all residues that are outside the 80 per cent ellipsoid will have a score of 08 residues with larger scores are associated with greater solvent accessibility the pi value was set to a score of 08 discotope predicts epitopes using 3d structure and half-sphere exposure as a surface measure in a novel spatial neighbourhood definition method default values were set for sensitivity 047 and specificity 075 for selecting the amino acids forming discontinuous epitopes a sensitivity of 047 means that 47 per cent of the epitope residues are predicted as part of the epitopes while a specificity of 075 means that 25 per cent of the non-epitope residues are predicted as part of the epitopes outputs from both the methods were combined and the final regions were mapped on the modelled 3d-structure as the most probable conformational epitopes in addition we also predicted n-linked glycosylation sites in the s protein using netnglyc 10 server httpwwwcbsdtudkservicesnetnglyc the spike proteins were also screened for the presence of potential epitopes presented by major histocompatibility complex mhc class i molecules to cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctls the online netctl12 server httpwwwcbsdtudkservicesnetctl based on machine learning techniques such as artificial neural

the e gene ranged from 198 to 345 for the tsns specimens detailed ct values for the real-time rt-pcrs specific to the above-mentioned genes of the positive specimens are given in table i blood samples were found to be negative for the sars-cov-2 case 1 travelled from wuhan china reached india on january 23 2020 and further travelled to the final destination of kerala on january 24 this individual developed cough on january 25 and further experienced a sore throat and mild fever and was admitted to the general hospital thrissur kerala the second case travelled from wuhan and had close contact with case 1 during the travel to the final destination in india case 2 developed similar symptoms along with fever and diarrhoea on january 26 and the collected ts specimens were referred to the icmr-niv on january 28 the second case was hospitalized on january 30 in a medical college alappuzha kerala the clinical sample ts was collected on january 31 2020 case 3 travelled from china to india developed a runny nose on january 30 and was admitted to the general hospital kasaragod kerala on january 31 2020 ts specimens were collected on january 31 2020 ngs of sars-cov-2 from india - phylogenetic analysis and molecular characterization ngs analysis from the ts specimens retrieved two complete genome sequences from case 1 and case 3 the complete genomic sequence data for case 2 could not be recovered due to the lower kappa concentration of the sample and hence not included in the study for analysis the fastq files were reference mapped with the available wuhan seafood pneumonia virus wuhan hu-1 complete sars-cov-2 genome accession number nc 0455122 the total reads which were mapped and the percentage of the genome recovered for the two cases are summarized in table i analysis of the complete genome sequences of sars-cov-2 from the positive cases in india revealed that the percentage nt and aa differences between case 1 and case 3 were 0038 and 010 per cent respectively the sequences of case 1 and case 3 diverged from the wuhan-hu1 sequence by 0017 per cent nt and 0041 per cent aa respectively indian sars-cov-2 clustered with the sarbecovirus subgenus of the betacoronavirus genus and was closest to the batcov ratg13 sequence 9609 nt8 the phylogenetic comparison showed the clustering of the genome sequences of case 1 and case 3 with the existing sequences of the sars-cov-2 sequences fig 1 the phylogeny revealed emerging heterogeneity within the sars-cov-2 sequences globally the indian sars-cov-2 viruses were positioned in different clusters indian sars-cov-2 sequences showed two changes 408 argile and 930 alaval in the spike protein compared to the wuhan hu-1 sequence the mutations were further mapped on the spike protein model of the indian sequence supplementary fig 1 available from httpwwwijmrorginarticles20201512imagesindianjmedres20201512200281471sm6pdf deletion of a three-nucleotide stretch encoding tyrosine residue at position 144 of the spike gene was also observed in the indian sars-cov-2 from case 1 when compared to the other sars-cov-2 sequences as noted in the earlier sars-cov-2 sequences both the indian sequences possessed the polybasic cleavage site rrar in the spike protein at the junction of s1 and s2 the two subunits of the spike protein19 epitope predictions thirty one linear b-cell epitopes were predicted by bepipred in the indian sars-cov-2 of which three were found to have a length of 6 amino acids and hence not considered linear epitopes were also predicted using the abcpred prediction tool which predicted 47 epitopes based on the threshold of 08 regions common to both the prediction methods n17 were identified manually the 17 epitopes were screened for their antigenicity using the vaxijen v20 tool httpwwwddg-pharmfacnetvaxijenvaxijenvaxijenhtml and nine of these epitopes were shortlisted these epitopes were further screened for their ability to elicit an ifn- response which was predicted using the ifnepitope tool finally five epitopes four in the s1 domain and one in the s2 domain were predicted which could possibly generate an immune response and suppress the ifn- response table ii n-linked glycosylation site prediction revealed that two putative glycosylation sites with a low value for jury agreement were present within the epitope stretch 328-344 the discontinuous epitopes in the spike protein of the indian sars-cov-2 were further identified using multiple methods ellipro and discotope conformational epitopes based on these methods were mapped on the pre-fusion structure of the modelled indian sars-cov-2 spike protein the newly released structure of the sars-cov-2 spike protein was used as the template for modelling the indian spike protein ramachandran plot statistics revealed 837 per cent of the residues to be in the core region 144 per cent in the additionally allowed region and 05 per cent in the disallowed region four epitopes were predicted by ellipro based on the pi threshold of 08 supplementary table ii available from http www ijmrorginarticles20201512imagesindianjmedres20201512200281471sm7pdf the result from the discotope is presented in supplementary table iii available from httpwwwijmrorginarticles 20201512 images indianjmedres20201512200281471sm8pdf the mapped conformational epitopes are depicted in figure 2 for the purpose of comparison the indian s protein sequence was also modelled using the pre-fusion structure of sars-cov-1 6accpdb 8729 identity and the results for the conformational epitopes predicted are

httpwwwijmrorginarticles20201512imagesindianjmedres20201512200281471sm10pdf t-cell epitope prediction revealed 105 strong binding epitopes capable of binding to different hla types using the netctl12 software based on the threshold of 04 twelve of these were shortlisted considering a binding efficiency of 05 nm and capable of eliciting ifn- response table iii till february 29 2020 three positive cases of sars-cov-2 were reported from india from 881 suspected cases tested at icmr-niv pune all the three cases had a travel history from wuhan china during january 2020 although ngs was performed on the specimens for all the three positive cases the complete genome sequence could be retrieved only from case 1 and case 3 the three cases were recovered after hospitalization and were home quarantined as per the guidelines of the ministry of health and family welfare government of india14 the low viral copy number of the ts specimen from case 2 could be the possible reason for lesser viral reads being retrieved during the ngs run leading to a fragmented genome the recent study from china on serial samples tss sputum urine and stool from two patients followed days 3-12 and days 4-15 post onset20 n gene-specific real-time rt-pcr assay showed that the viral loads in ts and sputum samples peaked at around 5-6 days after symptom onset ranging from around 104-107 copies per ml during this time20 in another study the virus was detected in the saliva specimens of 11 of the 12 patients and serial saliva testing showed declines of viral rna levels21 the two indian sars-cov-2 sequences were found to be non-identical 004 nt divergence and the result of phylogenetic analysis indicated that there were two different introductions into the country a recent study using 52 published genbank sequences showed evidence of substantial genetic heterogeneity and estimated the time to the most recent common ancestor to be december 5 2019 95 confidence interval november 6 - december 13 201922 continuous monitoring and analysis of the sequences from the affected countries would be vital to understand the genetic evolution and rates of substitution of the sars-cov-2 the comparison of the amino acid sequences of the non-structural nsp1-nsp16 and structural polyproteins was undertaken with reference to the wuhan-hu1 strain for molecular characterization some human betacoronaviruses including hcov-hku1 lineage a have a polybasic cleavage site as well as predicted o-linked glycans near the s1s2 cleavage site of the spike protein as published recently the polybasic cleavage site that has not been previously observed in related lineage b betacoronaviruses and is a unique feature of sars-cov-2 was noted in the indian sars-cov-2 the mutation arg408ile in the spike protein of one of the indian sequences is noted to be in the rbd and ala930val is located in the s2 domain however both are away from the ace2 receptor-binding interface1923 mutations in the spike protein sequences of sars-cov-2 observed currently are localized over the s1 and s2 domains and so far have not been found in the ace2-binding interface from the alignment of the spike protein sequences of sars cov-1 and sars-cov-2 wuhan-hu1 and india it can be observed that the three nucleotide-deletion in the case 1 sars-cov-2 from india is located close to the insert 1 region of the sars cov-1 supplementary fig 3 available from httpwwwijmrorginarticles20201512imagesindianjmedres20201512200281471sm11pdf notably case 1 and case 2 were in close contact while travelling to india but due to the absence of the complete genome of case 2 the genetic relatedness and source of infection could not be pinpointed among the sars-cov structural proteins the spike protein has been found to elicit neutralizing antibodies24 in this study it was observed that of the five b-cell linear epitopes which were predicted four epitopes were present in the s1 domain and one in the s2 domain prediction of conformational b-cell epitopes revealed that one of these residue positions 341-505 in the spike protein incorporates two of the predicted linear epitopes 327-342 and 404-419 having good antigenicity along with a favourable ifn- response that enables differentiation and proliferation of the b-cells25 notably an equivalent epitope 347-499 is predicted for the model generated using the sars-cov-1 s protein as a template in both cases this epitope lies within the rbd6 although the epitope has two putative n-linked glycosylation sites within it at positions 330 and 332 the probability of these sites being actually glycosylated is very low a major immuno-dominant epitope has been reported from sars-cov between residues 441 and 70026 hence the predicted b-cell conformational epitope identified in the present study may play an important role in initiating a b-cell response among the five linear epitopes predicted in this study epitopes 327-342 and 1204-1219 are conserved between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-1 epitopes 243-258 404-419 and 413-428 are found to have variations the spike protein of sars-cov has also been reported to be immunogenic and elicit high ifn--specific t-cell response26 the prediction results in this study revealed that nine possible ctl epitopes possessing good antigenicity and inducing ifn- response were present in the s protein a recent report27 also predicted t-cell epitopes in the s protein based on a similar annsvm method and antigenicity score although the ifn- response was not considered by these authors it was noted that two of the predictions were found to be common among the t-cell epitopes predicted in the present study four epitopes 89-97 and 256-264 in the s1 domain and 825-833 and 1058-1066 in the s2 domain were found to have good ctl prediction scores with a broad hla allele coverage of a and b supertypes these hla supertypes being predominant in the indian population the predicted epitopes may be considered suitable for future experiments towards vaccine design to conclude the prompt intervention by the government of india and the health authorities of the state of kerala ensured that the said cases did not become secondary foci of transmission further the timely identification of sars-cov-2 in these suspected cases by the icmr-niv pune has helped in the isolation of the patients containment and enhanced surveillances for the virus and its restricted movement the availability of the genomic sequences of the identified cases will contribute to the public repositories and help towards the development of diagnostics vaccines and antivirals the sequence data would also help in tracking the virus from its origin and evolution with its transmission in time availability of data sequences are deposited in

causing upper-respiratory-tract infections in humans and other higher mammals bedford et al 2020 coronavirus outbreak has been reported three times in the 21st century namely sars in 2002 mers in 2012 and covid-19 in november 2019 the recent outbreak of covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 has emerged from china human-human transmission of this highly infectious zoonotic virus has led to exponential growth in the number of infected cases which resulted in its pandemic outbreak worldwide fahmi 2020 currently more than 225 countries are affected due to covid-19 with more than 25 million people to date which is increasing in thousands per day around the world and approximately 5 to 10 mortality rate fahmi 2020 additionally the lives of millions of people have been impacted due to mandatory lockdowns isolations and quarantines thus the severe effect of the covid-19 outbreak has imposed major challenges for global health society and economy fry 2020 currently there are no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines available for the treatment and management of covid-19 which is further making the situation difficult to handle at present preventive and supportive therapies are being implemented to prevent complications salata et al 2020 several efforts are going on to target key proteins of sars-cov-2 pathogenesis like the main protease mpro rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp rna binding n terminal domain ntd of nucleocapsid protein n protein viral ion channel e protein 2-o-ribosemethyltransferase and human angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 receptor hace-2 gao et al 2020 gupta et al 2020 khan et al 2020 sarma et al 2020 shang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 to propose or repurpose drug andor lead molecules against sars-cov-2 it would be effective to target multiple virus pathogenesis specific proteins within a close network of interaction or having dependent functionality zhou et al 2020 for drug discovery purposes the mpro of coronaviruses has been studied extensively they are papain-like proteases involved in the self-maturation and processing of viral replicase enzymes zhang et al 2020 mpro has 11 putative cleavage sites in 790 kd replicase lab indicating its predominance in the proteolytic processing of large polyprotein lab mpro from sars-cov-2 showed high sequence identity and structural similarity to that of the sars-cov mpro it contains two catalytic domains i chymotrypsin and ii picornavirus 3 c protease-like each containing six-stranded antiparallel -barrel containing active diad h41 and c145 since they have a key role in virus replication these proteases have emerged as important drug targets furthermore with their very low similarity with human proteases inhibitors of mpro are found to be very less cytotoxic anand et al 2003 zhang et al 2020 preliminary studies have suggested the potential use of protease inhibitor lopinavirritonavir commonly used drugs for human immunodeficiency virus hiv for the treatment of covid-19 patients cao et al 2020 muralidharan et al 2020 unfortunately in the open-label randomized clinical study these drugs are not found to be that impressive for covid-19 treatment additionally several other viral protease inhibitors like hcv protease inhibitor danoprevir hiv protease inhibitor darunavir are under in vivo and clinical studies for the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection dong et al 2020 to find new or repositioning existing drug molecules the understanding of sequence and structure of sars-cov- mpro in regards to various other coronavirus strains could be important their comparative understanding is enigmatic which could be important to repurpose available antiviral protease inhibitors against sars-cov-2 mpro coronavirus uses a multiprotein complex to replicate its rna based genomes cleavage of viral polyproteins orf1a and orf1b produces a set of non-structural proteins nsp of these rdrp or nsp12 catalyzes the synthesis and is known to play an important role in the replication and transcription cycle of the virus rdrp is a primary target for nucleotide analog antiviral inhibitors such as remdesivir a drug under evaluation for sars-cov2 infection in clinics gao et al 2020 imbert et al 2006 remdesivir a nucleotide analog has shown broad-spectrum antiviral activities and preclinical studies have also shown promising human safety data amirian  levy 2020 dong et al 2020 recently a report suggested that the significant inhibition of rdrp of sars-cov-2 by remdesivir and clinical studies for the same are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of this molecule in the covid-19 patients wwwclinicaltrialsgov study no nct04280705 apart from the maturation and replication the entry of this virus by binding its surface spike protein to the hace-2 is also a crucial process that can be targeted hasan et al 2020 kuhn et al 2004 shang et al 2020 since this host cell receptor is essential for the virus entry targeting hace-2 has a promise for preventing sars-cov-2 infection it has been shown that clinically approved serine protease inhibitor tmprss2 can also bind to the sars-cov-2 receptor hace-2 and inhibit viral entry hoffmann et al 2020 to date the chinese clinical trial registry has recorded around 550 trials against sars-cov-2 mostly evaluating existing drug molecules these trials include the application of antiviral favipiravir adalimumab dihydroartemisininpiperaquine leflunomide lopinavir antimalarial drugs chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine highdose vitamin c etc wwwchictrorgcnindexaspx from the available data of experimental and clinical studies it has been found that molecules targeting single protein will be ineffective antiviral lead thus to devise an effective strategy there is a need for molecules that can target multiple key proteins such as rdrp and hace-2 along with the mpro as a major drug target wu et al 2020 in silico screening of the drugs is a very vital and useful tool for rapid screening this enables to shortlist leads and thus meet the urgent demand for repurposing drugs for the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection therefore in this study we have performed a comparative analysis of the major target of sars-cov-2 mpro for its structural characteristics to other viruses from the coronoviridea family this information was further used for the virtual screening of the custom-made library of phytochemicals active ingredients present in the commonly used ayurvedic anti-tussive medicines in india and the synthetic anti-viral drugs against mpro top hit molecules from this screen were then docked against sars-cov-2 rdrp and hace2 to find the multi-target-directed molecules we believe that this study will provide a new approach and a base for the discovery of multi-targeted antiviral molecules against sars-cov-2 pathogenesis thus these compounds could be potential candidates for in vitro and in vivo anti-viral studies followed by clinical treatment of sars-cov-2 phylogenetic analysis of proteases mpro helped to understand the structural-functional variation of sars-cov-2 concerning other viruses from the coronaviridae family figure 1a this analysis suggested that the mpros from the coronaviridae family are distributed in five clusters it has been observed that these proteases are separated in different clades depending on their zoonotic sources in the clade 1 orange colour which appears to be the ancestral clade in the phylogenetic tree have sequences from porcine transmissible gastroenteritis and pandemic diarrhea coronavirus this clade appears to be evolutionary primitive to avian coronavirus but also showed coevolutionary traits in the clade 2 cyan most of the sequences are from the strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus it is then followed by clade 3 blue which mainly consists of the sequences from different strains of bat coronavirus it is also found to be the parental clade for the clade 4 red and the clade 5 green which consist of predominantly mammalian host coronaviruses it is interesting to see that the clade 4 which comprises viruses from bats and the majority of human infectious coronaviruses like sars mers and also recent sars-cov-2 our phylogenetic analysis revalidated the bat origin of the sars-cov-2 andersen et al 2020 while the clade 5 has sequences from bovine coronaviruses it also has subclades that are indicative of a distinct host range part of the clade 5 is from the bovine coronavirus and the other part is from murine coronavirus between these two subclades there is a set of sequences that forms clad 52 comprises of human coronaviruses like strain oc43 p0c6u7 and hku1 p0c6x3 which have bovine or murine as primary or intermediate host figure 1a as evident in the multiple sequence alignment supplementary figure 1 the mpro sequences from various coronaviruses strains showed very high conservation in the active site also sequences of mpro from isolates of sars-cov-2 viral strain showed high identity however the sequence variation around the active site can lead to the separation of these proteases in distinct clades depending on their hosts furthermore the sequence similarity network ssn analysis was carried out to understand the similarities in mpro sequences from viruses of the coronaviridae family it was noted that till e-value 1e-80 all the sequences were clustered together suggesting an extremely high sequence similarity amongst all the coronaviridae proteases supplementary figure 2 at e-value 1e-140 the sequences were segregated in 5 clusters figure 1b the largest cluster green consisted of sequences from bovine coronavirus murine coronavirus and some human coronavirus such as oc43 and hku1 the second cluster orange exclusively consisted of the porcine coronaviruses and related strains bat coronaviruses were grouped in a single cluster blue while cyan cluster housed avian coronaviruses the red cluster consisted of human coronaviruses including sars mers sars-cov-2 along with various other bat coronaviruses the small cluster of 2 sequences that separated from the red cluster at e-value 1e-125 also belongs to the bat coronaviruses the clusters of ssn are showing a high correlation with the clades of the phylogenetic tree figure 1a suggesting high evolutionary divergence amongst the coronaviruses depending on their host reservoir this high specificity of the variations related to the host might have resulted from the natural selection in the animal hosts before human transmission andersen et al 2020 a comparison of 49 structures of mpro from different coronavirus strains using the dali server showed five clusters similar to the phylogenetic tree figure 2a supplementary data 1 clusters 1 to 3 contains protease structures from porcine transmissible gastroenteritis and pandemic diarrhea coronavirus also they include the mpro structure from human coronavirus strains like nl63 and huk furthermore clusters 4 and 5 mostly consist of protease structures from the coronavirus strains causing respiratory infections like sars mers and sars-cov-2 the structural similarity matrix with hierarchical clustering also corroborates with the phylogenetic tree and structural cladogram showing the classification of mpro in five major clusters figure 2b these results indicate that sequence variations in the mpro are also reflected in the structural variations resulting in similar clustering at the sequence and structure level structural superimposition of representative proteases from each cluster of the structure cladogram and the similarity matrix depicted that the backbone of these proteases is conserved with rmsd less than 1  in the majority of cases figure 2c it suggests that the sequence variation leads to minor structural changes without major changes in the conformation furthermore a comparison of the substrate-binding pocket of these selected proteases shows that active site residue conformation is highly conserved figure 2d there are some variations in the binding pocket residues as shown in the multiple sequence alignment but these variations are subtle and overall binding pocket conformation is conserved structural conservation of backbone and binding pocket of mpro from various coronavirus strains suggest that substrate recognition and inhibitor binding would more or less likely to be similar in them hegyi and ziebuhr 2002 have shown the conservation in the substrate specificities and proteolytic processing of replicase polyproteins in the main proteases across coronaviruses hegyi  ziebuhr 2002 this similarity highlights the development of universal mpro assays and the design of broad-spectrum inhibitors of mpro from different coronavirus strains this also suggests that the mpro inhibitor-based drug repositioning would be the rapid and near to accurate approach to screen the drugs against sars-cov-2 infection besides structural conservation it is important to understand inter-secondary elements and inter-residue contacts within the protein to unravel the mechanism of these proteases secondary structure topology indicates that proteins are asymmetrically populated by the beta-sheets at the n- terminus and helix at c- terminus figure 3a the chord plot between pairs of secondary structural elements arc of a circle displays the number of interactions chord thickness between the corresponding elements in mpro the contacts between the secondary structural elements indicated that the majority of contacts are present in the n-terminus beta-sheets which makes the juxtaposed beta barrels connected with the loop that harbors substrate binding site whereas c-terminus globular cluster of helix showed comparatively less number of contacts indicating the rigid nature of these helix cluster involved in the protease dimerization figure 3b inter-residue contact map showed that the population of inter-residue contact is far denser in the first 200 amino acids which consist of beta barrels having the catalytic role while c-terminus residues show less number of contacts suggesting the involvement of this part of the protein globular cluster of helices in a structural role figure 3c to validate the flexibility of the beta-barrels the normal mode simulation was performed to map the root means square fluctuations of the residues from its mean position structural trajectory and the fluctuation map indicate that most of the residues present in the beta barrels have fluctuation above 1  while the c-terminus is mostly rigid with very few residues having fluctuation above 1  figure 3d and 3e though the n-terminus show high fluctuations the active sites h41 and c145 showed very less variation which is important to maintain the required conformation of these residues in the substrate-binding pocket the high frequency of inter secondary elements and residue contacts in the n terminus might provide structural flexibility for the proteolytic processing of large replicase polypeptide and they are potential sites to be targeted while designing or screening the inhibitors c li et al 2016 screening of the custom made the library of 7100 molecules comprising of different types such as flavonoids glucosinolates anti-tussive anti-influenza anti-viral terpenes terpenoids alkaloids and other know andor predicated anti-sars-cov-2 molecules was done against sars-cov-2 mpro as the main target supplementary data 2 sequence similarity search of mpro against human protein sequences was performed which suggests that the viral proteases do not have any homolog in the human thus targeting mpro will be specific to viral proteases only docking analysis results demonstrated that several phytochemicals and anti-viral have strong binding in the active site of sars-cov-2 mpro the selected molecules also displayed a high binding affinity to sars-cov-2 rdrp and hace-2 supplementary data 3 likewise mpro other viral targets considered in this study rdrp also showed that there is no human homolog present thus could be a potential viral target with mpro top molecules with the highest binding energy and with acceptable absorption distribution metabolism and excretion adme criteria were further selected for interaction analysis figure 4 to validate our docking strategy and obtained outcomes we have used a set of known or predicted anti-sars-cov-2 molecules reported from the literature wu et al 2020 for further interaction analysis we have selected the molecules with a high binding score against all the targets also we have taken into account of earlier reports that support the antiviral properties of these molecules against different viruses as one of the symptoms of covid-19 is cough a library of ayurvedic anti-tussive molecules in indian medicine 82 molecules are screened against sars-cov-2 mpro the resulting top 20 molecules were further screened against other targets- rdrp and hace 2 receptors amongst these molecules -viniferin chrysanthemin myritilin and myricitrin showed strong binding with sars-cov-2 mpro the -viniferin and myricitrin showed high solubility and bioavailability in computational adme analysis thus analyzed for intermolecular interaction with sars-cov-2 mpro -viniferin exhibited binding energy of -84 kcalmol with several non-covalent interactions in the active site and substrate-binding site thr24 and his163 form polar contact with hydroxyl groups of -viniferin while active site residue his41 shows pi-pi interaction with the central aromatic scaffold of a ligand apart from this met165 is involved in pi-sulfur interaction with ligand and other residues from the substrate-binding pocket which are involved in either attractive van der waal interaction or carbon-hydrogen bond figure 5a in addition to mpro -viniferin appeared to have a strong binding with the sars-cov-2 rdrp and hace2 receptor with a score of -83 and -84 kcalmol respectively in the case of rdrp binding pocket residues ala762 trp800 ser814 showed hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl group of the ligand while active site and other key residues namely arg553 asp618 asp623 and asp761 display pi interactions with the aromatic scaffolds of -viniferin the high density of these intermolecular non-covalent interactions is an indicator of strong and specific binding of -viniferin with rdrp active pocket furthermore hydroxyl and aromatic groups of -viniferin also interacts through polar contacts and pi-alkyl interaction with the glu35 leu39 lys68 and ala71 residues of hace-2 figure 5b and 6c the interaction of -viniferin with mpro rdrp and hace-2 suggests its high potential as a multi-target directed ligand against sars-cov-2 -viniferin is a resveratrol dimer a major stilbene produced by stressed grapevine leaves aresta et al 2003 it is also one of the major stilbenes present along with resveratrol in the red wine vitrac et al 2005 previous studies have also suggested that -viniferin shows potent antiviral activity against a variety of viruses viz rotavirus b yu et al 2018 human immunodeficiency virus hiv pflieger et al 2013 hepatitis c virus hcv lee et al 2019 another anti-tussive molecule myricitrin found to have a strong binding with the active site residues of the mpro with a binding score of -89 kcalmol active site residues his41 and cys145 form pi-alkyl and pi-sulfur interactions with the aromatic scaffold of ligand respectively tyr54 phe140 gly143 his163 and glu166 are involved in the formation of 6 hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl and carboxyl oxygen of ligand apart from this there are other additional interactions like van der waals forces that stabilize the binding of the ligand to the enzyme figure 5d myricitrin exhibited equally strong interaction with rdrp and hace-2 with a binding score of -79 and -75 kcalmol respectively for rdrp the carboxyl group of myricitrin forms two hydrogen bonds with arg553 arg555 and thr556 while the active site residue asp623 is having pi-anion interaction with the aromatic rings of the ligand similarly this ligand binds to hace-2 by forming polar interaction with ala348 phe390 arg393 and asn394 this interaction is then further stabilized by pi-stacking of phe40 and pi-anion interactions of asp350 asp382 with aromatic rings of the ligand figure 5e and f myricitrin is a glycosylated analog of myricetin present in the myrica esculenta although in our docking study myricetin has shown relatively lesser binding affinity when compared to myricitrin previous studies have shown that it possesses potent antiviral activity myricetin inhibited vp35 protein with double-stranded rna interaction in ebola virus daino et al 2018 the glycosylated myricetin ie myricitrin has been found to inhibit hiv ortega et al 2017 herpes simplex virus li et al 2020 sars coronavirus keum  jeong 2012 yu et al 2012 together our results suggest that -viniferin and myricitrin could be potent molecules for the mitigation of sars-cov-2 interestingly top anti-tussive molecules in the present study mainly -viniferin chrysanthemin myritilin and myricitrin are present in the extract of black grapes which is one of the key ingredients of ayurvedic antitussive medicines and energy and immune booster chyawanprash georgiev et al 2014 thus these medicines could be helpful in the management and mitigation of covid-19 particularly the herbal formulation and beverages containing vitis vinifera might be helpful in the management of covid-19 the tapping of natural molecule libraries to predict inhibitors of mpro showed that several active biomolecules from different medicinal plants have a strong affinity against sars-cov-2 mpro the flavonoid group of compounds showed a high binding score with all three targets suggesting this group of phytochemicals most bioactive against sars-cov-2 infection one of the molecules from this type taiwanhomoflavone a isolated from cephalotaxus wilsoniana showed a strong binding affinity with mpro -96 kcalmol in silico adme study indicated that this molecule possesses high bioavailability and likeliness to be the lead like compound interaction analysis depicted that reactive groups of taiwanhomoflavone a form of hydrogen bonds with thr199 and stabilizing forces are provided by electrostatic interaction with leu189 residue of mpro the bulkiness of this ligand leads to a large area of interaction that may lead to a higher contribution of attractive van der waals force between ligand and binding site residues figure 5g furthermore taiwanhomoflavone a also showed extremely strong binding with the rdrp and hace2 receptor with a binding score of  98 kcalmol and -78 kcalmol respectively the rdrp binding pocket residues lys621 and trp800 showed hydrogen bonds with the carboxyl group of the ligand while active site residues namely asp760 and asp761 form pi interactions with the aromatic groups of taiwanhomoflavone a in the case of hace-2 taiwanhomoflavone a makes polar contact with glu75 and pi interaction with glu35 figure 5h and i taiwanhomoflavone a has been explored for its anticarcinogenic anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic propertieskuo et al 2002 it would be interesting to consider this molecule further for anti-viral evaluation in vitro and in vivo in the terpenoids group lactucopicrin 15-oxolate a derivative of lactucin and oxalic acid showed higher interaction the lactucarium compounds are found in lactuca virosa wild lettuce and also in the latex of lactuca species the lactucopirin 15-oxolate has a binding energy of -82 kcalmol with mpro by the virtue of three hydrogen bonds to ser144 gly143 and cys145 of the active site it also showed a high binding affinity with rdrp and hace2 receptor with the binding score of -76 kcalmol and -83 kcalmol respectively figure 5j with rdrp lactucopirin 15-oxolate makes hydrogen bonds at arg553 arg555 and thr556 residues and it is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions of asp623 and thr687 figure 5k in the case of the hace2 receptor it forms three hydrogen bonds with residues ala99 tyr385 asn394 and pi-stacking interaction with phe40 figure 5l the lactucopicrin and lactucin are known for their anti-malarial activity bischoff et al 2004 based on the in silico adme studies the compound is found to be highly soluble bioavailable and high gi absorption criteria which can be utilized for further drug development against novel-sars-cov-2 apart from this biorobin pedunculagin afzelin hysperidin baicalin and other several molecules from alkaloid flavonoids and terpenoid that showed strong interaction with sars-cov-2 targets table 1 supplementary data 3 these findings highlight that the traditional medicines andor nutraceuticals along with synthetic drug molecules could be effective ways to tackle covid-19 drug re-purposing is a strategy to investigate existing drugs for new uses the advantage of repurposing is that the drugs are preclinically approved and it helps in the formulation and development of the drug in ease in this case we have used the existing anti-influenza and anti-viral drugs to study the treatment strategy for the sars-cov-2 we screened 17 compounds and found a macrocyclic derivative nympholide a a phytochemical present in the aquatic plant of nymphaeaceae family elegami et al 2003 it showed the highest binding energy with mpro and rdrp with a score of -78 and -93 kcalmol respectively mpro residues met165 glu166 leu 167 have hydrogen bond interaction with the ligand in the case of rdrp residues lys551 arg553 lys798 tyr 619 side chains have strong hydrogen bonding with the ligand and glu811 makes the pi-anion interaction which improves the binding in rdrp compared to protease the hace2 receptor has fewer interacting residues as a result shows a weaker affinity to nympholide a supplementary figure 3 a-c in the case of antiviral compounds saquinavir has the highest binding energy with mpro -9 kcalmol rdrp and hace2 targets have a binding energy of -87 and -75 kcalmol respectively saquinavir aromatic scaffold makes pi-sulfur and pi-pi stacking interaction with the met49 and his41 residues of mpro these interactions help in strong binding to protease active site and further the interaction is stabilized by hydrogen bonding of gly143 ser144 cys145 glu166 of mpro residues supplementary figure 3 d similar to protease the viral rdrp also have aromatic pi-alkyl and pi-anion interaction with arg624 and arg553 residues the hydrogen bonding of asp618 lys551 lys 621 residues of rdrp with the hydroxyl group of ligand give similar stability to protease the hace2 showed pi-pi stacking interaction of phe40 phe390 and one hydrogen bond of asn394 with the ligand supplementary figure 3e and f saquinavir has been known to inhibit the hiv-1 protease in our study the saquinavir has higher interaction with protease compared to rdrp and hace-2 stefanidou et al 2012 as there are other viral protease inhibitors like danoprevir ritonavir and lopinavir are being tested in clinical trials for potential treatment against sars-cov-2 it would be interesting to consider saquinavir for further studies cao et al 2020 this study provides a comprehensive overview of the structural characteristics of the coronaviridea proteases and their potential inhibitors phylogenetic and ssn network analysis has illustrated the divergence in the proteases depending on their host reservoir suggesting the role of natural selection of host in conditioning the virus structural comparison depicted that the high structural similarities in the backbone and substrate binding pocket indicating conservation in the substrate specificities over different strains of coronavirus asymmetrical structural flexibility in the mpro might be crucial for its activity thus it can be targeted for inhibition the structural similarity in the binding pocket assisted the prediction of repositioning of known protease inhibitors as sars-cov-2 mpro several molecules were identified as of the potent sars-cov-2 mpro inhibitors like delta -viniferin myricitrin chrysanthemin myritilin taiwanhomoflavone a lactucopicrin 15-oxalate nympholide a afzelin biorobin herperidin and phyllaemblicin b these molecules also equally showed strong binding with other targets of sars-cov-2 like rdrp and hace-2 figure 6 interestingly most of the potential lead natural molecules of our study are anti-tussive and anti-virals thus we speculate that the herbal formulation containing these bioactive phytochemicals might be applicable in the management of covid-19 these molecules could be potential lead molecules for multi-targeted drug development against sars-cov-2 the amino acid sequences of main proteases from the coronaviridae family were retrieved from the uniprotkb database wwwuniprotorg depending on their similarity with covid-19 mpro the criteria for the selection of the sequences were more than 90

prepared using available structures from pubchem kim et al 2018 similarly a library of active ingredients from the plants used in ayurvedic antitussive medicine was prepared this library was further enriched with antiviral molecules available in pubchem other databases and literature we have also included several molecules that are predicted as anti-sars-cov-2 molecules in recent reports all the

evolutionary dynamics of mers-cov potential recombination positive selection and transmission zhao zhang libing shen xun gu   by far the largest mers-cov outbreak is in saudi arabia and almost all human cases have a direct or indirect link to arabian peninsula in this study we collected 74 human mers-cov whole genome sequences from 9 countries supplementary table 1 the geographic distribution of these samples is shown in supplementary fig 1a the majority of them are from the countries in arabian peninsula 784 5874 and more than half of them are from saudi arabia 649 4874 supplementary fig 1a the peak season for mers is between april 265 and may 250 supplementary fig 1b based on the whole-genome alignment of our collected sequences supplementary table 1 we performed the phylogenetic analysis for these sequences with two sras-covs serving as the outgroup our phylogenetic tree shows that all camel and human mers-covs are clustered together the bat and hedgehog mers-covs formed a basal paraphyletic group to all camel and human mers-cov clade fig 1a a single camel mers-cov isolated in egypt gi 589588051 forms a single basal clade to human and the other camel mers-covs fig 1b the human-camel mers-cov cluster can be further divided into two cladesclade a and clade b as previously reported16 clade a contains four human strains isolated in jordan and saudi arabia while 70 human and 17 camel mers-covs are mixed in clade b there are five groups in clade b and we named them as group i to group v as the previous study15 there are 25 17 14 2 and 29 mers-cov sequences in group i to group v respectively fig 1b we performed the recombination analysis on the collected full-length mers-cov sequences we find that there are 28 of them experienced potential recombination events 304 2892 including three camel mers-covs and 25 human mers-covs supplementary table 1 we divided 28 potential recombinant sequences into seven different types and named them as type 1 to type 7 fig 1bd supplementary table 1 type 1 means the recombination happened between group ii and group v which includes 3 sequences and is about 11 of total recombinant sequences type 2 means the recombination happened between group iii and group v which includes 6 sequences 22 interestingly the mers-covs newly found in 2015 in south korea and china are type 2 recombinants1523 type 3 means the recombination happened between group i and group iii which includes 2 sequences 7 type 4 5 and 6 are the recombination happened between different genomic regions of group iv and group v which include 7 4 and 4 sequences 25 14 and 14 respectively type 7 is the recombination happened among three groups group i iv and v which includes 2 sequences 7 our phylogenetic analysis showed type 1 belongs to phylogenetic group ii while type 2 and 3 belong to phylogenetic group iii and type 4 to 7 belong to phylogenetic group v there is no recombination found in phylogenetic group i and group iv fig 1b we also reconstructed the phylogenetic tree using non-recombinant sequences only and found that its topology is consistent with the tree based on all sequences supplementary fig 2 we also performed the snp single-nucleotide polymorphisms analyses for each recombinant types and found the large recombination segments in type 2 4 6 7 are conspicuous but in type 1 3 5 are obscure supplementary fig 3 in order to explore the selection pressure on the mers-cov proteins when it transmitted from animal host to human we performed the adaptive evolution analyses for all mers-cov protein in absence of recombinant strains firstly we set camel and human mers-covs as the foreground branch and bat and hedgehog mers-covs as the background branch to preform branch-site test in codeml of paml program see fig 1a the strong positive selection is detected in spike s glycoprotein between these two branches p  0001 while there is no significant positive selection in the other mers-cov genes table 1 we find nine positive selection sites in mers-cov spike s glycoprotein and eight of them are statistically significant table 1 six significant positive selection sites are located in the receptor binding domain of s protein fig 2a we utilized a published crystal structure pdb id 4l72 in rcsb protein data bank the receptor binding domain rbd aa 367-606 fig 2b of mers-cov spike glycoprotein complexed with the human receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ddp4 to demonstrate their locations in a 3d environment fig 2b the receptor binding domain of mers-cov s protein can be further divided into a receptor-binding sub-domain and a core sub-domain two significant positive selection sites k511r and g521n are in the receptor-binding sub-domain and k511r is in direct contact with human receptor ddp4 q419s g436n d472s and r479l are in the core sub-domain moreover we also detected a positive selection site in s proteins c-terminal l775s secondly we screened the positive selection sites among human-camel mers-covs table 2 five significant positive selection sites are found in orf 8b m protein n protein and s protein table 2 two of them are located in n proteins and one of them are located in m s or open reading frame 8b orf8b respectively the mers-cov genome contains 11 open reading frames supplementary fig 1c the nucleotide substitution rate of each open reading frame and the whole-genome sequence was estimated for camel and human mers-covs table 3 the genome-wide average nucleotide substitution rate of camel and human mers-covs was 481  104 substitutions per site per year open reading frame 3 orf3 has the fastest substitution rate while orf5 has the slowest substitution rate the orf4b nucleocapsid n glycoprotein and spike s glycoprotein have a similar substitution rate which is faster than the whole-genome substitution rate in order to study the temporal and spatial pattern of mers-cov transmission a maximum clade credibility mcc tree was constructed using mers-cov whole genome sequences without recombinant strains fig 3c the ancestral host state with time reference was estimated for each tree node and marked with different colors we named six important nodes in mers-cov divergence on mcc tree for node a to f fig 3c the possible transmission time for each node and its 95 highest posterior density hpd are shown in fig 3b we found that the origin time of human-camel mers-cov is relatively late node d furthermore the tmrca for clade b is in 2012 fig 3b node f and clade a and clade b are divergent in 2011 fig 3b node e interestingly the mcc tree shows that there are six cross-species transmission events with high posterior probabilities in clade b five of them are human-to-camel transmission events and one of them are camel-to-human transmission events fig 3c additionally with the mers-cov of humancamel and bathedgehog mers-cov together we inferred the ancient mers-cov exists for decades of years fig 3bc the tmrca of the mers-covs for vespertilio superans neoromicia capensis or erinaceus europaeus can be traced back to 2006 node c 2003 node b and 1996 node a respectively before the emergence of human-camel mers-cov the estimated tmrca for all mers-covs appeared in 1996 fig 2c node a we also preformed root-to-tip analysis using the consistent dataset fig 3a and the result shows that the origin time of tmrca is in 1995 with high statistical supports r2  0874 p value  0001 together these results suggest that the ancient mers-cov should have existed for decades in animal host and got the ability to infect human or camel recently mers-cov belongs to coronavirus beta-coronavirus lineage c since it was discovered in 2012 mers-cov has attracted extensive attention due to its human-to-human infection capability and high mortality rate recombination events have been confirmed in human mers-cov23 the fact that mers-cov can be found in multiple species proposes its cross-species transmissibility456711 by far the evolutionary details of how mers-cov transmitted to human are still unknown based on the most comprehensive collection of mers-cov genome sequences so far we tried to elucidate the evolution and transmission of mers-cov among different species mers-cov has been reported in five species including european hedgehog two species of bats dromedary camel and human we used the ml method to reconstruct the whole-genome phylogenetic tree of mers-covs isolated from these species the ml tree shows that the hedgehog mers-covs are basal to all the other mers-covs and two bat mers-covs are basal to camel and human mers-covs this result suggests that the ancestor of camel and human mers-covs may be from other animal host such as the hedgehog or bat we also reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of mers-cov using nj method or based on each mers-cov protein these trees show a consistent topology which proposes that the phylogenetic relationship estimated in our study is credible supplementary fig 5 we divided clade b into five groups as pervious study to detect the recombination of mers-cov15 because the evolutionary distances among mers-covs are close table 3 no large segment recombination could be detected among them thus according to discontinuous recombination segments we defined potential recombination events in mers-covs this method has been used in the previous study to label potential recombination event24 in our study we found 28 strains form seven recombinant types which took more than 30 of all isolated mers-covs in human and camel among them we found 26 strains in six recombinant types type 1 to type 6 between two phylogenetic groups and two strains in one type type 7 among three phylogenetic groups for now the recombination of mers-cov was confirmed in previous study but no report about the recombination among more than two groups of mers-cov interestingly most recombinant types type 1 2 4 5 6 and 7 are related to group v and they make up 929 of total recombinant strains 2628 the result suggests that recombination events might happen frequently and the recombinant types involving group v might happen broadly additionally multiple recombination events indicate that double infection and super infection likely existed during the transmission history of mers-cov we failed to detect possible large recombination segments in type 1 3 and 5 by comparing the snps single-nucleotide polymorphisms of reference sequences with recombinant sequences we reckoned that specific nucleotide mutation might influence the results of recombination analysis this problem can be solved by discovering more mers-cov sequences or developing more detailed genotype classification for mers-covs in the future we also performed phylogenetic analyses for potential recombinant region and got similar results supplementary fig 3 interestingly the east asian mers-cov strains china and south korea belong to type 2 recombinant and the previous study show that their tmrca might be a result of potential recombination event23 which indicates the recombinant strains have transmitted broadly moreover one recombinant mers-cov lineage has led to the large-scale outbreak in both camel and human26 it proposes that recombinant mers-covs have experienced cross-species infection additionally our study reveals that the number of recombinant strains is large and the potential recombinant types are abundant together these findings highlight that we should take more attention to recombinant mers-cov transmission although how the mers-cov transmitted from its natural host to human is still unknown it is confirmed the mers-cov have been found in many animal hosts such as bats and hedgehog to study the evolutionary pressure on each mers-covs protein during its potential cross-species transmission we conducted a comprehensive scan for positive selection sites in mers-covs proteins recombinant strains were excluded in this analysis we set camel-human mers-covs as the foreground branch and hedgehog-bat mers-cov as the background branch and estimated the relative evolutionary pressure on the foreground branch compared to the background branch we only found that mers-covs s protein underwent strong positive selection and there are nine significant positive selection sites in s protein it suggests that s protein was under strong evolutionary pressure during the transmission from its natural host to human among significant positive selection sites six of them are located in s proteins receptor binding domain rbd rbd is crucial for virus to enter host cells and it comprises of one binding region and one core region based on the rbds 3d model we find that two sites are located in the binding region of rbd which suggests that these amino acid substitutions might change mers-covs binding capability to host cells and thus facilitate its cross-species transmission the other four sites are located in the core region of rbd these amino acid substitutions might change the structure of core region and indirectly influence mers-covs cross-species capability in order to eliminate the sample bias between humancamel group and bathedgehog group we also did random sampling for the 68 non-recombinant human and camel sequences we tried 10 20 and 50 random sampling respectively using random sampled sequences together with bat and hedgehog mers-cov sequences we performed branch-site analyses and got the same results as our aforementioned data not show we also estimated the nucleotide substitution rates of camel-human mers-covs to investigate its evolutionary dynamics after it infected camel and human our estimated nucleotide substitution rate for mers-covs whole genome is 481  104 which is slower than the previous estimation9 one explanation for the phenomenon is that we used a larger dataset than the previous study which includes all available mers-cov whole genome sequences our estimated confidence interval of the substitution rate of mers-cov genome is largely overlapped with the result from another study16 the estimated nucleotide substitution rates show that four proteins experienced the accelerated evolution through evolutionary pressure analysis we found camel-human mers-covs four proteins underwent positive selection and detected five significant positive selection sites one of them is located in m proteins there is evidence that m proteins are powerful interferon antagonist26 which proposes that the evolutionary pressure on m proteins are from hosts immune system two out of five significant sites are found in n protein which is fundamental for mers-cov self-assembly coronavirus n protein is able to bind to different host cell proteins and demonstrated to have various functions one of which is also counteracting host interferon as shown in sars-cov27282930 it is reasonable to speculate that mers-cov n protein under intensive selection because its functions were similar to those of sars-cov n protein the results above suggest that the arm race between mers-cov proteins and hosts immune system might be the main evolutionary driving force behind mers-covs adaptive evolution after it began to infect camel and human mers-cov spike s glycoprotein evolves slightly faster than the genome-wide average rate which indicates that the nucleotide substitution rate of mers-cov s protein still maintains a fast speed even after it crossed the species boundary the positive selection site we found in mers-cov s protein with site-specific test is identical to the previous studys result3 this site is located in heptad repeats 1 which is a key component in membrane fusion architecture and required for mers-cov entering host cells31 in absence of recombinant strains we performed the mcc analysis using mers-cov whole-genome sequences in order to infer the time and source species when mers-cov crossed the species boundary the topology of the mcc tree is highly congruent with that of the whole-genome phylogenetic tree we defined six nodes af to explain transmission the posterior probability for the ancestral sate of node a b or c is not very high in our mcc analysis and the 95 highest posterior density hpd of the divergence time for these three nodes is quite long so these results are weak for demonstrating the exact origin time or ancestor state of mers-cov however these estimations still provided the evidence that the ancestor mers-cov should have been infected a number of animal hosts such as bat or hedgehog for decades of years supplementary fig 4 the x-intercept tmrca in root-to-tip is 1995 with high statistical supports which is close to the estimated time of tmrca in mcc analysis this hypothesis is in agreement with the result of serological studies23 the appearance of the common ancestor of human-camel mers-cov is in 2010 and the appearance of the tmrca of clade a and b is in 2011 which are exactly the same as the previous report16 in clade b we detected five possible human-to-camel transmission events and one camel-to-human transmission event it suggests that mers-cov frequently transmitted back and forth between human and camel after it acquired the capability of infecting both hosts actually there is at least one confirmed case of camel-to-human mers-cov transmission32 in conclusion we found that potential recombination events are common in mers-covs evolutionary history and potential recombinant mers-covs can be divided into seven types the amino acid sites under positive selection in mers-cov s protein especially those in its receptor binding domain might have facilitated its cross-species transmission from animal host to human we detected the strong positive selection in four proteins of camel-human mers-covs which indicates that they probably experienced strong adaptive evolutionary pressure from hosts immune system additionally we also found six possible cross-species transmission cases between human and camel our study investigated the evolutionary dynamics of mers-cov which shall provide a basis for mers-cov control and treatment the complete genomic nucleotide

diseases d janies d pol   in the past most studies of influenza were performed on a limited number of isolates and genes suited to a particular problem major goals in science today are to understand emerging diseases in broad geographic environmental societal biological and genomic contexts synthesizing diverse information brought together by various researchers is important to find out what can be done to prevent future outbreaks jon03  thus comprehensive means to organize and analyze large amounts of diverse information are critical for example the relationships of isolates and patterns of genomic change observed in large datasets might not be consistent with hypotheses formed on partial data moreover when researchers rely on partial datasets they restrict the range of possible discoveries phylogenetics is well suited to the complex task of understanding emerging infectious disease phylogenetic analyses can test many hypotheses by comparing diverse isolates collected from various hosts environments and points in time and organizing these data into various evolutionary scenarios the products of a phylogenetic analysis are a graphical tree of ancestor-descendent relationships and an inferred summary of mutations recombination events host shifts geographic and temporal spread of the viruses however this synthesis comes at a price the cost of computation of phylogenetic analysis expands combinatorially as the number of isolates considered increases thus large datasets like those currently produced are commonly considered intractable we address this problem with synergistic development of heuristics tree search strategies and parallel computing phylogenetics is the study of the evolutionary relationships of genes and organisms thus providing a retrospective analysis of biological change and adaptation over time phylogenetic trees are represented by acyclic graphs in which the leaves of these graphs represent the observed biological entities taxa being compared eg sequences of genes genomes andor anatomy of individuals isolates or cultivars species or any higher level taxonomic unit the internal nodes of the tree are interpreted as a nested set of hypothetical evolutionary ancestors of the entities under consideration as depicted in fig 2 1 once a tree is complete changes such as mutations and host shift can be traced along branches of the tree that contain important disease causing strains this retrospective analysis of features provides means of finding mutations that are diagnostic of pathogens correlating phenotypes and genotypes and predicting strains that are important for vaccine design the classification of organisms dates back to aristotle ari343  however it was only a few decades ago that the theoretical foundations of the field of phylogenetics as it is practiced today were established the modern school of phylogenetics arose from the application of the ideas termed cladistics originally proposed by hennig hen66  cladistics lead v x w y p q fig 21  phylogenetic tree of four taxa labeled v w x and y and two hypothetical ancestors labeled p and q biologists to use shared derived similarities termed synapomorphies that distinguish various natural groups of organisms nested sets of natural groups of organisms based on synapomorphies are then used to discover the evolutionary relationships between organisms and reconstruct patterns of modification in the features of organisms subsequently these principles have been used to develop optimization techniques to find the most justifiable sets of synapomorphies in large datasets optimization techniques are necessary with most large and real world datasets as they often contain several often conflicting evolutionary signals treated below in contrast advocates of another way of thinking termed phenetics sne73  group organisms based on gross measures of similarity groups are based on measures evolutionary distance rather than the concept of shared derived characters in modern practice similarity methods espousing phenetic concepts are used in searches of nucleotide databases and some multiple alignment methods clustering algorithms in which least distant groups are clustered first and then distant clusters are connected are termed distance methods in phylogenetics distance methods typically produce a single tree and cannot on their own trace patterns of change in the features of organisms as they convert raw data to distances next we discuss how various viewpoints have influenced methods algorithms and implementations in phylogenetics a wide variety of methods have been proposed in order to infer the phylogenetic relationships of organisms most methods are based on minimizing edit cost such as a hamming distance to transform one string of nucleotides or organismal characters into another phylogenetic methods can be further classified in two different categories distance-based and character-based in this paper we compare and contrast the applications of distance and characterbased methods used in infectious disease research we illustrate applications of these technique to study the evolutionary relationships of groups of rna viruses and the patterns of mutations and phenotypic changes that can be reconstructed among the distance-based methods the most commonly used is neighbor-joining sai87  distance based methods require a precomputed multiple alignment of dna or amino acid sequences drawn from homologous genes the most similar pair of taxa as represented by sequences are clustered the clustered pair is then considered as a single taxon and the next most similar pair of taxa is clustered until only the last taxon is joined and the tree is completed although the use of distance-based methods is relatively common in analysis of organisms that cause infectious disease several authors have criticized the performance of this method for phylogenetic reconstruction see far96  one strategic flaw of the method is that it is computationally greedy distance methods form the most similar clusters instantaneously without considering locally suboptimal paths that may lead to a better global optimum other methods of phylogenetic analysis focus on characters which are typically polymorphisms recognized in columns of aligned nucleotides or amino acids from sequences of interest or investigator encoded characters of polymorphic phenotypes character-based methods seek to find the phylogenetic trees that optimize a particular criterion major optimality criteria include parsimony far83 and maximum likelihood fel73 fel81  bayesian analysis ran96 li00 hue02 uses a maximum likelihood optimality criterion but incorporates the probability termed the prior that a hypothesis is correct in the absence of data the unifying feature of character-based methods is that they examine many randomly generated trees each representing an evolutionary hypothesis of character transformations and organismal relationships as a character based analysis progresses edit costs are calculated for transformations that candidate tree imply and optimal trees are stored for further consideration and refinement the concept of optimality can be associated with cladistics or maximum likelihood but not distance methods distance techniques lack a measure of tree quality and means to compare trees cladistics employs parsimony as an optimality criterion the core concept of cladistics is that the least number of transformations in the data implies the most defensible hypothesis in cladistics various edit costs can be applied to different genomic and phenotypic transformations in the case of weighted parsimony the goal of tree search is to minimize weighted costs under the maximum likelihood criterion the probability of the data given the tree calculated with a model for nucleotide or amino acid substitution is optimized the related technique of bayesian phylogenetic inference uses maximum likelihood to evaluate trees bayesian analysis aims to capture a posterior probability distribution of trees typically the results of a bayesian analysis are displayed not as an optimal tree but rather as the probability that a set of evolutionary relationships is true given the prior probabilities the substitution model and data all character-based methods of molecular phylogenetics cladistics maximum likelihood and related bayesian methods rely on explicit assumptions about ancestral character states to polarize transformations of phenotypes and genotypes that can be reconstructed from data as an example of such assumptions in character based analyses is the outgroup criterion treated below in contrast distance based methods do not use an outgroup criterion distance based methods do not use the outgroup criterion parsimony is a widely used optimality criterion this criterion is associated with the concept that simpler explanations provide for more supportable hypotheses in phylogenetics the most parsimonious trees is that which implies the minimum number of transformations in sequence andor phenotypic character states among organisms of interest the biological justification of this use of parsimony is that descent with modification from a common ancestor is a primary pattern of organismal diversification and the record of transformations can be used to reconstruct that pattern as such the trees that minimizes the overall number of independent transformations convergences or reversals in character state that are needed to explain the observed data are to be preferred far83  recombination and horizontal gene transfer as seen among rna viruses are violation of the assumption of ancestor to descendent evolution not parsimony per se some novel techniques for discovery and understanding of reassortment and horizontal gene transfer have been developed under the parsimony criterion wan05 whe05  the parsimony score for a tree is measured based on the number of transformations implied by the tree known as the tree length far70  the tree length is the sum over all edges of the hamming distances between the labels at the endpoints of the edge ric97  the labels located at the leaves of the tree are the observed characteristics either genotypic of phenotypic of the organisms being analyzed the internal nodes are labeled in order to minimize the tree length of each tree being evaluated given a tree and a matrix of features or aligned sequences for each taxon the tree length is calculated using the fitch algorithm fit71  this algorithm works in polynomial time with the amount of data being analyzed both in the number of characters and taxa thus for a sequence alignment of thousands of taxa each of which is labeled with thousands of nucleotides the tree length of a particular tree can be computed using modern implementations of the fitch algorithm gol03 in fractions of a second given a tree and a data matrix of sequences and features the parsimony method can pinpoint the branches on which certain evolutionary events are inferred to occur between ancestor or descendent in an infectious disease context these events can be a shift by a viral lineage from animal to human host in the case of standard nucleotide sequence analysis transformation events include substitution mutations replacement of a given nucleotide by other and nucleotide insertions and deletion mutations some analyses invoke more complex parsimony models with weighted recombination and horizontal transfer events as well as differentially weighting certain classes of mutation such as transversions pyrimidine-purine shifts transitions pyrimidine-pyrimidine or purine-purine shifts or insertion-deletion events whe05  note that in using the fitch algorithm to optimize a phylogenetic tree both the tree length and the branch in which a particular transformation event is inferred to occur can be calculated in unrooted or rooted trees the results of these calculations are independent of the root chosen for the tree for example in an unrooted tree relating four taxa known from their nucleotide sequences see fig 2 2 the fitch algorithm can be used to identify a specific branch of a tree in which a transformation occurs eg a mutation between nucleotides c and t of the third sequence position occurring in the only internal edge of the tree in fig 23  however the polarity of a transformation event is dependent on how the tree is rooted inferring polarity of change requires an external criterion termed the outgroup  in character-based methods explicit assumptions of ancestral character states are set up by the investigator via the designation of at least one taxon as the outgroup a good outgroup is known to be closely related to the taxa of interest termed the ingroup however the outgroup must be clearly not a member of the ingroup the underlying logic of the outgroup criterion is that the transformation events that occurred at evolutionary origin of the ingroup can be identified by comparison to modern organisms of another clade but with which the ingroup shares a common ancestor the common ancestor is a hypothetical organism that provides a baseline set of character states from which polarity determinations can be made thus the outgroup method like bayesian inference incorporates some previous knowledge of the relationships of the organisms if the phylogenetic results show that the ingroup includes some members of the outgroup the previous knowledge must be reevaluated the outgroup taxon is included in the data matrix of the phylogenetic analysis and the entire data set is analyzed simultaneously the phylogenetic position and relationships of the outgroup are determined by the optimality criterion in the case of the parsimony method the outgroup is treated as any other taxon and is positioned in the tree in the position that minimized tree length once the phylogenetic affinities outgroup are established the outgroup can be used to root the tree and the polarities of the transformations can be established note the unidirectional arrows in fig 24  if chosen carefully the outgroup will not be clustered with any of the ingroup model based methods can also be used in reconstruction of ancestral character states eg cha00 thr04 to communicate the choice of outgroup taxon or taxa and clarify the relationships of the taxa character based trees are often drawn as directed acyclic graphs with the root positioned on the branch between the outgroup and ingroup in the example diagrammed in fig 2 4 a mutation is inferred to occur in the third sequence position from the ancestral state of c to the derived state of t the presence of a t in the third sequence position is a synapomorphy a derived character state that can be used to distinguish the members of the group formed by the taxa w and y in contrast the presence of a c in the third sequence position in taxa x and v cannot be used to distinguish these taxa since a c is also present in the third position in the outgroup in this case the third position c is a primitive similarity of x and y or a symplesiomorphy the other mutations occurring in sequence positions 2 5 and 6 are found only in one taxon and thus cannot be used to infer relationships these are termed autapomorphies sequence position 4 is inferred to have not changed in this example and is thus of no value in discovering groups in cladistics only the shared derived characteristics synapomorphies are used to diagnose a group although other criteria have been proposed to root phylogenetic trees the outgroup criterion is the least arbitrary as a result outgroup rooting is widely used for character-based phylogenetic analyses nix94  problems of the outgroup criterion as seen the use of the outgroup taxon provides an informative way test hypotheses on the content of natural groups and to root the phylogenetic tree in a way that allows interpretation of the polarity of change of evolutionary events however the choice of an outgroup taxon is key to the success of this method if the nucleotide sequences of a candidate outgroup are divergent from the sequences of the ingroup taxa the phylogenetic position of the outgroup might be hard to establish whe90  therefore the choice of the outgroup requires judicious selection and searches for organisms that 1 are safely outside the ingroup but 2 that have comparable data whe90  the cases shown in figs 21-24 are based on the simplifying assumption that the genes sequenced for the taxa of interest have equal number of residues ie amino acid or nucleotide sequences of the same length frequently in empirical studies of related organisms homologous genes have sequences with different number of residues sequence length variation occurs in both coding and noncoding loci the causes can be genetic drift mutation recombination or horizontal transfer events the phylogenetic analysis of molecular sequences like that of all other comparative data is based on schemes of putative homology that are then tested via phylogenetic analysis unlike some other data types however putative homologies in molecular data are not directly observable sequences from various organisms are often unequal in length hence the correspondences among sequence positions are not evident and some sort of procedure is required to determine which regions are homologous this procedure is typically multiple sequence alignment alignment inserts gaps to make the putatively corresponding residue line up into columns these columns characters comprise the matrix used to reconstruct cladograms the matrix is then submitted to phylogenetic analysis in the same manner as other forms of data such as morphological characters scored by an investigator thus the primary reason in phylogenetics to create an alignment has a strongly operational basis -to make it possible to submit these data to standard phylogeny programs that were designed to handle column vectors of morphological characters nevertheless alignment followed by tree search is the standard procedure two major options are currently available to analyze sequence data in a phylogenetic framework a twostep analysis or a one-step analysis phylogenetic analysis of large genomic datasets can present several nested npcomplete problems multiple alignment tree-search and in some cases gene order and complement differences among organisms just as in distance methods in most character-based methods alignments are precomputed before any phylogenetic analysis the alignment procedure is usually done through algorithms that produce a matrix from the raw dna sequences of the organisms being analyzed fig 2 5 this data set is then analyzed second step in order to find the optimal tree see sect 214 the multiple alignment procedure ranges from easy in many coding loci to very difficult in noncoding loci such as functional rnas and genes containing introns mor97  in the case of some protein coding loci the alignment may be a nonissue if there are no significant length differences in sequences however various investigators who employ different primer sets and editing styles often produce various length sequences leading and trailing gaps produced by experimental artifact should not be counted in tree length calculations results of multiple alignment of functional rnas and genes containing introns can be sensitive to parameter choices fit83  important parameters include the addition order of taxa relative costs of various classes of mutations transversions transitions insertion-deletion and differential costs applied to opening or extending regions of insertion-deletions analyses of different alignments of the same raw sequences can lead to different trees irrespective of tree search procedures mor97  in such cases investigators must search parameter space whe95 phi00 or otherwise justify their assumptions during alignment gra03 just as they are required to justify optimality criteria used during tree search several researchers have noted that performing phylogenetic analysis into two steps is not consistent with the goals of finding the most parsimonious solutions due to the interdependence of multiple alignment and tree estimation phi00 jan02  in fact popular multiple alignment programs such as clustal tho94 use a guide tree used to construct the alignment therefore methods have been proposed to make a simultaneous estimation of the optimal sequence alignment and the optimal phylogenetic tree san83  a modern implementation of the one-step concept in poy whe05  termed direct optimization allows unaligned sequence data to be analyzed without precomputing an alignment in direct optimization sequence data are aligned as various trees are built and their optimality is assessed thus for each tree considered in a search various sets of homology statements for the sequence data are considered one advantage of direct optimization is that the outgroup need not be designated by the investigator poy allows for randomization of the outgroup taxon and thus adds rigor to the search for optimal trees and homology statements in some implementations of character-based methods where prealignment is necessary the outgroup can be randomized by scripting a series of analyses eg tnt gol03  one important difference is that in molecular data a rigorous tree search with on a prealigned dataset with unordered characters should lead to the same tree length irrespective of outgroup choice whereas in direct optimization the homology statements and hence tree length can be dependent on outgroup choice several groups are developing algorithms for simultaneous estimation of alignment and phylogenetic trees methods for a one-step phylogenetic analysis have been developed using maximum likelihood tkf92 fle05 and parsimony optimality criteria whe96  as well as for bayesian analysis red05  although the one-step approach has the appeal of using a unified and epistemologically consistent method of alignment and tree estimation the time and space requirements for computation are considerable this problem of tree-based alignment is known to be np-complete wan94  in this situation genes that vary in length as most noncoding and intronic containing genes do present a huge number of possible hypothetical ancestral sequences even for a single binary tree during a phylogenetic analysis many trees will be examined and compared for s taxa and l nucleotides per taxon the cost of computation per tree ranges from sll 2 to s2l 3  depending on the heuristics applied the memory requirements scale proportional to l 3  fortunately procedures such as the optimized diagonal transition algorithms described by ukkonen ukk85 abate the space and time dependence on l the number of nucleotides whe05  phylogenetic analysis under the parsimony criterion is based on an objective function tree length tree length is used to evaluate the optimality of each phylogenetic tree considered however finding the optimal phylogenetic tree among all possible topologies is an np-hard problem fg82  that resembles the steiner tree problem the combinatorial optimization problem of phylogenetic analysis consists of finding the optimal solution from a very large number of possible trees the number of possible trees increases dramatically with the number of organisms being analyzed fel78  the number of possible unrooted phylogenetic trees t  for a given set of organisms increases following where s is the number of organisms leaves of the phylogenetic tree therefore the number of possible phylogenetic trees is extremely large even for trees with moderate number of organisms as stated above a phylogenetic analysis consists evaluating topologies in order to find the optimal solution ie the trees with the minimum length it is interesting to note that the computing time of an exhaustive evaluation of all possible trees for a fixed number of taxa will increase nearly linearly with the number of characters eg length of dna sequences because the fitch algorithm fit71 for evaluating the tree length of a particular topology works in polynomial time however the excessively large number of possible phylogenetic trees of 20 or more organisms see table 2 1 makes exhaustive evaluation of all phylogenetic trees intractable note on multiple optimal trees frequently in phylogenetic analysis based on an optimality criterion there are multiple trees that score the same minimum order of magnitude is given for the number of trees with more than 10 organisms for tree length or likelihood in the set of known optimal trees the transformations may be differentially distributed and different organismal groups may be implied therefore this set of known optimal trees must be considered equally valuable these cases represent alternative hypotheses ie phylogenetic trees that are equally supported by the available data and can be summarized through a consensus tree several kinds of techniques for consensus estimation exist the strict consensus tree is one of the most frequently used a strict consensus calculation represents a tree that has all the edges shared by all the known optimal trees see swo91 for further information on various consensus trees two algorithms can be applied to perform exhaustive searches that evaluate explicitly or implicitly all possible phylogenetic trees in order to find the optimal tree the first of these is exhaustive enumeration which computes the optimality value eg tree length of every possible phylogenetic tree and select the tree or trees with the minimal value the second method is the branch and bound algorithm hen82 that implicitly evaluates all possible trees but avoids in practice computing all possible trees see sea96  in current phylogenetic software packages eg swo02 gol03  this algorithm can be applied to data sets of up to 20 or 25 organisms and guarantees to find the optimal trees or trees for a given phylogenetic data matrix for analysis of data sets with larger number of organisms the number of trees is prohibitively large for conducting an exhaustive search in modern biology interesting data sets consider hundreds to thousands organisms thus the problem of phylogenetic tree search is compute bound and must be approached through heuristic searches in these tree searches a large number of phylogenetic trees are evaluated and the best solution is kept as known estimate of minimum tree length some early examples of heuristic tree searches include the algorithm to compute wagner trees far70  the wagner algorithm creates a phylogenetic tree of three taxa and progressively adds organisms attaching them to the branch that generates the minimal increase in tree length at that step this stepwise procedure is conducted until the last organism is added to the tree although this procedure usually results in a tree that has a suboptimal tree length in most cases this score is significantly better than that obtained with a random choice among all possible topologies as various starting points are used for building wagner trees this aspect of phylogenetic analysis can be considered a type of monte carlo randomization given one or many wagner trees the next standard heuristic refinement techniques that would be typically applied in tree search are known as branch swapping or hill-climbing procedures see sea96  this class of refinement procedures consists of performing minor rearrangements of branches in the starting tree each wagner tree is modified by pruning a subtree and reattaching it to a different branch of the remaining tree the tree length of the modified tree is then calculated if the modified tree has a shorter tree length it is kept in a buffer of new candidate trees branch swapping is applied to all wagner and candidate trees until the algorithm converges when no further rearrangements can improve the current topology the branch swapping is finished the results of the branch-swapping algorithm depend on the quality of the starting point ie wagner tree in many cases the tree resulting from the application of branch swapping to a wagner tree is a local optimum that cannot be further improved by swapping therefore multiple replicates 100s to 1000s of independent wagner trees followed by swapping are typically preformed at the end of these stages of analysis the best trees found in all the replicates are kept as a set representing topologies at the known minimum length replication of wagner builds plus swapping or random-restart hill climbing is the most widely used routine implemented in most software packages eg swo02 gol03  one major drawback of wagner builds plus swapping is that this procedure is subject to finding only local optima finding the globally optimal trees for a dataset of 20 taxa is a np-hard problem fg82  however performing multiple replicates of this procedure can provide a relative degree of confidence if the minimum length trees converge at the same tree length from numerous independent starting points gol99  replication of wagner builds plus swapping is usually efficient for data sets smaller than a hundred taxa because of advances in automated dna sequencing technology the size of modern comparative data sets far exceed the limits for which these techniques are efficient analytical tools for phylogenetic analysis large phylogenetic problems are becoming increasingly common across the life sciences due to the prevalence of high throughput nucleotide sequencing technology large data sets are of interest to biologists because they provide a rich context of phenotypes and genotypes and permit worldwide and longitudinal sampling of genomes these large phylogenetic problems will become increasingly common in the years ahead thus phylogenetic methods suited to large datasets will have important consequences not only for the study of organismal classification and evolution but also for many aspects of public health see sect 22 furthermore in a operational context strong organismal sampling has been shown to correlate with improved performance of phylogenetic methods hil96 poe98 ran98 zwi02 hil03 the dauntingly high cost of computation of large-scale phylogenetic analysis stunted this line of research however in recent years two main lines of research have provided efficient tools to analyze large phylogenetic datasets the development of new algorithms and the use of parallel computing several researchers have combined groups of algorithms into heuristic tree search strategies that have proven to be efficient for phylogenetic analyses of hundreds to thousands of organisms under the parsimony criterion these heuristic search strategies are based on basic monte carlo and hill climbing techniques with the addition of other classes of algorithms including simulated annealing gol99  data perturbation nix99  divide-and-conquer gol99 ros04  and genetic algorithms moi99 gol99  similar search strategies that combine several layers of algorithms have been employed using other optimality criteria such as maximum likelihood lew98 sal01 lem02 bra02  the judicious application of various algorithms has provided efficient solutions for the analysis of datasets of several hundreds organisms gol99 in a single cpu teh03  in particular the successive combination hill-climbing genetic and simulated annealing algorithms of tree search have produced a drastic speed up in comparison to other strategies gol99  efficient implementations of these algorithms have become recently available in software packages gol03  the need of phylogenies depicting the evolutionary relationships of datasets consisting of thousands of taxa has prompted the synergistic implementation of efficient heuristic tree search strategies and parallel computing hardware an increasing number of researchers are developing software suited for parallel computing using beowulf class clusters ste00  beowulf clusters are simply arrays of commodity pcs and switches enabled by scalable open source operating systems eg linux and message passing software eg pvm or mpi although the advantages of parallel computing in phylogenetics and multiple alignment have been clear for some time whe94  the means to exploit this potential for research gain have not been broadly and economically available until the beowulf concept was developed by the end of the 1990s alignment and tree search problems are naturally suitable for parallel computing phylogenetic researchers quickly realized the opportunity presented by beowulf computing cer98 jan01  finding an optimal phylogeny requires the evaluation of the same objective function on a large number of alternative trees because many trees can be examined concurrently and independently this has led several authors to implement phylogenetic tree searches in parallel jon95 sne00 cha01 gol02 bra02 sta02 these implementations use the parsimony and maximum likelihood optimality criteria as well as bayesian analysis researchers have also used parallelism to speedup one-step phylogenetic analysis jan01 and multiple alignment whe94 li03  originally phylogenetics was considered relevant only to taxonomic and evolutionary studies however the ability to identify conserved and divergent regions of genomes is becoming critical data for numerous disciplines in biology and medicine these fields include vascular genomics rub03  ecology sil97  physiology car94  pharmacology sea03  epidemiology ros02  developmental biology whi03  and forensics bud03  phylogenetics has even been used in successful criminal prosecution of a doctor who attempted to cause hiv infection in his former girlfriend via blood products taken from a hiv patient under his care met02  here we focus on cases in which phylogenetic analyses have helped researchers to understand the evolution and spread of infectious diseases we provide exemplar cases in which phylogenetic analyses of viral genomes have been crucial to understand complex patterns of transmission among animal and human hosts severe acute respiratory syndrome sars ksi03 and influenza web92  emergent infectious diseases often evolve via zoonosis shifts of an animal pathogen to human host in fact most category a pathogens and potential agents of bioterrorism and more than 75 of emergent diseases have zoonotic origins tay01 fra02  a typical set of tests for the hypothesis of animal host of a disease might be 1 experimentally exposing the candidate host animals with isolated viruses and ascertaining whether infection and viral shedding occurs mar04  or 2 survey populations of animals with antibodies for exposure to the virus gua03  these activities often provide model organisms for vaccine and drug development data on seroprevalance and sequence data for viruses isolated from various candidate hosts phylogenetic analysis of genomes is a complement to laboratory and survey studies with a distinct advantage with phylogenetics the researcher is not restricted to testing a single hypothesis for a specific candidate host in each experiment provided with sequence data for a diverse set of candidate hosts a researcher performing a single phylogenetic analysis makes a vast number of comparisons thus evaluating simultaneously many alternative hypotheses these hypotheses include the evaluation of pathways of transmission among several hosts and the polarity of the transmission events for example experimentalists report that small carnivores in chinese markets have been exposed to sars-cov gua03 and the virus can infect domestic cats mar04  on their own these data do not necessarily reconstruct the history of the zoonotic and genomic events that underlie the sars epidemic furthermore whether or not interspecies transmission is observed or enhanced under controlled laboratory conditions phylogenetic research is distinct as it can address whether the genomic record has evidence to support a hypothesis for a particular transmission pathway for example if phylogenetic analysis reveals multiple independent events of human to avian transmission of influenza viruses without intermediate hosts such as swine that provides a strong argument to reevaluate the hypothesis that pigs serve as mixing vessels for avian and human viruses leading to influenza epidemics sch90  in many cases host shifts occur via recombination between two ancestral pathogen genomes to produce a chimeric descendent epidemics can occur when subsequent to recombination a lineage of pathogens establishes itself in a new population of hosts vectors or reservoir species that can amplify and distribute the pathogen mor95  a host shift can require key mutations and rearrangement of the pathogen genome to infect cells of new hosts followed by adaptation to novel regulatory machinery phylogenetics can reconstruct genomic changes at the level of each nucleotide and unravel parental and descendent strains in recombination mediated host shifts wan05  influenza is a widespread respiratory disease caused by an rna virus orthomyxoviridae the influenza virus has been traditionally divided in three major types a b and c influenza viruses of type a are known from many strains that infect both mammal and avian hosts whereas the other two type are primarily known from humans influenza a is characterized by antigenic subtypes see sect 23 influenza is interesting from both epidemiological and evolutionary points of view due to the interplay between genetic changes in the viral population and the immune system of hosts ear02  there are two basic hypotheses on how influenza a viruses escape the immune response in host population to cause epidemics 1 antigenic drift meaning that random point mutations produces novel influenza strains that succeed and persist if they can infect and spread among hosts 2 antigenic shift meaning that genes derived from two or more influenza strains reassort thus creating a novel descendent genome with a constellation of genes that can infect and spread among hosts in both scenarios zoonosis is often involved in case of antigenic shift the ancestry of only a fraction of the influenza genes may be zoonotic two major classes of influenza epidemics are recognized in humans seasonal outbreaks and large-scale epidemics known as pandemics web92  seasonal influenza is a significant public health concern causing 36000 deaths and 200000 hospitalizations in the united states in an average year ger05  elderly and children account for many of these severe cases of seasonal influenza much of the population has partial immunity to seasonal influenza strains that are typically descendents of strains circulating in previous years pandemics are often caused by infection replication and transmission among the human population with influenza strains of zoonotic origin to which few people have prior immunity pandemics are rare but can affect the entire human population irrespective of an individuals predisposition to respiratory diseases in fact the 1918 pandemic disproportionately affected young adults tau06  suggesting that older adults may have had some immunity there have been three major influenza a pandemics 1918 h1n1 1957 h2n2 and 1968 h3n2 the pandemic of 1918 is estimated to have killed tens to a hundred million people worldwide and 675000 in the united states tau01  the asian flu pandemic of 1957 and the hong kong flu pandemic of 1968 were less severe but caused tens of thousands of deaths in the united states hhs04 all of these pandemic strains are thought to have originated in wild birds web92  the 1957 and 1968 strains are believed to be the results of antigenic shift however recent studies suggest that the h1n1 influenza virus that caused the pandemic of 1918 was entirely of avian origin rather than a humanavian reassortant tau05  other researchers have countered that the 1918 h1n1 strains had a more commonly accepted route to infection of human populations by reassortment in mammals gib06 ant06 pandemics can theoretically occur with any strain of influenza most influenza infections since 1968 have been attributed to influenza a h3n2 or h1n1 strains however there have been several recent reports of novel human infections from avian strains of influenza with subtypes thought to occur rarely in humans several cases of human infection of viruses of subtype h7 of avian origin have recently occurred in canada twe04 and the netherlands koo04  avian influenza of antigenic subtype h5 and h7 viruses can be found as low or high pathogenic forms depending on the severity of the illness they cause in poultry thus far influenza h9 virus has only been identified as strains with low pathogenicity lin00  alarmingly highly pathogenic strains of influenza a with an h5n1 subtype have spread rapidly among various species of birds in china southeast asia russia india the middle east africa eastern and western europe who07a  these h5n1 influenza a strains share common ancestry with the outbreak of h5n1 that lead to a massive chicken cull and six human deaths in hong kong in 1997 li04  between 2003 and september 10 2007 there have been 328 cases and 200 deaths among humans who07b  there are several instances of h5n1 infection of felids and swine in asia there is scant evidence of human-to-human transmission in thailand ung05 and indonesia yan 2007  if lethality to human cases of h5n1 drops the virus might spread rapidly and without being detected many predict an upcoming avian influenza pandemic of devastating human and economic costs in the united states alone it is projected that 15-35 of the population will be affected and the costs could range from 716 to 1665 billion united states us dollars ger05  although vaccine production can in theory be modified to include h5n1 strains dut05  the genomes of interest are moving targets it remains unknown whether the descendents of the contemporary h5n1 virus will achieve efficient human-to-human transmission and if this will occur via incremental mutations or a more punctuated reassortment mediated change thus phylogenetics is a key technology to track the evolution of h5n1 and compare those changes to genomic and zoonotic events that underlie pandemics the viruses of influenza type a are classified as various subtypes that represent differences in the antigenic reaction of two key glycoproteins hemagglutinin ha and neuraminidase na these proteins reside on the surface of the virion these proteins play key roles in recognition and infection of susceptible hosts ha and viral replication na these surface proteins are primary antigens recognized by the host immune system web92  the subtypes of influenza a are labeled according to the reaction of standard monoclonal antibodies to these ha and na proteins provided by the us centers for disease control to laboratories participating in the world health organizations who surveillance program hhsb  although this number will soon expand there are currently 16 different antigenic subtypes recognized for ha labeled from h1 to h16 and 9 different antigenic subtypes of na from n1 to n9 thus a subtype of influenza virus type a is labeled with the number associated with ha and na proteins eg the most common subtype found in humans h3n2 since 1948 influenza viruses have been the focus of a coordinated surveillance program organized by the who who05  the hemagglutinin gene ha is the major target of the influenza surveillance this program helps track predominant strains to inform the development of new vaccines influenza viruses are sampled worldwide through the national influenza centers located in 54 countries who05  many of the viral isolates sampled by these programs are sequenced for the hemagglutinin gene although there has been an increasing interest in sampling complete influenza genomes ghe05 obe06  an extensive record of hemagglutinin sequences of the influenza viruses type a isolated since 1902 are publicly available these data provide a unique set of challenges and opportunities for phylogenetics the geographically wide and temporally long sampling of viral isolates provides an unprecedented opportunity to study evolutionary patterns underlying the spread and host range of an infectious disease however as described earlier large datasets present an enormous search space of possible evolutionary scenarios to be evaluated the availability of nucleotide sequences of influenza viruses has triggered numerous research groups to attempt reconstruction of the phylogenetic history of these viruses eg bus99 yua02 fer03 bus04  these groups draw on data from currently circulating strains as well as from historically important strains gathered from archival tissue samples examples of archival tissues that have provided date of interest to the 1918 epidemic include lung biopsies of deceased soldiers victims frozen in alaskan permafrost tau97  and waterfowl collected for the smithsonian in 1916-1917 fan02  phylogenetic analysis of seasonal influenza sequence data has been used to classify nucleotide substitution mutations in many codons of the ha gene mutations that produce a change in protein sequence are more frequent than those that do not bu99  this finding indicates that selective pressures imposed by the immune system of the hosts can drive the evolution of some codons of ha thus an evolutionary perspective can illuminate functional studies of infectious disease ear02  as noted phylogenetics have been widely used to understand history of influenza epidemics host shifts as well as evolutionary interactions with the hosts immune system see sect 231 however most phylogenetic analyses of influenza thus far have used only fractions of the dataset of influenza nucleotide sequences in the public domain the sequences in the public domain are largely ha but recently whole genomes have been produced the institute for genomic research tigr is rapidly sequencing and releasing into the public domain thousands of influenza genomes under the microbial sequencing center msc program sponsored by the national institute of allergy and infectious disease niaid ghe05  st jude childrens research hospital in memphis has contributed a significant increase in the number of avian influenza genomes sequences obe06  most existing phylogenetic analyses of influenza have focused on the phylogenetic relationships of particular subgroups of influenza type a such as the h5n1 subtype eg li04  or the h3n2 subtype eg bus99  these analysis have provided useful information but have depicted a disjoint picture of the evolution of the major lineages of influenza in contrast other studies have attempted broader subtype scope however they included a single viral isolate as an exemplar of each subtype suz02  this study failed to include an extensive sampling of strains poor strain sampling can have a negative impact on the performance of phylogenetic methods see sect 215 and does not test whether the subtypes are natural groups ie monophyletic a very recent study has used whole genomes of 136 isolates drawn from a variety of avian influenza subtypes obe06  here we show results of a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis based on hemagglutinin dna sequences of 2359 viral isolates these sequences include representatives of the 16 different subtypes of the hemagglutinin protein of influenza type a recorded worldwide by the world health organization surveillance program the analyzed viruses were isolated as early as 1902 from tissues of patients who died during the 1918 spanish flu epidemic to recently sequenced isolates from the 2004 seasonal flu and h5n1 outbreak the analyzed dna sequences also implies a broad range of host organisms including multiple species of wild and domestic birds humans swine horses felids and whales an inclusive phylogenetic analysis with a large number of taxa require the use of efficient tree search strategies see sect 215 and the use of multiple computers dedicated to the phylogenetic analysis the cost of computation is tied primarily to the number of strains not nucleotides thus the inclusion of whole genomes does not contribute significantly to the compute bound nature of phylogenetic analysis however the inclusion of whole genome data does increase memory demands this 2359 isolate dataset was analyzed with a parallelization of the tree search strategy implemented in a recently developed software for parsimony analysis gol03  the results of this analysis are used here to illustrate two new uses longitudinal analyses of patterns of zoonotic transmission and assessment of surveillance quality our results on the relationships of ha subtypes shown in fig 26 has similarities with the results of suzuki and nei suz02  including the clades h8 h12 h9 h15 h7 h10 h4 h14 h3 and h2 h5 h1 h6 however the position of h13 and h11 differ in our trees due to our inclusion of h16 moreover the relationship of these clades to one another differs in our assessments our tree has a staircase shape with h8 h12 h9 basal most whereas suzuki and neis suz02 tree has a symmetrical shape with no clear basal group influenza a viruses from wild aquatic birds have been identified as the source of influenza viruses isolated from birds of the order galliformes eg turkeys grouse quails pheasants domestic chickens and their ancestral stock the jungle fowl web92  direct human infection by avian strains of influenza a is considered rare lip04  after the discovery of receptors for both avian fig 26  phylogeny of hemagglutinin ha sequences representing 2358 isolates of influenza a with a single sequence of influenza b as outgroup to summarize the source tree we have condensed each subtype clade into a single branch the numbers of isolates included in the full tree are presented as the numerals above each branch the numerals below each branch represent jackknife support values 0 worst to 100 best sequence and character data was drawn from genbank wwwncbinlmnihgov and the influenza sequence database wwwflulanlgov and mammalian strains of influenza in the trachea of pigs it has been hypothesized that domestic swine act as intermediate hosts in which human and avian viruses can recombine sch90  this mechanistic hypothesis of viral transmission is widespread however as discussed above a number of events of suspected direct transmission of avian influenza viruses to humans have been reported lip04 ung05  hypotheses on the relative frequency of host shifts can be made on a phylogenetic tree through the optimization fit71 of a character with states representing various hosts of the viral isolates under consideration see sect 221 we performed this analysis on our tree of 2359 ha sequences and found that most of the internal nodes close to the root are optimized as having an avian origin fig 27  thus the results of this analysis are consistent with the hypothesis of an avian origin of all influenza type a viruses web92  these results also show that most major lineages of influenza a that infect domestic birds originated in aquatic birds this is compatible with the hypothesis that wild aquatic birds as the natural reservoir of influenza viruses of type a web92  however the pattern of host shifts resulting from our study of 2359 ha sequences seems to be much more complex than previously thought gam90 lip04  for instance in many cases after the spread of influenza type a viruses into domestic bird and mammal populations including humans some derived lineages are later spread again to aquatic birds furthermore the results indicate that direct shifts from avian to human hosts have occurred 18-27 times independently in different lineages without observed intermediate hosts it must be noted that the possibility of an intermediate host in avian-to-human transmission events cannot be completely rejected it is possible that an intermediate host existed in nature but it was not sampled by the surveillance program and therefore not included in the analysis however based on the available evidence it seems that host shifts from birds to humans have been frequent in the evolutionary history of influenza type a moreover avian-to-human shifts are more common than swine to human shifts in the history of influenza multiple direct avian-to-human shifts appear to occur in the case of the putative pandemic strains of influenza a subtype h5n1 that have spread across eurasia since 1997 who05  in addition to being highly pathogenic these h5n1 strains have independently infected other hosts such as felids and pigs in several instances phylogenetics is practiced by most as a historical science however several researchers noted that aspects of the tree shape may be used in predicting future genetic lineages of influenza against which it is important to design vaccines gre04  notable among these assertions are the studies in the shape of influenza a phylogeny as viewed through the hemagglutinin ha gene fig 27  two character optimizations on the for hemagglutinin ha sequences representing 2358 isolates of influenza a with an influenza b outgroup at the root the top tree has an optimization of the character ha antigenic subtype the lower tree depicts optimization of the character host character data was drawn from genbank wwwncbinlmnihgov and the influenza sequence database wwwflulanlgov optimizations and tree graphics were made with mesquite wwwmesquiteprojectorg for better visualization contact the authors for files in scalable pdf format bus99 fer02  the ha gene codes for a surface glycoprotein of the virion responsible for binding to sialic acid on host cell surface receptors at a genomic level lineages of influenza are constantly changing due to mutation that occurs at high rates in rna viruses extinction of evolutionary lineages of viruses to which hosts have become immune or when susceptible hosts are in short supply is common gre04  this process of constant replacement of influenza lineages produces a characteristic coniferous shape to a phylogeny reconstructed from ha sequences bus99  the conifer metaphor refers to the hypothesis that influenza ha is constantly changing but there is limited diversity at any time fer02  thus an influenza ha tree appears to be formed by addition of strains to the apex of the trees trunk that contains the contemporary infectious viruses rather than more basal presumably extinct lineages to which hosts are immune other groups of researchers have used the assumption that there is limited influenza a diversity at any one time to downplay the utility of phylogenetic approaches plo02  as an alternative to phylogenetics which they consider difficult these groups make predictions based on size of various clusters of related isolates termed swarms plo02  several groups whether using trees or swarms have identified putatively dominant strains of influenza to predict the genetic makeup of future viral populations plo02 bus99  if these assumptions were never violated the diversity of a previous years flu season could be assessed forthcoming strains predicted and thus used to inform vaccine design in practice the cdc uses a mixture of viral strains comprised of h1n1 and h3n2 of influenza a and an influenza b virus pal06  notably the h5n1 strain or any of the other avian strains with potential to infect humans is currently not considered in the vaccine that is seasonally administered to civilians in the united states the ability to predict influenza viral strains that will affect human and animal populations is important however prediction methods and experimental designs that are relevant to those methods are in their infancy current surveillance programs are focused on detection of antigenically novel strains as such surveillance programs are not designed as ecological experiments to quantitatively measure strain-specific incidence and cluster size furthermore the current sample of influenza diversity may be biased by partial genomic sequencing differences in effort within various geographic and political boundaries focus on certain subtypes of interest and differential efforts over time due to variable public concern recent papers using whole genome data have indicated that the conifer like growth assumption of habased phylogenies that has been central to predictive models of h3n2 seasonal influenza bus99 fer02 may be violated full genome analysis of h3n2 has shown that there are multiple co-circulating lineages some of which may be overlooked by vaccine designs hol05 ghe05  similarly our large scaleanalysis of 2359 ha sequences depicts that many subtypes and lineages within subtypes of influenza are circulating and being exchanged among human and animal populations at any one time fig 2 7 in addition to providing hypotheses on the relationships of a group of organisms phylogenetic trees imply a temporal order of the successive internal nodes ie the time at which a single evolutionary lineage splits producing two independent descendent lineages minimal estimates on the date at which these evolutionary splits occur can be obtained through the analysis of the time at which the descendant organisms leaves are known to occur these estimates can be computed with the implementation of an irreversible sankoff character in which the cost of transformation between two character states represents the amount of time elapsed between the time of appearance of two terminal taxa pn01  influenza a viral sequences are named with the host locale and year in which each isolate was sampled by the surveillance program several methods exist to measure the correlation between the temporal dates of sampled organisms and the relative order they show in the phylogenetic tree here we adapt the manhattan stratigraphic metric msm to influenza surveillance the msm was originally developed to assess the quality of the fossil record pn01 table 2 2 however the msm is simply a quantitative measure of how well the available data reflects the diversification pattern of the taxa present in the optimal phylogenetic trees and is thus of general utility an extensive sampling of sequences such as the one gathered for the study of 2359 isolates is critical to comparatively assess quality of surveillance in various regions among various strains and over periods of time our results show that this correlation between branching pattern and dates of viral isolation is good in that it significantly differs from a random expectation this is true over the entire tree as well as when some individual lineages are measured however the relative quality of surveillance differs markedly between lineages one example of differential surveillance quality occurs in two closely related groups of avian influenza of h5 hemagglutinin subtype one group in this example contains the highly pathogenic h5n1 strains that currently circulate in eurasia the middle east and africa this large clade has been the focus of intense surveillance since the discovery of widespread infection among wild and domestic birds and some avian-to-human transmission yua02 ung05  the h5n1 viral isolates form a sister clade to h5n2 known from domestic and wild bird in the americas h5n2 the number of available hemagglutinin sequences of h5n2 comprise less than one fifth of the number of ha sequences for h5n1 this in itself represents a measure of the surveillance intensity devoted to these two groups of avian influenza however even if the number of sequences is normalized at 100 sequences to perform the msm test the surveillance quality of the h5n1 clade is far superior to the h5n2 clade we can also use visualization techniques to assess surveillance quality typically branches of a phylogenetic tree are scaled used to depict the number of mutations or other character changes assigned to each branch however we have adapted this use of branch scaling to reflect the number of years that have passed between sampling of related isolates rather than mutations or characters compare fig 2 8 which has short branch lengths reflecting good surveillance quality with fig 2 9 which has long branch lengths implying poor surveillance quality cases in which there is poor correlation between the date of sampling of a given isolate and its inferred date of origin would indicate that the surveillance program is failing to closely monitor the persistence of diverse lineages of influenza 29 no matter the type of phylogenetic perspective they may espouse most virologists produce the same basic data by surveying putative host animals and patients with antibodies then isolating and sequencing partial or whole genomes of various viruses detected in hosts molecular phylogenetic analyses of the nucleotide or inferred amino acid sequence data from various viral isolates can then be used to reconstruct the history of the transmission events the virus among hosts the fundamental belief associated with this research program is that the branching pattern of the phylogeny will reveal a temporal series of transformations when character of interest such as the host is optimized on the viral phylogeny most virology researchers rely on distance methods the most popular distance method among virologists is neighbor-joining nj sai87  distance methods require a precomputed multiple alignment of dna or amino acid sequences drawn from homologous genes of the viral strains of interest then in nj the most grossly similar pair of isolates as represented by sequences are clustered the clustered pair is then considered as a single taxon and the next most similar pair of taxa is to cluster until only two taxa remain and are joined in distance methods no outgroups are proposed and no assumptions of ancestral character states are considered as a result polarity of transformations can only be inferred as from dissimilar to similar distance methods output a single unrooted star-shaped graph nevertheless preparing figures some investigators who use distance methods choose to impart directionality by selecting an edge of the graph to serve as a root of the tree the choice of root is crucial in depicting the polarity of host shifts and depicting clades the rooting step has been executed variably by researchers comparing sequence data from covs isolated from humans with sequence data covs isolated from small carnivores in the case of guan et al fig 1a  rooted on a clade comprised of two sars-cov isolates one from human and the other from a carnivor  son05 their fig 1b  and in a regression analysis a date for a common ancestor of sars-cov isolated from humans is calculated using a human basal group son05 their fig 3  in papers comparing sequence data from sars-like cov recently isolated from bats to that from humans and small carnivores lau et al lau05 do not root their trees their fig 2 and li et al li05 and force the root position on their drawing such that one of the bat sequences is ancestral their fig s4 of the supplemental material thus although all these studies employ distance methods the researchers use various often facultative means to infer the animal origins of sars-cov other methods of phylogenetic analysis focus on characters states edit costs for changes among states outgroup assumptions and polarity of change among states -rather than gross similarity in the case of distance methods characters can be polymorphisms recognized in columns of aligned nucleotides or amino acids from sequences of interest or phenotypic states such as host date of isolation or antigenic subtype another feature of most character based methods that differs from nj is that character based methods examine many randomly generated trees each representing an evolutionary hypothesis of character transformations and organismal relationships thus the concepts of optimality and hypothesis testing are tightly associated with cladistic and maximum likelihood inference optimal trees represent more defensible hypotheses moreover character based methods of molecular phylogenetics rely on explicit choices of outgroup to make assumptions about ancestral character states and thus polarize transformations of phenotypes and genotypes that can be reconstructed from data in order to make an explicit assumption of ancestral character states the investigator designates at least one taxon as the outgroup the outgroup method originated in cladistics wat81 and has become central to the phylogenetic inference nix94  if chosen carefully the outgroup estimates baseline character states in sequence and phenotypes such that transformations such as host shifts can be reliably inferred to illustrate the choice of outgroup taxon or taxa and clarify the relationships of the organisms character based trees are often rooted from the outgroup and ingroup just as in distance methods in most character-based methods sequence data is aligned before the phylogenetic analysis novel implementations termed direct optimization allow unaligned sequence data to be analyzed without precomputing an alignment wheeler whe96  in direct optimization sequence data are aligned as various trees are built and their optimality is assessed using maximum likelihood and cladistic optimality criteria as specified by the investigator thus for each tree a specific alignment that is optimal for that tree is constructed one additional advantage of direct optimization is that the outgroup need not be designated by the investigator but rather randomized during the search for optimal trees and alignments in some implementations of character based methods where prealignment is necessary the outgroup can be randomized by scripting a series of analyses outgroup randomization enables analyses of taxa where previous knowledge of ingroupoutgroup relationships is lacking or is among the hypotheses the investigator wants to test via tree search large-scale phylogenetic analyses are particularly useful to study global problems of infectious disease however phylogenetic analysis of large number of organisms and whole genomes is an extremely challenging computational problem recent advances in heuristic tree search algorithms alignment methods and parallel computing strategies have been successful these advances have pushed upward the limits of taxon sampling considered tractable large data sets analysis is interesting not only because it presents interesting computational challenges moreover large dataset analysis is leading to new knowledge about natural phenomena for example in the recent past researchers working on small datasets argued that influenza had limited diversity at any one time and that this should allow us to predict which strains are important for vaccine design on the contrary with large datasets we find that there are multiple co-circulating lineages at any one time thus large datasets and means to analyze them are important for future vaccine design character-based approaches to phylogenetics provide a wide variety of tools that can be used to better understand the evolutionary processes underlying the spread of infectious diseases we have discussed here only some of the wide array of applications that phylogenetics and outgroup criteria can have on genomic studies of infectious disease we look forward to the continued synergistic development of technological and scientific means to better understand infectious and zoonotic disease  an update on the

 here we aimed to update the origin of sarscov2 by systematic phylogenetic classification and spike glycoprotein s protein amino acid sequences fulllength protein sequences of s protein were downloaded from the ncbi genbank database including eleven wild type sarscov2 accession number qiq22760 qhs34546 qhr84449 qhz00379 qic53204 qho62877 qhd434161 qia98554 qik50417 qik50438 and qiq08790 sarscov accession number aap134411 merscov accession number afs889361 batsarslikecov slcov accession number avp78042 and avp7831 bat rhinolophus affinis covratg13 accession number qhr633002 malayan pangolin manis javanica derived cov accession number qia48641 qia48614 qiq54048 qia48632 and qia486231 and representative viruses of the coronavirinae subfamily cov cov cov and cov

 for phylogenetic analysis the full length s protein sequences of 11 countries sarscov2 were compared with sarscov merscov batcov ratg13 pangolincov batslcov and previously published representative viruses of the coronavirinae subfamily sequences by blastexplorer program that uses the neighborjoining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates

 the resulting dendrograms were used to verify previously proposed genera assignments and identify areas for clarification alignment of rbd and olinked glycan residues sequences between sarscov2 strains ratg13 pangolincov batslcov and sarscov were analyzed by mega10

 efforts to identify the reservoir of human cov led to the discovery of diverse cov which are genetically close related for the first time we have constructed an s protein sequencebased phylogenetic tree with all the known coronavirinae subfamily viruses for the betterment of understanding of current sarscov2 clustering and classified them into genera    and  cov to crosscheck the proximal to sarscov2 we had chosen wild type human cov spike protein sequence to compare with all species of cov along with recently documented closest cov ratg13 and pangolincov figure 1 the protein sequences were nearly identical across the s protein of eleven isolates with sequence identity above 9970 indicative of a very recent emergence into the human population and justification here why we selected those 11 isolates than mutated and variant strains being updated globally the phylogenetic analysis result showed that eleven sarscov2 isolates were closely clustered to inner joint neighbor ratg13 9741 pangolins carried cov 9222 identity and batslcov 8036 identity all these together form a new clade 2 in lineage b of  cov and 2003 emerged sarscov urbani forms clade 1 the cov s protein is an envelope glycoprotein that plays the most important role in viral attachment fusion and entry into host cells and serves as a major target for the development of neutralizing antibodies inhibitors of viral entry and vaccines sarscov2s protein 1273aa contains two functional domains such as receptor binding domain rbd 223aa sequence 319541 aa and glycoprotein domain 609aa sequence 6621270 aa

 five and four of these six residues differ between sarscov 2 vs ratg13 and pangolincov respectively whereas a pangolincov project id prjna573298 had 100 66 residues similar to sarscov2 suggesting there are differences among pangolincov and 50 36 similarity were seen between ratg13 and pangolincov figure 2a another notable feature of sarscov2 is a prra insertion compared to ratg13 and only prr to pangolincov in a polybasic cleavage site this polybasic cleavage site in s2 glycoprotein 681to 684 has a role in determining viral infectivity and host range the functional consequence of the polybasic cleavage site in sarscov2 is unknown and it will be important to determine its impact on transmissibility and pathogenesis in animal models besides olinked glycans to s673 t678 and s686 which side the cleavage site of sarscov2 and compared to ratg13 and pangolincov only serine ser in pangolin and both threonine thr and serine ser olinked glycans were seen in ratg13 between the olinked glycans pangolin had varied aa sequences compared to ratg13 figure 2b and the structural difference of ace2 contact residues and olinked glycan among sarscov are shown in table 1 cov are enveloped have a nonsegmented positivesense rna genome ranging from 26 to 32kilo bases in length

 although the sarscov2 epidemic was linked to the wuhan seafood market huang et al
26
 reported a total of 41 patients and 14 cases are not related to the seafood market and no trace of bats has been found so exact place of origin need to be studied in detail

 subsequently zhou et al

 from wuhan institute of virology zheng li shi lab showed that sarscov2 was highly similar throughout the genome to ratg13 with an overall genome sequence identity of 962 and 931 nucleotide identity to s protein also the author did not mention when it has been sequenced and rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp data not shown to compare sarscov2

 ratg13 was isolated from the bat rhinolophus affinis on 24 july 2013 by zheng li shi group and the reason unclear why they did not submit the sequence before instead on 27 january 2020 although it is proximal to batslcov accession number avp780421 avp780311 and acu310511 figure s3 sarscov rs8062006 accession number acu310511 already has proven for intraspecies diversity and its implications for the origin of sars coronaviruses in humans

 however li et al
31
 concluded that the human sarscov2 virus did not come directly from pangolins based on a unique peptide prra insertion seen in the human sarscov2 virus and not in pangolins carried cov
32
 also a study demonstrated sarscov2 is not a purposefully manipulated virus based on highaffinity binding to human ace2 polybasic cleavage site and the three adjacent predicted olinked glycans are unique to sarscov2 and were not previously seen in lineage b cov

 hence we compared ratg13 and pangolincov with sarscov2 for an update and betterment of understanding rbd of s protein in sarscov2 binds strongly to human pangolin and bat angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors

 indicated that other than pangolins and snakes turtles may act as the potential intermediate hosts transmitting sarscov2 to humans based on the key amino acid interaction between rbd and ace2 choudhury et al

 showed sarscov2 is close to batcov strongly binds with ace2 receptor protein from both human and bat origin and tlr4 is most likely to be involved in recognizing molecular patterns from sarscov2 to induce inflammatory responses li et al
39
 demonstrated that sarscov2s entire rbm was introduced through recombination with cov from pangolins possibly a critical step in the evolution of sarscov2s ability to infect humans a study data support the natural origin of sarscov2 likely derived from bats possibly transferred to pangolins before spreading to man and it not artificial cov including the chimeric slshc014ma15
40
 the study proposes a unique cleavage motif promoting sarscov2 infection in humans may be under strong selective pressure given that replication in permissive veroe6 cells leads to the loss of this adaptive function

 overall we demonstrate the key residues of rbd 455 486 493 494 501 and 505 and polybasic cleavage sites varies significantly need to be studied in detail for a better understanding of crossspecies transmission pubmed search results showed only three bat rhinolophus affinis and five pangolin cov sequences were available and more cov isolation need to verify the origin of ratg13 although ratg13 and pangolinderived cov is very proximal to sarscov2 the key receptor binding and olinked glycan residues vary significantly except a malayan pangolin prjna573298 isolate has 100 identity the polybasic cleavage site prra insertion was absent in ratg13 and pangolin prjna573298 whereas it is only prr in other pangolin isolates with unique amino acid changes within thus animal study isolation of cov from pangolin manis javanica and bat rhinolophus affinis is necessary to help in the understanding of sarscov2 origin and intermediate transmission the authors declare that there are no conflict of interests jm contributed to the conceptualization study design critical review of the content and approved the final version of the manuscript sa contributed to study design data analysis and approved the final version of the manuscript km contributed to data analysis and approved the final version of the manuscript ggr contributed to data analysis and approved the final version of the manuscript  predicting the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 utilizing capability as the receptor of sars-cov-2 ye qiu yuan-bo zhao qiong wang jin-yan li zhi-jian zhou ce-heng liao xing-yi ge   the aa sequences of ace2s of homo sapiens human rhinolophus sinicus chinese horseshoe bat paguma larvata civet sus scrofa swine and mus musculus mouse were downloaded from uniprot knowledgebase the rest of 248 vertebrate species were downloaded from genbank file s1 multiple sequence alignment was performed for the whole aa sequences of aces using mafft with a local alignment strategy fft-ns-2 the phylogenetic tree was constructed by mega7 using the neighbour-joining nj method with 1000 bootstrap replicates and visualized using figtree the critical aa sites for the utilization by sars-cov-2 were selected by picking the unique aa residues in mouse ace2 which distinct from human ace2 and the sites reported to be critical for the receptor binding of sars-cov in the previous study 14 the initial mark for every ace2 was 100 and the substitution on each critical sites resulted in a reduction of its mark of 50 for substitutions reported to abolish the receptor binding of sars-cov or 10 for other substitutions the utilizing capability by sars-cov-2 of the ace2s were ranked by the final scores and ace2s with scores 50 were considered to be potentially utilized by sars-cov-2 to evaluate the homology of ace2s in different species we built a phylogenetic tree haboring ace2s of 253 vertebrate species fig s1 the tree was branched to two major groups the first group included the classes of mammalia aves and reprilia and the second group included the classes of amphibian chondrichthyes and teleostomi this tree indicated that besides mammalia ace2s of aves and reprilia were more likely to be utilized by sars-cov-2 than other vertebrates as shown in fig 1
 among mammals human ace2 was clustered with bat civet and swine ace2s but not mouse ace2 matching the previous report about the utilizing capability by sars-cov-2 of these ace2s intriguingly cat pangolin cow and goat ace2s were also clustered with human ace2 considering the widespread of stray cats wildlife markets and stock farms it was not strange that these animals could serve as potential intermediate hosts of sars-cov-2 indeed it was reported in the local news that sars-cov-2 was detected in pangolins though further verification is required we further tried to predict the receptor utilizing capability by sars-cov-2 via looking into the critical single aa polymorphism in different ace2s we screened the aa sites critical for sars-cov-2 utilization by two approaches first it has been proved that human chinese horseshoe bats civet and swine ace2s can be utilized by sars-cov-2 but mouse ace2 cannot 6 we aligned the aa sequence of these five ace2s file s2 eleven aa residues distinct in mouse ace2 but conserved in other ace2s were identified which were t20 y83 s218 a246 k353 p426 t593 n636 a714 r716 and a774 however according to the complex structure of human ace2 and the receptor binding domain rbd in sars-cov-2 s protein pdb id 6vw1 only three of the eleven sites are located near the interface and potentially mediate the binding which were t20 y83 and k353 fig 2
a second sars-cov-2 shares an identity of 746 with sars-cov in the aa sequences of their rbds and thus the aa residues critical for the receptor binding of sars-cov may be also critical for sars-cov-2 according to the previous study such critical sites include k31 y41 k68 y83 k353 d355 r357 and m383 14 among these sites k31d y41a y83f k353 had d355a and r357a abolish or strongly inhibit sars-cov binding while the substitutions on k68 and m383 slightly inhibit sars-cov binding 1415 combining the two screening we got nine critical aa sites as shown in fig 2b based on these sites we established a marking system to evaluate the utilizing capability by sars-cov-2 of different ace2s in the system the initial score for every ace2 was 100 and substitution on the critical sites would result in reduction of 50 marks for k31d y41a y83f k353 had d355a and r357a or 10 marks for other substitutions k31t and y41h would not reduce the scores since these two substitutions exist in civet and chinese horseshoe bat ace2s respectively fig 2b a final score less than 0 was adjusted to 0 as the result a final score equal to or less than 50 means that the ace2 contains either at least one substitution that will abolish the receptor binding or at least five other substitutions that will make it quite different from human ace2 therefore the ace2s with final scores higher than 50 were considered to be potentially utilized by sars-cov-2 while those with scores less or equal to 50 were unlikely to be utilized by sars-cov-2 the final scores for all ace2s we analysed were listed in table s1 as shown in table 1
 excluding the animals unlikely contacted by people pangolin cat cow buffalo goat and sheep ace2 were ranked as the top mammals that could be potentially used by sars-cov-2 while murine ace2s such as mouse and rat ace2s got the lowest scores as for birds pigeon ace2 reached the highest score of 70 table 1 though birds are not natural reserviors for currently know species of betacoronavirus the classification of coronaviruses is based on the genome feature not the host range and thus we could not exclude the possibility that new betacoronavirus may infect birds considering pigeons are food in many places around the world more attention should be paid on the non-mammalian hosts of sars-cov-2 ace2 of protobothrops mucrosquamatus pallas pit viper a common snake got a score of 20 indicating that reprilia ace2s were unlikely to be utilized by sars-cov-2 to verify the robustness of our ranking system we labelled the utilizing capability of different ace2s on the phylogenetic tree and found that the ace2s confirmed or potential to be utilized by sars-cov-2 labelled with circles were obviously clustered from those unlikely to be utilized by sars-cov-2 labelled with triangles fig 1 the well matching with the phylogenetic tree elevated the liability of this marking system in summary we combined phylogenetic analysis and critical site marking to predict the utilizing capability of ace2s from different animal species by sars-cov-2 the results from these two analysis matched each other quite well indicating relative reliability of our prediction we have shown that besides currently confirmed ace2s utilized by sars-cov-2 pangolin cat cow buffalo goat sheep and pigeon ace2s might be utilized by sars-cov-2 indicating potential interspecies transmission of the virus from bats to these animals and among these animals considering the widespread existing of these animals some of them might serve as intermediate hosts for sars-cov-2 which called for the attention in disease control however these are still preliminary results predicted by sequence analysis which cannot accurately reflect the infection in the animals and more laboratory and epidemiological investigation are required to uncover the true intermediate hosts of sars-cov-2 the authors declare no competing interests  quantification of intra-host genomic diversity of sars-cov-2 allows a high-resolution characterization of viral evolution and reveals functionally convergent variants daniele ramazzotti fabrizio angaroni davide maspero carlo gambacorti-passerini marco antoniotti alex graudenzi rocco piazza  a global cross-discipline effort is ongoing to characterize the evolution of sars-cov-2 virus and generate reliable epidemiological models of its diffusion to this end phylogenomic approaches leverage accumulating genomic mutations as barcodes to track the evolutionary history of the virus and can benefit from the surge of sequences deposited in public databases yet such methods typically rely on consensus sequences representing the dominant virus lineage whereas a complex sublineage architecture is often observed within single hosts furthermore most approaches do not account for variants accumulation processes and might produce inaccurate results in condition of limited sampling as witnessed in most countries affected by the epidemics we introduce verso viral evolution reconstruction a new comprehensive framework for the characterization of viral evolution and transmission from sequencing data of viral genomes our approach accounts for accumulation of clonal mutations and uncertainty in the data by taking advantage of the achievements of research in cancer evolution to deliver robust phylogenomic lineage models and exploits intra-host variant frequency profiles to characterize the sublineage similarity among samples which may derive from uncovered infection events the application of our approach to rna-sequencing data of 162 sars-cov-2 samples generates a high-resolution model of evolution and spread which improves recent findings on viral types and highlights the existence of patterns of co-occurrence of minor variants revealing likely infection paths among hosts harboring the same viral lineage the in-depth analysis of the mutational landscape of sars-cov-2 confirms a statistically significant increase of genomic diversity in time and identifies a number of variants that are transiting from minor to clonal state in the population we also show that standard phylogenetic methods can produce unreliable results when handling datasets with noise and sampling limitations as proven by the further application of verso to 12419 consensus sequences included in gisaid database notably verso allows to pinpoint minor variants that might be positively or negatively selected across distinct lineages thus driving the design of treatments and vaccines in particular minor variant g29039au detected in multiple viral lineages and validated on independent samples shows that sars-cov-2 can lose its main nucleocapsid immunogenic epitopes raising concerns about the effectiveness of vaccines targeting the c-terminus of this protein finally we here release the likely sars-cov-2 ancestral genome obtained by resolving ambiguous snps that distinguish two widely-used reference genomes from human samples by employing the pangolin-cov and the bat-cov-ratg13 genomes our results show that the joint application of our framework and data-driven epidemiological models might allow to deliver a high-resolution platform for pathogen surveillance and analysis  the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid- 19  which started in late 2019 in wuhan china 1 2 and was declared pandemic by the world health organization is fueling the publication of an increasing number of studies aimed at exploiting the information provided by the viral genome of sars-cov-2 virus to identify its proximal origin characterize the mode and timing of its evolution as well as to define descriptive and predictive models of geographical spread and evaluate the related clinical impact 3 4 5  as a matter of fact the mutations that rapidly accumulate in the viral genome 6 can be used as natural barcodes to track the evolution of the virus and accordingly unravel the viral infection network 7 8  at the time of this writing numerous independent laboratories around the world are isolating and sequencing sars-cov-2 samples and depositing them on public databases eg gisaid 9  whose data are accessible via the nextstrain portal 10  such data can be employed to estimate models from genomic epidemiology and may serve for instance to estimate the proportion of undetected infected people by uncovering cryptic transmissions as well as to predict likely trends in the number of infected hospitalized dead and recovered people 11 12  most studies typically employ standard phylogenomics approaches that roughly compare consensus sequences representing the dominant virus lineage within each infected host and rely on some measure of genetic distance among samples 13 14  however while such analyses are undoubtedly effective in unraveling the main patterns of evolution of the viral genome at least two issues can be raised first most methods are missing key information on intra-host minor variants which can be retrieved from wholegenome deep sequencing raw data 15  in our opinion this information might be essential to produce high-resolution models of the sars-cov-2 evolution and accordingly of the likely transmission chain second most approaches do not explicitly model the processes of accumulation of clonal variants in the population and do not account for uncertainty in the data due to eg sequencing artifacts 16  for these reasons they can produce unreliable results when processing data collected on a short timescale and with significant sampling limitations as it has occurred for most countries during the epidemics 17 18  we here introduce a novel framework to overcome these issues the analysis of intra-host genomic diversity enhances the characterization of viral evolution due to the high replication and mutation rates of rna viruses populations of distinct viral sublineages also known as viral quasispecies 19  can often coexist within the same host as shown by studies on numerous diseases 20 21 22 15 8 23  in particular most intra-host minor variants have no functional effect follow a neutral evolutionary dynamics and often involve mutational hotspots 24  certain variants instead can be positively selected as a result of the strong immunologic pressure within human hosts 25  furthermore the mechanisms of transmission of minor variants in the population are still elusive and depend on the combination of sublineage clonality virulence and contact dynamics which results in the presence of bottlenecks founder effects and stochastic fluctuations 26 22  the complex architecture of viral sublineages observed in infected individuals is the result of this complex and undeciphered interplay in particular it was recently shown that an unexpected high number of intra-hosts variants is observed in sars-cov-2 genomes a proportion of which are detected in distinct hosts 27 28  in this regard the analysis of variant frequency profiles retrieved from raw sequencing data allows to overcome the limitations of approaches based on consensus sequences which on the one hand do not consider intra-host minor variants and on the other hand might erroneously call certain minor variants as clonal according to arbitrary frequency thresholds moreover such analysis allows to examine three important phenomena see fig 1a and suppl fig 1  1 patterns of co-occurrence of minor variants in hosts infected by the same viral lineage ie displaying the same clonal variants might indicate the possible presence of a transmission path in which at least a portion of viral sublineages has been transferred from an individual to another during the infection accordingly one can hypothesize that hosts sharing a significant proportion of identical minor variants might be at smaller evolutionary distance than hosts sharing clonal variants only see fig 1a  2 homoplasies ie minor variants observed in hosts infected by different viral lineages ie displaying distinct clonal variants might have emerged after the infection because either positively selected in a parallelconvergent evolution scenario or neutral but falling in error-prone regions of the genome see suppl fig 1a  3 variants that are detected with low frequency in certain individuals and as clonal in others might indicate the existence of selection shifts andor of founder effects involving specific sublineages during infection events distance s1 s2 s3 s5 s6 s7 s8 s9 s10 s11 s12 s13 s14 s4 s15 c l2 l3 l1 in particular all hosts share the same clonal mutation uc green but two of them 2 and 3 are characterized by a distinct minor mutation au red which randomly emerged in host 2 and was transferred to host 3 during the infection standard sequencing experiments return an identical consensus rna sequence for all samples by employing a threshold on variant frequency vf and by selecting mutations characterizing the dominant lineage b by analyzing identical sequences and not considering any constraint on variant accumulation standard phylogenetic algorithms cannot disentangle any ordering or evolutionary relation among hosts infected by the same viral lineage and can return uncertain ordering among lineages furthermore false positives can confound the analysis c verso is a new framework for the characterization of viral evolution which processes vf profiles from raw sequencing data in step 1 verso returns a phylogenomic lineage tree on binarized profiles of clonal variants vf  90 by relying on a probabilistic framework and assuming variant accumulation see methods the output tree model describes viral genotypes or lineages associated with clusters of samples whereas edges represent mutation accumulating from reference genome in step 2 verso computes a refined genomic distance among hosts on vf profiles which is employed with clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques to project and visualize samples on a 2d space representing the sublineage composition and the distance among hosts also allowing to identify possible intra-lineage transmission paths homoplasies can be investigated to pinpoint positively selected variants or mutational hotspots two related questions arise can the characterization of intra-host genomic diversity i improve the resolution of transmission chain maps and ii be used to identify positively and negatively selected variants and variants undergoing transition to clonality lessons from cancer evolution to reduce the impact of noise and sampling limitations the process of diffusion of variants in the population is driven by the complex interplay between genomic evolution of the virus within hosts and transmission among hosts even if the discussion on the topology of viral evolution is ongoing 29  it is reasonable to assume that clonal mutations ie with a variant frequency close to 100 are likely transferred from a host to another during an infection event while as specified above the extent of transmission of intra-host minor variants is still uncertain we notice also that while multiple infections of the same host from distinct viral lineages might in principle affect variant clonality their occurrence is extremely rare however some of the most widely-used phylogenomic methods such as mrbayes 30  beast 31 and augur 10 used for the analyses in nextstrain rely on distance-based or parsimony algorithms and do not include any explicit constraint on the process of variants accumulation furthermore most techniques do not typically account for noisy observations which can derive eg from sequencing issues or from biological variability even though in optimal sampling conditions and in a timescale adequate to cover the whole evolutionary history of a virus such methods are expected to produce reliable results current circumstances have highlighted extremely partial and inhomogeneous samplings both in geographical and temporal terms in several countries worldwide 18  in such cases the simple genetic distance among hosts might not reflect the temporal ordering among mutational events and accordingly may induce erroneous inferences on the infection chain see fig 1b and suppl fig 1b-c  notice also that some of the aforementioned approaches integrate genomic and clinical data such as collection dates to better estimate temporal orderings among samples 31  unfortunately however collection dates may be scarcely correlated with the date of contagion or with the onset of the disease this aspect is intensified in covid-19 for which the incubation period is typically long symptoms onset occurs within 115 days for 975 of infected persons ci 82 to 156 days 32  and for which the ratio of asymptomatic infected individuals is extremely high 33  all these aspects may impact the reliability of downstream contact-tracing algorithms 34  in order to reduce the impact of noise and sampling limitations on the accuracy of predictions it may be effective to employ methods that account for accumulation processes and uncertainty in the data in this regard many computational methods have been developed for the analysis of somatic cancer evolution and intra-tumor heterogeneity from sequencing data and may be relevant alternatives in the context of viral evolution due to the many analogies and to the similar data types 35 36 37 38  some early work on the topic 39  in particular proved that methods accounting for mutation accumulation outperform standard distance-based phylogenetic models when a complex polyclonal architecture and conditions of limited samplings are observed as it is expected in viral evolution and transmission scenarios a further question arises can methods accounting for mutation accumulation and uncertainty in the data be used to reduce the impact of sampling limitations and produce more reliable phylogenomic models to answer the questions above in the following we first introduce the verso viral evolution reconstruction framework for viral evolution and sublineage characterization see fig 1c  which is further detailed in the methods section we then present the detailed analysis of 162 sars-cov-2 samples from multiple studies for which at the time of writing raw illumina sequencing data are available in public databases also discussing the definition and release of the likely sars-cov-2 ancestral genome in detail we provide both the phylogenomic lineage tree and the sublineage characterization of samples which allows to identify likely transmission paths also among individuals infected by the same viral lineage we then provide an in-depth analysis of the mutational landscape of both clonal and minor variants also identifying variants undergoing transition to clonality as well as a number of mutations shared across distinct lineages and which might be positively selected in particular we identify mutation g29039au which is responsible for the nucleocapsid variant plys256 and might be of particular interest because it abrogates the vast majority of the b and t bona fide antigenic epitopes of the target protein we finally show the phylogenomic lineage tree reconstructed by our method on a large cohort comprising 12419 gisaid consensus sequences verso a new framework for the characterization of viral evolution and transmission we introduce verso viral evolution reconstruction a new framework for the inference of high-resolution models of viral evolution from raw sequencing data of viral genomes see fig 1c  our framework introduces several major novelties a verso employs a probabilistic approach that models the process of accumulation of clonal variants following infection events and explicitly accounts for uncertainty in the data due to technical noise and biological variability accordingly it delivers robust phylogenomic models of viral evolution also in conditions of severe sampling limitations 17  such models can be then employed in downstream analyses for instance by improving the estimation of molecular clocks and accordingly the predictive accuracy of epidemiological models which typically rely on limited and inhomogeneous data 11 18  b verso exploits the information on intra-host variant frequencies to characterize the sublineage composition of samples and to define a highly refined genomic distance among hosts more in detail by employing methods for dimensionality reduction and clustering originally employed in single-cell analyses 40  verso first allows to reconstruct and visualize likely infection chains among hosts harboring the same viral lineage while this is prevented to methods that process consensus sequences moreover verso improves the quantification of the genomic diversity in a given host or in a given group of samples based on sublineage composition and heterogeneity also allowing to identify variants undergoing selection shifts or being possibly affected by founder effects during transmission finally our framework allows to investigate homoplasies ie variants detected in independent viral lineages 29 and which may result from functional convergent evolution as well as to isolate specific regions of the viral genome under purifying selection see suppl fig 1a  this information might be then used to drive the design of opportune treatmentsvaccines for instance by blacklisting positively selected genomic regions and prioritizing target loci exposed to purifying selection reference genome since different reference genomes have been employed in the analysis of sars-cov-2 we here selected as candidate references two high-quality genome sequences from human samples sequence epiisl405839 downloaded from gisaid ref 1 in the following used eg in 43 and sequence epiisl402125 ref 2 in the following employed in several studies on sars-cov-2 eg 3  the sequence comparison highlighted the presence of 5 snps at locations in order to disambiguate the conflicting snps we here employed the bat-cov-ratg13 genome 1 sequence epiisl402131 and the pangolin-cov genome 4 sequence epiisl410721 which both display haplotype ucucu at locations 8782 9561 15607 28144 and 29095 accordingly we generated the reference genome sars-cov-2-anc which most likely represents the ancestral sars-cov-2 genome preceding both ref table 1  whereas in suppl fig 2 the geo-temporal localization of samples via microreact 44 is displayed even though as expected the vf profiles of minor variants are noisy a complex sublineage architecture is observed in several individuals moreover patterns of co-occurrence of minor variants across samples support the hypothesis of transmission of at least a portion of sublineages from a host to another as well as the presence of homoplasies the phylogenomic lineage tree was reconstructed by applying step 1 of verso to the 19 variants detected as clonal vf  90 in at least 2 of the samples the model describes the presence of 11 viral genotypes or lineages l1-11 which display the same set of clonal mutations and are associated to different clusters of samples  fig 2a  see methods notably data are extremely consistent with the perfect phylogeny assumptions only 1 clonal variant in 1 sample shows a possible violation see methods we then applied step 2 of verso to the complete vf profiles of the samples associated with the lineages with the largest size  10 samples and projected the sublineage composition and the genomic distance among samples on the umap low-dimensional space see methods such maps describe the likely transmission paths among hosts characterized by the same viral lineage and which would not be identifiable by processing consensus sequences only see fig 2b  more in detail variant g29095uc mapped on orf n synonymous is the earliest evolutionary event from reference genome sars-cov-2-anc and is present in all 162 samples of the dataset the related viral lineage l1 which displays no further mutations identifies a cluster including 3 chinese and 1 american samples two principal clades originate from lineage l1 and correspond to previously identified sars-cov-2 types in 14 41  in particular both lineage l1 and the left clade of our model lineage l2 are characterized by the absence of snvs g8782uc and g28144cu and correspond to type a 14 also type s 41  which was hypothesized to be a early sars-cov-2 type lineage l2 is characterized by three private snvs g17747cu orf1ab p5828pl g17858ag orf1ab p5865yc and g18060cu orf1ab synonymous and includes 41 samples from usa the right major clade -which includes lineages l3-11 -is characterized by the presence of both snvs g8782uc orf1ab synonymous and g28144cu orf1ab p84sl and corresponds to type b 14 also type l 41  l3 includes all remaining chinese samples among which also sample srr10971381 epiisl402125 which was employed as reference genome in several studies 3  plus several samples from other countries usa cambodia germany and nepal lineage l4 includes samples from usa canada and israel whereas lineages l5-11 are associated with american samples only consistently with our model the b l type appear to be more abundant in the population 1045312229  85 of the samples on gisaid database 9  update may 7th 2020 and was diffused especially in the early stages of the epidemic in wuhan 41  we also note that considering the actual shortage of clinical data on sars-cov-2  patients associated to genomic sequences there are insufficient elements to support any epidemiological claim on virulence and pathogenicity of the distinct sars-cov-2 types even if very recent evidences would suggest the existence of a low correlation 45  the analysis of the sublineage composition of the lineages characterized by the largest sample size ie l2 l3 l7 and l9 fig 2b  allows to uncover distinct intra-lineage clusters which identify samples with similar vf profiles on all variants as well as the possible links among clusters as determined by the k-nearest neighbors graph see methods this result would suggest that the inherently complex sublineage architecture of samples as well as possible infection paths may be obfuscated in a consensus sequences analysis or in an analysis that only considers clonal variants for instance with respect to lineage l3 a cluster including 6 very early samples from china is identified with links connecting to a distinct cluster with subsequent samples from china germany and cambodia as a further example one can notice that within lineage l7 two distinct clusters clusters 0 and 3 include single samples with a significantly antecedent collection date namely samples srr11621844 and srr11621931 and which one might suppose to be early spreaders for that cluster this high-resolution representation of the sublineage composition of individuals and of the likely within-lineage transmission paths is a major novelty introduced by verso and might pave the way for improved genomic-based contact tracing algorithms standard methods for phylogenomic inference appear to struggle in the analysis of this dataset in suppl fig 3 we show the phylogenetic model returned by nextstrain-augur on 133 of 162 samples of dataset 1 for which high-quality consensus sequences are currently available in gisaid database whereas in suppl fig 4 we display a heatmap showing the distance among samples returned by the method as compared with that returned by verso since there is no ground-truth to be used as benchmark in the evaluation of the phylogenetic tree inference we here compared the capability of the methods in grouping samples in homogeneous and stable clusters in particular we employed an heuristic based on the amount of the variance explained by each principal component as computed on the distance matrix returned by nextstrain-augur to determine the optimal number of clusters which in this case is 8 and compared the results with the clustering executed via verso interestingly the normalized mutual information among the two partitionings shows a value of 059 proving that the two approaches produce significantly different results in addition the average silhouette coefficient for nextstrain-augur clustering is 041 whereas for verso is 073 thus demonstrating a significantly higher stability for the latter method all in all these results would suggest that verso is able to partition samples in highly stable clusters as opposed to standard distance-based methods such as nextstrain-augur which provide more uncertain assignments to samples often violating the accumulation hypothesis this might likely derive from the sampling limitations of currently available datasets and show that in such cases methods that explicitly account for mutation accumulation might be more appropriate to reconstruct reliable models of viral evolution and transmission mutational landscape of clonal and minor variants the comparison of the number of clonal vf  90 and minor variants detected in each host fig 3a  reveals a bimodal distribution of clonal variants 1st mode  4 2nd mode  10 median 9 max 15 apparently related to the two major clades of the phylogenomic lineage tree see above whereas minor variants display a more dispersed long-tailed distribution median 3 max 44 from the plot it is also clear that individuals characterized by the same viral lineage may display a significantly different number of minor variants with distinct distributions observed across lineages importantly the comparison of the distribution of the number of variants obtained by grouping the samples with respect to collection week  fig 3b -c allows to highlight a statistically significant increasing trend for clonal variants mann-kendall test for trend on median number of clonal variants p  0008 this result would strongly support both the hypotheses of accumulation of clonal variants in the population and that of a concurrent increase of overall genomic diversity of sars-cov-2 46 27  whereas the relevance of this phenomenon on minor variants is more uncertain we then focused on the properties of the snvs detected in the cohort surprisingly the distribution of the median vf for each detected variants fig 3d nonsynonimous whereas the large majority of remaining variants are synonimous the mapping on sars-cov-2 orf of variants detected in  2 of the samples is shown in fig 2a  these results would suggest that in most cases randomly emerging sars-cov-2 minor variants tend to remain at a low frequency in the population whereas in some circumstances certain variants can undergo frequency increases and even become clonal due to uncovered mixed transmission events or to selection shifts as it was observed in 8 for the case of h3n2 and h1n12009 influenzas this result is further confirmed by analyzing the data included in gisaid database 9  in fact 115 of 489 always minor variants detected in our dataset are found as clonal in at least one sample included in gisaid database 9 update may 7th 2020 interestingly several variants classified as always minor are found in a relatively high number of distinct lineages identified by the phylogenomic analysis see above and might indicate the presence of either mutational hotspots or homoplasies in this respect the heatmap in fig 3f returns the distribution of snvs in vf bins grouped according to the number of lineages in which they are found on the one hand one might suppose that variants that are detected in single lineages left region of the scatterplot either are randomly emerged private mutations or the result of intra-cluster infection events see above on the other hand snvs found in multiple lineages right region of the scatterplot may either be positively selected in a parallelconvergent evolution scenario or recurrent neutral mutations due eg to mutational hotspots as expected lineage-specific variants are the most abundant and also display a larger dispersion and higher values of median vf variants detected in multiple lineages instead display significantly lower vf values and can be found in a maximum of 1011 lineages a variant in particular g29039au n p256k nonsense is found in significant abundance in 26162 samples and in 711 lineages median vf  0099 max vf  025 and was further investigated as it might suggest the presence of functional convergence this mutation is present at subclonal level in 26162 samples of our study cohort with a median intra-host variant frequency of 0099 and is also confirmed in dataset prjna6079 the locus of the g29039au mutation is particularly complex with the mutated nucleotide being the center of symmetry of a perfect 19bp palindromic hairpin sequence notably in many samples the presence of a large number of supplementary reads suggests that this hairpin region may be also a hotspot for more complex rearrangements likely occurring through rdrp mediated template switching suppl fig 5  the functional effect of these rearrangements is the generation of a stop codon in the linker region similarly to what observed for g29039au studies done on sars-cov nucleocapsid n protein allowed to identify two non-interacting structural domains one n-terminal known as the rna-binding domain rbd and one c-terminal known as the dimerization domain dd 47  rbd and dd domains are separated by a disordered region playing a putative role as a flexible linker the rbd directly interacts with the viral single-stranded rna generating the ribonucleoprotein core while the c-terminal dd domain is responsible for protein dimerization although its functional role is yet unknown a comparison between the n protein of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 reveals a percent identity and similarity of 905 and 941 respectively suppl fig 6  indicating that the two n proteins share a very similar structural organization recently a set of putative sars-cov-2 b-and t-immunogenic peptides were identified by homology to those experimentally defined in sars-cov 48 49  interestingly the majority of the immunogenic epitopes of the nucleocapsid protein 13 out of 18 are located in the c-terminus of the protein in the linker region and dd domain and right after lysine 256 see fig 4  suppl table 2  in this context the identification of a subloclonal nonsense variant such as the p256k occurring before the c-terminus of the sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid is particularly intriguing because it suggests that the mutation may have been selected in order to mask one of the most immunogenic viral regions 48 49 under the selective pressure of the host immune response indeed several studies demonstrated that antibodies raised against the n protein upon sars-cov infection are abundantly expressed 50  albeit short-lived 51  in contrast t cell-mediated immune responses can provide long-term protection after sars-cov infection 52 53 51  in line with these data sequence homology and bioinformatic approaches indicate that the nucleocapsid together with the spike protein are among the most promising targets for dna vaccine development 54  not surprisingly vaccines for both proteins have been already developed for sars 55  in this context the identification of a subclonal nonsense variant occurring in patients samples and suppressing the expression of the immunogenic nucleocapsid dd domain may suggest a potentially limited effectiveness of veccines targeting this region for at least two reasons i because resistant subclones such as the g29039au variant are already present in the wild probably owing to the natural selective pressure exerted by the host immune system and ii because the dd domain could be non-essential for the survival and infectiousness of the virus as opposite to the rbd and therefore it could be easily lost upon exposure to the selective pressure raised by the vaccine we finally specify that currently available data do not allow to assess the vf distribution of g29039au in the population because for the large majority of samples in public databases only consensus sequences are available to this extent we stress that once a larger amount of raw sequencing data on sars-cov-2 would be available one will be able to quantitatively assess the possible increase of frequency of minor variants in the population as this might be used to evaluate the presence of selection-driven shifts verso phylogenomic lineage tree of 12419 gisaid samples dataset 2 we finally applied verso to the 12419 high-quality samples available on gisaid database on may 7th 2020 by aligning consensus sequences to sars-cov-2-anc reference genome with augur pipeline and calling clonal variants in unambiguous locations ambiguous locations are set as na details on dataset 2 are provided in methods section the phylogenomic lineage tree returned by verso is displayed in fig 5a and reveals the presence of 17 viral lineages and the corresponding clusters of samples see suppl fig 7 for the complete mutational profile of all samples as raw sequencing data are not available in gisaid database step 2 of the verso pipeline could not be performed remarkably this model is consistent with the analysis made on 162 samples of dataset 1 and discussed above fig  1  despite minor differences due to the only partially overlapping composition of the cohorts specifically all lineages present in both models display the same variants accumulation ordering moreover as previously shown the two major clades that characterize both models correspond to as and bl sars-cov-2 major types 14 41  noteworthy a specific lineage is inferred as hidden ie with no attached samples in the analysis of dataset 1 whereas it includes a significant number of samples in the analysis of dataset 2 lineage l14 in fig 5  with g25563gt as characterizing variant this proves that verso is effective in handling sampling limitation issues of false positives equal to 73 and which significantly deviates from the average value of the dataset  073 one could speculate that such snv may be involved in a violation of the perfect phylogenetic constraints due to eg convergent evolution by looking at the geo-temporal localization of samples obtained via microreact 44 fig 5b-c  one can see that the different lineages are distributed across the world in distinct complex patterns suggesting that most countries have suffered from multiple infections especially in the early phases of the outbreak as confirmed also in 14  the country showing most cases is usa which currently includes 3899 samples distributed in all 17 lineages but with lineage l2 and l16 accounting together for 65 of the samples 381 samples from china are included in the dataset and are distributed in 7 distinct lineages with l1 and l3 the most abundant 33 and 55 of the samples respectively these two lineages represent the early samples differentiating types as and bl and are consistently most observed in china with lineage l3 being the more abundant we finally note that the average silhouette coefficient as computed on sample clusters see above is 098 for verso and 035 for the model returned by nexstrain-augur on the same dataset confirming also in this case the significantly greater robustness of clustering assignments of our approach  we have shown that by considering both clonal and intra-host minor variants and by explicitly accounting for the mutation accumulation process it is possible to highly improve the resolution of the phylogenomic analysis of the sars-cov-2 evolution and reduce the impact of sampling limitations this may represent a paradigm shift in the analysis of viral genomes and should be quickly implemented in combination to data-driven epidemiological models to deliver a high-precision platform for pathogen detection and surveillance 12 56  this might be particularly relevant for countries which suffered outbreaks of exceptional proportions such as usa brazil spain and italy and for which the limitations and inhomogeneity of diagnostic tests have proved insufficient to define reliable descriptivepredictive models of disease evolution and spread for instance it was hypothesized that the rapid diffusion of covid-19 might be likely due to the extremely high number of untested asymptomatic hosts 33  a better estimation of undetected infected hosts can be derived from high-resolution phylogenomic analyses of tested individuals also in conditions of severe sampling limitations we have also shown that the analysis of intra-host minor variants can produce experimental hypotheses with translational relevance and which might drive the design of treatment or vaccines for instance variant g29039au was found to suppress the vast majority of the b and t epitopes of the highly immunogenic nucleocapsid protein while leaving its entire rna binding domain intact it is therefore tempting to speculate that this subclonal event may be the result of the selection pressure exerted by the host immune system against the virus and may raise an alert on the development of vaccines specifically targeting the highly immunogenic c-terminal region of the nucleocapsid protein we finally recall that we release as suppl file 1 the sequence sars-cov-2-anc which likely represents the ancestral sars-cov-2 genome after spillover and which might allow to improve the resolution and accuracy of phylogenomic analyses thus enhancing the understanding of sars-cov-2 evolution methods verso computational framework verso is a new framework for the reconstruction of viral evolution models from raw sequencing data of viral genomes verso includes a two-step procedure which takes advantage of the many achievements of research in cancer evolution and in sequencing data analysis step 1 in the first step verso employs an evolved version of the algorithm introduced in 57 for the reconstruction of models of cancer evolution from single-cell mutational profiles in order to identify the phylogenomic lineage tree of viral evolution our probabilistic framework solves a boolean matrix factorization problem with perfect phylogenetic constraints thus assuming a consistent process of accumulation of clonal variants in the population and accounts for uncertainty in the data by employing a maximum likelihood approach via mcmc search that allows for the presence of false positives false negatives and missing data points see the si for further details in particular the method takes as input a binary mutational profile matrix as defined on clonal mutations only an entry in a given sample is equal to 1 present if the vf is larger than a certain threshold in our case equal to 90 it is equal to 0 if lower than a distinct threshold in this case equal to 5 and is considered as missing na in the other cases thus modeling possible uncertainty in sequencing data we recall that the accumulation hypothesis holds only when considering clonal mutations which are most likely transmitted from a host to another during the infection whereas this might not be the case with variants with lower frequency due to bottlenecks founder effects and stochasticity see below the inference returns a set of maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees minimum 1 depicting the variants as sampled during the mcmc search accordingly such trees provide a set of maximum likelihood attachments of samples to variants which in turn can be used to estimate a similarity measure between samples namely by counting how many times pairs of samples are attached to the same variant verso then performs hierarchical clustering of samples on such similarity measure by selecting the optimal number of clusters via standard heuristics see parameter settings we notice that in case only 1 unique maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree is found during the inference the unique maximum likelihood attachment of samples to variants can directly be used for clustering in the verso output model each node correspond to a viral genotype or lineage whereas edges model parental relations which stand for major evolutionary events and are characterized by one or more accumulating variants each viral lineage is associated to a cluster of samples via the procedure described above as shown in 57 in a different experimental context our algorithmic framework ensures robustness and scalability also in case of high rates of errors and missing data due for instance to sampling limitations finally verso allows to visualize the geo-temporal localization of clusters via microreact 44  we note that violations to perfect phylogeny constraints are possible due eg to the emergence of manifold mutations at single locations or to multiple infections of the same host yet they are unlikely when considering clonal variants only in any case verso allows to identify clonal variants that display significant deviations from the expected error rates of the dataset thus indicating likely violations of the accumulation hypothesis in particular given the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree and the related attachments of samples to variants verso can estimate the variants theoretically expected in each sample and subsuming the accumulation hypothesis hence by comparing the theoretical observations with input data verso can estimate the rate of false positives ie variants that are observed in the data but are not predicted by verso and false negatives ie variants that are not observed but predicted variants that show a particularly high level of estimated error rates represent possible violations of perfect phylogeny constraints eg due to convergent evolution since by construction no ordering is possible among individual infected by the same viral lineage when considering clonal variants only verso aims at overcoming this limitation with step 2 step 2 in the second step verso takes into account the variant frequency profiles of intra-host variants by exploiting widely-used methods for the analysis of single-cell transcriptomic data and included in the scanpy suite 40  we remark that while it is sound to binarize clonal variant profiles to reconstruct a phylogenetic lineage tree the variant frequency profile has to be considered when analyzing intra-host variants for several reasons first variant frequency profiles describe the sublineage composition of any given host and this information would be lost during binarization second minor variant profiles might be noisy due to the relatively low abundance and to the technical limitations of sequencing experiments accordingly such data may possibly include artifacts which can be partially mitigated during the quality-check phase and by including in the analysis only highly-confident variants however binarization with arbitrary thresholds might increase the false positive rate compromising the accuracy of any downstream analysis third as specified above the extent of transmission of minor variants among individuals is still partially obscure due to the low frequency for instance minor variants may be affected by stochastic fluctuations bottlenecks and founder effects according to which a certain sublineage might significantly change its variant frequency not be transmitted or become clonal in the infected host 26  the latter issue also suggests that the hypothesis of accumulation of minor variants during infection may not hold and should be relaxed for this reason verso defines a pairwise genomic distance as computed on the variant frequency profiles to be used in downstream analyses the intuition is that samples displaying similar patterns of co-occurrence of minor variants might have a similar sublineage architecture thus being at a small evolutionary distance accordingly this might indicate a direct or indirect infection event in particular in this work we employed the bray-curtis dissimilarity which is defined as follows given the ordered vf vectors of two samples ie v i  v f i 1      v f i r   and v j  v f j 1      v f j r   the pairwise bray-curtis dissimilarity di j is given by since this measure weights the pairwise vf dissimilarity on each variant with respect to the sum of the vf of all variants detected in both samples it can be effectively used to compare the sublineage composition of samples as proposed for instance in 42  however verso allows to employ different distance metrics such as correlation or euclidean distance as a design choice in verso the genomic distance is computed among all samples associated to any given viral lineage as inferred in step 1 the rationale is that in a statistical inference framework modeling a complex interplay involving heterogeneous dynamical processes it is crucial to stratify samples into homogeneous groups to reduce the impact of possible confounding effects 58  in the context of viral evolution and transmission noisy observations affecting low-frequency variants eg due to sequencing limitations as well as homoplasies such as mutational hotspots or convergent mutations observed across lineages might distort the relative distance among samples when considering unpartitioned cohorts conversely the identification of a phylogenomic lineage tree which describes the process of accumulation of clonal variants allows to stratify samples in robust groups that are consistent with major evolutionary events therefore improving the reliability of downstream analyses accordingly due to the distinct properties of clonal and minor variants during transmission it is reasonable to assume that the event in which certain minor variants and no clonal variants are transmitted from a host to another during the infection is extremely unlikely the genomic distance is then employed in a standard scanpy 40 workflow for dimensionality reduction and clustering and which includes three steps i the computation of the k-nearest neighbour graph k-nng which can be executed on the original variant frequency matrix or after applying principal component analysis pca to possibly reduce the effect of noisy observations when the number of samples and variants is sufficiently high ii the clustering of samples via either louvain or leiden algorithms for community detection 59  iii the projection of samples on a low-dimensional space via standard tsne 60 or umap 61 plots as output verso delivers both the partitioning of samples in homogeneous clusters and the visualization in a low-dimensional space also allowing to label samples according to other covariates such as eg collection date or geographical location in the map in fig 2b  for instance the sublineage composition of each sample and the genomic distance among samples are projected on the first two umap components whereas samples that are connected by k-nng edges display similar patterns of co-occurrence of variants accordingly the map show clusters of samples likely affected by infection events in which a portion of sublineages might have been transmitted from a host to another this represent a major novelty introduced by verso and also allows to visualize for the first time the space of sublineages also known as quasispecies 22  datasets description dataset 1 we analyzed a cohort of 162 samples from distinct individuals obtained from 11 ncbi bioprojects which at the time of writing are the only publicly available datasets including raw illumina sequencing data in detail we selected the following projects 1 prjna601736 2 individuals geographically located in wuhan china for which we considered rna-seq from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf 2 prjna603194 1 individual from wuhan china with rna-seq from 2  3 prjna605983 2 individuals from china with illumina hiseq rna-seq data 4 prjna607948 1 individual from wisconsin usa 5 prjna608651 1 individual from nepal with rna-seq isolate from oro-pharyngeal swab of 43  6 prjna610428 143 individuals geographically located in the state of washington usa 7 prjna615319 1 individual geographically located in germany 8 prjna616446 7 individuals from china 9 prjna623895 1 individual from cambodia 10 prjna624792 2 individuals from canada and 11 prjna626526 1 individual from israel furthermore we considered 3 additional samples from ncbi bioproject prjna607948 all obtained from the same individual from wisconsin already included in the dataset representing 3 independent passage isolates which were used to validate the discovered minor variant g29039au dataset 2 we considered the whole set of complete high-coverage and human-derived consensus sequences available on gisaid on may 7th 2020 the dataset includes a total of 12419 samples we then used bwa mem version 0717 to map reads to sars-cov-2-anc reference genome suppl file 1 see results we generated sorted bam files from bwa mem results using samtools version 110 and removed duplicates with picard version 2222 variant calling was performed generating mpileup files using samtools and then running varscan min-var-freq parameter set to 001 62  variants were mapped on sars-cov-2 coding sequences cdss via a custom r script also by highlighting synonymousnonsynonymous states and amino acid substitutions for the related open reading frame orf product in particular we translated reference and mutated cdss with the seqinr r package to obtain the relative amino acid sequences which we compared to assess the effect of each nucleotide variation in terms of amino acid substitution finally notice that one should be extremely careful when considering low-frequency variants which might possibly result from sequencing artifacts even in case of high-coverage experiments for this reason we here employed further significance filters on variants in particular we kept only the mutations 1 showing a varscan significance p-value  005 fishers exact test on the read counts supporting reference and variant alleles and more than 8 reads of support in at least 70 of the samples 2 displaying a variant frequency vf  5 as a result we selected a list of 684 highly-confident snvs to be included in the analysis dataset 2 with respect to dataset 2 we aligned the 12419 consensus sequences present on gisaid on may 7th 2020 to sars-cov-2-anc reference genome via augur pipeline 7001 distinct variants were detected in at least 1 sample we called as clonal the variants detected in unambiguous locations whereas ambiguous locations were set to na we then removed regions highly affected by sequencing artifacts by selecting the 6713 variants showing less than 10 of ambiguous calls finally we selected the list of variants to be considered as input to verso by selecting the 27 mutations observed in at least 2 of samples a table including for each sample the run id the bioproject id the biosample id the instrument type the sample name the gisaid id and origin country is returned for dataset 1 as suppl table 3  whereas name accession date region and host type are provided for each sample of dataset 2 as suppl table 4  parameter settings the phylogenomic analysis via verso was performed on dataset 1 and 2 by considering only clonal variants vf  90 for dataset 1 detected in at least 2 of the samples of the cohort a grid search comprising 64 different error rates was employed for dataset 1 hierarchical clustering was performed on the similarity matrix returned by verso see methods for dataset 2 instead as verso returned only 1 unique maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree hierarchical clustering was performed directly on the maximum likelihood attachment of samples to variants in this latter case we first removed samples with ambiguous attachment 229 out of 12419 samples and then we performed pca analysis with a maximum of 27 pcs on the attachment matrix and used the results as inputs for hierarchical clustering the optimal number of clusters was determined with an heuristic based on the amount of the variance explained by each principal component   evolving sequence mutations in the middle east respiratory

abdulaziz alajlan ali hajeer   the 21st century is witnessing a 3rd outbreak of zoonosis 1 associated with a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 in this case similar to its predecessors the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 23 infection with sars-cov-2 officially named covid-19 by the world health organization on february 11 2020 can manifest as bronchitis pneumonia or a severe respiratory illness interestingly these novel human coronaviruses hcovs emerged 810 years apart sars-cov emerged in china in november 2003 where the pandemic infected more than 8096 people resulting in 774 deaths who 2002 the pandemic warning was removed by the world health organization who in 2004 and there was no evidence of new cases of infection in humans thereafter approximately eight years later in 2012 a new coronavirus mers-cov surfaced in saudi arabia 3 and periodic outbreaks of mers-cov are still a matter of immense concern for global health security a total of 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases have been documented to date resulting in 858 deaths spanning 27 countries overall saudi arabia has led in the number of infections with 2102 confirmed cases and 780 deaths 5 similar to many other covs mers-cov has a very large rna genome of approximately 30 kb including the 5 and 3 utrs which encodes three broad protein classes 67 several structural and non-structural proteins are encoded within the intact virion the structural proteins include the spike s protein nucleocapsid n protein envelope e protein and membrane m protein the two main polyproteins pp1ab and pp1a encoded by orf1ab are cleaved into 1516 different non-structural proteins 67 together they form the replicase complex which is essential for polyprotein processing and efficient virus replication mers-cov encodes accessory proteins including orf 3 orf 4a orf4b and orf 5 67 similar to many other coronaviruses the exact roles and precise locations of the accessory proteins of mers-cov are not quite clear however it has been suggested that these proteins influence viral replication pathogenesis and disease outcomes as observed in sars-cov and other coronaviruses 8 the entry of mers-cov into human cells is facilitated by a heavily glycosylated type i transmembrane protein s that binds to the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 protein a receptor on host cells 9 there is a strong consensus that dromedary camels camelus dromedarius are the primary source of the transmission of mers-cov to humans 10 whether camels serve as mixing vessels for the emergence of variant mers-cov strains warrants further investigation 11 a low mutation rate has been demonstrated in mers strains isolated from humans which is attributed to the low level of immunological pressure exerted on this coronavirus in humans 12 a high frequency of mutations and recombinant events is observed in mers-cov strains isolated from camels 13 sporadic cases of mers-cov are in continuous circulation in saudi arabia and the currently available epidemiological data cannot explain the changing epidemiology of the virus in this study we obtained complete genome sequences of mers-cov from eight individuals from the riyadh region in saudi arabia we carried out molecular epidemiology analysis to investigate their epidemiological connection with one another and with past strains an in-depth genetic analysis was performed to construct an interface linking genomic variations and disease severity the patients included in this study n  8 presented with severe

calling base quality recalibration alignment and consensus sequence assembly using torrent suite server v 56 and ion torrent software the nucleotide genome sequences obtained in this study were

isolates n  8 were aligned with the mers-cov sequences both partial and complete available in genbank using the multiple sequence comparison by log-expectation muscle program included in the mega v7 software package wwwmegasoftwarenet homologous basic local alignment search tool blast searches were carried out for each strain to determine the most closely related sequences to generate a composite phylogenetic tree we randomly removed sequences to create a dataset proportional to these newly isolated sequences keeping in mind that the homologous sequences remain in the final alignment the final alignment contained 113 sequences from the complete genome phylogeny including 79 from human cases and 34 of animal origin the best-fit substitution model was selected using jmodeltest 14 and employed

table 1
presents the baseline and clinical characteristics of the 8 studied patients infected with mers-cov the mean age of the patients was 57 years and they included 6 males and 2 females most of the patients had a history of hypertension and 4 of the 8 had diabetes all these patients were admitted to the intensive care unit icu of kamc mng-ha and 4 of the patients died the evolutionary relationships of these newly sequenced saudi mers-cov isolates were assessed in combination with the globally isolated sequences available in the genbank database fig 1 fig 2
 seven of these isolates were assembled with lineage b3 while one strain belonged to the lineage b4 sequences in the complete genome phylogenetic analysis fig 1 all the studied isolates were closely related to previous strains from riyadh isolated during 20152017 two of the 2019 strains and one 2017 strain specifically exhibited longer branch lengths due to a large number of substitutions the only lineage b4 strain mh013216 appeared in the complete genome tree together with a recombinant strain from jeddah isolated from a camel in the subgenomic phylogenetic analysis all b3 strains remained in the same clade fig 2a 2b 2c whereas the b4 strains resembled the b2 strains more closely in the orf1a gene phylogeny fig 2a further analysis using the simplot program 16 confirmed that mh013216 is a complex recombinant strain with contributions from multiple lineages of mers-cov fig 3
 the close similarity of mh013216 with b4 sequences was mainly located between nucleotides 16500 and 24000 in orf1 however the strain sequence matched parts of a2 b1 b2 and b3 the assembly of the strain within b2 occurred because of similar nucleotides at certain sites within lineages and an exclusive b2-like arrangement between nucleotides 12000 and 12500 fig 3 we compared the deduced amino acid sequences of the studied isolates with the reference jx869059 emc2012 and searched for amino acid substitutions in mers-cov proteins that are probably associated with disease severity or transmissibility in humans we were astounded to note a variety of unique mutations not detailed previously in mers-cov the majority of these mutations were found in orf1ab 41 unique mutations followed by the n protein 10 mutations the s protein 9 mutations and orf4b 5 mutations supplement table 2a and supplement table 2b in the orf1ab replicase mutations were quite evident in nsp3 n  17 putative papain-like protease plpro nsp12 n  9 putative rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp nsp13 n  6 putative helicase hel and nsp14 n  6 putative exonuclease exon random mutations were also found in nsp4 and nsp6 putative hydrophobic regions nsp16 putative s-adenosylmethionine-dependent 2-o-ribose methyltransferase and nsp1 and nsp2 proteins of unknown function characteristic nsp3 plpro amino acid substitutions were observed at positions g981s p1099r and k1255r in 58 isolates and v1375i and m2119i in 48 isolates similarly an nsp13 hel substitution at position v5551a and annsp14 exon substitution at position v6030 f were present in 58 isolates supplement table 2a the s protein of mers-cov is a heavily glycosylated type 1 transmembrane protein found on the surface of the virus forming spikes consisting of receptor-binding subunit s1 and membrane fusion subunit s2 7 the noteworthy substitutions in the receptor-binding domain rbd of the s1 subunit were t424i in 28 isolates and s459 t in 18 isolates another substitution w553r was found in the overlapping rbdrbm receptor binding motif region in 28 isolates the s2 subunit substitutions included s950 t in the fusion peptide q1009 l in hepatad repeat region 1 hr1 and c1313s in the transmembrane tm region supplement table 2b n proteins are essential for the packaging of viral rna into viable virus-like particles the characteristic substitutions included v178a in the n-terminal domain ntd present in 68 isolates and a300 v in the c-terminal domain ctd present in all studied isolates table 2
 other ctd amino acid substitutions observed were l293 f present in 28 isolates and v263a r292 p and w293c present in one isolate each the substitutions in the linker region lkr of the n protein include g198s which was present in 28 isolates and d242e which was present in one isolate the n arm of the n protein included s11 f which was present in 28 isolates and p7l and g28 v which were present in one isolate each the c-tail of the n protein also contained a single amino acid substitution s391i supplement table 2b similar to other lineage c betacoronaviruses mers-cov encodes five unique accessory proteins designated 3 4a 4b 5 and 8b 7 we found a two-amino acid substitutions in orf3 encoding a protein of unknown function which was g85dp86 f in 38 isolates and the single-amino acid substitutions v62 f in 28 isolates and t87 n in one isolate the orf4a 4b and m proteins have recently been found to antagonize type i inf production four of the studied isolates exhibited the orf4a substitution e102q the substitutions observed in orf4b were h73 n and a218s in 28 isolates and v51i i147 l and h243q in 1 isolate each two of the isolates exhibited an amino acid substitution in the m protein t127i while one isolate exhibited a mutation in orf5 i98 m supplement table 2b sporadic cases of mers-cov continue to occur in middle eastern regions including saudi arabia in this study we conducted sequencing to determine the genome sequences of 8 mers-cov isolates we performed evolutionary and genomic analyses to address several among many unanswered questions related to persistent mers-cov infection we found a number of genomic variations in the crucial regions of mers-cov including the replicationtranscription complex rtc the nucleocapsid protein n the surface protein s and orf4a and orf44b involved in the host-mediated immune response we identified a genomic recombinant isolate exhibiting characteristic substitutions representing almost all the group a and b mers-cov strains phylogenetic analysis resulted in the assembly of 78 sequences into 3 subclusters within lineage 3 of group b mers-cov the longer branch lengths of these strains from the common node of their closest relatives in the phylogenetic tree were notable new isolates were detected within a period of 6 9 or 12 months after the detection of their closest relatives one possible explanation for the longer branch length observed is the large number of substitutions found in these isolates and another that we missed or could not detect were their close relatives during that period homology searches did not reveal any specific relatedness of mers-cov variants with sars-cov or mers-cov-2 in agreement with recently reported studies 121 the recombination frequency in coronaviruses is quite high and recombination is known to occur due to the exchange of functional motifs or even entire genes 17 some previous reports have also suggested the occurrence of recombination in association with host switching in many coronaviruses 18 19 20 the mh013216 strain showed complex genomic recombination including a major portion of the genome resembling strains of lineage 4 however it harboured lineage-specific residues of both groups a and b of mers-cov this strain was assembled within lineage 2 of the group b mers-cov strains in the subgenomic phylogenetic analysis of orf1a the mers-cov 30 kb genome encodes structural proteins accessory proteins and two orfs orf1a and orf1b from which two large polyproteins are translated and subsequently processed by the viral proteinase into nonstructural proteins nsp that together form rtcs 7 the synthesis of genomic rna grna and subgenomic messenger rnas sgmrna occurs at rtcs 8 involving interaction with the n protein 2223 amino acid substitutions in the nsp proteins as well as the n protein are therefore crucial in the cov life cycle in fact yeast two-hybrid y2h assays of mouse hepatitis virus mhv and sars-cov revealed that nsp3 is the main rtc component that interacts with the n protein 2425 the direct interaction of the n protein with rtcs is considered critical as impairment of this interaction greatly reduces cov replication and progeny production 24 we found amino acid substitutions in the nsp3 helicase nsp13 an important enzyme for viral tropism and virulence rdrp nsp12 and exoribonuclease nsp14 proteins how these proteins either individually or together interact with the n protein in viral replication sgmrna production and translation warrants functional studies most of the adaptive events in mers-cov in humans and camels 26 are now thought to occur through nsp3 via its deubiquitination and de-esterification activity to inhibit the ifn response 27 irrespective of the cov strain involved accessory orfs have been implicated in the context of infection specifically in the antagonization of the host response 2829 mers-cov orf4a suppresses ifn production by binding to dsrna 28 and the 4b gene product is reportedly associated with the evasion of host cell ifn defence mechanisms 3031 amino acid substitutions in these proteins may impact the host immune response to the disease and ultimately its pathogenesis the variant strains may have acquired high pathogenicity but intense surveillance studies will be required to elucidate how this will be reflected in viral spreading and persistence in the future similar to other coronaviruses the mers-cov spike protein s is highly exposed to the virus surface and is the first line of contact in virus infection and the host immune response amino acid substitutions in the rbdrbm region that play any role in virus binding to host dpp4 need to be investigated the heptad repeat region hr1 has recently been reported to be a major selection target among mers-covs for their interspecies jump and spread to humans one of the studied isolates presented the hr1 substitution q1009l and a nearby amino acid substitution t1015 n has been implicated in an increased mers-cov infection efficiency in vitro 32 although camels are thought to be the primary zoonotic reservoir responsible for human transmission there is some evidence that bats might be the ancestral reservoir host for mers-cov 17 direct contact with dromedary camels or camel products has been reported in only 55  of primary mers-cov cases and the contact history in the remaining cases is unknown 33 this study has some limitations as we do not have samples from camels or other domestic and wild animals to confirm the possible contact history of the disease in our patients we identified novel point mutations and mutation complexes indicating a changing epidemiology of mers-cov potentially raising the alarm regarding new viral outbreaks and associated morbidity and mortality the search for intermediate hosts in mers-cov evolution is necessary as are functional studies to determine the pathogenic potential of such substitutions which may aid in the screening of patients at higher risk in conclusion the results of this study lead to the recommendation that the complete genome sequencing of all new cases of mers-cov to monitor virus evolution a clear understanding of the recombination events involved in mers-cov evolution would aid in developing effective tools for controlling new human coronavirus infections worldwide mab designed and supervised

alberto alberti   bats order chiroptera are one of the most diverse and widely distributed group of mammals comprising more than 1300 species across 21 families 1 and play a key role in terrestrial ecosystems 2 in the last few decades they have been associated with several emergent zoonotic agents and recognized as potential reservoir of zoonotic viruses belonging to different families such as hendra nipah ebola lyssa and sars coronavirus 3 bats represent ideal hosts and reservoirs of viruses due to their high diversity and ecological characteristics that potentially facilitate virus transmission such as the roosting together behavior and their ability to fly over distance 4 5 therefore it is essential to identify and characterize the currently unrecognized viruses circulating in bat populations coronaviruses cov family coronaviridae are enveloped viruses with large single-stranded rna genomes ranging between 27 and 32 kb 6 7 based on genome-scale phylogenies they are classified into four genera alphacoronavirus -cov and betacoronavirus -cov pathogenic for mammals gammacoronavirus -cov and deltacoronavirus -cov primarily but not exclusively circulating in birds 8 9 most covs are disease-causing agents associated with a range of respiratory gastrointestinal hepatic and neurological diseases both in humans and animals they are also potentially transmitted among species causing epidemics after host transition 1012 due to mutation and recombination events new strains constantly originate and spread 4 13 different bat species have been identified as natural reservoirs of most mammalian -cov and -cov including the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov 14 15 which recently caused outbreaks in the human population 4 sars-related cov was first identified in rhinolophus bats from china 16 and subsequently many mammalian covs were detected in chinese bats 17 18 and globally 19 further investigations identified -cov and -cov in several european countries from bats of various species 2022 in italy few studies have been conducted on bat cov ecology viral detection and prevalence was investigated in greater horseshoe bats 23 alpha- and betacoronaviruses were identified in different species such as kuhls pipistrelle lesser horseshoe bats and serotine bats 10 24 and recently two mers related beta cov detected in italian kuhls pipistrelle and savis bat were fully sequenced 25 a total of 21 bat species are currently recognized as living on the island of sardinia italy lying geographically at the interface between europe and africa and recently indicated as a major mediterranean hotspot for bat biodiversity 26 nothing is known about cov presence and distribution among bat populations on the island and this is the first study aiming to fill this gap herein we report the molecular identification and typing of a sars-like coronavirus detected in three species of sardinian bats belonging to rhinolophus plecotus and tadarida genera during a viral survey conducted on non-invasive bat samples collected from different localities on the island we also inferred the phylogenetic characteristics of the identified -cov and its evolutionary relationships with other bat covs identified in europe and globally a total of 46 bats belonging to 15 different species were captured using mist nets or hand nets in 8 different localities distributed in northern and central sardinia grotta sa rocca ulari borutta galleria casteldoria santa maria coghinas diga santa chiara ula-tirso monte corallinu dorgali tilpera bonorva mularza noa bolotana belv and grotta verde alghero listed in table 1 sampling locations included caves buildings tunnels woods abandoned bridges and other type of natural roosts captures were performed by expert and trained biologists within a regular census program of sardinian bat populations between november 2015 and november 2016 bats were placed individually into cotton bags before investigation species sex age category and forearm length were determined oral and cutaneous swabs were collected using sterile micro-swabs aptaca and then bats were released at

 after detecting cov in faecal samples a total of 1110 bp of rdrp gene were successfully amplified and directly sequenced the same betacoronavirus sequence was detected in all three positive bat species upon blastn analysis the viral sequence identified was found highly similar to bat coronavirus bm48-31bgr2008 gu190215 detected in a blasiuss horseshoe bat rhinolophus blasii in bulgaria 14 with 100 query coverage and 96 identity the obtained sequence also showed high nucleotide similarity 89 with bat sars cov rs6722006 fj588686 identified in a chinese rufous horseshoe bat rhinolophus sinicus 34 and with bat sars-like coronavirus rsshco14 kc881005 from the same bat species 35 a first phylogenetic analysis was performed based on 1090 bp amplified fragment of the rdrp gene including the cov identified in sardinian bats and other 16 sequences representatives of cov genetic variability the phylogram tn93g fig 1 clearly showed that sardinian bat cov belong to the -cov genus and clustered together with the bulgarian bat cov identified in a rhinolophus blasii gu190215 to have a deeper look into clade structuring within genera and further characterize the phylogenetic relationships of the detected cov especially with other european bat coronaviruses another phylogenetic analysis was performed based on 396 bp of the rdrp gene and including a total of 30 sequences figure 2 shows the t92g tree obtained clearly assigning the sardinian bat cov to clade 2b within the -cov genus the branching also showed that the detected sequence was closely related to a betacoronavirus previously identified in a greater horseshoe bat rhinolophus ferrumequinum in italy btcovrhiferit17ita2009 genbank number kc633199 as well as other bat covs detected in rhinolophus spp from slovenia gq409747 36 and again from italy ie kf500954 10 all other clade groupings were consistent with previous studies 14 

 

 at least 21 bat species are currently recognized as living on the island of sardinia italy 37 some species are common and adaptable inhabiting both wild and urban habitats while others are rare and restricted to limited areas of the island recently an island endemic species was characterized plecotus sardus and an endemic lineage of plecotus auritus was also identified 38 the existence of endemic bat taxa on sardinia highlights the island importance in the conservation of the european bat community some sardinian bat populations appear genetically differentiated and isolated from any continental gene pool and should therefore be considered as an evolutionarily significant unit esu 39 this is the first report of coronavirus detection in faeces from bat species in sardinia a sars-like betacoronavirus was detected in three species table 3 the greater horseshoe bat rhinolophus ferrumequinum common cave species distributed all over the island the brown long-eared bat plecotus auritus rare species inhabiting few localities especially mountain woods in central sardinia and the european free-tailed bat tadarida teniotis common species usually colonizing rocky slopes and mediterranean bushes as well as buildings and bridges in urban areas the detected virus sarbatcov1 belonged to clade 2b including most of the sars-like covs found in bats as well as human sars coronavirus figs 1 2 sarbatcov1 appeared related to another betacoronavirus previously identified in the italian greater horseshoe bat btcovrhiferit17ita2009 genbank number kc633199 and also clustered with a -coronavirus isolated from a blasiuss horseshoe bat in bulgaria bm48-31bgr2008 genbank number gu190215 as shown in fig 2 the two clades within -coronaviruses are strongly supported in the phylogram and clade 2c clustered many other bat covs identified in europe italy and spain from different species these findings confirm a correlation between sars-like covs and bats belonging to rhinolophus spp consistently with previous studies 14 40 although the same rdrp sequence in this study was also detected in two other species belonging to the genera plecotus and tadarida as previously discussed phylogenetic analyses providing insights into viral transmission among bat species have revealed a general clustering by geographic location rather than by bat species 4 however our results also show that similar coronaviruses with nucleotide identity up to 96 are found in bats distributed in geographically distant regions such as the island of sardinia mainland italy and bulgaria since the identification of sarsr-rh-batcov in bats of the rhinolophus genus 16 an intense effort was dedicated to investigate covs in bats and many sars-like viruses were detected and characterized in various species worldwide 4 19 recent studies also provided evidence that bats may be the original ancestor hosts for sars and mers viruses which recently caused pandemic and heavy consequences in humans 4143 therefore it is paramount to investigate and characterize covs distribution and diversity in bat species before their potential emergence in humans full-length genome analysis of the detected cov should be attempted to thoroughly understand phylogenetic relationships between sarbatcov1 and betacoronaviruses previously described in european bats further studies including larger number of samples as well as continued surveillance on viruses circulating in sardinian species are also needed to understand the role played by bats in the maintenance and transmission of beta covs monitoring and research on potential zoonoses are essential and the prevalence and distribution of covs in sardinian bats should be further investigated in urban and rural environment however without specific evidence bats should not be considered as a major concern for public health especially given the key ecosystem services they perform 44 bats play essential ecological roles in mosquito and pest control as pollinators and are keystone species in natural ecosystems on top of this bat species are often protected by national and international laws as their conservation status may be vulnerable or threatened and sardinia was recently indicated as a major mediterranean hotspot for bat biodiversity 26  journal pre-proof a novel bat coronavirus closely

scale 35 1 2  although bats are regarded as the most likely natural hosts for sars-cov-2 3 the 36 origins of the virus remain unclear here we report a novel bat-derived coronavirus 37 denoted rmyn02 identified from a metagenomics analysis of samples from 227 bats 38 collected from yunnan province in china between may and october 2019 notably 39 rmyn02 shares 933 nucleotide identity with sars-cov-2 at the scale of the complete 40 virus genome and 972 identity in the 1ab gene in which it is the closest relative of 41 sars-cov-2 reported to date in contrast rmyn02 showed low sequence identity 42 613 to sars-cov-2 in the receptor binding domain rbd and might not bind to 43 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 critically and in a similar manner to 44 8 using simplot 10 also revealed that rmyn02 was more similar to sars-cov-2 than 137 ratg13 in most genome regions  figure 1a  again in the rbd the 138 pangolinmp7892019 virus shared the highest sequence identity to sars-cov-2  figure  139 1b 140 141 results from both homology modelling 2  in vitro assays 3 and resolved 142 three-dimensional structure of the s protein 11 have revealed that like sars-cov 143 sars-cov-2 could also use ace2 as a cell receptor we analyzed the rbd of rmyn02 144 ratg13 and the two pangolin beta-covs using homology modelling  the s protein of covs is functionally cleaved into two subunits s1 and s2 15 in a similar 171 manner to the haemagglutinin ha protein of avian influenza viruses aivs the insertion 172 of polybasic amino acids at the cleavage site in the has of some aiv subtypes is 173 associated with enhanced pathogenicity 16 17  notably sars-cov-2 is characterized 174 by a four-amino-acid-insertion at the junction of s1 and s2 not observed in other lineage 175 b beta-covs 18 this insertion which represents a poly-basic furin cleavage site is 176 unique to sars-cov-2 and is present in all sars-cov-2 sequenced so far the insertion 177 of three residues paa at the junction of s1 and s2 in rmyn02  figure 2h  and figure  178 s2a for results from sanger sequencing is therefore of major importance although the 179 inserted residues and hence nucleotides are not the same as those in rmyn02 and 180 10 hence are indicative of an independent insertion event that they are presented in wildlife 181 bats strongly suggests that they are of natural origin and have likely acquired by 182 recombination as such these data are strongly suggestive of a natural zoonotic origin of 183 sars-cov-2 184 we next performed a phylogenetic analysis of rmyn02 ratg13 sars-cov-2 and the 185 pangolin beta-covs consistent with a previous research 6 the pangolin beta-covs 186 formed two well-supported sub-lineages representing animal seized by anti-smuggling 187 authorities in guangxi pangolin-covgx and guangdong pangolin-covgd provinces 188  figure 3a and figure s4a  however whether pangolins are natural reservoirs for these 189 viruses or they acquired these viruses independently from bats or other wildlife requires 190 further sampling 6  more notable was that rmyn02 was the closest relative of 191 sars-cov-2 in most of the virus genome although these two viruses were still separated 192 from each other by a relatively long branch length  figure 3a and figure s4a  in the 193 spike gene tree sars-cov-2 clustered with ratg13 and was distant from rmyn02 194 suggesting that the latter virus has experienced recombination in this gene  figure 3b and 195 figure s4b  in phylogeny of the rbd sars-cov-2 was most closely related to 196 pangolin-covgd with the bat viruses falling in more divergent positions again indicative 197 of recombination  figure 3c and figure s4c  finally phylogenetic analysis of the 198 complete rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene which is often used in the 199 phylogenetic analysis of rna viruses revealed that rmyn02 ratg13 and sars-cov-2 200 formed a well-supported sub-cluster distinct from the pangolin viruses  figure 3d and 201 figure s4d  202 11 we confirmed the bat host of rmyn02 rhinolophus malayanus by analyzing the 203 sequence of the cytochrome b cytb gene from the next generation sequencing data this 204 revealed 100 sequence identity to a rhinolophus malayanus isolate genbank 205 accession mk900703 both rhinolophus malayanus and rhinolophus affinis are widely 206 distributed in southwest china and southeast asia generally they do not migrate over 207 long distances and are highly gregarious such that they are likely to live in the same caves 208 which might facilitate the exchange of viruses between them and the occurrence of 209 recombination notably ratg13 was identified from anal swabs and rmyn02 was 210 identified from feces which is a simple but feasible way for bats to spread the virus to 211 other animals especially species that can utilize cave environments 212 our study reaffirms that bats particularly those of the genus rhinolophus are important 213 natural reservoirs for coronaviruses and currently harbor the closest relatives of 214 sars-cov-2 although this picture may change with increased wildlife sampling in this 215 context it is striking that the rmyn02 virus identified here in rhinolophus malayanus is 216 the closest relative of sars-cov-2 in the long 1ab replicase gene although the virus 217 itself has a complex history of recombination finally the observation that rmyn02 218 contains a polybasic insertion at the s1s2 cleavage site in the spike protein clearly 219 indicates that events of this kind are a natural and expected component of coronavirus 220 the s1s2 cleavage site of rmyn02 and representative beta the s1s2 cleavage site of rmyn02 and representative beta the s1s2 cleavage site of rmyn02 and representative beta the s1s2

using a combination of metagenomic sequencing and tiling amplicon approaches combined epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses indicate multiple independent introductions to guangdong although phylogenetic clustering is uncertain due to low virus genetic variation early in the pandemic our results illustrate how the timing size and duration of putative local transmission chains were constrained by national travel restrictions and by the provinces large-scale intensive surveillance and intervention measures despite these successes covid-19 surveillance in guangdong is still

this preprint  httpsdoiorg1011012020040120047076 doi medrxiv preprint our analyses of the genomic epidemiology of sars-cov-2 in guangdong province indicate that following the first covid-19 case detected in early january most infections were the result of virus importation from elsewhere and that chains of local transmission were limited in size and duration were effective in interrupting community transmission in a densely populated urban region ultimately containing the epidemic and limiting the potential for dissemination to other regions however vigilance is still required as the risk remains that sars-cov-2 transmission will reignite in guangdong following a recent increase in the number of covid-19 cases imported to china from other countries the results also suggest that early phylogenetic analyses of the pandemic should be interpreted carefully the number of mutations that define phylogenetic lineages are small often one and may be similar to the number of sequence differences arising from errors introduced during reverse transcription pcr amplification or sequencing bayesian estimates of divergence times rannala and yang 1996  such as the tmrca of the pandemic are based on aggregate numbers of mutations and are expected to be more robust further the low and variable sampling of covid-19 cases among different regions makes it challenging to evaluate phylogenetic clusters that comprise cases from a single region although such clusters could indeed represent local transmission our results show they can also include multiple introductions from a genomically-undersampled location therefore as with all phylogenetic analyses the sars-cov-2 genomes must be interpreted in the context of all available epidemiological information is the authorfunder

valeria micheli davide sassera stefano gaiarsa claudio bandi matteo brilli  the sars-cov-2 pandemic that we are currently experiencing is exerting a massive toll both in human lives and economic impact one of the challenges we must face is to try to understand if and how different variants of the virus emerge and change their frequency in time such information can be extremely valuable as it may indicate shifts in aggressiveness and it could provide useful information to trace the spread of the virus in the population in this work we identified and traced over time 7 amino acid variants that are present with high frequency in italy and europe but that were absent or present at very low frequencies during the first stages of the epidemic in china and the initial reports in europe the analysis of these variants helps defining 6 phylogenetic clades that are currently spreading throughout the world with changes in frequency that are sometimes very fast and dramatic in the absence of conclusive data at the time of writing we discuss whether the spread of the variants may be due to a prominent founder effect or if it indicates an adaptive advantage positions 203 and 204 belong to the linker region between the n-and c-terminal rna binding domains in particular they are positioned in the sr region named after the marked abundance in s and r residues mcbride van zyl and fielding 2014  this region plays a role in cell signaling and rna binding it is a thought to be a highly flexible and intrinsically disordered region idp of the protein while the mutation r203k is a conservative mutation in terms of charge and size of the residue side chain g204r introduces a bulky charged residue in place of a g residue however even though the loss of a g may reduce the backbone flexibility r residues are common in idp regions and r204 might introduce a new charge which is compatible with the rna binding properties of this domain as said before we feel that the change from rg to kr may indicate a requirement for an arginine at that position with a path rg to kg that could be disadvantageous to kr and back to a situation resembling the original haplotype  the worldwide fast spread of sars-cov-2 virus during the first months of this year has caused 316169 deaths with more than 4731458 confirmed cases since the first reports of novel pneumonia in wuhan hubei province china zhou et al 2020 wu et al 2020  up to may 19 2020 who 2020b  the virus belongs to the beta-coronavirus and it is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans causing severe respiratory and systemic disorders rothan and byrareddy 2020  with a basic r0 index estimated to range from 14 to over 6  the closest known relatives of sars-cov-2 circulate in animals specifically bats or pangolins zhang wu and zhang 2020  suggesting that an animal virus crossed species boundaries to efficiently infect humans possibly through multiple passages in intermediate animal hosts even though the transmission route has not been yet identified to date andersen et al 2020  traces of the history of the spread are present in the viral genome and comparative genomics approaches can therefore be used to understand how viruses can adapt to multiple hosts uncovering key signatures of this adaptation andersen et al 2020 wan et al 2020  and to trace the infection routes of the virus at the same time genomic studies can help tracing viral variants that may be geographically restricted andor may account for different levels of infectivity and mortality in humans these variants might arise during the spread of the epidemic as viruses are known for their high frequency of mutation particularly in single stranded rna viruses -as in the case of sars-cov-2 sanjun and domingo-calap 2016  which has a single positive-strand rna genome randomly generated variants can then spread in the population due to stochastic reasons ie founder effect drift or as a consequence of positive selection exerted by intrinsic biological features such as the level of virus infectivity and its transmission rate or extrinsic factors such as use of antivirals or reactions by the immune system or other defence mechanisms put in place by the host di giorgio et al 2020  therefore haplotypes present at the beginning of the epidemic spread can change in time sometimes novel variants can overcome ancestral ones and this can be a consequence of different levels of aggressiveness but also of mechanisms beyond selection if the different variants are identical in terms of their ability to infect and replicate in the host country-specific switches in haplotype frequency with respect to the most common haplotypes can depend on the very first haplotypes arriving in the country provine 2004  instead when haplotype frequency changes globally then the hypothesis of differential aggressiveness becomes more probable indicating that the novel variants may be better adapted to infect human hosts however even in this case the complexity of global human mobility or sampling bias may originate patterns that may seem causal but are not here we present a comprehensive study of the coding sequences from sars-cov-2 genome sequences isolated since the beginning of the epidemic italy was the first european country registering non-imported covid-19 cases requiring hospitalization the first registered case of covid-19 was on february 20 2020 a young man in the lombardy region in northern italy diagnosed with atypical pneumonia livingston and bucher 2020  in the next 24 hours 36 more cases were detected and as of april 27th 2020 italy registered 197675 cases with 26644 deaths one of the highest toll in europe and in the world who classifies the spreading occurring in italy as community transmission indicating that the country is experiencing large outbreaks of local transmission with no possibility to trace transmission chains between the cases and with multiple and unrelated clusters of transmission the high mortality rate observed in italy especially at the beginning of the epidemic raised the question whether italian strains might have increased aggressiveness while the increased mortality observed in italy could be explained by the fact that at the beginning of the epidemic swabs were performed only on individuals showing up at a hospital distorting the sampling toward a group of symptomatic individuals devoid of healthy carriers we cannot exclude that italian haplotype frequency are partially different at least genetically to have a better insight on the history and spread of the covid-19 pandemic in italy and thanks to the sequences deposited in the gisaid database we identified 7 non synonymous mutations that are differentially frequent in italian sars-cov-2 strains respect to strains circulating globally these mutations are enriched in italy but present in strains from other countries as well as shown by tracing their relative frequency in time both globally and in different countries therefore we traced their distribution worldwide and complemented with a phylogenetic analysis to understand how the variants are related genomes were downloaded from the gisaidorg repository on april 10 2020 and a second time on april 28 2020 and are listed together with reference to the submitting laboratories in supplementary table 1  we extracted coding sequences using a strategy based on tblastn camacho et al 2009  comparisons using as queries all the proteins from the sars-cov-2 reference sequence deposited in ncbi accession mn908947 after the comparison the coordinates of the blast alignments on each genome were used to extract the coding sequence nucleotide sequences were then aligned and translated and the alignments were manually checked for the presence of frameshifts and manually edited alignments were manually edited to remove partial and poorly aligned sequences resulting in a variable number of sequences per alignment this manual curation resulted in alignments containing a minimum number of 2262 sequences for orf3a and a maximum of 5585 sequences for the nucleocapsid protein with an average of 4222 sequences per alignment we are aware that by removing sequences with gaps we are likely removing part of the genuine variability present ie indels however we observed indels with such a low frequency that we attributed them mostly to sequencingassembly errors and decided that the clear advantage of a stronger signal outweighs the possible disadvantages deriving from information loss additional analysis with high quality genome sequences will be necessary to evaluate whether indels represent an important source of variation regardless this does not change the results of our analysis as the target of this work are point mutations sequences from the alignments were used to build amino acid frequency profiles by using the r-package seqinr charif and jr 2007  basically for each protein encoded in the sars-cov-2 we obtained two profiles one for italian strains and one for the entire set of sequences as the positions in the alignments for the two groups under examination are congruent we can then calculate that is the maximum log ratio of the frequency f of all amino acids at a certain position i in the alignment in italian  it  and total  all  sequences then we identify positions with s05 that corresponds to the identification of positions where there is a frequency change in one of the residues of at least 2x variability in multi-alignments was quantified by calculating entropy     -8 9 - at each position of each manually curated protein multi-alignment mutual information was calculated based on buck and atchley 2005 to assess whether variants tend to co-occur frequently to build updated time profiles of the identified variants sequences were downloaded a second time from gisaidorg on april 28 2020 9075 sequences only high quality and high coverage sampling dates were retrieved from the database and can be found in the gisaid sequence acknowledgment table supplementary table 1  sequences for which the geographic origin andor the data were not correctly defined supplementary table 1  were removed to obtain a database of about 8500 sequences with some per-site variability due to the variable presence of ns in the sequences we calculated two different time series one for the entire set of sequences available up to the moment of sequence download and one by considering only sequences taken from predefined groups of countries hereinafter the time series by country in the latter we merged nearby countries to increase the precision of the estimation of the relative frequency of variants within predefined time intervals the total time range since the first sequence available 133 days was split into 13 9 for the analysis by country as the number of sequences per interval is smaller non-overlapping intervals of about 10 days 13 days for the time series by country interval duration was selected looking for a compromise among the number of sequences available on average per interval in the different groups and the time resolution of the time series for each interval we calculated the frequency of the observed variants and the shannon diversity index considering all concatenated coding sequences not limited to the positions considered in this work in supplementary table 2 we show the number of sequences used for each country for each interval we performed a phylogenetic analysis by concatenating nucleotide aligned on the basis of the manually curated amino acid alignments we selected the best phylogenetic model for our alignment using modeltest-ng darriba et al 2020  gtri model and then we performed maximum likelihood phylogenetic estimation in raxml8 stamatakis 2014  the obtained phylogenetic tree was then visualized and integrated with additional information about variants and geographical origin using figtree httpsgithubcomrambautfigtree our analysis allowed us to identify 7 positions in four proteins that present drastic changes in amino acid frequencies when comparing italian sequences with worldwide sequences available on gisaidorg on april 10 2020  figure 1  however we discovered that residues found at these positions are not peculiar of italy and as a matter of fact they are the most variable genomic positions across available sars-cov-2 sequences supplementary figure 1  therefore we decided to proceed with a worldwide analysis the sites that we identified are 1 position 614 in the spike protein where an aspartate residue is found in high frequency in sequences obtained at the beginning of the pandemic a variant with a glycine residue at the same position is however now very common in europe italy in particular  during the preparation of this manuscript we realized that some of the variants are also the topic of other papers and preprints predating this work eg korber et al 2020 banerjee et al 2020 somasundaram mondal and lawarde 2020 begum et al 2020 bai et al 2020 yang et al 2020 pachetti et al 2020  the fact that we identify some of the previously known mutations by using a different approach indicates that they represent a genuine signal rather than artefacts however this does not necessarily mean that their increase in time see below is a consequence of a correspondingly increased transmissibility rate or aggressiveness in general -for which at the moment there is no conclusive data as stated in most of the available preprints in the following we summarize a thorough bibliographical analysis looking for functional information associated with these positions or the domains they belong to however we stress once more that virus spreading is characterized by haplotype shifts that are not necessarily related to the performances of the haplotypes themselves -for instance genetic drift or founder effect -therefore without targeted functional studies on the variants it is difficult to ascertain whether one or the other explanation is more probable figure 1 for a confirmation of the variability of these positions in the entire set of sequences note that to cope with zeros when taking the logarithm of the ratio of amino acid frequencies we add a small number to every frequency that depends on the number of sequences in the two groups italian and world this makes so that positions with identical amino acid frequencies in the two groups do not get an s exactly equal to zero d614 is located in the sd1 domain of the spike protein it is positioned in a loop right after a beta-strand and close to a completely solvent exposed disordered region outside and downstream the ace2 interaction domain wrapp et al 2020 walls et al 2020  the resolution of the three available structures is not high enough to thoroughly discuss h-bond network it is likely that d614 side chain does not establish close interactions with neighboring residues conformationally d614 lies in the region of left-handed helices thus from the structural point of view the mutation d614g is likely to be neutral no particularly strong interactions lost from the missing carboxylate group on the other hand the mutation might even be beneficial for overall protein stability given the increased conformational freedom of glycine it is indeed a perfect residue in turns following beta structures other authors suggest a positive effect of d614g on the virus efficiency in binding the ace2 receptor korber and colleagues unpublished korber et al 2020  suggest the possibility of structural changes in the protein or even an improved antibody-dependent enhancement effect in coronaviruses orf1 is translated to yield the polyprotein that is processed by proteolysis with the production of intermediate and mature nonstructural proteins nsps in figure 2 we highlight the position of the variant sites on the polyprotein with respect to known domains as defined by the conserved domain database  position 265 corresponds to residue 85 of the non-structural protein 2 nsp2 which is characterized by four transmembrane helices th angeletti et al 2020  whose role is still unknown more in detail position 85 lies at the n-terminal which protrudes from the external face of the membrane interaction analysis of the corresponding protein from sars virus shows that nsp2 can form dimeric or multimeric complexes that can also involve additional viral proteins nsp3 nsp4 nsp6 nsp8 nsp11 nsp16 orf3a von brunn et al 2007 suggesting that nsp2 might be involved in the viral life cycle sars nsp2 also interact with host proteins such as prohibitin 1 and 2 cornillez-ty et al 2009  that are involved in cell cycle progression migration differentiation apoptosis and mitochondrial biogenesis fusaro et al 2003 merkwirth and langer 2009 rajalingam et al 2005 sun et al 2004 suggesting it might be important to manipulate prominent host functions murine hepatitis virus and sars-cov strains deleted in this portion of the polyprotein graham et al 2005  have a strongly reduced viral growth and rna synthesis but are not affected at the level of protein processing ectopic expression of the nucleotide sequence coding for nsp2 in murine cells infected by strains missing nsp2 allowed to detect its recruitment in viral complexes it is therefore possible that nsp2 is involved in global rna synthesis interaction with host proteins and pathogenesis von brunn et al 2007  in infected cells nsp2 seems to be present in small vesicular foci but in absence of additional viral proteins it localizes in cytoplasmic or nuclear membranes without a specific target prentice et al 2004 von brunn et al 2007  unfortunately mutagenesis experiments are still not available for sars-cov2 and therefore we still do not know whether the variant observed at this site has any effect on in vivo virus properties position 3606 belongs to nsp6 a protein that induces the formation of autophagosomes which is a sign of starvation in uninfected cells cottam whelband and wileman 2014  autophagosomes can act as an innate defense against viral infection but they can be hijacked and support the assembly of coronavirus replicase proteins orvedahl et al 2007 suhy giddings and kirkegaard 2000 wileman 2006  together with nsp3 and nsp4 nsp6 moreover promotes the formation of the double membrane vesicles typically observed in sars disease angelini et al 2013  nsp6 is a protein with 7 transmembrane domains oostra et al 2008  and position 3606 lays in the luminal loop between the first and second hydrophobic transmembrane domains in the wild type sars-cov-2 sequence we find 3 phenylalanine residues just before l3606 instead some of the variants in this paper have a stretch of 4 phenylalanine keeping this region highly hydrophobic position 4715 belongs instead to the n-terminal domain of the rna-directed rna polymerase rdrp also known as nsp12 by inspecting its three-dimensional structure sars-cov-2 rdrp displays a n-terminal nidovirus-like rdrp-associated nucleotidyltransferase domain niran followed by an interface domain and then by the canonical palm and finger domain structure gao et al 2020  p4715 p323 according to nsp12 numbering is located in the alpha-beta interface domain which bridges niran with the finger domain specifically p4715 sits on a solvent exposed loop region in the groove formed between niran and the finger domain the mutation p4715l mutation does not change the non-polar nature of the side chain and from the conformational point of view the substitution from p to l should not result in specific structural adjustment of the loop thus despite no information concerning mutations at the specific sites identified in this work the three variant sites in the polyprotein belong to important functional regions of the sequence orf8 codes for a secreted accessory protein not directly involved in viral replication dediego et al 2008 yount et al 2005 tan et al 2020  homologs have been found in some beta-coronavirus named orf7a tan et al 2020  orf7a of sars codes for a protein with a structure similar to immunoglobulin superfamily proteins specifically the metazoan ig involved in adhesion nelson et al 2005 hnel et al 2006  the function of this protein is not entirely clear but could be related to the modulation of the immune system studies have demonstrated that sars-orf7a protein localizes mainly in the perinuclear region of the host cell where it interacts with bst-2 bone marrow stromal antigen 2 preventing the glycosylation of bst-2 needed for functioning taylor et al 2015  bst-2 inhibits the release of the virus as observed in hiv-1 taylor et al 2015 likely at the level of the endoplasmic reticulum-golgi where it binds budding virions orf8 has a structure composed of a beta-sandwich fold with seven beta-stands which highly resembles orf7as structure but it lacks the c-terminal transmembrane region and has an additional long insert between strands 3 and 4 which is supposed to be involved in peptide binding tan et al 2020  orf8 is a fast-evolving gene which together with the absence of the transmembrane region and the presence of the insertion may suggest some functional divergence with respect to its ancestor tan et al 2020  it has been proposed that orf8 may have acquired a function similar to the adenoviral cr1 protein which interferes with mhc molecules to attenuate the antigen presentation and therefore the capability of the host immune system to detect the virus in this context we notice that l84 lays within the orf8 insert indicating it may represent a further adaptation because direct functional information on this site is lacking at the moment it is not possible to ascribe a functional adaptation to these variants however variability at this site might counteract mhc interference function as a fast-evolving region in the insert may have been selected positively to facilitate the interaction with a fast-evolving host molecule tan et al 2020  after having identified variant sites we explored the time profile of the seven variable sites across all sequences figure 3  evidencing haplotype frequency changes for all of them between february and march with five changes being moderate nucleocapsid r203g and g204r orf8 l84s polyprotein t265i and l3606f and two more drastic now representing the most common haplotypes of non-chinese recent sequences spike d614g and polyprotein p4715l the spike variant in particular was sequenced only few times in china since the beginning of the epidemy the first time in zhejiang on january 24 however in this country it never reached a significant frequency conversely after the first sequencing of this variant in germany on january 28 this variant started at very low-frequency and then became the most common haplotype at this position outside china a similar situation is true for the haplotype with a leucine in position 4715 of the polyprotein -that rapidly increases since the beginning of march these patterns seem indicative of a functional role for at least some of the variants that undergo an increase in frequency but in the absence of any functional test or experimental data we cannot rule out that the observed frequency changes are a consequence of a founder effect in europe followed by a spreading wave from europe to countries where the epidemic started later a founder effect however implies that the founder arrives first while this is not always the case at least for some of the variants and part of the countries at the same time some data both reviewed and unreviewed start to be available suggesting that d614g on the spike might provide some advantage to the virus bai bai et al 2020  and brufsky brufsky 2020  observed a correlation of g614 with increased mortality while korber and coworkers korber et al 2020 found a correlation between the presence of the mutation and a higher viral load in patients in the legend we indicate the reference residue with an asterisk and the variant on which we are focusing with an exclamation mark additional variants were identified in the sequence dataset downloaded on april 28 but they never reach significant percentages at least at the moment position 614 on the spike and position 4715 on the polyprotein covary in a significant way data not shown the most likely explanation for this is the rapid sequential fixation of both mutations in the same strain together with the absence of recombinations in between the two the two adjacent sites in the nucleocapsid sequences show a perfect agreement in the time profiles strongly suggesting that they happened together or within a short time these two mutations respectively remove and add an arginine passing from rg to kr by considering the overall frequencies of the possible amino acid pairs at these positions we suggest that the second arginine may complement the loss of the first one indeed rr is never observed kg is extremely rare relative frequency rf 000036 while most genomes either present the original pair rg rf 087464 or kr rf 012500 we speculate that this could indeed be a consequence of the non-neutrality of configurations with no arginine at both positions an information still not giving hints on the fitness of the fixed variant nextwe reasoned that grouping all the sequences uploaded from different countries may provide a picture averaged over variable and more complicated situations that might characterize the evolution of the virus within different countries or geographical areas we therefore explored the time profiles of the variants in different geographical macro-regions  figure  4 and figure 5  highlighting a highly heterogeneous situation we also provide a movie illustrating the changes taking place in variant frequencies across overlapping time windows in macro-regions supplementary movie 1 which provides a dynamical view of the time profiles of the variants figure 4 shows that d614g in china never reaches significant frequency while it increased quite rapidly in several areas where it arrived and where it often started at very low frequency with respect to the original haplotype if a functional role for this mutation will be demonstrated this pattern seems to indicate that different variants might have different fitness when interacting with different hosts haplotypes ie in case asian and european have different haplotypes concerning some of the proteins interacting with the spike like for instance furin to conclude it is clear that since the first appearance of d614g and other of the above variants their relative frequency underwent a significant increase in several countries most of the time overcoming in prevalence the original variants except for china south asia south america and africa in figure 6 we summarize the most recent situation by using sequences from the interval april 10 to 20 2020  the best phylogenetic model selected according to aic and bic was gtrig for which the estimated substitution rate matrix contains the following rates relative to the g-t rate taken as unity a-c034 a-g077 a-t032 c-t100 the extremely high rate for c to t or better u considering we are dealing with an rna virus is in agreement with the involvement of host apobec-like editing mechanisms as proposed in recent works di giorgio et al 2020  besides not being the focus of this paper these rates provide further evidence that hosts mutagen systems may play an important role in the evolution of sars-cov-2 and its detection by the immune system the phylogenetic tree integrated with additional information is reported in figure 7  with different coloring schemes and together with an evolutionary model summarizing how the different variants configurations are likely related to each other when considering the information about the residues found at the seven positions on which we are focusing hereinafter variants configurations vcs as in figure 7a  we find that the phylogenetic clades correspond to the six most frequent ones accounting for over 963 of the sequences that is rgtlpdl rgtlpds rgtfpdl krtllgl rgtllgl rgillgl -obtained by linking the variant residues in the order protein nucleocapsid sites 203 and 204 polyprotein sites 265 3606 and 4715 spike site 614 and orf8 site 84 for this reason hereinafter we will use clades a to f interchangeably with the vcs written above we are aware that the correlation is not perfect as can be seen by the presence of additional but low frequency variants within each clade or the presence of vc misplaced with respect to their major clade misplaced sequences can be a consequence of insufficient phylogenetic signal or of convergent evolution for instance as anticipated above one of the chinese sequences carrying spike variant 614g vc rgtlpgs is indeed contained within clade b rgtlpds indicating convergent evolution with the spike d614g variant in clades d e f or maybe an artifact however the limited number of similar cases supports our simplification and the correspondence among clades in the tree and vcs our multi-alignment contains one sequence annotated as bat coronavirus epiisl402131 which provides a rooting of the phylogenetic tree that falls in clade b and indeed contains most of the sequences obtained in china at the beginning of the epidemy  figure 6 panel b  the tree has two main radiations one corresponding to variants configurations rgtlpdl rgtlpds rgtfpdl and one to krtllgl rgtllgl rgillgl therefore the main partition of the tree corresponds to the identity of residues at position 614 of the spike and 4715 of the polyprotein the two radiations are present at different frequencies in the same countries with the notable exception of chinese sequences within radiation 2 except for epiisl422425 the only sequence with a rgtllgl pattern sequenced in china that is also present in the phylogenetic tree indicated in figure 7a  this suggests that while most of the diversification of radiation 1 took place in china and was then exported outside the ancestor of radiation 2 travelled outside china early to start a diversification in the countries where it arrived this hypothesis is in agreement with the fact that epiisl422425 is placed very close to the root of the branch leading to radiation 2 indicating it may indeed represent a strain closely related to the true radiation 2 ancestor these observations raise important questions 1 about the identity and movements of the first individual carrying the ancestral radiation 2 variant outside china 2 on the timing of the epidemic but most importantly 3 the reason why it did not increase in frequency in china but elsewhere following the topology of the tree we propose an evolutionary model figure 7c  whereby the ancestral bat variants configuration rgtvpds or any other present in the presently unknown animal host evolved into rgtlpds and from this to rgtlpdl we stress that this likely took place through unobserved stateshosts as the root branch length is close to the total length of the tree and therefore we do not consider mutation v3606l in the polyprotein full sequence as an adaptation to the human host the latter originated rgtfpdl on one side and the ancestor of radiation 2 rgtllgl that originated both krtllgl through kg unfit strains and later rgillgl given the almost perfect agreement of the tree with the variants configurations we analysed the geographical distribution and the time profiles of the seven sites at once similar to what is done for mlst-based classification of pathogens in figure  8a we show the time profiles of the relative abundance of sequences belonging to the 6 clades clearly showing not only the appearance and increase of the novel clades but most importantly the gradual disappearance of sequences belonging to clade a see also supplementary movies 2 and 3 when focusing on single clades across all macro-regions previously defined we find a heterogeneous situation with different variants increasing in time in different countries however we can see that all vcs with a proline at position 4715 of the polyprotein and an aspartate at position 614 of the spike almost disappear in time remaining abundant only in south asia and oceania in the rest of the world only vcs with a leucine and a glycine at those positions remain in the last interval of our time range after replacing the existing vcs this is indeed clear from figure 8c showing that vc for clade a rgtlpdl is no more present in the interval april 10 to 20 2020 south asia is particular because it is the only area where vcs of radiation 2 rgtllglkrtllglrgillgl are present for some time but then disappear with a re-increase of clade c rgtfpdl this may suggest these variants have equal phenotypic characteristics but as written above we cannot exclude differential fitness depending on hosts haplotypes by calculating the shannon index for sequences within the same intervals of times used to track the changes in frequency of the variants we were able to trace the evolution of diversity in different places peaks indicate the emergence from outside or by evolution of pre-existing strains of variants and their increase in frequency values maintaining a high shannon index correspond to situations where different variants coexist at comparable frequencies while a decrease after a peak means that after the appearance of one or more new variants  clades one of them novel or old takes over -reducing the variability we also indicate the first sampled sequence for each of the six clades variability increases when a new variant appears then it stays more or less stable when the existing variants maintain their relative frequencies however if one of the variants becomes dominant then variability decreases again after a peak increasing variability in time means that the arrival of novel variants continues steadily or that the existing ones become more homogeneous in frequency in this work we identified seven positions in coding sequences of the sars-cov-2 genome that are characterized by a different pattern of amino acids when comparing italian sequences with the global trends around the world further analysis revealed that these sites are not peculiar of italian strains and that different combinations of these variants are present at varying relative frequencies in different geographic areas we found that the combination of these residues identifies six abundant configurations that corresponds to 6 phylogenetic clades and that cover over 96 of all sequences this suggests that the characterization of these positions can represent a fast and portable method for the sars-cov-2 typing but novel variants are emerging that might eventually take over the old ones through mutations at additional sites using this approach we were able to follow the evolution of the virus over time among continents showing that the different clades evolved in different moments and that their frequencies vary among continents these sites are also the most variable among all available sars-cov-2 sequences raising intriguing questions about their functional effects variants with a leucine at position 4715 of the polyprotein together with a glycine at position 614 of the spike underwent an increase in frequency since the end of january in most countries overcoming the original haplotypes mutations that might affect the structure of the spike protein are of primary interest since many vaccine candidates and serological tests rely on the conformation of this protein who 2020a this and other works also explore the hypothesis that the variants may indeed provide a selective advantage to the virus clade prevalence in different countries could be used to check for mortality rate differences and association with variants but as the rates depend on many other factors different screening strategies different ways to define an individual infected and so on we feel premature discussing such correlations once the numbers will be standardized for different countries this kind of associations if present will clearly emerge moreover to really clarify these issues experimental data is required such as for instance in the form of tninsertion mutagenesis as performed on other viruses in the past fulton et al 2017  followed by competition experiments in in vitro cultures or the design of genomes carrying well-defined changes this would allow to understand how the virus tolerate mutations at different sites and might provide information on the importance of different

9
 it also shows that the whole genomes of the three sarscov2 strains isolated from patients in northern italy and characterized by us are closely related to each other as well as to the other two published italian sequences and the german finnish mexican and brazilian sequences all of which formed a highly supported clade the german sequence at the outgroup of the clade came from a covid19 outbreak reported between 20 and 24 january and occurring after business meetings with a shanghai business woman who tested positive after returning to china
10
 our tmrca estimate showed that the root of clade a was in the month of january 2020 a period compatible with this event however our data do not allow us to make any hypotheses concerning the possible routes followed by the virus to reach italy because given the limited number of sparsely sampled sequences in the tree
11
 it is impossible to infer the directionality of transmission and this means that multiple independent importations to europe cannot be excluded our data suggest that sarscov2 virus entered northern italy between the second half of january and early february 2020 which is weeks before the first italian case of covid19 was identified and therefore long before the current containment measures were taken interestingly although they were sampled in the same area on the same day the genomes isolated from these three patients have a number of different mainly synonymous substitutions in particular one patient living near the municipality in which the highest number of cases was recorded showed a high degree of genomic heterogeneity thus suggesting considerable genetic drift in conclusion our data show that the sarscov2 isolates infecting the italian patients involved in the early epidemic in northern italy and those isolated from other european and latin american patients reporting contacts with italy are closely related to the strain isolated during one of the first european clusters observed in bavaria in late january 2020

 on the basis of the phylogenetic analysis alone we cannot exclude possibly multiple introductions in germany and italy from china or other countries but the epidemiological data showing that the first cases in germany preceded the first cases in italy by almost a month suggest that the strain entered germany before italy finally as we have characterized only three genomes so far we cannot exclude the presence of other different strains in italy that may be the result of multiple introductions further epidemiological and molecular studies of a larger sample are needed to clarify these issues the authors declare that there are no conflict of interests al gz and mg conceived and designed the study lm ar db sr gr sa and mg were involved in patient care and the collection of biological materials al ab mt ag and cb performed the experiments gz al and ab made the phylogenetic analyses al gz ab sr and mg wrote the first draft of the manuscript all of the authors contributed to revising the manuscript and read and approved the submitted version  probable pangolin origin of sars-cov-2 associated with the covid-19 outbreak tao zhang qunfu wu zhigang zhang   to confirm our assumption we downloaded raw rna sequencing rna-seq data sra prjna573298 for those two lung samples from the sra and conducted consistent quality control and contaminant removal as described by lius study 1 we found 1882 clean reads from the lung08 sample that mapped to the sars-cov-2 reference genome genbank mn908947 6 and covered 7602 of the sars-cov-2 genome we performed de novo assembly of those reads and obtained 36 contigs with lengths ranging from 287 bp to 2187 bp with a mean length of 700 bp via blast analysis against proteins from 2845 cov reference genomes including ratg13 sars-cov-2s and other known covs we found that 22 contigs were best matched to sars-cov-2s 706100 amino acid identity average 9541 and that 12 contigs matched to bat sars-cov-like cov 927100 amino acid identity average 9748 table s1 these results indicate that the malayan pangolin might carry a novel cov here named pangolin-cov that is similar to sars-cov-2 using a reference-guided scaffolding approach we created a pangolin-cov draft genome 19587 bp based on the above 34 contigs to reduce the effect of raw read errors on scaffolding quality small fragments that aligned against the reference genome with a length less than 25 bp were manually discarded if they were unable to be covered by any large fragments or reference genome remapping 1882 reads against the draft genome resulted in 9999 genome coverage coverage depth range 1x47x figure 1
a the mean coverage depth was 771x across the whole genome which was two times higher than the lowest common 3x read coverage depth for snp calling based on low-coverage sequencing in the 1000 genomes project pilot phase 7 similar coverage levels are also sufficient to detect rare or low-abundance microbial species from metagenomic datasets 8 indicating that our assembled pangolin-cov draft genome is reliable for further analyses based on simplot analysis 9 pangolin-cov showed high overall genome sequence identity to ratg13 9055 and sars-cov-2 9102 throughout the genome figure 1b although there was a higher identity 962 between sars-cov-2 and ratg13 3 other sars-cov-like covs similar to pangolin-cov were bat sarsr-cov zxc21 8565 and bat sarsr-cov zc45 8501 while this manuscript was under review two similar preprint studies found that covs in pangolins shared 903 10 and 924 11 dna identity with sars-cov-2 approximating the 9102 identity to sars-cov-2 observed here and supporting our findings taken together these results indicate that pangolin-cov might be the common origin of sars-cov-2 and ratg13 the pangolin-cov genome organization was characterized by sequence alignment against sars-cov-2 genbank mn908947 and ratg13 the pangolin-cov genome consists of six major open reading frames orfs common to covs and four other accessory genes figure 1c table s2 further analysis indicated that pangolin-cov genes aligned to sars-cov-2 genes with coverage ranging from 458 to 100 average coverage 769 pangolin-cov genes shared high average nucleotide and amino acid identity with both sars-cov-2 genbank mn908947 932 nucleotide941 amino acid identity and ratg13 928 nucleotide935 amino acid identity genes figure 1c table s2 surprisingly some pangolin-cov genes showed higher amino acid sequence identity to sars-cov-2 genes than to ratg13 genes including orf1b 734728 the spike s protein 975954 orf7a 969936 and orf10 973946 the high s protein amino acid identity implies functional similarity between pangolin-cov and sars-cov-2 to determine the evolutionary relationships among pangolin-cov sars-cov-2 and previously identified covs we estimated phylogenetic trees based on the nucleotide sequences of the whole-genome sequence rna-dependent rna polymerase gene rdrp non-structural protein genes orf1a and orf1b and main structural proteins encoded by the s and m genes in all phylogenies pangolin-cov ratg13 and sars-cov-2 were clustered into a well-supported group here named the sars-cov-2 group figures 2
 s1 and s2 this group represents a novel betacoronavirus group within this group ratg13 and sars-cov-2 were grouped together and pangolin-cov was their closest common ancestor however whether the basal position of the sars-cov-2 group is sarsr-cov zxc21 andor sarsr-cov zc45 is still under debate such debate also occurred in both the wu et al 6 and zhou et al 3 studies a possible explanation is a past history of recombination in the betacoronavirus group 6 it is noteworthy that the discovered evolutionary relationships of covs shown by the whole genome rdrp gene and s gene were highly consistent with those exhibited by complete genome information in the zhou et al study 3 this correspondence indicates that our pangolin-cov draft genome has enough genomic information to trace the true evolutionary position of pangolin-cov in covs the cov s protein consists of two subunits s1 and s2 mediates infection of receptor-expressing host cells and is a critical target for antiviral neutralizing antibodies 12 s1 contains a receptor-binding domain rbd that consists of an approximately 193 amino acid fragment which is responsible for recognizing and binding the cell surface receptor 13 14 zhou et al experimentally confirmed that sars-cov-2 is able to use human chinese horseshoe bat civet and pig ace2 proteins as an entry receptor in ace2-expressing cells 3 suggesting that the rbd of sars-cov-2 mediates infection in humans and other animals to gain sequence-level insight into the pathogenic potential of pangolin-cov we first investigated the amino acid variation pattern of the s1 proteins from pangolin-cov sars-cov-2 ratg13 and other representative sarssarsr-covs the amino acid phylogenetic tree showed that the s1 protein of pangolin-cov is more closely related to that of 2019-cov than to that of ratg13 within the rbd we further found that pangolin-cov and sars-cov-2 were highly conserved with only one amino acid change 500h500q figure 3
 which is not one of the five key residues involved in the interaction with human ace2 3 14 these results indicate that pangolin-cov could have pathogenic potential similar to that of sars-cov-2 in contrast ratg13 has changes in 17 amino acid residues 4 of which are among the key amino acid residues figure 3 there are evidences suggesting that the change of 472l sars-cov to 486f sars-cov-2 corresponding to the second key amino acid residue change in figure 3 may make stronger van der waals contact with m82 ace2 15 besides the major substitution of 404v in the sars-cov-rbd with 417k in the sars-cov-2-rbd see 420 alignment position in figure 3 and without amino acid change between the sars-cov-2 and ratg13 may result in tighter association because of the salt bridge formation between 417k and 30d of ace2 15 nevertheless further investigation is still needed about whether those mutations affect the affinity for ace2 whether the pangolin-cov or ratg13 are potential infectious agents to humans remains to be determined the s1s2 cleavage site in the s protein is also an important determinant of the transmissibility and pathogenicity of sars-covsars-covr viruses 16 the trimetric s protein is processed at the s1s2 cleavage site by host cell proteases during infection following cleavage also known as priming the protein is divided into an n-terminal s1-ectodomain that recognizes a cognate cell surface receptor and a c-terminal s2-membrane anchored protein that drives fusion of the viral envelope with a cellular membrane we found that the sars-cov-2 s protein contains a putative furin recognition motif prrarsv figure 4
 similar to that of mers-cov which has a prsvrsv motif that is likely cleaved by furin 16 17 during virus egress conversely the furin sequence motif at the s1s2 site is missing in the s protein of pangolin-cov and all other sarssarsr-covs this difference indicates the sars-cov-2 might gain a distinct mechanism to promote its entry into host cells 18 interestingly aside from mers-cov similar sequence patterns to the sars-cov-2 were also presented in some members of alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus and gammcoronavirus 19 raising an interesting question regarding whether this furin sequence motif in sars-cov-2 might be derived from those existing s proteins of other coronaviruses or alternatively if the sars-cov-2 might be the recombinant of pangolin-cov or ratg13 and other coronaviruses with a similar furin recognition motif in the unknown intermediate host the n protein is the most abundant protein in covs the n protein is a highly immunogenic phosphoprotein and it is normally very conserved the cov n protein is often used as a marker in diagnostic assays to gain further insight into the diagnostic potential of pangolin-cov we investigated the amino acid variation pattern of the n proteins from pangolin-cov sars-cov-2 ratg13 and other representative sars-covs phylogenetic analysis based on the n protein supported the classification of pangolin-cov as a sister taxon of sars-cov-2 and ratg13 figure s3 we further found seven amino acid mutations that differentiated our defined sar-cov-2 group covs 12n 26 g 27s 104d 218a 335t 346n and 350q from other known sars-covs 12s 26d 27n 104e 218t 335h 346q and 350n two amino acid sites 38p and 268q are shared by pangolin-cov ratg13 and sars-covs which are mutated to 38s and 268a in sars-cov-2 only one amino acid residue shared by pangolin-cov and other sars-covs 129e is consistently different in both sars-cov-2 and ratg13 129d the observed amino acid changes in the n protein would be useful for developing antigens with improved sensitivity for sars-cov-2 serological detection based on published metagenomic data this study provides the first report on a potential closely related kin pangolin-cov of sars-cov-2 which was discovered from dead malayan pangolins after extensive rescue efforts aside from ratg13 the pangolin-cov is the cov most closely related to sars-cov-2 due to unavailability of the original sample we did not perform further experiments to confirm our findings including pcr validation serological detection or even isolation of the virus particles our discovered pangolin-cov genome showed 9102 nucleotide identity with the sars-cov-2 genome however whether pangolin species are good candidates for sars-cov-2 origin is still under debate considering the wide spread of sarsr-covs in natural reservoirs such as bats camels and pangolins our findings would be meaningful for finding novel intermediate sars-cov-2 hosts to block interspecies transmission

research in context
evidence before this study
the causal agent of an outbreak of severe pneumonia in wuhan china is a novel coronavirus provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov the first cases were reported in december 2019
added value of this study
we have described the genomic characteristics of 2019-ncov and similarities and differences to other coronaviruses including the virus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic of 200203 genome sequences of 2019-ncov sampled from nine patients who were among the early cases of this severe infection are almost genetically identical which suggests very recent emergence of this virus in humans and that the outbreak was detected relatively rapidly 2019-ncov is most closely related to other betacoronaviruses of bat origin indicating that these animals are the likely reservoir hosts for this emerging viral pathogen
implications of all the available evidence
by documenting the presence of 2019-ncov in a sample of patients our study extends previous evidence that this virus has led to the novel pneumonia that has caused severe disease in wuhan and other geographical localities currently available data suggest that 2019-ncov infected the human population from a bat reservoir although it remains unclear if a currently unknown animal species acted as an intermediate host between bats and humans
 in late december 2019 several patients with viral pneumonia were found to be epidemiologically associated with the huanan seafood market in wuhan in the hubei province of china where a number of non-aquatic animals such as birds and rabbits were also on sale before the outbreak a novel human-infecting coronavirus10 11 provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov was identified with use of next-generation sequencing as of jan 28 2020 china has reported more than 5900 confirmed and more than 9000 suspected cases of 2019-ncov infection across 33 chinese provinces or municipalities with 106 fatalities in addition 2019-ncov has now been reported in thailand japan south korea malaysia singapore and the usa infections in medical workers and family clusters were also reported and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed12 most of the infected patients had a high fever and some had dyspnoea with chest radiographs revealing invasive lesions in both lungs12 13
 we report the epidemiological data of nine inpatients from at least three hospitals in wuhan who were diagnosed with viral pneumonia of unidentified cause using next-generation sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples and cultured isolates from these patients 2019-ncov was found we describe the genomic characterisation of ten genomes of this novel virus providing important information on the origins and cell receptor binding of the virus nine patients with viral pneumonia and negative for common respiratory pathogens who presented to at least three hospitals in wuhan were included in this study eight of the patients had visited the huanan seafood market before the onset of illness and one patient wh04 did not visit the market but stayed in a hotel near the market between dec 23 and dec 27 2019 table

from the nine patients samples analysed eight complete and two partial genome sequences of 2019-ncov were obtained these data have been deposited in the china national microbiological data center accession number nmdc10013002 and genome accession numbers nmdc60013002-01 to nmdc60013002-10 and the data from bgi have been deposited in the china national genebank accession numbers cna000733235 based on these genomes we developed a real-time pcr assay and tested the original clinical samples from the bgi wh01 wh02 wh03 and wh04 again to determine their threshold cycle ct values table the remaining samples were tested by a different real-time pcr assay developed by the chinese cdc with ct values ranging from 2285 to 3241 table these results confirmed the presence of 2019-ncov in the patients bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples or cultured viruses of nine patients were used for next-generation sequencing after removing host human reads de novo assembly was done and the contigs obtained used as queries to search the non-redundant protein database some contigs identified in all the samples were closely related to the bat sars-like betacoronavirus bat-sl-covzc45 betacoronavirus23 bat-sl-covzc45 was then used as the reference genome and reads from each pool were mapped to it generating consensus sequences corresponding to all the pools these consensus sequences were then used as new reference genomes eight complete genomes and two partial genomes from samples wh19002 and wh02 table were obtained the de novo assembly of the clean reads from all the pools did not identify any other long contigs that corresponded to other viruses at high abundance the eight complete genomes were nearly identical across the whole genome with sequence identity above 9998 indicative of a very recent emergence into the human population figure 1a
 the largest nucleotide difference was four mutations notably the sequence identity between the two virus genomes from the same patient wh19001 from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and wh19005 from cell culture was more than 9999 with 100 identity at the amino acid level in addition the partial genomes from samples wh02 and wh19002 also had nearly 100 identity to the complete genomes across the aligned gene regions a blastn search of the complete genomes of 2019-ncov revealed that the most closely related viruses available on genbank were bat-sl-covzc45 sequence identity 8799 query coverage 99 and another sars-like betacoronavirus of bat origin bat-sl-covzxc21 accession number mg77293423 8723 query coverage 98 in five gene regions e m 7 n and 14 the sequence identities were greater than 90 with the highest being 987 in the e gene figure 2a
 the s gene of 2019-ncov exhibited the lowest sequence identity with bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 at only around 75 in addition the sequence identity in 1b about 86 was lower than that in 1a about 90 figure 2a most of the encoded proteins exhibited high sequence identity between 2019-ncov and the related bat-derived coronaviruses figure 2a the notable exception was the spike protein with only around 80 sequence identity and protein 13 with 732 sequence identity notably the 2019-ncov strains were less genetically similar to sars-cov about 79 and mers-cov about 50 the similarity between 2019-ncov and related viruses was visualised using simplot software with the 2019-ncov consensus sequence employed as the query figure 2b comparison of the predicted coding regions of 2019-ncov showed that they possessed a similar genomic organisation to bat-sl-covzc45 bat-sl-covzxc21 and sars-cov figure 1b at least 12 coding regions were predicted including 1ab s 3 e m 7 8 9 10b n 13 and 14 figure 1b the lengths of most of the proteins encoded by 2019-ncov bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 were similar with only a few minor insertions or deletions a notable difference was a longer spike protein encoded by 2019-ncov compared with the bat sars-like coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov figure 1b phylogenetic analysis of 2019-ncov and its closely related reference genomes as well as representative betacoronaviruses revealed that the five subgenera formed five well supported branches figure 3
 the subgenus sarbecovirus could be classified into three well supported clades two sars-cov-related strains from rhinolophus sp from bulgaria accession number gu190215 and kenya ky352407 formed clade 1 the ten 2019-ncov from wuhan and the two bat-derived sars-like strains from zhoushan in eastern china bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 formed clade 2 which was notable for the long branch separating the human and bat viruses and sars-cov strains from humans and many genetically similar sars-like coronaviruses from bats collected from southwestern china formed clade 3 with bat-derived coronaviruses also falling in the basal positions figure 3 in addition 2019-ncov was distinct from sars-cov in a phylogeny of the complete rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene appendix p 2 this evidence indicates that 2019-ncov is a novel betacoronavirus from the subgenus sarbecovirus as the sequence similarity plot revealed changes in genetic distances among viruses across the 2019-ncov genome we did additional phylogenetic analyses of the major encoding regions of representative members of the subgenus sarbecovirus consistent with the genome phylogeny 2019-ncov bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 clustered together in trees of the 1a and spike genes appendix p 3 by contrast 2019-ncov did not cluster with bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 in the 1b tree but instead formed a distinct clade with sars-cov bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 appendix p 3 indicative of potential recombination events in 1b although these probably occurred in the bat coronaviruses rather than 2019-ncov phylogenetic analysis of the 2019-ncov genome excluding 1b revealed similar evolutionary relationships as the full-length viral genome appendix p 3 the envelope spike s protein mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion24 and is crucial for determining host tropism and transmission capacity25 26 generally the spike protein of coronaviruses is functionally divided into the s1 domain especially positions 318510 of sars-cov responsible for receptor binding and the s2 domain responsible for cell membrane fusion27 the 2019-ncov s2 protein showed around 93 sequence identity with bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21much higher than that of the s1 domain which had only around 68 identity with these bat-derived viruses both the n-terminal domain and the c-terminal domain of the s1 domain can bind to host receptors28 we inspected amino acid variation in the spike protein among the sarbecovirus coronaviruses figure 4
 although 2019-ncov and sars-cov fell within different clades figure 3 they still possessed around 50 conserved amino acids in s1 whereas most of the bat-derived viruses displayed mutational differences figure 4 most of these positions in the c-terminal domain figure 4 in addition a number of deletion events including positions 455457 463464 and 485497 were found in the bat-derived strains figure 4 the receptor-binding domain of betacoronaviruses which directly engages the receptor is commonly located in the c-terminal domain of s1 as in sars-cov29 for lineage b and mers-cov30 31 and batcov hku432 for lineage c figure 5
 through phylogenetic analysis of the receptor-binding domain of four different lineages of betacoronaviruses appendix p 4 we found that although 2019-ncov was closer to bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 at the whole-genome level the receptor-binding domain of 2019-ncov fell within lineage b and was closer to that of sars-cov figure 5a the three-dimensional structure of 2019-ncov receptor-binding domain was modelled using the swiss-model program33 with the sars-cov receptor-binding domain structure protein data bank id 2dd834 as a template this analysis suggested that like other betacoronaviruses the receptor-binding domain was composed of a core and an external subdomain figure 5bd notably the external subdomain of the 2019-ncov receptor-binding domain was more similar to that of sars-cov this result suggests that 2019-ncov might also use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a cell receptor however we also observed that several key residues responsible for the binding of the sars-cov receptor-binding domain to the ace2 receptor were variable in the 2019-ncov receptor-binding domain including asn439 asn501 gln493 gly485 and phe486 2019-ncov numbering from genomic surveillance of clinical samples from patients with viral pneumonia in wuhan china a novel coronavirus termed 2019-ncov has been identified10 11 our phylogenetic analysis of 2019-ncov sequenced from nine patients samples showed that the virus belongs to the subgenus sarbecovirus 2019-ncov was more similar to two bat-derived coronavirus strains bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 than to known human-infecting coronaviruses including the virus that caused the sars outbreak of 2003 epidemiologically eight of the nine patients in our study had a history of exposure to the huanan seafood market in wuhan suggesting that they might have been in close contact with the infection source at the market however one patient had never visited the market although he had stayed in a hotel near the market before the onset of their illness this finding suggests either possible droplet transmission or that the patient was infected by a currently unknown source evidence of clusters of infected family members and medical workers has now confirmed the presence of human-to-human transmission12 clearly this infection is a major public health concern particularly as this outbreak coincides with the peak of the chinese spring festival travel rush during which hundreds of millions of people will travel through china as a typical rna virus the average evolutionary rate for coronaviruses is roughly 104 nucleotide substitutions per site per year1 with mutations arising during every replication cycle it is therefore striking that the sequences of 2019-ncov from different patients described here were almost identical with greater than 999 sequence identity this finding suggests that 2019-ncov originated from one source within a very short period and was detected relatively rapidly however as the virus transmits to more individuals constant surveillance of mutations arising is needed phylogenetic analysis showed that bat-derived coronaviruses fell within all five subgenera of the genus betacoronavirus moreover bat-derived coronaviruses fell in basal positions in the subgenus sarbecovirus with 2019-ncov most closely related to bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 which were also sampled from bats23 these data are consistent with a bat reservoir for coronaviruses in general and for 2019-ncov in particular however despite the importance of bats several facts suggest that another animal is acting as an intermediate host between bats and humans first the outbreak was first reported in late december 2019 when most bat species in wuhan are hibernating second no bats were sold or found at the huanan seafood market whereas various non-aquatic animals including mammals were available for purchase third the sequence identity between 2019-ncov and its close relatives bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 was less than 90 which is reflected in the relatively long branch between them hence bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 are not direct ancestors of 2019-ncov fourth in both sars-cov and mers-cov bats acted as the natural reservoir with another animal masked palm civet for sars-cov35 and dromedary camels for mers-cov36 acting as an intermediate host with humans as terminal hosts therefore on the basis of current data it seems likely that the 2019-ncov causing the wuhan outbreak might also be initially hosted by bats and might have been transmitted to humans via currently unknown wild animals sold at the huanan seafood market previous studies have uncovered several receptors that different coronaviruses bind to such as ace2 for sars-cov29 and cd26 for mers-cov30 our molecular modelling showed structural similarity between the receptor-binding domains of sars-cov and 2019-ncov therefore we suggest that 2019-ncov might use ace2 as the receptor despite the presence of amino acid mutations in the 2019-ncov receptor-binding domain although a previous study using hela cells expressing ace2 proteins showed that 2019-ncov could employ the ace2 receptor37 whether these mutations affect ace2 binding or change receptor tropism requires further study recombination has been seen frequently in coronaviruses1 as expected we detected recombination in the sarbecoviruses analysed here our results suggest that recombination events are complex and are more likely occurring in bat coronaviruses than in 2019-ncov hence despite its occurrence recombination is probably not the reason for emergence of this virus although this inference might change if more closely related animal viruses are identified in conclusion we have described the genomic structure of a seventh human coronavirus that can cause severe pneumonia and have shed light on its origin and receptor-binding properties more generally the disease outbreak linked to 2019-ncov again highlights the hidden virus reservoir in wild animals and their potential to occasionally spill over into human populations data are available on various websites and have been made publicly available more information can be found in the first paragraph of the results section  evolutionary trajectory for the emergence of novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 saif rehman ur laiba shafique awais ihsan qingyou liu   the global community is at the peak of emerging bugs even though the earlier scares of zoonotic viruses were not retained the re-emergence of viral agents is a great threat and challenge for the global health community 1 the global community has witnessed that over the last two decades the world has experienced three outbreaks of coronaviruses with elevated morbidity rates in december 2019 cases of mysterious pneumonia with unknown etiology were reported in wuhan hubei a province of china which got the attention of the world 2 researchers and the chinese government responded swiftly and after deep etiological and sequencing investigation the international committee on taxonomy of viruses entitled it as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 3 the sars-cov-2 belongs to betacoronavirus a member of the subfamily coronavirinae having four genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus in family coronaviridae categorized in the order nidovirales figure 1 generally covs are broadly distributed among humans birds and other mammals usually causing hepatic enteric neurologic and respiratory syndromes 45 four 229e oc43 nl63 and hku1 out of six human disease-causing covs are widespread and in immune-competent individuals they normally cause common cold symptoms 6 two other strains that were linked with fatal illness were zoonotic in origin including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 7 in 20022003 the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome occurred due to sars-cov in the guangdong province of china and quickly became pandemic to twenty-seven countries infecting 8098 people with 774 deaths and was declared the first endemic of the 21st century 8 a decade later in 2012 mers-cov caused a severe respiratory disease that emerged in the middle east with 2494 confirmed human infection cases and 858 deaths 9 in both epidemics bats were identified as the original source of sars and mers-covs the rate of human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 appears higher than earlier outbreaks of covs via cough andor sneezing droplets emitted from an infected person sars-cov-2 has appeared more transmissible but less deadly than sars-cov to date worldwide 194029 confirmed cases of human infection and 7873 deaths across 164 countries have been recorded 10 in natural populations mutations recombination and reassortment are the strategic evolutionary process considered for genetic diversity the high incidence of homologous rna recombination is one of the most fascinating features of covs replication 11121314 kottier et al reported the first experimental-based recombination evidence for avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv 15 although additional studies have also concluded that ibv evolves through recombination 161718192021 moreover murine hepatitis virus mhv evolution through recombination was also practically confirmed 22 this encouraged exploration of the probable role of recombination in the sars-cov emergence the current condition might appear as a vulnerable factor for severe disease and may impose serious health threats to the human due to wide distribution with the increasing prevalence of covs frequent genomes recombination large genetic diversity and high human-animal interface behavior covs might be emerged from time-to-time in humans due to occasional spillover and recurrent cross-species infectious events 723 as an emerging virus very limited information is available to describe the genetic diversity evolutionary ancestors and possible routes of transmission of sars-cov-2 from the natural reservoir to humans this study aimed to track the evolutionary ancestors of sars-cov-2 and different evolutionary strategies mutations recombination or reassortment that were genetically adapted by the novel coronavirus it is the utmost priority of the scientific community to minimize the public health risk through tracing the origin and natural inhabitants of sars-cov-2 to restrict human-to-human and cross-species transmission to understand the genetic diversity relationship and potential origin of sars-cov-2 with the other members of coronavirinae we have performed molecular phylogenetic analysis with a number of covs whole-genome sequences obtained from national center for biotechnology information ncbi table s1 the phylogenetic tree results demonstrate that all the covs responsible for the outbreak of concentrated pneumonia belong to the genera betacoronavirus figure 2 all the sars-cov-2 clade grouped with the cluster of sarssars-like covs with bat covs hku9-1 hku9-2 hku9-3 and hku9-4 as an immediate ancestor figure 2 the interior shared neighbors include sars-cov ns-1 sars-cov sino1-11 sars-cov gz02 and sars-cov gd01 and they were the human-infecting covs figure 2 the whole genome-based phylogenetic analysis presented that two bat sars-like covs zxc21 and zc45 were the closest relatives of sars-cov-2 most of the inner and outer joint neighbors of sars-cov-2 were found to have bats as their natural reservoir including bat sars-cov wiv1 in rhinolophus sinicus bat sars-cov hku3-1 and bat cov hku9-3 in rousettus bats consequently the bat would be the convenient native host of sars-cov-2 thus the probable intermediate host for the transmission cascade used by sars-cov-2 from bats to humans would be the same as that used by other sars-cov covs genome is comprised of single-stranded positive-sense rna with 5-cap and 3-poly-a tail figure 3 at the 5 end non-structure protein including poly-proteins pp1a and pp1b are directly translated from the genomic rna strand other structure proteins are envelope e nucleocapsid n membrane m and spike s proteins in addition covs encoded some special accessory proteins like 3ab 4ab 5 6 7ab etc proteins figure 3 wuhan-hu-1-cov in the phylogenetic tree was uniquely positioned with sarssars-like covs that share a common ancestor which resembled bat coronavirus hku9-1 hku9-2 hku9-3 and hku9-4 during the course of evolution various recombinant events possibly obscure the path substantially by the patterns of genomic homologous diversity thus we compared the e m n and s genomic regions of wuhan-hu-1-cov as representative of sars-cov-2 sars and mers-cov figures s1s4 wuhan-hu-1-cov genome had more sequence homology with sars-cov table 1 figure 4 as compared to mers-cov although high genetic diversity was found between wuhan-hu-1-cov and sars-cov table 1 in the e m n and s genes low sequence homology between wuhan-hu-1-cov and mers-cov was observed figures s1s4 examining the envelop e protein disclosed that the sequence conservation of wuhan-hu-1-cov in view of sars-cov was more than mers cov figure s1 wuhan-hu-1-cov shared 93 amino acid sequence homology with 7 genetic variation in the e protein with the sars-cov table 1 furthermore the amino acid sequence of the membrane m protein of wuhan-hu-1-cov sars-cov and mers-cov were compared figure s2 in wuhan-hu-1-cov about 92 conservation of amino acid sequences and 17 mutations 8 with respect to sars-cov were observed table 1 further we analyzed the nucleocapsid n protein which is a more abundant protein in covs with no exception about 93 of the amino acid sequence identity of the n protein for wuhan-hu-1-cov with sars-cov table 1 with 7 genetic variations was found while a less conserved sequence percentage was found with mers-cov figure s3 the conserved nature of sars-cov-2 along with other covs was an important factor to trace the evolutionary pathway of the cov and would be important to limit the outbreak of pneumonia-related viruses in covs the n protein was crucial for rna transcription and viral assembly disrupting the host cell and is also important to evaluate the virus-host adaptation and drug design further we compared spike glycoprotein s protein of wuhan-hu-1-cov sars-cov and mers-cov figure s4 it was observed that during the viral infection s protein underwent several drastic changes the s protein of wuhan-hu-1-cov was more prone to mutations particularly the amino acid sequence represented 19 alteration with four major insertions and 81 homology in contrast to sars table 1 figure 4ab additionally we found that the wuhan-hu-1-cov s protein was vulnerable to mutations especially in spike protein-cell receptor interface-associated amino acids sars-cov used a receptor-binding domain that stretched between 306527 amino acid sequences we compared the receptor-binding domain of sars-cov and wuhan-hu-1-cov and we found that 73 of conserved amino acid regions were observed in wuhan-hu-1-cov figure s5 in the meantime similar conservation patterns of the amino acid were also found in the binding receptor motif extended 424494 amino acid residues used by sars-cov to bind human ace2 figure s6 it was suggested that a significant affinity of wuhan-hu-1-cov with ace2 imposed high public health risk for humans by transmission through the s protein-ace2 binding channel subsequently homology protein modeling was used to predict the s protein structure of wuhan-hu-1-cov via the structure of sars-cov spike glycoprotein pdb c5xlrc figure 4bc nine regions in complete genome nucleotide sequences of wuhan-hu-1-cov were detected as putative recombinant regions and our recombination detection program rdp analysis suggested that wuhan-hu-1-cov could be a recombinant of sars gz02 rf1 sars-like zxc21 zc45 w1v1 and mers-covs table 2 the phi-test provided significant evidence of recombination p-value  000001 moreover the similarity plot showed that the 5-genomic region of wuhan-hu-1-cov shared substantially higher similarity with sars-like covs while the 3-genomic region shared a mixture of sars and sars-like covs nucleotide sequence figure 5 taken together our study found that most of the recombination events occurred in the spike glycoprotein motif of wuhan-hu-1-cov mostly towards the 5end of the s gene only a single recombination event was identified in rna-dependent rna polymerase helicase and orf3a table 2 sars-cov-2 is a novel emerging contagious agent that found a way into human civilization the outbreak of sars-cov-2 is the third pandemic of the 21st century and the situation is still ongoing the prediction of fan et al 24 that a future sars or mers-like covs epidemic would emerge in china with a probable bat source became reality when the first case of concentrated viral pneumonia was reported on december 30 2019 in wuhan city of china 25 later on the novel coronavirus designated as sars-cov-2 was found responsible for the viral outbreak of pneumonia in wuhan 26 generally emerging and re-emerging viral infections belong to the rna family of viruses since these viruses have high mutation rates that lead to eminent environmental adaptation with rapid evolution 27 to date very little knowledge is available about sars-cov-2 to understand the genetic diversity relationship and potential origin of sars-cov-2 our molecular phylogenetic analysis predicted that sars and sars-like covs were the ancestors of sars-cov-2 two bat sars-like covs zxc21 and zc45 were the closest relatives of sars-cov-2 figure 2 consequently we found that the bat would be the convenient native host of sars-cov-2 previously it was found that several bat covs were able to cause infection in humans without any intermediate host 2829 rapid sequencing of sars-cov-2 provided an opportunity for the research community to look into its genetic diversity developing diagnostic tests and ultimately helping with vaccine production the whole-genome sequence of sars-cov-2 retained 80 nucleotide homology with sars epidemic viruses all the structural proteins were well conserved except for spike glycoprotein that showed a high rate of mutation in sars-cov-2 3031 our results demonstrated that compared with sars-cov the sars-cov-2 shares 81 amino acid similarity in spike s protein table 1 figure 4 which represented less conserved patterns of s protein than other covs like hku3-cov 32 through deep receptor-binding domain rbd analysis of sars-cov amino acids the sars-cov-2 rbd was 73 preserved comparatively to the pandemic rbd figure s5 this conservation pattern of rbd placed the sars-cov-2 between hku3-4 627 conserved a bat virus that was not capable of using the human ace2 receptor and the divergent bat cov rshc014 808 a spike known to use the human ace2 receptor for entrance 2933 moreover the binding free energies for the s-protein to human ace2 binding complexes were calculated and the binding free energy for the wuhan-hu-1-cov s-protein increased by 28 kcal mol1 when compared to the sars-cov s-protein binding representing more binding affinity to the human ace2 receptor 34 moreover a recent study revealed that a polybasic cleavage site was present at the s1 and s2 junction of sars-cov-2 that effectively allowed cleavage by furin and the other protease and took part in viral host range and infectivity 35 whereas these polybasic cleavage sites in other human beta-corona viruses have not been detected 36 experimental investigation of follis et al with sars-cov demonstrated that furin cleavage site insertion at the s1-s2 junction increases cell-cell fusion 37 additionally an effective cleavage site in the mers-cov spike motif empowers bat mers-like covs to infect human cells 38 on the other hand in avian influenza viruses quick replication and diffusion effectively acquired polybasic cleavage sites in the hemagglutinin ha protein which served a similar function to that of the coronavirus spike protein in covs insertion or recombination facilitates acquisition of transforming low-pathogenicity into highly pathogenic forms for polybasic cleavage sites 39 so far sampled pangolin beta-corona viruses and the bat beta coronaviruses do not have polybasic cleavage sites covs could have adopted a natural evolutionary mechanism to mutate and to attain the polybasic cleavage site because the virus must have both the mutations and polybasic cleavage site for appropriate human ace2 receptor binding for this purpose it required a large population density for natural selection to attain an ace2-encoding gene that is akin to the human ortholog 4041 the recent study of peng et al revealed that might it be possible that sars-cov-2 ancestors jumped into humans getting the genetic features through adaptation and remaining undetected during human-to-human transmission once it adapted these variations became pandemic and sufficiently produced a large number of cases to activate the immune system that identified it 4041 usually viruses adopt different strategies including recombination mutation and reassortment which facilitate the viruses in getting to equilibrium in the final host due to low fidelity of reverse transcriptase and rna-dependent rna polymerase rna viruses are more vulnerable to point mutations even though the point mutation rates in rna viruses are approximately 104 to 105 42 during the 2002 sars-cov epidemics three mutations per rna in each replication round were estimated 826  106 per nucleotide per day 43 often large population size and high rate of mutations in rna viruses rapidly adjust genotypes allowing for quick adaptations in a rapidly changing environment respectively mutations have a specific influence on virus reproductive fitness as positive selection drives to fix the positive fitness effects of beneficial alleles while negative selection removes lethal and deleterious alleles from a population together with these selective approaches the evolutionary routes of virus populations can be figured out across a sequence space 34 examining the genetic insight of sars and wuhan-hu-1-cov presented more than 90 sequence conservation between the e m and n protein with few numbers of point mutations table 1 whereas the higher rate of mutations in the s protein of wuhan-hu-1-cov were also observed and shared 81 identity table 1 figure 4a these results were in accordance with the results of xu et al and pradhan et al 4445 recombination and reassortment became a powerful tool of emerging viruses to get innovative antigenic combinations that might aid the course of cross-species diffusion the recombination strategy facilitates this mechanism to find a better fraction of sequence space than the mutation raising the probability of finding a genetic configuration which supports host adaptations 46 it is important to note that numerous recently emerged rna viruses which were involved in human diseases exhibited active recombination or reassortment events mostly rna viruses get entry into the new host through the cross-species transmission 47 the recombination events in viruses are in fact related to discontinuous utilization of rna polymerase involved in the transcriptional mechanism to make mrnas rna polymerase of viruses must use different rna prototypes while making negative or positive rna strands that eventually result in rna recombination that is either homologous or non-homologous 12 in rna viruses this model of recombination is called the copy-choice model of recombination 1314 in covs a high recombination rate has been reported 48 it might be due to having large genome size discontinuous transcription and sub- or fully transcriptionally active genomic length of rna the co-infection of two covs in same animal or cells can potentially facilitate crossing over in the recent past the emergence of new infectious bronchitis virus recombinant ibv a new type of cov in turkeys was reported the genome sequence revealed that the s protein gene of this virus was the recombinant of another covs 49 in the s protein the recombination event is certainly significant as it permits the virus to modify superficial antigenicity to get from the immune reconnaissance into the animals and then adapt to a human host we identified nine putative recombination patterns which encompass in terms of genes involved the spike glycoprotein rdrp helicase and orf3a six of the nine recombination regions were spotted in the s gene table 2 significantly in this study each of the recombinant regions were predicted with at least two methods table 2 according to the method of posada he recommended that one should not be dependent on a single method 50 these results were in agreement with previous reports where the recombinant event was reported between parent viruses in the avian-like and mammalian-like sars-cov evolution 5152 when segments of multiple viral genomes infect the same animal or tissue simultaneously it ultimately results in new viral progeny with a multiple parent genome set this process is termed as gene reassortment used by viruses for evolution 28 the literature suggests that a typical rna influenza a virus has eight ssrna segments and the assortment occurred among multiple influenza viruses termed as genetic shift or antigenic shift resulted in the change of influenza viral surface glycoproteinsneuraminidase thus the sequence of these virus strains diverges widely when host animal cell gets infected by confection and the progeny is developed by reassortment or recombination 27 taking this together we found that sars-cov-2 was the descendent of sarssars-like coronaviruses being a close relative of bat sars-like covs zxc21 and zc45 we confirmed that mutations in different genomic regions of sars-cov-2 have a specific influence on virus reproductive adaptability allowing genotypes to adjust and quickly adapt in a rapidly changing environment moreover for the first time we identified nine putative recombination patterns in sars-cov-2 which were undoubtedly important for evolutionary survival meanwhile permitting the virus to modify superficial antigenicity to get from immune reconnaissance into animals and then adapting to a human host with these combined natural selected strategies sars-cov-2 emerged as a novel virus in human society for molecular phylogenetic analysis the whole-genome sequences of 53 viruses including 10 sars-cov-2 were retrieved from ncbi through blastn search with wuhan-hu-1-cov being used as reference table s1 all the sequences were aligned by using mafft v 7452 online server 53 to determine the nucleotides substitution model the bayesian information criterion bic value for aligned sequences was determined using jmodel test 2 and the substitution model with minimum bic values was considered for phylogenetic inference table s2 54 the whole-genome sequence was considered as a single partition and three chains of bayesian analysis were performed by applying the gtrig model of substitution reaching the maximum allowed number of generations after discarding burin 270030000 the optimal analyses trees were pooled into a single tree file posterior probability values with majority consensus rule were visualized figure 3 was used to visualize the best tree and the likelihood phylogram was exported as a picture 55 multalin software was used to align and visualized the envelope membrane nucleocapsid and spike glycoprotein regions of sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 56 the amino acid conservation motifs of the receptor-binding domain rbd in sars-cov and sars-cov-2 genome were traced by performing muscle alignment using megax software the three-dimensional structures of spike glycoproteins of sars-cov2 and sars-cov were generated by using an online server protein homologyanalogy recognition engine v 20 phyre2 57 and the structure was visualized and marked by using pymol 58 to detect the recombination events whole-genome nucleotide sequences of seven viral strains wuhan-hu-1-cov bat sars-like including w1v1 zxc21 zc45 bat sars gz02 rf1 and mers were aligned using clustalw preliminarily maxchi and chimaera algorithms were used to detect the recombination events in the dataset by a recombination detection program rdp5 59 additionally bootscan analyses and similarity plots were performed using simplot 351 60 to confirm the rdp-suggested potential recombination events and were analyzed on the whole-genome sequence of wuhan as a query and bat sars-like sars and mers as potential parental sequences table s1 a phi statistical test was applied to evaluate the significance of recombination evidence between closely and distantly related genomes furthermore the point of recombination along with major and minor parents of the recombinant was accessed through rdp bootscan maxchi chimaera and 3seq methods 59  receptor utilization of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 1 indicates a narrower host range of sars-cov-2 than that of sars  cov ye 1 qiu wang 1 jin-yan li ce-heng liao zhi-jian zhou xing-yi ge  coronavirus pandemics have become a huge threat to the public health worldwide in the 25 recent decades typically sars-cov caused sars pandemic in 2003 and sars-26 cov-2 caused the covid-19 pandemic recently both viruses have been reported to 27 originate from bats thus direct or indirect interspecies transmission from bats to 28 humans is required for the viruses to cause pandemics receptor utilization is a key 29 factor determining the host range of viruses which is critical to the interspecies 30 transmission angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 is the receptor of both sars-31 cov and sars-cov-2 but only ace2s of certain animals can be utilized by the 32 viruses here we employed pseudovirus cell-entry assay to evaluate the receptor-33 utilizing capability of ace2s of 20 animals by the two viruses and found that sars-34 cov-2 utilized less ace2s than sars-cov indicating a narrower host range of 35 sars-cov-2 meanwhile pangolin cov another sars-related coronavirus highly 36 homologous to sars-cov-2 in its genome yet showed similar ace2 utilization profile 37 with sars-cov rather than sars-cov-2 to clarify the mechanism underlying the 38 receptor utilization we compared the amino acid sequences of the 20 ace2s and found 39 5 amino acid residues potentially critical for ace2 utilization including the n-terminal 40 20 th and 42 nd amino acids that may determine the different receptor utilization of sars-41 cov sars-cov-2 and pangolin cov our studies promote the understanding of 42 receptor utilization of pandemic coronaviruses potentially contributing to the virus 43 tracing intermediate host screening and epidemic prevention for pathogenic 44 coronaviruses 45 46 3  coronaviruses are enveloped non-segmented positive sense rna viruses in the recent 51 two decades human coronaviruses hcovs have caused to at least three major 52 pandemics and pose a huge threat to the public health worldwide 1 until now seven 53 different hcovs have been identified and all of them belong to the family 54 coronaviridae of the order nidovirales especially the species severe acute respiratory 55 syndrome-related coronavirus sarsr-cov of the genus betacoronavirus contains the 56 most pathogenic hcovs including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 57 sars-cov and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 2 58 sars-cov caused the sars pandemic in years of 2002 -2003 resulting in more than 59 8000 clinical cases with a mortality of 10 3 4  after the sars pandemic plenty of 60 research and measurements have been done to prevent the emergence and re-emergence 61 of coronavirus epidemics including transmission tracing pathogenesis studies and 62 therapy development 5 nevertheless 17 years later a novel human coronavirus 63 sars-cov-2 brought a much more severe and widespread pandemic of coronavirus 64 disease 2019 to the world and this pandemic is lasting until now 6 7 up 65 to may 25 2025 about 5 month after the first reported case of covid-19 sars-cov-66 2 has caused 5432302 confirmed infections and 342318 deaths worldwide far 67 surpassing the sars pandemic so far most countries around the world are suffering 68 from the public health crisis medical system overload and economic loss due to the 69 pandemic among common pathogenic viruses sars-cov-2 emerges a high 70 transmissibility whose r0 value is currently estimated as 23 but could be as high as 57 71 when more infection cases are identified 8 the high transmissibility of sars-cov-2 72 is probably a major reason for the rapid development of covid-19 epidemic in order 73 to relieve the current pandemic and prevent hcov epidemics in the future more studies 74 on the transmission of pathogenic hcov is urgently required 75 interspecies transmission from wide animals to humans is a major cause leading to 76 the epidemics of highly pathogenic coronaviruses such as sars-cov and sars-cov-77 2 previous virus tracing studies have shown that chinese horseshoe bats are natural 78 reservoirs of sars-cov 9 10 and a recent phylogenetic analysis has revealed that 79 sars-cov-2 might also be originated from bat-sarsr-cov 11 as an exopeptidase expressed in vascular endothelial cells in the heart and the kidney 95 that catalyses the conversion of angiotensins 16 17  ace2 is highly conserved and 96 ubiquitously expressed in most vertebrates but not all ace2s can serve as the receptor 97 for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 which is a key determinant of the host range of these 98 two viruses for instance sars-cov can use mouse ace2 as its receptor but sars-99 cov-2 cannot indicating that mouse is a potential host for sars-cov but not for 100 sars-cov-2 1 our previous study predicted the ace2 utilization of sars-cov-2 101 and showed that sars-cov-2 could potentially utilize most mammalian ace2s except 102 murine ace2s and even some avian ace2s meanwhile we also predicted 9 amino 103 acid aa residues in ace2 critical for sars-cov-2 utilization 18 however this 104 study was mainly based on the aa analysis and lacked experimental evidence which 105 could be hardly referred to clarify the host range of sars-cov-2 106 in this study we ectopically expressed ace2 of 20 different animals in hela cells a 107 cell line lacking of ace2 expression naturally and then infected the cells with hiv-108 based pseudoviral particles carrying coronavirus spike proteins to test their utilization of 109 these ace2s the result showed that both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 could use 110 most mammalian ace2s as their receptors but not fish or reptilian ace2s interestingly 111 similar to mouse ace2 sars-cov but not sars-cov-2 was capable of using 112 chicken ace2 indicating a narrower host range of sars-cov-2 especially in murine 113 and birds we also tested pangolin cov pseudovirus with spike highly similar to sars-114 cov-2 to our surprise pangolin cov showed an ace2 utilization profile similar to 115 sars-cov rather than sars-cov-2 by alignment of the aa sequence of the 20 ace2 116 orthologs we further confirmed several aa residues among the 9 residues predicted 117 previously critical for sars-cov-2 utilization including t20 k31 q42 and y83 and 118 excluded some critical aa residues such as y41 and k68 especially t20 of ace2 119 probably played critical roles in spike-ace2 binding by interacting with s477 and t478 120 within the receptor-binding motif rbm of sars-cov-2 spike protein but it was not 121 necessary for the binding of ace2s with sars-cov and pangolin cov spikes these 122 aa residues might partially determine the unique receptor utilization and host range of 123 sars-cov-2 in summary our study provides a more clear view of ace2 utilization 124 by sars-cov-2 which may contribute to a better understanding about the virus-125 receptor interaction and the host range of sars-cov-2 126 127 results 128 in this study we investigated the ace2 utilization of three sarsr-covs including 130 sars-cov-bj01 sars-cov-2 and pangolin cov pangolin cov was tested since 131 pangolins were suspected to be a potential intermediate host of  132 notably the rbm of pangolin cov spike is almost identical with sars-cov-2 spike 133 except for the 498 th aa residue but they are different from sars-cov spike on multiple 134 aa sites  figure 1a  135 in order to validate the successful preparation of the three pseudovirus the hek293t 136 cells for virus package were lysed after virus harvest the cells were lysed and subjected 137 to western blot detection of ha-tagged spike proteins as shown in figure 1b to evaluate the phylogenetic relationship of the 20 ace2s assessed above we built a 172 phylogenetic tree based on the aa sequences of all the ace2s figure 3a  in the tree 173 we observed the obvious branches of mammalian bird reptilia and fish ace2s 174 however with the mammalian ace2s there were no significant branches 175 corresponding to the ace2 utilization by sars-cov-bj01 or sars-cov-2 176 pseudoviruses indicating that the whole sequence analysis could hardly reveal the key 177 factors underlying the receptor utilization by the viruses 178 in our previous study we predicted 9 key aa sites on human ace2 potentially 179 critical for the receptor utilization including t20 k31 y41 k68 y83 k353 d355 180 r357 and m383 based on the sars-cov-2 utilization of human bat civet swine and 181 mouse ace2s 18 here we tested 15 more species and then we checked the 9 sites of 182 the 20 ace2 orthologs to validate the role of the nine sites in sars-cov-2 utilization 183 as shown in figure 3a  yh41 d355 r357 and r383 were conserved in all ace2s 184 indicating that these sites were not determining the receptor utilization by sars-cov-2 185 similarly k68 was conserved in both mouse and chicken ace2s that could not be used 186 by sars-cov-2 and was probably not important for sars-cov-2 utilization either 187 q42 was conserved in mouse ace2 but was substituted by e42 in chicken ace2 188 whose role in sars-cov-2 might be complicated on the contrary t20 k31 and y83 189 in usable ace2s were distinct from the corresponding aa in unusable ace2s indicating 190 their cirtical role in determining sars- in history most pandemic viruses originated from wild reservoir animals and 194 transmitted directly or indirectly to humans such as ebola virus from bats 19 the covid-19 pandemic caused by sars-cov-2 is the most severe worldwide 202 pandemic in the recent years surpassing the sars pandemic in 2003 so it is likely to 203 speculate that sars-cov-2 has a broad host range surprisingly our cell-entry result 204 showed that sars-cov-2 had a smaller range of ace2 utilization than sars-cov 205 sars-cov-2 could not utilize mouse or chicken ace2 which could be used by cov indicating a narrower host range of sars-cov-2 especially in murine and birds 207 the reason is probably that the host range of sars-cov-2 is broad enough to support 208 its transmission from bats to humans and lack of infection to some kinds of animals 209 does not affect such transmission due to redundant routes thus it is not suggested to 210 over-interpret the determination of the host range on the possibility of a virus to cause 211 pandemics especially for the viruses with broad host ranges 212 notably sars-cov-2 has a better utilization of bat ace2 than sars-cov though 213 sars-cov originate from bat-sarsr-cov the utilization of bat ace2 by sars-cov 214 is quite limited which is supported by the previous reports 10 21 according our 215 current results sars-cov-2 utilizes chinese horseshoe bat ace2 much better than 216 sars-cov indicating a higher homology between sars-cov-2 and its ancestor this 217 speculation is supported by the phylogenetic analysis of viral genomes in the previous 218 study 1 219 our cell-entry result showed that sars-cov and sars-cov-2 could use a wide 220 variety of mammalian ace2s which is further supported by the reports about the 221 susceptibility of various mammals to sars-cov-2 infection 22 however the 222 utilization of fish and reptilian ace2s was quite poor for both sars-cov and sars-223 cov-2 this can be explained by the remote phylogenetic relationship between 224 fishreptilian ace2s and mammalian ace2s by comparison bird ace2s have closer 225 phylogenetic relationship with mammalian ace2s and thus bird ace2s could be used 226 by some but not all sarsr-covs such as sars-cov this indicates that sarsr-covs 227 are more likely to be transmitted by mammals and birds but not fish and reptiles and 228 more attention should be paid to domestic mammals and birds to prevent cov pandemic 229 our previous study predicted 9 critical aa residues on ace2 orthologs based on the 230 aa sequence comparison of chinese horseshoe bat civet swine and mouse ace2s 231 since these were the only ace2s tested by sars-cov-2 utilization at that time 18 in 232 this study we have tested 16 more ace2s which could help to confirm or exclude 233 critical aa residues found previously k31 and y83 in human ace2 were confirmed by 234 this study as critical aa residues for sars-cov-2 utilization substitutions of k31d and 235 y83f were reported to abolish or strongly inhibit sars-cov binding 23 24 here we 236 have found more k31 substitutions abolishing sars-cov-2 utilization that chicken 237 ace2 with k31e crocodile and viper snake ace2s with k31q and mouse ace2 with 238 k31n could not be utilized by sars-cov-2 matching our previous prediction 239 considering both chicken and mouse ace2s could be utilized by sars-cov k31 may 240 be a key aa residue leading to the different receptor utilization of sars-cov and 241 sars-cov-2 also chicken mouse and viper snake ace2s with y83f could not be 242 utilized by sars-cov-2 consistent with our previous prediction and other former 243 reports on the contrary though y41a was reported to abolish sars-cov binding 23 244 horse ace2 with y41h could be used by sars-cov-2 well indicating that y41h 245 barely affect sars-cov-2 utilization however chinese horseshoe bat ace2 with 246 y41h showed a relatively lower utilization by sars-cov-2 and even lower utilization 247 by sars-cov indicating y41h might decrease receptor utilization synergistically with 248 only with other unknown substitutions especially for sars-cov substitution of k68 249 was reported to slightly inhibit sars-cov binding 23 nevertheless horse ace2 250 with k68r could be used by sars-cov-2 well indicating that k68r might not affect 251 sars-cov-2 utilization either crucian and viper snake ace2 with k68i could not be 252 used by sars-cov-2 but these ace2s contains so many other substitutions that we 253 may not attribute the abolishment of sars-cov-2 utilization to k68i 254 remarkably our study revealed t20 of ace2 as a potential key aa residue for 255 sars-cov-2 utilization t20 has not been reported to affect sars-cov utilization but 256 mouse ace2 with t20l and chicken ace2 with t20v could not be used by sars-257 cov-2 t20 is located at the n terminus of most mature mammalian ace2s excluding 258 the signal peptide according to the structure of sars-cov-2 receptor-binding domain 259 complexed with human ace2 the n-terminal t20 of ace2 is close to s477 and t478 260 of sars-cov-2 rbm  figure 3b  25 both threonine and serine contain hydroxyl 261 radicals that allow them to form hydrogen bonds with each other thus t20 of human 262 ace2 is likely to bridge with s477 and t478 of sars-cov-2 spike via hydrogen 263 bonds which stabilizes the ace2-spike binding however l20 on mouse ace2 and 264 v20 on chicken ace2 are both aliphatic aa that cannot form hydrogen bonds to support 265 the ace2-spike binding which may impair the utilization of these two ace2s by 266 sars-cov-2 in sars-cov spike the two aa residues are substituted by g463 and 267 k464 k464 can form hydrogen bonds with threonine and g463 is a non-polar aa that 268 can interact with valine or leucine via hydrophobic bond together with the adjacent 269 a461 therefore sars-cov spike can interact with various n-terminal aa of ace2s 270 and this may be the reason why sars-cov can utilize mouse and chicken ace2s 271 while sars-cov-2 cannot pangolin cov spike shares high similarity with sars-272 cov-2 which keeps s477 and t478 however pangolin cov spike harbors alkaline 273 h498 that can interact with acidic q42 and e42 of mouse and chicken ace2 274 respectively via ionic affinity which may complementally support the ace2-spike 275 binding and allow the utilization of mouse and chicken ace2 by pangolin cov on the 276 contrary sars-cov-2 spike substitutes h498 with acidic q498 leading to ionic 277 repulsion with q42 and e42 blocking its binding with mouse and chicken ace2s 278 these proposed interactions provide a possible explanation for the different utilization 279 of ace2s by sars-cov-2 and pangolin cov nevertheless all the speculation about 280 the aa residues on ace2 key for spike-ace2 binding is based on the sequence analysis 281 and mutation validation is necessary to further verify the roles of those sites 282 in summary our current study has validated the ace2 utilization by sars-cov-2 283 predicted in our previous analysis by pseudovirus cell-entry assay the results showed 284 less ace2 utilization by sars-cov-2 compared to sars-cov and pangolin cov 285 especially for murine and bird ace2s indicating narrower host range of sars-cov-2 286 meanwhile with these data we screend 5 key aa residues of ace2 for sars-cov-2 287 utilization especially the n-terminal t20 and q42 might be critical in determining the 288 bioworld usa

by the emboss needle online software which uses the needleman-wunsch alignment algorithm to find the optimum alignment including gaps of two sequences along their entire length chojnacki et al 2017 moreover sequence alignment was also visualized and analyzed by using jalview software httpswwwjalvieworg targeting potential antigens from viral proteins is crucial for constructing peptide-based

eraat analyses gundampati et al 2012structures were visualized and analyzed by pymol l delano 2002 we illustrated the number of cases and deaths of sars-cov-2 in a consecutive way through graphs to elucidate the pattern of occurrence of those outcomes we covered country-wise cases and deaths the onset of global and chinese cases by date the global death toll per day and province-wise cases and deaths in china we calculated the crude mortality rate and case fatality according to the formulas suggested by the cdc cdc 2020 as well as jacob and ganguli jacob 2008 here we calculated the crude mortality rate for those countries and for chinese provinces having death records per 1 crore persons for better interpretation it is already known that the sars-cov-2 can multiply even at high temperatures especially temperatures higher than 15 c chan et al 2011 kampf et al 2020 however sars-cov-2 is rapidly inactivated at 20 c kampf et al 2020 therefore temperature plays a great role in its multiplication for this purpose recent environmental temperature data from the place of first occurrence as well as bangladesh were obtained from landsat-8 satellite data this satellite provides high spatial resolution 30 m data at 15-day intervals using the brightness temperature of band number 10 tir-1 and emissivity data temperature in c of bands 4 and 5 l8 data users handbook a large area a 30-km-wide swath can be obtained for a time with minor deviation from in situ temperature data maximum 045 degree celsius sd therefore cloudless or less cloudy images less than 90 were obtained from

frequencies for those overlapped areas level-1 tier-1 images which are radiometrically and geometrically corrected were used in this study first all images fulfilling the cloud-related conditions were

clearly demonstrated the ancestral origin and distant evolutionary relationships of the newly epidemic novel coronavirus covid-19 it was found that sars-cov-2 was evolutionarily related to sars-cov fig 1
 in every case sars-cov-2 aligned with the same clade of sars-cov where two bat-originated coronaviruses hku4 and hku5were found to have divergent relationships with covid-19 rather hku4 and hku5 showed ancestral relationships with mers-cov moreover bufcov-hku26 of bangladesh origin always showed a phylogenetic relationship with the animal-originated coronavirus hcov-oc43 multiple sequence alignment msa of covid-19 proteins with sars-cov and bufcov-hku26 proteins is shown in fig 2
i and ii the results clearly suggested that major proteins four proteins of sars-cov-2 were more aligned with the sars-cov proteins which might strengthen the claim of evolutionary convergent relation of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov fig 2 i on the other hand the major proteins of bufcov-hku26 were also employed to msa with sars-cov and study found that there were significant dissimilarities between these two strains fig 2 ii moreover pairwise sequence alignment by emboss needle strengthened the phylogenetic relationship of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov table 1
included the similarity and identical pattern of sars-cov-2 proteins with their homologous proteins of other coronaviruses it had been raveled that sars-cov-2 proteins were highly similar and identical with sars-cov proteins for examples spike membrane envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of sars-cov-2 showed that approximately 764 905 947 and 905 nucleotide similarities with the respective protein molecules of sars-cov again in case of identity pattern results showed that spike membrane envelope and nucleoproteins of sars-cov-2 were 870 964 961 and 943 identical with the respective homologous proteins of sars-cov besides fewer level of similarity and identical patterns were found with other viral strains including bufcov-hku26 of bangladesh origin table 1 four types of viral

conserved in all of the homologous protein sequences deposited in the ncbi database table 2 cross-checked conservancy analysis of covid-19 antigenic epitopes with sars-cov proteins showed that conservancy when cross-checked with other coronaviruses including bufcov-hku26 of bangladesh origin was not significant table 3 the 3d structures of the sars-cov-2 proteins were modeled using the i-tasser server where sars-cov complex with human neutralizing s230 antibody fab fragment pdb id 6nb6 membrane protein complex pdb id 5x5y coronavirus envelope proteins pdb id 2 mm4 and sars cov nucleocapsid pdb id 1ssk acted as the top threading templates of the s m e and n proteins respectively the sars-cov-2 proteins showed 36 to 93 coverage and 40 to above 90 identity to the i-tasser template proteins supplementary table 3 as i-tasser usually deduces 5 different models for each operation refinement by modrefiner and validation by rampage and errat were performed to check the accuracy of the modeled structures after the refinement process ramachandran plot analysis was investigated to fix the structural accuracy from homology modeling ramachandran plot could do the placement of amino acids from modeled protein structure following the all attributes of structural biology from where comparatively better model could be screened out the present study revealed that the spike protein of sars-cov-2 showed 752 residues in the favored region 148 residues in the allowed region and only 10 residues in the outlier region fig 3 ia on the other hand membrane protein exhibited 777 residues in the favored region 15 residues in the allowed region and only 7 residues in the outlier region fig 3 ib in addition two other envelopes and nucleoproteins also showed the highest number of residues in the favored regions 74 for e and 681 for n and a lower number of residues 73 for e and 115 for n in the outlier regions fig 3 ic and id again for assuring more structural validity of the constructed models the results of errat had been analyzed it had been found that values of the highest quality factor from the modeled sars-cov-2proteins s  71 m  88 e  89 and e  73

occurrence of the disease per day from 22 january 2020 to 05 february 2020 and in the same way a steady decreasing trend from 06 february 2020 to 16 february 2020 interestingly on 17 february 2020 the number of cases worldwide 19572 cases and in china 19461 cases soared suddenly however the number started declining up until 25 february 2020 and then started rising sharply and reached to an apex on 20 march 2020 with 43957 cases fascinatingly after 25 february 2020 cases outside china increased more than those in china which was an alarming signal that covid-19 became a pandemic fig 5iand

the satellite-derived temperatures c for wuhan china south korea italy and bangladesh during february 2020 are shown in fig 7
 in this figure a single scale at the rightmost part of the image is used to indicate the temperature for all subimages however for the wuhan area no cloud-free clear image data were available for the western part of the image for that period therefore only the eastern part is shown here similarly during the study period in the mid-region of korea the temperature was very low which was caused by the presence of heavy and widespread clouds in that region during satellite image acquisition however very few clouds covers were found for the landsat-8 image acquisition for february 2020 for the italy areas in almost all areas temperature were lower than 20 c except a few places where the temperature did not exceeded 25 c therefore interpretations from the figures for these regions should be guarded in order to avoid errors the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 became a pandemic because of its global spread jung et al 2020 coronaviruses are one of the most diverse groups of viruses and have emerged as deadly pathogens of the human race with sars-cov-2 being the latest added to the list in most cases human coronaviruses evolve from zoonotic transmission and bats are reported as the best reservoirs for zoonotic viruses graham and baric 2010 although the causative agent of covid-19 has already been declared sars-cov-2 lai et al 2020 phan 2020 we adopted a protein-based phylogenetic study to reveal the phylogenetic relationships and divergent links of sars-cov-2 with other human coronavirus strains seven coronaviruses covid-19 hcov-229e hcov-oc43 sars-cov hcov-nl63 hku1 and mers-cov two bat-originated coronaviruses hku4 and hku5 and one buffalo-originated coronavirus bufcov-hku26 reported from bangladesh were subjected to phylogenetic analysis of four types of their viral proteins s m e and n proteins it was clearly demonstrated that sars-cov-2 and sars-cov shared asimilar pattern of ancestral origin fig 1 and pairwise alignment indicated maximum similarity and identity between these two viruses table 1 and fig 2 recently after the rapid transmission of sars-cov-2 and the resulting deaths who 2020c wu et al 2020 bogoch et al 2020 chinazzi et al 2020 the who announced the genetic similarities between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov which were clearly reflected in the present study in addition hku4 and hku5 are bat-originated coronaviruses and the similar genetic makeup of the other viral strains could indicate a similar host preference desjardins et al 2010 although there were a few unclear reports regarding the possibilities of bats as reservoirs of sars-cov-2 giovanetti et al 2020 benvenuto et al 2020b however the divergent phylogenetic relationships and minor alignment patterns of sars-cov-2 with the bat-originated viruses hku4 and hku5 suggested that there was a low possibility of sars-cov-2 being connected with bats fig 1 and table 1 as the ncbi database until now documented only the genome materials of a buffalo coronavirus bufcov hku26 from domestic water buffaloes bubalus bubalis in bangladesh lau et al 2016 a comparative study of bufcov-hku26 with sars-cov-2 was employed with phylogenetic analysis and pairwise alignment of the targeted viral proteins the study revealed that bufcov-hku26 showed divergent relationships and low pairwise alignment of s 295 identity and 442 similarity m 374 identity and 557 similarity e 209 identity and 442 similarity and n proteins 327 identity and 486 similarity with sars-cov-2 however as bufcov-hku26 is an animal-originated coronavirus its proteins always exhibited an ancestral relationship with the other animal-originated virus hcov-oc43 fig 1 bufcov-hku26 was detected in bangladesh which suggests that the country does provide a favorable environment for the transmission and pathogenesis of buffalo-originated coronaviruses sooryanarain and elankumaran 2015 rowe and east 1997 as the genetic architecture of sars-cov-2 was highly divergent from that of bufcov-hku26 fig 1 fig 2 and table 1 and viral transmission or pathogenesis is directly or indirectly governed by the genetic makeup of the virus it is possible that the conditions in bangladesh could be less favorable for the high occurrence of covid-19 although technical supports and policy level management could also influence the rapid transmission of any pandemic the novel coronavirus has been making headlines since it first came to light late in 2019 covid-19 has already spread to all continents except antarctica geographically bangladesh is located in a temperate zone we performed a comparative study of the temperatures between bangladesh wuhan south korea and italy interestingly temperature could be another factor reducing the risks of covid-19 to bangladesh although the country still has as a high risk index haider et al 2020athe high temperature and high humidity can effectively reduce the transmission of the covid-19 wang et al 2020a and temperature variation and humidity may be important factors affecting the covid-19 mortality ma et al 2020 however experts cannot yet predict the trajectory of the virus covid-19 sars-cov-2 might have different persistence times on inanimate surfaces but these times should be similar to those of sars-associated viruses 34 days kramer et al 2006 human coronaviruses such as middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus and endemic human coronaviruses hcov can persist on inanimate surfaces but not for long periods of time chan et al 2011 kampf et al 2020 however at lower temperatures such as 4 c or less this virus persisted for as long as 28 days and the lowest level of inactivation occurred at 20 relative humidity inactivation was more rapid at 20 c than at 4 c at all humidity levels likewise coronaviruses were inactivated more rapidly at 40 c than at 20 c kampf et al 2020 recently the authors established that temperature significantly changed covid-19 transmission in 429 cities in which covid-19 appeared to spread fastest at 872 c wang et al 2020b moreover scientists discovered that sars-cov-2 has mutated into a more aggressive disease tang et al 2020 population genetic analyses of sars-cov-2 genomes indicate two major lineages designated l and s with a higher possibility of infection by both types the ancestral s-type is suspected to be less infectious and milder in severity 30 while the later emerging l-type is more prevalent 70 tang et al 2020 if the continuing evolution of sars-cov-2 continues countries such as bangladesh will truly be in great trouble as human intervention may have placed more severe selective pressure on the l type which might be more aggressive and spread more quickly tang et al 2020 although according to the who this virus is unique in its continuous mutation who 2020a until now there has been no concrete evidence that the virus has already changed with regards to disease severity or infectivity however based on this brief discussion it can be presumed that this virus has a lower possibility of vertical spread and lower severity in countries or seasons with relatively higher temperatures respectively thus in affected countries covid-19 might disappear with rising temperatures when spring comes however caution should be used when interpreting these kinds of computer-based studies more comprehensive genomic data are required for further testing of this hypothesis in fig 7 the temperatures of wuhan china south korea italy and bangladesh during february 2020 are compared it can be observed that the temperature ranged from 13 to 22 c in many places of wuhan korea as well as in italy however across bangladesh the temperatures were above 25 c except for a very few small areas with temperatures of approximately 20 c which were caused by small patches of cloud cover thus the temperature is much higher in bangladesh than in wuhan korea and italy we know that during this period of modern science many people are moving from one place to another which allows for vertical spread of any severe disease from any small place to areas all over the world similarly coronavirus has spread to more than 182 countries and territories including a recent introduction into bangladesh however these temperature data indicate that if the virus has not yet undergone mutation to be able to sustain high temperatures such as 25 c which occur in bangladesh there is less possibility of this virus replication moreover currently in march the temperature may have increased considerably giving hope that the virus will not multiply much only 20 cases including 1 death of covid-19 have been confirmed in bangladesh as of march 20 2020 however more people 10929 cases and 183 deaths as of may 5 2020 documented to have been affected while visiting other countries are being treated carefully in quarantine which might result in the fast disappearance of covid-19 with little or no spread due to the higher temperatures in bangladesh the largest international airport in bangladesh is situated in dhaka and is a main entrance for people from all over the world as dhaka is an industrial and commercial zone and all the official works of bangladesh are centralized here most of the visitors or people returning to the country stay here for an extended period due to industrialization the temperature of dhaka is much higher than that of any other parts of bangladesh which is also evident from fig 7 d indicated by the black circle in the figure many of the scientists and pathologists revealed that high temperature and humidity able to restrict the spread of covid-19 and spread of disease will be suppressed as the weather warms sajadi et al 2020 zhang and zeng 2020 this also supports our hypothesis interestingly coronaviruses that cause colds do tend to subside in warmer months however it is highly uncertain whether sars-cov-2 will behave the same way current research by scientists is too early to predict how the virus will respond to changing weather national geographic 2020 immunogenicity and epitope conservancy analyses of coronavirus proteins were performed to determine the potential b-cell epitopes that would interact efficiently with b lymphocytes to initiate the immune response against specific viral pathogens klingen et al 2018 the study identified a total of 24 highly immunogenic b-cell epitopes from sars-cov-2 proteins 17 epitopes of s 1 epitope of m 1 epitope of e 5 epitopes of n proteins conservancy analysis table 3 demonstrated that selected epitopes were highly conserved in other homologous strains of sars-cov-2 which suggested the possibility of peptide-based vaccine development from s m n or e proteins azim et al 2019 abdulla et al 2019 preethika nair 2020 moreover potential b-cell epitopes were also identified from hcov-229e hcov-oc43 sars-cov hcov-nl63 hku1 mers-cov hku4 hku5 and bufcov-hku26 proteins supplementary table 1 the antigenic sites of covid-19 were also crosschecked with other coronavirus-corresponding proteins table 3 higher levels of conservation among antigenic epitope sites of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov supported a similar ancestry in their pathogenicity in contrast antigenic epitopes from sars-cov-2 exhibited the minimum conservancy pattern with bufcov-hku26 which suggested a distinct pathogenicity pattern between sars-cov-2 and bufcov-hku26 the national health authorities of china detected a cluster of 44 pneumonia patients of unknown etiology from 31 december 2019 to 3 january 2020 in wuhan city hubei province of china and reported this detection to the who chinese office who 2020c moreover on 7 january they identified the pathogen as a novel coronavirus world health organization who 2020 similar to covid-19 the world experienced an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 caused by a coronavirus also originating from china guangdong province which was suggested to be a potential zone of re-emergence of coronaviruses lai et al 2020 who 2020d however on 14 march 2020 who declared europe as new epicentre of covid-19 outbreak syariz et al 2015 within a very short time covid-19 was transmitted globally who 2020c wu et al 2020 bogoch et al 2020 chinazzi et al 2020 world health organization who 2020 by 20 march 2020 the viruses had spread to up to 182 countries and territories and one cruise ship named diamond princess in japan worldometers covid-19 coronavirus outbreak 2020 infecting 253796 persons globally who 2020c in contrast sars infected 8450 persons and caused 810 deaths globally in 33 countries chen et al 2005 moreover mers another coronavirus associated with an epidemic started in saudi arabia in september 2012 and spread to up to 27 countries affecting a total of 2494 persons and causing 858 deaths throughout the world up to november 2019 who 2020b therefore covid-19 has already covered approximately 552 times more countries than sars and mers who 2020c chen et al 2005 in

outbreak 2020 chen et al 2005 who 2020b although the occurrence of cases per day was high in china at the beginning of the outbreak after 25 february 2020 the number of cases declined in china and dramatically increased outside of china for example all of italy has been placed under lockdown due to covid-19 the majority of the cases are in mainland china followed by italy spain iran germany usa france and korea and the world health organization has formally declared the covid-19 outbreak a pandemic in march 11 2020 who 2020c jung et al 2020 the case fatality of covid-19 as of 19 march was 410 and 400 globally and in china respectively this calculation agrees with the report of wang et al wang et al 2020c who stated that the global case fatality was close to 3 however the global case fatalities of sars 960 and mers 3440 were higher than that of covid-19 who 2020b cameron et al 2008 by february 2020 the case fatality of china was 380 worldometers covid-19 coronavirus outbreak 2020 which supports our estimate despite the lower case fatality than the previous coronaviruses sars and mers covid-19 poses a great burden across the world in terms of geographical coverage occurrence of cases and death toll and became a pandemic causing extensive public panic the covid-19 coronavirus has spread in the neighboring countries of bangladesh as well it has also spread in the middle east a region with which bangladesh has economic relationships therefore bangladesh faces a high risk of being affected by novel coronavirus outbreaks as the virus has already spread in different parts of the globe over182 countries and territories reported covid-19 cases with more than 253796 people infected globally as of march 20 2020 who 2020c global health policycovid-19 coronavirus tracker 2020

phylogeography a sars-cov-2 case study philippe lemey samuel hong verity hill guy baele chiara poletto vittoria colizza ine oapostoole john mccrone t kristian andersen g michael worobey martha nelson i andrew rambaut marc suchard a  spatiotemporal bias in genome sequence sampling can severely confound phylogeographic inference based on discrete trait ancestral reconstruction this has impeded our ability to accurately track the emergence and spread of sars-cov-2 the virus responsible for the covid-19 pandemic despite the availability of unprecedented numbers of sars-cov-2 genomes on a global scale evolutionary reconstructions are hindered by the slow accumulation of sequence divergence over its relatively short transmission history when confronted with these issues incorporating additional contextual data may critically inform phylodynamic reconstructions  here we present a new approach to integrate individual travel history data in bayesian phylogeographic inference and apply it to the early spread of sars-cov-2 while also including global air transportation data we demonstrate that including travel history data for each sars-cov-2 genome yields more realistic reconstructions of virus spread particularly when travelers from undersampled locations are included to mitigate sampling bias we further explore methods to ameliorate the impact of sampling bias by augmenting the phylogeographic analysis with lineages from undersampled locations in the analyses our reconstructions reinforce specific transmission hypotheses suggested by the inclusion of travel history data but also suggest alternative routes of virus migration that are plausible within the epidemiological context but are not apparent with current sampling efforts although further research is needed to fully examine the performance of our travel-aware phylogeographic analyses with unsampled diversity and to further improve them they represent multiple new avenues for directly addressing the colossal issue of sample bias in phylogeographic inference 2  genomic data represent a key resource for testing hypotheses about how and when sars-cov-2 became established in different locations for example phylogenetic approaches may be able to distinguish community transmission from new introductions from travelers 2  whether viral outbreaks were associated with multiple introductions 3 recent advances in virus sequencing and phylogenetics hold great promise for addressing key questions in infectious disease epidemiology and outbreak response 6  there are limitations however to the insights that can be obtained from the wealth of sars-cov-2 genome data the current sequence diversity is relatively limited because sars-cov-2 emerged only recently in late 2019 and because sars-cov-2 transmission outpaces the rate at which substitutions accumulate 4  this implies that short-term transmission patterns may not leave a detectable footprint in virus genomes in addition large spatiotemporal biases exist in the available genome data for instance about 46  of currently available genomes have been sampled from the uk whereas italy having experienced a similar number of cases and likely an earlier epidemic onset only represents 03 of the genome collection on gisaid both low sequence diversity and sampling bias confound the interpretation of transmission patterns and highly similar sars-cov-2 genomes from the same or different locations do not necessarily imply direct linkage despite a relatively slow evolutionary rate the phylodynamic threshold for sars-cov-2 was reached relatively early 7  meaning that sufficient divergence had accumulated over the sampling time range to infer time-calibrated phylogenies and the underlying transmission processes that generate such trees including spatiotemporal spread however sampling bias presents a critical challenge for popular discrete trait ancestral reconstruction procedures 89  although the modern phylodynamic framework includes other statistical approaches that are less sensitive to sampling bias eg 10 11 12  computational complexity challenges their application to large data sets in particular when insights are needed in short turnaround times this explains the widespread adoption of ancestral reconstruction approaches that provide real-time tracking of pathogen evolution and spread 13  when confronted with low diversity and sampling bias evolutionary reconstructions may greatly benefit from integrating additional sources of information bayesian phylodynamic approaches are particularly adept for this purpose 14 and phylogeographic methods in particular have been extended to take advantage of human transportation data as proxies of population-level connectivity between locations 15  this approach has been utilized in a wide range of applications including the identification of the key drivers of ebolavirus spread in west africa 16  individual travel history of sampled patients also represents an important source of information that currently has not been used to its full potential in phylogeographic inference  to focus on the early stage of covid-19 spread we analyzed sars-cov-2 genome sequences and metadata available in gisaid on march 10th 19  discrete trait phylogeographic inference attempts to reconstruct an ancestral location-transition history along a phylogeny based on the discrete states associated with the sampled sequences in our bayesian approach the phylogeny is treated as random which is critical to accommodate estimation uncertainty when confronted with sparse sequence information here we aim to augment these location-transition history reconstructions on random trees with travel history information obtained from returning travellers when such information is available the tip location state for a sequence can either be set to the location of sampling as is done in the absence of such information or the location from which the individual travelled assuming that this was the location from which the infection was acquired neither of these options is satisfactory using the location of sampling ignores important information about the ancestral location of the sequence whereas using the travel location together with the collection date represents a data mismatch and ignores the final transitions to the location of sampling these events are particularly important when the infected traveller then produces a productive transmission chain in the sampling location incorporating information about ancestral locations cannot be achieved simply through the parameterization of the discrete diffusion model which follows a continuous-time markov chain ctmc process determined by relative transition rates between all pairs of locations that applies homogeneously or time inhomogeneously 25  along the phylogeny instead we need to shape the realization of this process according to the travel histories by augmenting the phylogeny with ancestral nodes that are associated with a location state but not with a known sequence and hence enforce that ancestral location at a particular possibly random point in the past of a lineage further the location state can also be ambiguous allowing equal or weighted probability to be assigned to multiple possible locations 26  we illustrate this procedure for an empirical example that includes 9 sars-cov-2 genomes in fig 1   incorporating travel history data in phylogeographic reconstruction panel a illustrates the concept of introducing ancestral nodes associated with locations from which travellers returned the ancestral nodes are indicated by arrows for five cases relating them to the genomes sampled from the travellers the ancestral nodes are introduced at different times in the ancestral path of each sampled genome panels b c and d represent the results from analyses using sampling location and travel history sampling location only and travel origin location respectively the branch color reflects the modal state estimate at the child node there is some topological variability but only involving nodes that are poorly supported the empirical example includes two genomes from hubei four from australia and three from italy travel history is available for five genomes one sampled in italy and four in australia and the same procedure is applied to the four genomes from travellers returning to australian from hubei iran southeast asia and hubei again from top to bottom in fig 1 a  in subsequent panels we compare a travel-aware reconstruction b to a reconstruction using we note that t ij can be treated as a random variable in case the time of travelling to the sampling location is not known with sufficient precision we make use of this ability for the genomes associated with a travel location but without a clear travel time in our bayesian inference we specify normal prior distributions over t ij informed by an estimate of time of infection and truncated to be positive back-in-time relative to sampling date specifically we use a mean of 10 days before sampling based on a mean incubation time of 5 days 27 and a constant ascertainment period of 5 days between symptom onset and testing 28  and a standard deviation of 3 days to incorporate the uncertainty on the incubation time finally we indicate that not only information about the sampled traveller can be incorporated but also about prior transmission history we apply this for two cases in our data set one of the genomes was sampled from a german patient who was infected after contact with someone who came from shanghai the person travelling from shanghai was assumed to be infected after being visited by her parents from wuhan a few days before she left in this case we incorporate wuhan hubei as an ancestral location with an associated time that accounts for the travel time from shanghai with a number of additional days and associated uncertainty another genome was obtained from a french person who had been in contact with a person who is believed to have contracted the virus at a conference in singapore 29  in this case we incorporate singapore as an ancestral location with a known travel time supplementary table 1  to investigate how unsampled diversity may impact phylogeographic reconstructions we include in our bayesian inference taxa that are associated with a location but not with observed sequence data we identify undersampled locations by considering the ratio of available genomes to the cumulative number of cases for each location obtained from our world in data httpsourworldindataorgcoronavirus-source-data  to keep all available data we opt not to downsample genomes but to add a number of unsampled taxa to specific locations in order to achieve a minimal ratio of taxa sampled and unsampled to cumulative number of cases in fig 2 a we plot the number of available genomes against the number of cases on march 10th 2020 on a log-log scale in our case we set the minimal ratio arbitrarily to 0005 although higher ratios may be preferred this comes at the expense of adding larger numbers of unsampled taxa and hence computationally more expensive bayesian analyses our choice for the minimal ratio requires adding 458 taxa for 14 locations colored symbols in fig 2  so about we integrate over all possible phylogenetic placements of such taxa using standard markov chain monte carlo mcmc transition kernels in the absence of sequence data time of sampling represents an important source of information for the analysis in addition to sampling location here we use epidemiological data in order to estimate a probabilistic distribution for the sampling times of unsampled taxa specifically we follow grubaugh et al 5 in estimating the number of prevalent infectious individuals on day t  p t  by multiplying the number of incident infections up to day t by the probability that an individual who became infectious on day i was still infectious on day t  where   t-i  is the cumulative distribution function of the infectious period we also follow grubaugh et al 5  we implement our approach to incorporate travel history in discrete phylogeographic inference in the beast framework v1104 30  in this framework we assume that discrete trait data x  in our case location data associated with both sampled and unsampled taxa and aligned molecular sequence data y arise according to continuous-time markov ctmc chain processes on a random phylogeny f with the following model posterior distribution where pr x  f  t  and pr y  f   represent the discrete trait likelihood and sequence likelihood respectively t is the additional time information for the ancestral nodes and characterize the discrete-trait and molecular sequence ctmc parameterizations along f respectively likelihoods pr x  f  t  and pr y  f   are calculated using felsensteins pruning algorithm 31  a computation that is efficiently performed using the high-performance beagle library 32  we for the sequence data we use the hky nucleotide substitution ctmc model 33 httpsgithubcombeast-devbeast-mcmc  and associated r package constructs these estimates we also visualize posterior expected markov jumps estimates between all locations using circular migration flow plots which have been successfully used to visualize migration data 39  including phylogeographic estimates 40  when summarizing these jumps from analyses that include unsampled diversity we ignore branches that only have unsampled taxa as descendants we only plot jumps that have a posterior expectation larger than 075 to focus on the early dynamics of sars-cov-2 spread we analyze a data set consisting of in our bayesian analysis of the complete data set we model a discrete diffusion process between 44 locations 29 countries and 15 locations within china including 13 provinces one municipality beijing and one special administrative area hong kong we fit a glm-parameterization of the discrete diffusion process and consider air travel data within-continent geographic distances and an estimable asymmetry coefficient for transitions from and to hubei as covariates for the diffusion rates in table 1 of what location data we use in the analyses they consistently indicate that in this early stage sars-cov-2 spread is shaped by air travel and not by geographic distance and that there is strong asymmetric flow out of hubei interestingly this asymmetry is somewhat stronger for the analyses that incorporate travel locations compared to the analysis using only sampling locations one explanation is that the majority of travellers were returning from hubei and adding this information contributes appropriately to the intensity of outflux from hubei we report posterior inclusion probabilities and posterior mean 95 highest probability density intervals log conditional effect sizes for air travel geographic distance and asymmetry out of hubei as expected for a low degree of sequence variability over this limited time range our bayesian phylogeographic reconstructions are burdened by a high degree of topological uncertainty in fig 4  posterior support for the nodes in the mcc tree is represented by the size of the node circles illustrating that only a limited number of clusters are reasonably well supported this renders a single phylogenetic tree summary inadequate to interpret phylogeographic history we side-step this problem by studying spatial trajectories that marginalize over phylogenetic variability in the ancestral history of single taxa in fig 5  we consider a case study involving the spatial path of a virus that was collected in switzerland in february 2020 epiisl413021 the swiss virus is part of lineage b1 sw in fig   4  and is positioned within a cluster of viruses primarily from europe that has been the subject of controversy the basal clustering of a genome from the first detected case in germany led to speculation that the virus spread from germany to italy 41  using the standard location of sampling  fig 5 a   to further explore the sensitivity of phylogeographic analyses to sampling bias we incorporate unsampled taxa in our reconstructions in addition to travel history data we add unsampled taxa for locations that are undersampled according to case counts cfr methods in this case primarily for hubei  n  307 followed by italy  n  47 iran  n  40 and south korea  n  30 we specify a prior distribution over their tip ages sampling times based on estimates of prevalent infections cfr methods using this framework we revisit the trajectory estimate for the swiss b1 genome  fig 7   in contrast to the reconstructions with no unsampled taxa  fig   5  we now mainly observe a direct transition from hubei to italy posterior probability  088 implying that a second introduction from hubei that is independent from the introduction into germany may have seeded the italian clade this hypothesis arises from the inclusion of unsampled hubei taxa that now cluster between the german virus and the italian clade  fig 7   even though the branch connecting the german genome to the italian clade only represents a single substitution the many unsampled italian taxa that fall in this clade further reinforce its italian ancestry markov jump trajectory plot as in fig 5 for a swiss genome epiisl413021 in lineage b1 and b1 subtree for the bayesian phylogeographic analysis incorporating travel data fig 7 and unsampled diversity dotted lines represent branches associated with unsampled taxa assigned to italy and hubei china the tip for the swiss genome corresponding to the trajectory is indicated with an arrow because of the color similarity between italy and germany the basal german virus is labeled the value at the root represents the posterior location state probability the inclusion of unsampled taxa also provides more resolution on the hubei ancestry of the iran-australia case study in lineage b4 epiisl412975 we estimate a similar trajectory as the analysis using travel history without unsampled taxa  fig 6  but with a more recent coalescence in hubei because of unsampled hubei taxa clustering basal to an iranian clade  fig   8  the genomes from four australian travellers returning from this country one direct contact another australian genome without travel history as well as a genome from a traveller returning from iran to new zealand are effectively embedded in unsampled iranian diversity the most basal virus in this clade is from a canadian traveller returning from iran although the basal nature of this virus is not well supported there is good posterior support for the monophyly of all the sampled genomes in this clade notably this virus was sampled before the first report of covid-19 in iran on february 19 th 43  but our reconstruction indicates that considerable diversification and hence transmission already took place prior to this report in addition to focusing on specific transmission patterns we also summarize the overall dispersal dynamics in a way that marginalizes over plausible phylogenetic histories for the four different analyses we perform  fig 9  while introductions from hubei represent the dominant pattern when using sampling location only  fig 9 a  this is far more pronounced for the other analyses using sampling location suggests unrealistic dispersal from locations such as australia and the netherlands that largely disappear in the other analyses specifically when using travel history data without or with unsampled diversity  fig 9 c  d  in the travel-aware analyses european countries experience more introductions from italy and to a lesser extent also more directly from hubei as also illustrated by the specific examples  fig 5  6  the considerable number of secondary transmissions from italy and iran is revealed by using travel history data the substantial addition of unsampled taxa from these relatively undersampled locations does not further contribute to this pattern however adding unsampled diversity from hubei suggests that occasional introductions from other locations are more likely direct introductions from hubei such as introductions from guangdong province to shandong province south korea and japan and a supposedly canadian introduction in the us the direction of the transitions are encoded both by the origin colour and by the gap between link and circle segment at the destination migration into a location is associated with a larger gap than migration out of a location as part of the supplementary information we include the same figure but with a transparency for transitions from hubei to emphasize the secondary dispersal dynamics international travelers had a central role in the early global spread of the sars-cov-2 virus to track whether covid cases were new imports or community transmission detailed travel histories were collected from many of the early covid patients to date however phylogeographic approaches using discrete trait reconstruction have not been able to fully incorporate travel history data researchers had to select whether to assign a sample to the location of sampling typically the home country or to the location visited by the traveler either way half of the information was lost during a period when there were major gaps in the availability of sars-cov-2 genomes from many key locations losing half of the spatial information provided by travelers has been suboptimal here by developing a new phylogeographic approach that introduces ancestral nodes in the phylogeny that are associated with locations visited by travelers we provide a method to formally recapture all the rich information provided by travelers most importantly we demonstrate that the travel-aware approach can dramatically improve phylogeographic inferences about the specific country-to-country paths followed by the sars-cov-2 virus during the early stages of global spread as expected the inclusion of travel history data is most informative when travelers are arriving from locations such as italy and iran that experienced early sars-cov-2 outbreaks but for which few genome sequences were available resulting in large gaps in the phylogeny we are currently studying a pandemic as it unfolds and as new sars-cov-2 sequences continue to be generated globally at an explosive pace there will be ongoing opportunities to reassess the probability of conclusions drawn from earlier data sets more genome data from hubei has already become available which will reduce the need for unsampled diversity from the pandemic origin in phylogeographic reconstructions we have also observed that two genomes from iran are now available in gisaid that cluster with the genomes from australian travellers returning from this country data not shown which reinforces the iran-australia connection observed in our travel history reconstructions we anticipate that the generation of additional data from italy will also support the spatial connections inferred here from traveler data however we intentionally tested the performance of our methods using an early sars-cov-2 data set that was heavily burdened by spatiotemporal sampling bias it is possible that our methods could not account for all gaps in data at this stage and further exploration is needed of how well our methods perform at different magnitudes of sampling gaps we retrieved travel history data for about 20 of the early available genomes but many more travel-based introductions may be undocumented while such information is sometimes available in gisaid records this is not commonly included metadata and there is otherwise no specific resource available to retrieve such information this may at least partly be explained by concerns about the risk of patient identification travel history data may be particularly important when analyzing low diversity data using bayesian joint inference of sequence and traits because sharing the same location state can contribute to the phylogenetic clustering of taxa in general it is crucial to consider the uncertainty of bayesian time-measured phylogenetic reconstructions because even for sparse sequence information a single tree sample including the mcc tree will appear highly resolved with branching structures that may not be supported by substitutions  fig 4   however this is only a single transmission hypothesis compatible with the data while many other hypotheses will be plausible as should be reflected by the different topologies in the posterior and hence by low node support values for this reason we resorted to posterior summaries that focus on the location transition patterns in the ancestral history of single taxa or on markov jump estimates both averaging over all plausible trees while downsampling genomic data from locations in unbalanced data sets has become a common practice 15 18  we present here an alternative approach that adds unsampled taxa to assess the sensitivity of inferences to sampling bias we emphasize that even though the inclusion of unsampled taxa is informed by epidemiological data these unsampled taxa should never be considered as additional observations the unsampled diversity reveals alternative hypotheses that may not be captured by the available genome sampling but are worth considering in the context of biased sampling however reconstructions using unsampled taxa do not provide evidence for any single hypothesis with the same weight as actual genomic data we envision reconstructions built with unsampled taxa as being exploratory in nature and most useful as added support for conclusions drawn independently from other analytical approaches for example evolutionary simulations or epidemiological studies it is important for future users of these methods to understand exactly how different kinds of empirical data are used to determine where unsampled taxa will attach to the phylogenetic backbone of sampled genomes the first important aspect is the relative positioning in time of unsampled tips which in our case is drawn from distribution curves of estimated prevalent infections over time so this together with the relative abundance of unsampled taxa by location is informed by epidemiological data second the locations of unsampled taxa will determine their clustering when jointly inferring the phylogeny based on sequences and discrete location traits in this respect unsampled taxa will preferentially cluster with taxa representing the same locations either sampled genomes or other unsampled ones however unsampled taxa can and do in our experience branch off lineages representing different location states the relative preference for which location transitions this involves will be determined by the matrix of transition rates of the discrete trait ctmc which in our case are informed by covariates such as air travel this implies that in the sars-cov-2 analysis unsampled taxa can be positioned with taxa from countries that are highly connected by airline travel given the importance of air travel in the early spread of the virus finally the branch lengths or time it takes for unsampled taxa to find a common ancestor with other taxa will be influenced by the coalescent prior we opted for a simple exponential growth coalescent prior in our analyses but more flexible tree priors are available that can also be informed by epidemiological data eg 44  by formally accommodating the possibility of unsampled diversity in our phylogenetic reconstructions we provide alternative scenarios for how sars-cov-2 spread globally and entered specific countries most importantly many early introductions in different locations were likely from hubei in line with modelling estimates that point at the underdetection of exported covid-19 cases from wuhan 36  in addition our findings reinforce estimates shaped by travel history that point at early introductions into both italy and iran two countries that are not well represented by genomic sampling and subsequent transmission events from these countries to other locations due to the low genomic variability of sars-cov-2 it may be more appropriate to refer to unsampled transmission chains rather than unsampled diversity because many unsampled taxa may represent highly similar or even identical genomes with the large number of sars-cov-2 genomes now available the question arises how scalable the incorporation of unsampled taxa will be for computationally expensive bayesian inferences the approach may need to go hand in hand with downsampling procedures or more detailed examination of specific sublineages furthermore as averaging over all plausible phylogenetic placements of large numbers ofvolatile unsampled taxa can be a challenging task further developments are needed to make the estimation more efficient for larger scale datasets we firmly acknowledge that many aspects of these analyses require further detailed examination and refinement in other pathogen systems with different types of data gaps and sampling biases for example we used an arbitrary cut-off for the ratio of available genomes to case counts in order to decide which locations required representation by unsampled taxa without accounting for differences in reporting rates for case counts so it would be useful to investigate how sensitive the reconstructions are with respect to such decisions our spatial diffusion glm may benefit from 2020 travel data that are impacted by travel restrictions the time dependency imposed by travel restrictions could potentially be modelled with an epoch version of the discrete trait ctmc 25  this could also be important for the asymmetry factor we included for transitions from hubei as these will be severely impacted by the travel ban imposed on january 23 45  finally in addition to investigating the impact of model and data adjustments on empirical examples simulation studies would greatly assist in evaluating the performance of the phylogeographic reconstructions in controlled scenarios in conclusion we demonstrate how travel history data can be formally integrated into discrete phylogeographic reconstructions and that this together with accounting for unsampled diversity can mitigate spatiotemporal sampling bias in reconstructions of the early spread of sars-cov-2 more research is needed on the specifications of such analyses and we hope that this work will stimulate developments to further integrate epidemiological information and other data sources into phylodynamic reconstructions  defining the pandemic at the

caporaso gregory david engelthaler m michael worobey paul keim  in december of 2019 a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 emerged in the city of wuhan china causing severe morbidity and mortality since then the virus has swept across the globe causing millions of confirmed infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths to better understand the nature of the pandemic and the introduction and spread of the virus in arizona we sequenced viral genomes from clinical samples tested at the tgen north clinical laboratory provided to us by the arizona department of health services and at arizona state university and the university of arizona collected as part of community surveillance projects phylogenetic analysis of 79 genomes we generated from across arizona revealed a minimum of 9 distinct introductions throughout february and march we show that 80 of our sequences descend from clades that were initially circulating widely in europe but have since dominated the outbreak in the united states in addition we show that the first reported case of community transmission in arizona descended from the washington state outbreak that was discovered in late february notably none of the observed transmission clusters are epidemiologically linked to the original travel-related cases in the state suggesting successful early isolation and quarantine finally we use molecular clock analyses to demonstrate a lack of identifiable widespread cryptic transmission in arizona prior to the middle of february 2020  in late 2019 a novel positive sense rna virus family coronaviridae genus betacoronavirus and subgenus sarbecovirus emerged in the human population as a result of cross-species transmission from an unknown host 1 2  the virus sars-cov-2 began widespread circulation in the chinese city of wuhan in late december of 2019 with spread in other countries apparently beginning around mid-january 3 4  the first confirmed case of covid-19 the disease caused by sars-cov-2 in arizona was in late january 2020 from a student attending arizona state university who had travelled to china 5  extensive contact tracing and isolation led to zero additional reported cases stemming from this original case az1 there were no additional cases reported in arizona until march 3rd when a travel-related case returned from europe and tested positive 6  on march 6th the first case of community transmission in arizona was announced 7  on march 26th the arizona department of health services azdhs updated the level of community transmission to widespread as of may 6th there are 9707 confirmed positive cases in arizona and more than 426 deaths 8  and the number of new cases per day in arizona continues to increase 9  the navajo nation located mostly in northeastern arizona but also utah colorado and new mexico at the time of writing has among the highest number of cases per capita in the us approximately 850 confirmed cases per 100000 individuals 10  this is disproportionately high relative to the rest of arizona approximately 130 confirmed cases per 100000 individuals and about 50 of the per capita cases seen in the hardest hit regions of the usa areas of new york 11  given the scale of the pandemic there is an urgent need to understand patterns of sars-cov-2 spread including the relative roles of local transmission versus repeated travel-associated introductions and the accumulation and spread of mutations that could affect the function of the virus interfere with testing or have antigenic effects that might impact vaccine efforts viral genome sequencing has emerged as a key tool for addressing these questions in order to assist with both local and global efforts to track the spread and evolution of this virus we began intensive sequencing of viral genomes from across arizona and deposition of these sequences in the gisaid database which makes them accessible to the research community for downstream analyses notably including real-time pathogen tracking through nextstrain 12  to better understand the evolution of the virus within the state of arizona we compared our sequences with publicly available sars-cov-2 genomes from across the world in a phylogenetic framework and here we report our preliminary findings specifically we sought to answer 3 key questions regarding the circulation of the virus in arizona first although it appeared from epidemiological data that the first case of covid-19 in arizona did not lead to any additional cases did cryptic transmission occur similar to that proposed to have begun with wa1 the first diagnosed covid-19 patient in the us who arrived in washington state from wuhan china on january 15th 2020 13  second how many independent introductions contributed to the outbreak in arizona and what was the approximate timing of each event third are there any unique mutations present in arizona sequences that could have potential phenotypic effects or could interfere with diagnostic detection as of april 15th we have sequenced and assembled a total of 79 nearly complete sars-cov-2 genomes obtained from patients across arizona these genomes were sequenced from nasopharyngeal swabs that were collected over a 28 day period from march 5th to april 2nd 2020 this represents a sequencing effort of 49 of all reported cases in arizona as of april 2nd this dataset includes at least one genome from 11 of the 15 arizona counties supplementary table 3  aside from az1 3 sars-cov-2 genomes from arizona were sequenced by the cdc which we do not include in any analyses initial arizona case did not lead to sustained local transmission the first case of covid-19 in arizona az1 was documented in late january 2020 and contact tracing suggested this initial case did not result in additional symptomatic infections within the state 5  we sought to independently verify this conclusion using bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses to compare our 79 genomes to a representative subset of the sars-cov-2 genomes generated from around the world the genomes used in this analysis were selected using a novel bioinformatics pipeline see methods which subsampled genomes uploaded to gisaid to reduce the size of the dataset while representing temporal spatial and genetic diversity of the full dataset this resulted in a set of 384 sars-cov-2 genome sequences including our 79 arizona genomes and 305 additional representatives supplementary table 1  a reduced version of this dataset including 372 genomes with complete dating information was used in the bayesian analysis our phylogenetic analyses  figure 1 and supplementary figure 1  indicated that the genome from az1 belonged to lineage a although 979 114 of our genomes also clustered in lineage a these genomes belonged to distinct sublineages a1 a2 and a3 and the az1 genome contained one derived substitution c-to-t at nucleotide position 29031 that we did not observe in any other arizona sequences this substitution was however shared with 12 other genomes included in our analysis all of which were sampled in china or japan this is consistent with infection of az1 occurring during documented travel to china 5  although our analyses cannot completely rule out the possibility of a cryptic transmission chain originating from this initial case it is clear that the first documented introduction of sars-cov-2 to arizona did not play a substantial role in fueling the ongoing epidemic rather the majority of arizona cases are linked to later introduction events see below these results further demonstrate the power of public health contact tracing and self-isolation following a positive test for stemming the tide of infections moving forward our phylogenetic analyses indicated that multiple distinct sars-cov-2 lineages co-circulated in az during march 2020 we detected 9 distinct lineagessublineages in arizona between early march and early april table 1  these lineages were not unique to az they have all been documented in other parts of the usa as well as in multiple countries around the world  figure 3 supplementary figure 2  in fact the geographic ubiquity of the major sars-cov-2 lineages along with the common observation of identical virus genomes sampled in multiple us states countries and continents clearly demonstrates how frequently this virus has been moved between locales given the timing and size of the az outbreak relative to outbreaks in other locations figure 3  we argue it is unlikely that any of these named lineages arose within arizona therefore the number of observed lineages 10 including az1 represents a conservative estimate for the number of independent introductions of sars-cov-2 into arizona to estimate when community transmission of sars-cov-2 first began in arizona we used our bayesian phylogenetic analysis to estimate dates for the most recent common ancestors tmrca of the arizona genomes within each of these lineages in total we sequenced 2 viral genomes from 510 of the observed lineages which we name major lineages and tmrca estimates using these genomes  figure 2 suggest that at the earliest community transmission in arizona began around early february 2020 however we view this as the most extreme estimate because many of these lineages likely represent multiple distinct introductions to arizona rather than a single introduction followed by sustained community transmission for example b1 the inferred oldest lineage containing arizona genomes includes multiple well-supported clades posterior probability  099 bootstrap 65 all of which have also been observed in several other us states and countries supplementary figure 1  therefore there have almost certainly been multiple introductions of viruses from this lineage that have contributed to local transmission in arizona and the early february tmrca likely predates actual community transmission within arizona to determine the most likely source of the sars-cov-2 introductions to arizona we examined the geographic distribution of sequences within each lineage  figure 3  for this analysis we considered the full collection of sars-cov-2 genomes available on gisaid as of 4162020 first for each of the 5 major lineages arizona sequences were always sampled after a sequence from that same lineage or sublineage had been sampled elsewhere although sequencing efforts can influence this result it appears unlikely that any of the major lineages emerged in arizona rather they were likely imported second there are very few sequences from asia clustered within each of the 5 major lineages instead it appears importation was largely driven by domestic travel in the case of a1 b12 b129 or perhaps imported from europe b1 or oceania a3 although both of these latter lineages have also been commonly observed elsewhere in the us given the widespread distribution of these nearly identical genomes it would be impossible to directly estimate the location of each of these importations beyond the continent level the arizona sequences are largely represented by two lineages a1 and b1 we focus the remaining results and discussion on these two lineages a1 was identified in washington state in late february and has since spread across the globe  figure 3  it was previously proposed that the a1 washington outbreak announced on february 28th as the 2nd instance of community transmission in the united states 1415  is derived from the first washington case a lineage a sequence back in january 2020 13  for the purposes of our discussion we only focus on the a1 sublineage which regardless of the ultimate source of a1 had begun circulating in washington in the middle of february at the latest we sequenced six genomes that are members of the a1 clade from arizona these were detected in 5 counties across arizona table 1  we infer that the mrca of these arizona sequences likely existed around feb 16th 2020 95hpd feb 9th -feb 23rd if these six arizona genomes stem from a single introduction of the a1 lineage this tmrca estimate suggests the lineage was already present in arizona prior to when community transmission was announced in washington on feb 28th  figure 2  however it is possible and even likely that the six a1 lineage genomes from arizona arose from multiple introductions into the state given that the same lineage was being spread throughout the country 16  although multiple introductions would push the tmrca estimate of the a1 introduction to be more recent we argue that it is possible a1 was first imported near the dates inferred the first a1 arizona genome we sequenced was collected on march 5th from a person who was a household contact of another case representing the first known community transmission event in arizona the other individual tested positive on march 3rd and held a healthcare job in phoenix their sars-cov-2 genome has not been sequenced 17  this implies the first community transmission subject was infected sought testing and infected a close contact who we sampled given the median incubation time of 5 days 18 and assuming the healthcare worker was infected by someone traveling directly from washington with no additional transmission in between that would place the time of importation to be feb 28th this falls outside our 95 hpd tmrca estimate of feb 23rd however this timeline makes it clear that even if multiple a1 introductions caused the tmrca to be artificially early it is not by more than a week or two of the 79 genomes we have sequenced in arizona 65 82 belong to the b1 lineage including sublineages b12 and b129 making b1 the most abundant lineage in arizona as it is globally 19  arizona sequences from this lineage were collected from march 11th to april 2nd 2020 and were detected in samples from eight counties table 1  if these genomes all stemmed from a single introduction to arizona we estimate an introduction around feb 7th 2020 95hpd jan 24th -feb 15th however given the widespread distribution and frequency of this particular clade both globally and nationally as well as the lack of detected cases in arizona in february it is very likely that multiple introductions of b1 viruses have contributed to the  cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 13 2020  outbreak in arizona in which case the actual onset of community transmission for this lineage may be later than the tmrca estimate suggests one of the substitutions that is present in all b1 lineage viruses occured in the gene for the spike protein and resulted in an aspartic acid to glycine substitution at residue 614 d614g based on viral rna quantifications and phylogenetic analyses 20  it was recently suggested that this substitution may have increased the transmissibility of the virus although the outbreak in arizona was already dominated by b1 lineage viruses in early march 2020 we did see a gradual increase in the relative proportion of b1 throughout march and into early april  figure 4a  we also compared qrt-pcr cycle threshold ct values for clinical samples with and without this substitution our results show a similar trend to that reported from patients in sheffield england 20  with a lower mean ct higher viral load in samples containing the d614g substitution however this is not a statistically significant difference p085 with our current sample size  figure 4b  combined these data along with those published by other groups 20  httpsgithubcomblabncov-d614g  are consistent with a replication andor transmission advantage of viruses containing the d614g substitution however experimental studies are needed to validate this hypothesis an alternative explanation is that the b1 lineage has simply been increasing in frequency globally due to chance events that led this lineage to dominate in early outbreaks eg in italy from which the virus has been spread widely throughout the world and has seeded outbreaks in many other locations the b1 lineage has also dominated the large outbreak in new york and in some reports 21  the b1 lineage has been used as an indication of an epidemiological link to the new york outbreak however we would urge caution with this approach based on ancestral state reconstructions this lineage is predicted to have first emerged in asia andor europe nextstrain and this lineage was observed in multiple european countries including the large italian outbreak before it was first documented in new york nextstrain in fact just within arizona we have documented at least two instances in which b1 lineage viruses were imported directly to the us from europe the second case of covid-19 in arizona was reported on march 3rd from a traveler who returned from france on feb 27th 22  this individual self-reported being symptomatic on the plane back to phoenix and went to multiple social gatherings before being officially diagnosed 23  at one of these social events at least one other individual was infected 24  although we did not sequence the sars-cov-2 genome from this individual cdc deposited this sequence into gisaid  epiisl420784   and we confirmed it belonged to the b1 lineage data not shown we also have records shared to us by the coconino health and human service department that one of the b1 genomes we sequenced from coconino county came from an individual who had recently traveled to rome italy and who presumably got infected there thus although it is tempting to speculate that most of the b1 infections across the us came from the ny outbreak we show at least two confirmed instances of direct importation of b1 into arizona from europe like all rna viruses sars-cov-2 accumulates mutations over time some of which may impact virulence replication and intervention strategies and some of which have no functional clinical or antigenic importance we identified non-synonymous mutations in coding sequences of sars-cov-2 genomes from arizona  figure 5 supplementary table 2  these include mutations in the spike protein nonstructural proteins nsp involved in rna synthesis nucleocapsid protein and the putative orf10 several of these mutations have also been reported as being associated with sars-cov-2 sequences from europe 25  below we hypothesize about potential phenotypic impacts of these substitutions however it is important to note that experimental studies need to be conducted to test these hypotheses and the vast majority of substitutions that occur during viral replication will not have a significant impact on virulence or transmissibility  cc-by-nd 40 international

demonstrates that 7 assays yield no false negatives based on exact primerprobe matches several of the primersprobes align with stretches of n characters in individual genomes and the amplification

sars-cov-2 spike s protein mediates receptor binding and cell entry and is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies 26  mutations in the spike protein may have implications for viral entry and

replication demonstrate that nsp14 regulates replication fidelity through its 3-to-5 exonuclease activity 31 32  mutations in nsp7 nsp8 nsp12 and nsp14 may therefore have an effect on viral rna synthesis and susceptibility to antiviral treatments such as remdesivir 33  we identified several non-synonymous mutations in nsp7 residue 25 s  l and 26 s  f but none in nsp8  figure 5b  one of the nsp12 mutations at residue 323 p  l identified in 69 az sequences was previously associated with sars-cov-2 sequences from europe 25  we did not find nsp12 mutations at sites predicted to be the

switching during viral subgenomic mrna synthesis 35  n is expressed at high levels during early stages of replication and like the s protein is also a major immunogenic target of antibodies 36  five az sequences had a triple nucleotide substitution ggg  aac that resulted in a tandem amino acid change in the n protein at residues 203 and 204 rg  kr over the relatively short time-frame of sars-cov-2 evolution these tandem substitutions are relatively uncommon 25  orf10 is a short putative protein of unknown function predicted in the 3 end of the sars-cov-2 genome which is conserved in the closely-related bat and pangolin coronavirus sequences  figure 5c  we identified a 2-nucleotide insertion in orf10 from two az sequences that result in a premature stop codon and early truncation of orf10 a similar truncation is present in the sars-cov genome due to the presence of an upstream stop codon this may indicate a region of the virus genome with relaxed evolutionary constraints consistent with a report that did not detect subgenomic orf10 mrna 37   cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display

that the ongoing covid-19 outbreak in arizona has been fueled by multiple distinct introductions of sars-cov-2 to the state we estimate a minimum of 9 over the course of february and march by estimating the timing of introductions we find no evidence for cryptic community transmission in arizona prior to late january rather our analyses indicate that community transmission likely did not occur within arizona until at least early-to mid-february when viruses from lineages b1 and a1 may have been introduced it appears that most of the introductions of sars-cov-2 to arizona have had domestic origins in line with reports from other states 16  however there have also been instances of arizona cases linked to international travel and these have likely also contributed to the local outbreak a number of non-synonymous mutations were identified in the arizona isolates including within regions of the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein and non-structural proteins involved in the rna synthesis complex the functional consequences of these mutations are unknown highlighting the need for mechanistic studies our phylodynamic tracing provides unique epidemiological insights

step of 98c for 30 seconds and then 35 cycles at 98c for 10 seconds 65c for 2 minutes the reactions were pooled together and visualized on a 2 agarose gel to confirm successful amplification amplicons were then cleaned with a 11 mixture of ampure xp magnetic beads beckman coulter the mixture was incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature and then placed on a magnetic rack until all the beads were pulled out of solution the remaining liquid was pulled off and discarded next 200ul of 80 etoh was used twice to wash the bead mixture the beads were allowed to dry and re-suspended in 30ul of water following a 5 minute incubation the tube was placed back on a magnetic rack until the beads were pulled out of the solution the 30ul of cleaned amplicons was transferred to a fresh tube the remainder of the protocol was identical to the artic protocol which includes end-repair ligation of oxford nanopore sequencing adapters and additional cleaning steps using the ampure xp beads the final prepared

reference sequence from ncbi genbank nc0455122seven randomly sampled sequences per week from gisaid wa1  mn9853251 and az1 mn997409 4 we then searched all of gisaid against the sequence collection compiled in step 3 using vsearchs usearchglobal option and identified sequences that most closely matched the arizona sequences to ensure that we were including the closest relatives of arizona sequences to contextualize clades containing arizona sequences 42  the collection of best hits was sampled to result in a geographically dispersed collection of sequence sources those sequences were added to the sequence collection from step 3 and ensure that monophylies of arizona sequences are not artifacts of our sequence sampling approach 5 all gisaid sequences that were not clustered by the previous step were clustered with vsearchs clusterfast option at 999 percent identity cluster centroid sequences were added to the sequence collection generated in step 4 this ensured that a divergent collection of the sars-cov-2 genomes was represented in our data set 6 an initial alignment was constructed with mafft followed by the construction of a neighbor joining tree several sequences that were suspected of being low quality at this stage including both gisaid and arizona sequences were removed from the sequence collection the sequences resulting from this workflow were used as the starting point for all downstream analyses maximum-likelihood phylogenies were generated using raxml-ng v051b 43 with the gtrg4 model as indicated by a substitution model selection analysis carried out in iqtree with 20 distinct starting trees and 100 bootstrap replicates lineage assignment for all arizona sequences was performed with the software pangolin which is a real time dynamic tool for assigning lineages to sars-cov-2 sequences based on shared mutations and phylogenetic support 44  we employed a bayesian molecular clock method implemented in the beast v1104 45 software package to estimate the divergence times for the total sars-cov-2 dataset as well as several arizona-specific lineages and overall evolutionary rates to compare how different model combinations impact results we carried out two sets of analyses with the uncorrelated lognormal ucln 46 clock model combined with either the exponential or bayesian skygrid demographic 47 models four chains of each model combination were run for 100000000 generations and sampled every 10000 generations for both model combinations we found convergence within and among chains using tracer v16 logcombiner was used to merge the four different chains of each model combination after discarding the first 10 as burn in 10000000 generations per chain and then resampling every 40000 generations the two resulting files

reservoirs into the human population 9 in fact association of some of these cov to certain bat species has been suggested 10 11 reinforcing the notion that there may be a relationship between some batcov and their hosts nowadays the presence of cov has been shown in bats in china 12 13 north and south america 1417 africa 18 and a number of regions in europe 11 1921 but not the iberian peninsula spain and portugal which is a bridge for european and african bat populations 22 thus surveillance of wildlife reservoirs of putative zoonotic cov is necessary not only to unveil the ecology of these viruses but also to permit early detection of viruses that might pose a threat to human health to determine the presence and distribution of putative zoonotic cov in iberian bats 576 individuals from

 whereas the most common approaches that were applied to the analysis of cov sequence evolution in terms of phylogenetic reconstruction detection of recombination and identification of selection signatures are summarized in boxes 1 and 2
box 1molecular evolution in viruses general conceptsrna viruses are rapidly evolving pathogens that can accumulate considerable genetic diversity in relatively short time periods this is mostly due to their high nucleotide mutation rates but see text for covs the diversity of extant viral sequences can be analyzed to construct phylogenetic relationships among speciesstrains and to infer the underlying evolutionary patterns in the presence of recombination a single phylogenetic tree is unable to describe the evolution of homologous sequences because recombination is common in many viruses including hcovs the evolution of viral genomes is best modeled by several phylogenies one for each nonrecombinant fragment box 2 by reassorting mutations recombination has the potential to generate novel viral phenotypes thus not only recombination is of interest per se but failure to account for its presence can distort phylogeny-based analyses including estimates of natural selection 66 natural selection acts pervasively on viral sequences when coding regions are concerned natural selection is commonly estimated in terms of  also referred to as dnds  that is the observed number of nonsynonymous differences per nonsynonymous site dn over the observed number of synonymous differences per synonymous site ds under neutral evolution  is expected to be equal to 1 as the rate at which amino acid substitutions accumulate is similar to the rate for synonymous changes due to the fact that essential protein domains can often tolerate only minor sequence changes most amino acid replacements are eliminated by selection this generates  values 1 a situation referred to as negative or purifying selection nevertheless amino acid replacements can be advantageous for a virus in terms for example of host adaptation or immune evasion in this case  values can be higher than 1 positive selection thus evaluation of how  varies from site to site or from branch to branch in a phylogeny is commonly used to describe selective events some possible caveats should nevertheless be kept in mind i the saturation of substitution rates especially ds may occur and affect evolutionary inference when fast-evolving sequences are analyzed see box 3 for an example and box 2 for methods to overcome this problem ii in viral genomes synonymous substitutions are not always neutral this may be due to the presence of overlapping reading frames conserved rna secondary structures packaging signals and other functional elements box 3 iii a relaxation in the intensity of both negative and positive selection may occasionally occur box 2 and figure 2abox 2molecular evolution in viruses methods and caveatsphylogenetic tree constructiondistance-based and character-based approaches can be used in phylogenetic tree reconstruction distance-based methods measure pairwise differences among sequences and generate the tree from the resultant distance matrix eg upgma neighbour joining character-based methods evaluate all possible trees and estimate the one that best fits the data this approach includes maximum likelihood ml and bayesian methods eg phyml 67 raxml 68 mrbayes 69recombination detectionthe location of recombination breakpoints can be detected using phylogenetic incongruence among segments in a sequence alignment eg gard 70 or by evaluating the distribution of nucleotide substitution along genomic regions eg recco 71 a common approach is to use different methodologies to identify breakpoint locations and contributing sequences eg rdp 72positive selection analysespositive selection is usually estimated based on  variation across sites andor lineages box 1 a common approach is to compare ml models that allow or not a class of codons in the alignment to evolve with   1 eg the site models in paml 73 likelihood ratio tests are then applied to determine whether the neutral model can be rejected in favor of the positive selection model alternatively branch-site models can be applied to detect episodic positive selection on specific branches of the phylogeny different methods allow to test a priori whether a branch is under selection 74 75 or to model different evolutionary scenarios for each branch 76 when evolutionary analysis is focused on recent timescales selection may not have yet fixed the advantageous mutations or removed the deleterious ones one possibility is to compare the distribution of nonsynonymous and synonymous polymorphisms in a specific lineage with the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous fixed differences between lineagesspecies the mcdonald-kreitman test 77 has been widely applied for this purposerelaxed selectionwhen selection is relaxed smaller  values tend toward 1 whereas  values higher than 1 decrease this phenomenon can be confused with episodic selection specific methods allow one to infer whether a branch in the phylogeny is under positive or relaxed selection 18subsitution rate saturationsaturation of substitution rates can be a serious issue for deep tree branches nonetheless branch-site methods are relatively insensitive to biases introduced by ds saturation and can be applied to the analysis of distantly related species 78 alternatively specific indexes have been developed to detect substitution saturation 79 in the presence of ds saturation third-codon positions can be removed to obtain reliable phylogeniessynonymous constraintregions with an excess of synonymous constraint can be identified using a recently developed sliding-window ml-based method 80 covs are positive-sense single-strand rna viruses with a likely ancient origin and hcovs repeatedly emerged during the past 1000 years box 3
 all covs have nonsegmented genomes that share a similar organization about two thirds of the genome consists of two large overlapping open reading frames orf1a and orf1b see glossary that are translated into the pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins these are processed to generate 16 nonstructural proteins nsp1 to 16 the remaining portion of the genome includes orfs for the structural proteins spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleoprotein n a variable number of accessory proteins are also encoded by distinct viruses figure 1bbox 3time origin of cov genera and hcov emergencecoronaviruses are classified into four distinct genera alpha beta gamma and delta 81 alpha-covs and beta-covs circulate in mammalian hosts whereas gamma-covs and delta-covs mainly infect birds 82 an analysis of the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene in 43 covs provided a first estimate of around 10 000 years ago for the time of the most recent common ancestor tmrca of the four genera 83 this result was questioned on the basis of observations suggesting a longstanding interaction between covs and their hosts 82 thus wertheim and coworkers hypothesized that natural selection in particular negative selection resulted in a bias of the tmrca estimate 82 indeed strong negative selection can result in the saturation of substitutions at synonymous sites and consequently in underestimation of branch lengths in a phylogeny to overcome this issue the authors applied a branch-site test see box 1 76 to estimate branch lengths while taking into account the effect of different selective pressures among lineages in the cov phylogeny 82 their findings placed the separation of the four cov genera around 300 million years ago highlighting the importance of evolutionary models in molecular clock dating interestingly this tmrca is consistent with the separation time between mammals and aves 84 suggesting a coevolutionary relationship between coronavirus and their hosts however the dating estimates obtained for closely related viruses by wertheim and coworkers were in agreement with previous studies suggesting that the action of natural selection is not biasing the estimation of more recent divergence times although most hcovs were identified only recently molecular clock analyses indicate that some of these viruses diverged from closely related covs hundreds of years ago in particular the emergence of hcov-nl63 and hcov-229e has been roughly estimated around 500800 and 200 years ago respectively 85 86 hcov-oc43 is thought to have shared a common ancestor with bcov around 120 years ago 87 as for sars-cov and mers-cov molecular dating studies estimated that they diverged from bat covs in the last three decades 14 88 finally the mrca of hcov-hku1 extant lineages was estimated to have existed in the 1950s 60 clearly these dates should be regarded as estimates and confidence intervals are often wide a timeline for the emergence of hcovs is depicted in figure i
 among rna viruses covs have exceptionally long genomes up to 32 kb genome expansion in covs is believed to be at least partially mediated by increased replication fidelity although estimates of the mutation rate for covs differ possibly depending on the phase of cov adaptation to novel hosts several studies have shown that these viruses may possess an unusually high replication fidelity 6 7 8 indeed a major step that allowed genome expansion in covs and more generally in nidovirales was the acquisition of a set of rna-processing enzymes that improved the low fidelity of rna replication 9 these enzymes include an rna 3-to-5 exoribonuclease exon and possibly an endoribonuclease nendou 9 additional evidence though suggests that features distinct from replication fidelity underlie genome expansion in nidovirales these include a peculiar genome organization 9 and a processive replication complex 10 importantly cov genome expansion allowed the acquisition and maintenance of genes encoding diverse accessory proteins that may promote virus adaptation to specific hosts and often contribute to the suppression of immune responses as well as to virulence accessory proteins differ in number and sequence even among covs belonging to the same lineage figure 1b raising interesting questions about their origin and evolution the acquisition or loss of novel protein-coding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes thus tracing these gainloss events may identify important turning points in viral evolution among sars-cov accessory proteins the origin of orf8 has remained mysterious for a while as sars-cov-related sarsr bat viruses were isolated but found to encode divergent orf8 proteins amino acid identity with sars-cov orf8 around 33 11 12 13 very recently sarsr-batcovs from rhinolophus sinicus rs and rhinolophus ferrumequinum rf were isolated 14 15 analysis of the orf8 region revealed high sequence identity with civethuman sars-cov two groups came to the conclusion that recombination within sarsr-rs-covs or between sarsr-rs-covs and sarsr-rf-covs led to the acquisition of an orf8 closely related to that of civethuman sars-cov and ultimately originated the virus responsible for the human epidemic 14 15 interestingly lau and coworkers also reported that the orf8 region has a dnds
  35 in sars-covs isolated from humans but not in sarsr-batcovs indicating the action of positive selection box 1 14 this finding is interesting per se and becomes even more important considering that early in the human epidemic sars-covs acquired a signature 29-nucleotide deletion which split orf8 into two functional orfs orf8a and b 16 these findings suggest that rapid evolution of orf8 might facilitate host shifts 14 this possibility is however questioned by the presence of additional sars-cov human isolates that carry independent and larger deletions in the orf8 region 16 thus an alternative explanation for these findings is that the activity of orf8 became dispensable in the human host if this were the case relaxed purifying selection rather than positive selection might be responsible for the high dnds to disentangle these alternative possibilities we analyzed orf8 in human and civet viruses that carry an intact gene as well as in bat viruses although we confirmed that dnds is well above 1 for humancivet sars-cov orf8 we detected no evidence of positive selection using the m7m8 site models from paml box 2 or with parris partitioning approach for robust inference of selection 17 figure 2a instead we obtained evidence that relaxation of natural selection 18 in orf8 accompanied the shift from bats to civetshumans figure 2a these results suggest no major adaptive role for orf8 during the human sars-cov epidemic and support the view that orf8 is dispensable for virulence and transmission at least in the humancivet host a similar gene loss from the genome of a bat-derived ancestor occurred during the evolution of hcov-229e covs closely related to hcov-229e were recently isolated from african hipposiderid bats 19 and a cov belonging to the same species as hcov-229e had been described in captive alpacas suffering from an acute respiratory syndrome 20 21 figure 1a analysis of these viral genomes indicated that compared to hcov-229e they carry an additional orf at the genomic 3 end 20 figure 1b this orf which is designated orf8 but shares no homology with the homonymous sars-cov gene has unknown function and shows limited similarities to any other cov gene 20 we analyzed the sequences of recently identified alpha-covs from camels 22 and found that orf8 is encoded by these viruses as well figure 1b thus it is presently unknown whether the loss of orf8 conferred some advantage during the host shift to humans or as in the case of orf8 in sars-cov it became dispensable in the human host another interesting feature of some covs is that they encode phosphodiesterases pdes figure 1b these viral enzymes cleave 25-oligoadenylate the product of oas proteins to prevent activation of the cellular endoribonuclease rnase l and consequently block interferon ifn-induced antiviral responses 23 the pde activity in the mouse hepatitis virus mhv ns2a protein is critical for hepatovirulence 23 hcov-oc43 as well as other lineage a nonhuman beta-covs encode ns2a proteins that are characterized by a high degree of sequence similarity to the mhv pde figure 1b a protein with structure and sequence homology to ns2a is also encoded by an unrelated virus group a rotavirus in this case the pde activity resides in the c-terminal portion of vp3 a virulence factor 24 interestingly both vp3 and ns2a show two motifs that are characteristic of the 2h-pde family and share very little sequence similarity to the pde domain of a cellular protein akap7 24 figure 2b akap7 and the viral pdes display structural homology figure 2b and murine akap7 can complement an inactive mhv ns2a gene 25 from an evolutionary standpoint these observations suggest that i beta-covs and rotaviruses have independently acquired pde activities and ii akap7 served as the source gene in both viral genera figure 2b more recently a pde activity was also discovered in the ns4b protein of mers-cov figure 1b and other lineage c beta-covs 26 similar to those in lineage a beta-covs and rotavirus ns4b belongs to the 2h-phosphoesterase family and displays a predicted structure homologous to akap7 26 figure 2b it remains to be determined whether ns4b was acquired by capturing a vertebrate akap7 but the observation that distinct viruses acquired most likely independently a pde activity underscores the importance of these enzymes for viral fitness it was recently proposed that covs and other viruses stole additional genes from their hosts 27 hemagglutinin-esterases hes are encoded by lineage a beta-covs eg hcov-hku1 and hcov-oc43 figure 1b as well as influenza c virus and toroviruses structural analysis suggested that these viral enzymes derive from an ancestral host lectin although it is unclear whether acquisition occurred in an ancestral virus followed by speciation or multiple times 27 incidentally the n-terminal domain of the cov spike protein is also believed to derive from a cellular lectin 28 unlike the influenza virus c enzyme cov hes lack membrane-fusion activity and are accessory to the spike protein by serving primarily as receptor-destroying enzymes rde  that is they aid viral detachment from carbohydrates present on infected cells 29 30 in fact hes are present only in the genome of lineage a beta-covs most of which use sialic acids as coreceptors 1 figure 1b these observations suggest that sialic acid-binding spike proteins coevolved with he genes serving as rdes this hypothesis is supported by the observation that the mhv spike protein evolved from an ancestral sugar-binding preference to a protein-binding mode and that several mhv strains lost expression of he 27 28 figure 1b finally it is important to notice that artificial selection can lead to unintended changes in viral genomes such changes most likely result from passages in culture that on one hand relieve the virus from pressures exerted in vivo eg by the host immune system and on the other hand derive from viral adaptation to the in vitro system an example of these effects is the loss of a full-length orf4 in the hcov-229e prototype strain which due to a two-nucleotide deletion has a split gene encoding two proteins orf4a and orf4b 31 32 figure 1b conversely clinical isolates display a full-length orf4 sequence 32 an intact orf4 is also observed in bat and camel viruses related to hcov-229e 19 22 whereas the alpaca alpha-cov displays a one-nucleotide insertion resulting in a frameshift 20 figure 1b the availability of only a single alpaca cov genome makes it impossible to determine whether the inserted sequence is representative of the alpaca cov population or else if it represents a sequencing error overall these observations suggest that loss of full-length orf4 is a result of passaging in cell culture a process that often generates attenuated viruses an interesting finding on the role of orf4a came from the observation that its protein product regulates virus production in vitro by functioning as a viroporin
33 most likely the same function is performed by the full-length orf4 as well viroporins were also detected in sars-cov hcov-oc43 and hcov-nl63 34 35 figure 1b as expected given the relatedness of the two viruses the proteins from hcov-nl63 and hcov-229e share substantial sequence similarity limited similarity is also observed with the sars-cov protein especially in the first and second transmembrane regions suggesting either a common origin or independent acquisition followed by convergent optimization of residues in the transmembrane helices figure 2c conversely the hcov-oc43 protein encoded by orf5 originally denoted ns129 is unrelated to the other cov viroporins both in terms of sequence and of domain topology 34 figure 2c a protein homologous to the hcov-oc43 viroporin is instead encoded by mhv accessory protein ns5a and functions as an antagonist of ifn-induced antiviral responses 34 36 whether the hcov-oc43 viroporin has the same ifn-antagonizing activity remains to be investigated however mutant viruses lacking orf5 display growth defects in vitro and in vivo as well as reduced virulence in mice 34 interestingly the viroporins from sars-cov hcov-nl63 and hcov-229e can complement the viroporin-defective mutant hcov-oc43 in vitro
34 thus the conserved function of cov viroporins was most likely attained by convergent evolution for acquisition of unrelated genes the evolutionary analysis of mers-cov is a rapidly moving field as sequences from the latest phases of the epidemic have just become available analysis of an ever increasing number of viral sequences of both mers-cov and of related beta-covs revealed that genetic variability in the s gene was shaped by recombination and positive selection in fact both ancient and recent intra-spike recombination events were described 22 40 41 interestingly recombination events with breakpoints within the s gene occurred in camels in saudi arabia and originated the mers-cov lineage that spread to south korea analysis of positive selection of mers-cov spike genes indicated that several adaptive variants arose in mers-cov and in phylogenetically related covs 42 contrary to common expectation and to what happened during the sars-cov host shift to humans positive selection did not target the rbd in fact most adaptive substitutions were detected in the region encompassing the heptad repeats regions of central importance for virus cell entry figure 3a 42 43 in other covs variants in the heptad repeats were previously shown to affect host or tissue tropism 44 45 46 interestingly during the south korean outbreak mers-covs that carry point mutations in the spike protein rbd emerged and rapidly spread 47 these viruses showed decreased binding to the cellular receptor 47 figure 3a because several immune epitopes are located in the rbd these findings point to the possibility that mers-cov is evolving to avoid the binding of neutralizing antibodies resulting in a trade-off with receptor-binding affinity 47 if this were the case the phases of mers-cov adaptation to humans may have consisted of initial events that modulated host tropism through changes in the heptad repeats followed by the emergence of virus variants that escape immune responses in mers-cov and other lineage c beta-covs positive selection also targeted the nonstructural components particularly orf1a 48 most adaptive events occurred in nsp3 a multifunctional protein which acts as a viral protease and contributes to the suppression of interferon responses through its deubiquitinating and deisgylating activities 49 selection in nsp3 is ongoing among mers-cov isolated from humans and camels 48 in analogy to the s protein though no major selective event was found to be associated with camel-to-human transmission although a positively selected change r911c in nsp3 was observed among human-derived viruses alone suggesting that viral adaptation to our species represented the underlying pressure 48 a recent analysis indicated that hcov-229e may have recombined with the alpaca alpha-cov virus within the s gene as also demonstrated by the distinct phylogenetic trees for the s1 and s2 regions 19 also hcov-229e acquired a deletion in the s gene compared to bat viruses 19 recent sequencing of several of such viruses showed that this deletion is also present in the alpaca cov s gene and in camel-derived alpha-covs 22 this finding is particularly interesting because deletions in the ntd are associated with changes in tissue tropism in tgev transmissible gastroenteritis virus in this porcine virus the spike has dual tropism for the respiratory and intestinal tracts but the n-terminally deleted variants from prcv porcine respiratory coronavirus only infect the respiratory tract 50 51 in chiroptera covs are mainly restricted to the gastrointestinal tract whereas in humans and camelids the upper and lower respiratory airways are infected it will be important to determine whether the s gene deletion in hcov-229e and camelid alphacovs is indeed responsible for a change in tissue tropism recombination contributed to shaping the diversity of the s gene among hcov-nl63 viruses recombination between an ancestral hcov-nl63 virus and the related pedv was also detected in the m gene that in its 3 portion is more similar to pedv than to hcov-229e 52 like sars-cov hcov-nl63 uses its rbd to bind ace2 the binding site on the cellular receptor is the same for the two viruses but the rdbs show no sequence similarity interestingly the rbds of sars-cov and hcov-nl63 do not display any structural similarity either hcov-nl63 contacts ace2 with three discontinuous beta-loops whereas sars-cov binds the receptor through a continuous subdomain 53 figure 3b these observations suggest that the two viruses independently acquired the ability to bind the same ace2 region via convergent evolution or that they shared an ace2-binding ancestor long ago strikingly tgev which is phylogenetically related to hcov-nl63 uses two regions corresponding to the hcov-nl63 beta-loops to bind a distinct cellular receptor anpep figure 1b figure 3b 54 finally hcov-229e sharing sequence homology with hcov-nl63 and tgev figure 1a binds anpep but engages a region distinct from that bound by tgev 55 overall these data highlight the extraordinary plasticity of cov rbds and their complex evolutionary dynamics whereby divergent evolution can be followed by convergent adaptation to the same receptor this complexity is further expanded by the ability of some covs to use other cellular attachment molecules to complement the function of the rbd indeed the s protein of hcov-nl63 exploits heparan sulfate proteoglycans to adhere to host cells 56 interestingly a similar ability to bind heparan sulfate can be gained by mhv with relatively few in vitro-acquired mutations in the s protein 57 in line with the view that heparan sulfate is an aspecific receptor the mutant mhv viruses display expanded host tropism 57 highlighting the potential relevance of combinatorial receptor usage or receptor shifts for interspecies transmission recombination seems to be rampant in hcov-oc43 viruses and contributed to originate the a to e viral genotypes as well as viruses that do not belong to these major genotypes 58 59 60 to our knowledge no study has analyzed the fitness of recombinant viruses or more generally of viruses belonging to distinct genotypes nonetheless two reports indicated that genotype d has become predominant in the east asian population 58 59 whether this is due to population acquired immunity against the older a and b genotypes or to viral features unrelated to antigenicity remains to be determined the active recombination in hcov-oc43 suggests that inference of natural selection is best performed by analysis of sequences belonging to the same genotype in one such analysis positive selection was found to act on the s gene of genotype d viruses 61 interestingly several positively selected sites with high posterior probability of positive selection are located in the ntd which is involved in the binding of sialic acids a positively selected site was located in the ctd a region that has unclear function in the hcov-oc43 s protein as no known protein receptor has been identified to date 61 however recent data from hku1 suggest that by analogy a protein receptor for hcov-oc43 may exist 62 see below the structure of the s protein of hku1 was recently solved the glycan-binding site is located in the ntd and is conserved with bovine coronavirus bcov s1 63 nonetheless antibodies against the ctd but not those against the ntd block hku1 infection of human trachealbronchial epithelial cells suggesting that the ctd is the major rbd and that a protein receptor for hku1 exists 62 in analogy to hcov-nl63 glycans may mediate only the initial attachment to the host cells a recent survey of hku1 clinical isolates from different geographic origins indicated that most viruses from colorado form a subclade in the hku1 phylogeny and carry three distinctive substitutions in the s protein within the ntd ctd and close to the s1s2 cleavage site w197f f613y and h716d respectively 64 it will be interesting to assess whether these differences are functional and derive from a selective process thanks to high-throughput techniques a large number of complete cov genomes have become available to the scientific community and many more will be coming in the near future field studies have contributed enormously to widen our knowledge on the diversity of covs hosted by different vertebrates and epidemiological surveys have provided cov sequences from distinct geographic areas and associated with different disease phenotypes in parallel resources have been created to store and mine these data eg the virus pathogen database and analysis resource vipr 65 these advances have allowed tracing the evolutionary history of the large and complex cov genomes to an unprecedented detail the emerging picture indicates that cov genomes display high plasticity in terms of gene content and recombination the long cov genome expands the sequence space available for adaptive mutation and the spike protein can adapt with relative ease to exploit different cellular receptors these features are likely to underlie the alarming propensity of covs for host jumps despite these advances major challenges remain see outstanding questions efforts to underscore the viral genetic determinants that favor interspecies transmission should be pursued as an effective strategy to prevent or prepare for future hcov emergenceoutstanding questionsdo different genotypes arising from recombination or mutation of the same cov species result in distinct viral phenotypeswhat is the relevance of adaptive changes in nonstructural proteins for host adaptation and what is the role played by accessory proteins in interspecies transmission and virulencewhy do similar viruses determine very different disease phenotypes in distinct mammalian hosts do the viral and host genome interplay in determining disease and to what extentwhat is the distribution of covs in different mammalian orders and how genetically diverse are covs hosted in wild or domestic mammalscan evolutionary information be applied to develop tools to predict which viruses have greater zoonotic potential and may result in the next epidemic
