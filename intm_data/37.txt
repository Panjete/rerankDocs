patientsserum sputum or throat-swab specimens from 19 patients with sars associated with 5 nosocomial infections and 1 laboratory-contamination incident were collected for the present study for each patient data on the date at onset of the disease and on possible sources of infection were gathered by trained interviewers table 1 we also downloaded for our phylogenetic-tree analyses 20 complete taiwanese sars-cov sequences from genbank for 10 of these sars-cov strains have been described elsewhere 11
epidemiological investigationto track the origins of sars cases in taiwan we used sars-treatment reports written by physicians and submitted by their respective hospitals to taiwans cdc we also sent trained interviewers to all hospitals that reported nosocomial infections to gather additional assessment data we based our investigation on the who definition of sars 20
analysis of sars-cov sequence variation and selection of variable regions for phylogenetic analysiscomplete nucleotide sequences from 20 sars-cov isolates available from genbank were aligned by the bioedit program 21 the sequence variations were analyzed by the simplot program httpsraymedsomjhmieduraysoftsimplot genomic sequences from civet-cat sars-cov strains sz-3 and sz-16 were used as standards for comparison 19 sequence-variationdistance plots were generated by use of an 800-bp window a 200-bp step and a jukes-cantor correction initially 4 variable regions sc18 sc22-23 sc27 and sc28 which contain snvs of different sars-cov genotypes 17 were combined for phylogenetic analysis because the resultant phylogenetic tree was not satisfactory we added another 2 variable regions sc10 and sc20 based on the sequence-variation plot figure 2
comparison of conventional and proposed strategies for
phylogenetic analysisthree methodsneighbor joining nj fitch and wagner parsimony pars and maximum likelihood mlwere used for comparison of the conventional ie complete genome and proposed strategies the proposed strategy for phylogenetic analysis entailed the deletion of conserved domains and the combination of minimal variable regions the mega2 and phylip36 software packages were used to construct the phylogeny 2224 and 80 sars-cov sequences downloaded from the genbank database were used for the comparison a bootstrap analysis of 100 replicates was used to compare the robustness of the nj and pars trees generated by the conventional strategy versus that of the nj and pars trees generated by the proposed strategy 25 for the ml method the p value for branch length was calculated by use of the hidden markov model before the conventional and proposed strategies were compared 26
rt-pcr and sequencingrna was extracted from serum sputum or throat-swab specimens by qiaamp viral-rna minikits qiagen rt-pcr primer pairs for the 6 sars-cov variable regions are listed in table 2 rt-pcr was performed in a single-tube reaction qiagen using primers from each region the pcr thermocycler program consisted of predenaturing for 4 min at 95c 35 cycles of denaturing for 30 s at 95c annealing for 30 s at 52c and initial extension at 68c for 3 min and final extension at 68c for 10 min the pcr product was gel-purified for dna sequencing by use of an abi prism 3700 dna analyzer applied biosystems for the laboratory-contamination case multiple primers 17 were used for complete genome sequencing superscript iii rt invitrogen was used for production of cdna and a race kit roche was used to amplify the 5 and 3 ends of cdna both strands of the pcr product were analyzed and the resultant sequences were assembled by use of the seqman ii software package version 50 lasergene
analysis of the nucleotide-signature patterns of different waves of epidemic sars infectionto perform the analysis of nucleotide-signature patterns representative sars-cov strains with complete sequences were chosen from each wave of epidemic sars infection in taiwan in addition cases that were of unclear origin were also included in the analysis the nucleotide sequence of sars-cov strain urbani 16 was used as a prototype for the comparison
development of a proposed strategy for phylogenetic analysis of sars-cov isolatespairwise comparisons were used to analyze sequence variations among 20 sars-cov isolates the results show that the 3 region of the viral genome had the highest sequence variation especially near the junction of replicase 1b and the spike genes figure 2 six variable regionssc10 sc18 sc20 sc22-sc23 sc27 and sc28were chosen for testing the proposed strategy for phylogenetic-tree analysis the total length of the sequences in these 6 regions was 5287 nt using 3 phylogenetic analytical methods we compared for 80 sars-cov isolates the topology and robustness of the phylogenetic tree generated by the proposed strategy which uses only these 6 regions versus the topology and robustness of the tree generated by the conventional strategy which uses the complete genome sequences as shown in figure 3 the topology of the nj tree generated by use of the complete genome sequence was almost identical to that of the nj tree generated by use of a combination of the 6 variable regions similar results were obtained for the pars trees and the ml trees data not shownto compare the robustness of trees generated by the proposed method versus that of trees generated by the conventional method we focused on the bootstrap values for 3 bifurcation nodes between sars-cov clusters node a between civet-cat sars-cov and human sars-cov node b between sars-cov subgroups a1 and a2 and node c between sars-cov subgroups a and b in the nj trees the bootstrap values for nodes a b and c were respectively 100 100 and 63 for the conventional method versus 96 83 and 66 for the proposed method figure 3 similar results were obtained for the pars trees generated by these 2 methods table 3 for the ml tree generated by the proposed method all p values for bifurcation nodes between different clusters were 01 for the ml trees generated by the conventional method the only node with a p value 01 occurred at the bifurcation node between civet-cat sars-cov and human sars-cov table 3
phylogenetic analysis of sars-cov infections in taiwan the proposed method is useful for study of the molecular epidemiology of sars-cov strains both because of its compatibility and because it can obtain results by using fewer specimens in addition it is more economical and less time-consuming we applied this tool to better understand the entire complement of taiwanese sars-cov isolates including the 20 that had been published previously and the additional 19 identified in the present study epidemiological information nasopharyngeal aspirates and serum samples were collected from 18 patients with sars who were treated at 6 taiwanese hospitals table 1 the sars-cov from a laboratory worker patient scvj who contracted sars during december 2003 was sequenced and analyzed an nj tree was constructed and the results showed that all 39 taiwanese sars-cov isolates belonged to subgroup b and could be divided into 3 clustersb1 b2 and b3integration of the results of the phylogenetic analyses and the epidemiological information figure 4 indicated that there were 5 waves of epidemic sars-cov infection in taiwan during 2003 the first wave during early march was composed of 1 imported case 2 cases of transmission between family members strain tw1 and 1 nosocomial infection strain tw3 in cluster b1 both sars-cov strain tw1 and sars-cov strain tw3 were clustered with other sars-cov strains linked to hotel m in hong kong 8 17 the second wave strain tw5 consisted of 4 taiwanese individuals who contracted the disease as they flew from hong kong to beijing 9 and who then carried it back to taiwan during mid-march the third wave which began in late march consisted of an infection that occurred on a train patient tw-hp1 a case of transmission between family members strain tc1 and multiple nosocomial infections all tw-hp patients and patients tw-gd1 tw-gd-3 and tw-gd4 in cluster b2 all the sars-cov isolates mentioned above clustered with the sars-cov isolates from amoy gardens strains cuhk-ag01 cuhk-ag02 and cuhk-ag03 27 with a bootstrap value of 71 the fourth wave which started during late april and ended in mid-june contained sars-cov isolates not only from hospitals jc kc ph gd patients tw-gd2 and tw-gd5 and ym but also from sporadic community outbreaks strains tw10 and tw11 and all of these sars-cov isolates belonged to cluster b3 with a bootstrap value of 71 the fifth wave occurred during early december and began with a laboratory-contamination case patient scvj it clustered with both hku-39849 a sars-cov strain used in the laboratory 14 and twc another strain from taiwan 12 sequence-variation rates for the strain from patient scvj versus strain twc and for the strain from patient scvj versus strain hku-39849 were respectively 001 329756 and 004 1229756 in addition a 24-nt deletion occurred at nucleotide position 2613226155 resulting in both a frameshift of open reading frame 4 and a deletion of 8 aa residues within the small-envelope glycoproteinas shown in figure 5 there were 27 snvs and 1 dinucleotide deletion among 14 sars-cov isolates 12 of the 27 snvs were nonsynonymous changes distinctive snvs were identified for each wave of epidemic sars infection in taiwanat nucleotide position 3165 for wave 1 at nucleotide positions 3852 11493 and 26477 for both wave 3 and wave 4 and at nucleotide positions 26203 and 27812 for wave 4 the nucleotide-signature pattern between the strain from patient scvj the laboratory-contamination case and strain twc consisted of 2 snvs at nucleotide position 1632526600 and 1 dinucleotide deletion at nucleotide position 2780827809when for phylogenetic analysis we combined sequences from different variable regions of the sars-cov genome we assumed that no dual infection or recombination between the sars-cov subgroups had occurred because sars is an acute infectious disease the odds that it will be contracted from 2 subgroups are very low furthermore the strategy of combining different genomic regions for phylogenetic analysis has been used in molecular epidemiological investigations of the origins of hiv-2 in those studies the evolutionary history of a simian immunodeficiency virushiv-2 lineage was reconstructed by use of a combination of partial gag and env sequences the method increased the accuracy of the phylogenetic analysis 28it is noteworthy that the simplot analysis demonstrated that the 3 region of the viral genome especially near the junction of replicase 1b and the spike genes encoding protein s had the greatest sequence variation figure 2 the s protein is considered to be the most important target for the humoral and cellular immune responses to sars-cov 15 16the 3 algorithms most commonly used in molecular phylogenetic analyses are the nj ml and pars methods we used all 3 to obtain tree topologies in terms of robustness a bootstrap value of 70 is often cited as a cutoff for a reliable cluster 25 although the bootstrap values for nodes a and b in the nj and pars trees generated by the conventional method were higher than those in the nj and pars trees generated by the proposed method the difference was not statistically significant in contrast the bootstrap values for node c in the pars trees generated by the conventional and proposed methods were 56 and 67 respectively and the corrresponding bootstrap values in the nj trees were 63 and 66 this finding was confirmed by the ml trees the p value for node c in the tree generated by the conventional method was not statistically significant and that for node c in the tree generated by the proposed method was 01 accordingly the tree generated by the proposed method was more reliable also because the proposed method requires only 7 rt-pcr reactions to perform the analysis it is less time-consuming and more efficient than the conventional method to facilitate other laboratories future molecular epidemiological studies of outbreaks of sars we have made the nucleotide-sequencealignment file of 80 sars-cov reference strains available on our centers web site httpwwwymedutwaidsmolepiin the present study we used 39 taiwanese sars-cov isolates including 20 downloaded from the genbank database to trace the origin and the path of dissemination of sars-cov infections that occurred in taiwan during 2003 phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the taiwanese sars-cov strains were distributed in 3 clustersb1 b2 and b3which differ from clusters 13 reported by yeh et al 11 the latter clusters were not defined on the basis of a bootstrap value whereas we used a bootstrap value of 70 as the cutoff to define our clusters b1b3 therefore our cluster b1 contains both cluster 1 and cluster 2 of yeh et al and their cluster 3 was divided into 2 clustersb2 and b3in our studyon the basis of the epidemiological data for the patients with sars who were considered in the present study it is clear that taiwan experienced 5 waves of epidemic sars infection during 2003 the first and second waves were in different phylogenetic clusters suggesting that they had different origins although both the second and the third waves were in the b2 cluster the sars-cov isolates in the third wave had their own nucleotide-signature pattern figure 5 neither the first wave nor the second wave led to serious outbreaks but the third waveoriginating with a resident of amoy gardens who visited taiwanled to 1 transmission on a train strain twc3 1 case of transmission between family members strain tc1 and nosocomial infections in at least 2 hospitals hp and gd in northern taiwan only 1 nucleotide difference between strains tc1 and twc3 was noted figure 5 in addition strain twc3 and an amoy gardens strain cuhk-ag01 shared an identical sequence even though the woman who was the source of the isolate of strain twc3 never left taiwan at any time during the epidemic an epidemiological investigation showed that the visitor from amoy gardens and this woman sat in different cars during the train ride because this is the first documented case in which there is molecular proof of transmission on a train it raises the question of why only 1 passenger contracted the infection because it has been reported that sars appears to be most infectious at 611 days after onset of illness and not during the first day of symptoms 29 we assumed that the visitor from amoy gardens was not highly infectious during the train ride even though he developed symptoms during the same evening that he traveled from taipei to taichungit is important to note that twc the sars-cov strain isolated from patient twc clustered with whu an isolate from wuhan city china in cluster 1 but did not cluster with either strain tc1 direct sequencing of a sample from patient twc or strain twc3 direct sequencing of a sample from patient tw-hp1 figures 3 and 4 in addition there was a 7-nt difference between twc and tc1 figure 5 if we assume that strain cuhk-ag01 represents the first-generation sars-cov in the transmission link then both strain tc1 and strain twc3 were the second-generation and twh was the third-generation according to the snv-based analysis figure 5 the number of nucleotide changes in the sars-cov genome per number of intermediate hosts was extremely low 1 nt changehost because it has also been shown that no or very limited nucleotide changes occur in sars-cov sequences from either cultures or primary clinical specimens 11 30 we can tentatively conclude that strain twc is a laboratory contaminant and did not originate from patient tc1the origin of the fourth wave cluster b3 is still unknown the molecular epidemiological data suggest that it originated at hospital jc patient tw-jc2 and then spread to hospitals kc ph gd and ym as well as to others the epidemiological investigations also support this hypothesis tw-ph1 a patient with sars who was treated at hospital jc went to kaohsiung city and received treatment at hospital kc and after being treated at hospital kc table 1 went back to penghu island and was hospitalized in hospital ph where he transmitted the disease to other health-care workers as shown in figure 6 after combining the epidemiological data with the results of our phylogenetic-tree analysis we conclude that the fourth wave of epidemic sars infection progressed in 2 dissemination paths the first path was from hospital jc to hospital kc in kaohsiung and then to hospital ph on penghu island the second path was from hospital jc to hospital gd and then to hospital ym two cases associated with community outbreaks in taipei strains tw10 and tw11 also belong to this clusterwith regard to the laboratory contamination the laboratory researcher said that he had used sars-cov strain hku-39849 for his experiment however our results indicate that the sequence in patient scvj is more closely related to that of strain twc figure 5 because the researcher claimed that he had not obtained strain twc from taiwans cdc and that he had used many clinical sars-cov strains besides hku-39849 we are continuing our investigation to confirm both 1 whether the virus that he had obtained from taiwans cdc was in fact strain hku-39849 or strain twc and 2 which sars-cov strain that he handled was the source of the laboratory contamination because 30 imported sars cases have been reported by taiwans cdc but have not yet been analyzed we plan to use the proposed tool to conduct further analyses in an attempt to identify their origins these contact histories will provide valuable information for the control of future sars infectionsthe sars-cov nucleotide sequences 6 sequences for each of 18 strains identified during this research have been deposited in genbank accession numbers ay451856ay451963 the

committee on taxonomy of viruses officially renamed the novel coronavirus ie previously 2019ncov responsible for the current outbreak of covid19 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 this was chosen based on analysis of the new coronaviruss evolutionary history and associated pathogen ie sarscov the virus which emerged in december 2019 in the chinese city of wuhan causes a respiratory illness called covid19 which can spread from person to person

 as of 21 february 2020 there have been 76 288 cases of sarscov2 confirmed in mainland china including 11 477 serious 2 345 deaths and 20 659 discharged as well as 68 cases in hong kong 10 in macao and 26 in taiwan more than 1300 cases have also been confirmed in at least 27 other countries on four continents world health organization who officials outlined their top research priorities for controlling the outbreak of the coronavirusassociated disease known as covid19 and highlighted the importance of developing candidate therapeutics and easytoapply diagnostics for identifying active asymptomatic and resolved infections of note the coronaviridae family not only includes sarscov2 but also sarscov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov and common cold viruses eg 229e oc43 nl63 and hku1

 the sarscov pathogen was responsible for 8 000 cases and 774 deaths in 37 countries during the 2002 to 2003 sars outbreak

 and the merscov pathogen was responsible for 2 494 cases and 858 deaths in 27 countries during the 2012 mers outbreak

coronaviruses are known to circulate in mammals and birds previous studies revealed that both sarscov and merscov are zoonotic in origin originally coming from bats
9
 
10
 
11
 
12
 with sarscov spreading from bats to palm civets to humans
13
 
14
 
15
 and merscov spreading from bats to camels to humans
16
 
17
 recent research has also reported that the sarscov2 virus likely originated in bats a proposal based on the similarity of its genetic sequence to that of other known coronaviruses
18
 however like sarscov merscov and many other coronaviruses the sarscov2 virus may have been transmitted to humans by an intermediate animal host
19
 therefore the identity of the animal source of sarscov2 remains a key and urgent question furthermore to stem future outbreaks of this type and preventing the transmission of zoonotic diseases to humans should be a top research prioritythe existence of an intermediate animal host of sarscov2 between a probable bat reservoir and humans is still under investigation the discovery of a virus closely related to the newly emerged sarscov2 in a data set from pangolins sampled more than a year ago illustrates that the sampling of other mammals handled or consumed by humans could uncover even more closely related viruses
20

during a press conference on 7 february 2020 two researchers shen yongyi and xiao lihua from the south china agricultural university in guangzhou identified the pangolin as a potential source of the sarscov2 virus based on genetic comparison of coronaviruses taken from pangolins and from humans infected during the recent outbreak by analyzing more than 1 000 metagenomic samples and using molecular biology testing they found that the positive rate of  coronavirus in pangolins was 70 and that the genome sequence of an isolated virus strain was 99 similar to that of the sarscov2 virus thus whether pangolins acted as a direct intermediate animal host of the sarscov2 virus is worth further investigationin the present study we performed analyses of the transmission dynamics and evolutionary history of the virus based on 70 genomes of sarscov2 strains sampled from australia n  4 belgium n  1 china hubei province n  19 guangdong province n  16 zhejiang province n  4 taiwan n  1 finland n  1 france n  4 germany n  1 japan n  1 korea n  1 singapore n  3 thailand n  2 united kingdom n  2 and united states n  10 with sampling dates between 24 december 2019 and 3 february 2020 we reanalyzed two of the 21 pangolin metagenome samples from previously published data
20
 and compared the amino acid sequences of the s protein of sarscov2 and sarsrelated coronaviruses these analyses should extend our understanding of the origins and dynamics crossspecies transmission and subsequent host adaptation of the sarscov2 outbreak in china and elsewhereas of 9 february 2020 73 genomes of sarscov2 strains obtained from humans have been released on gisaid httpgisaidorg

20
 after assembly the srr10168377 and srr10168378 genomes were 16 999 and 6 392 bp in length respectively we defined another data set dataset6 composed of six genome sequences of coronavirus strains betacovwuhanhu12019 epiisl402125 was grouped as clade a one betacovbatyunnanratg132013 epiisl402131 and two batslcovzc45 mg772933 and batslcovzxc21 mg772934 sarsrelated coronaviruses were grouped as clade b and clade d respectively the two assembled genomes from srr10168377 and srr10168377 were grouped into clade c the two data sets dataset70 and dataset6 were aligned using mafft v7222
22
 and then manually curated using bioedit v725
23

to assess the recombination of dataset70 we employed the pairwise homoplasy index phi to measure the similarity between closely linked sites using splitstree v4151
24
 the bestfit nucleotide substitution models for the two data sets were identified according to the bayesian information criterion bic method with 3 24 candidate models or 11 88 candidate models substitution schemes in jmodeltest v2110
25
 to evaluate the phylogenetic signals of dataset70 and dataset6 we performed likelihoodmapping analysis
26
 using treepuzzle v53
27
 with 25 000 to 175 000 randomly chosen quartets for the two data sets for dataset70 split network analysis was performed using kishinoyano85 distance transformation with the neighbornet method which can be loosely thought of as a hybrid between the neighborjoining nj and split decomposition methods implemented in treepuzzle v53 for dataset70 nj
28
 phylogenetic trees were constructed using the kimura 2parameter method

32
 for all nj and ml phylogenies of the two data sets bootstrap support values were calculated with 1 000 replicates
34
 and trees were midpoint rooted for dataset70 regression analyses were used to determine the correlations among sampling dates and roottotip genetic divergences of the respective ml phylogenies with tempest v15
35
 we also estimated the evolutionary rate and time to the most recent common ancestor tmrca for dataset70 using ml dating in the treetime package
36

to reconstruct the evolutionary history of sarscov2 bayesian inference through a markov chain monte carlo mcmc framework was implemented in beast v184
37
 with the beagle v212 library program
38
 used for computational enhancement we used two schemes to set the timescale prior for each data set that is constrained evolutionary rate method with a lognormal prior mean  10  103 substitutions per site per year 95 bayesian credible interval bci 1854  104 to 4  103 substitutions per site per year placed on the evolutionary rate parameter as per previous studies
39

41
 and the tipdating method for which the overall estimated evolutionary rate was given an uninformative continuoustime markov chain ctmc reference prior we ran bayesian phylogenetic analyses using various clock model combinations ie strict clock and uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock
42
 and coalescent tree priors ie constant size and exponential growth to ensure adequate mixing of model parameters mcmc chains were run for 100 million steps with sampling every 10 000 steps from the posterior distribution convergence was evaluated by calculating the effective sample sizes of the parameters using tracer v171
43
 all parameters had an effective sample size 200 indicative of sufficient sampling trees were summarized as maximumclade credibility mcc trees using treeannotator v184 after discarding the first 10 as burnin and then visualized in figtree v144 httptreebioedacuksoftwarefigtreethe hiv transmission cluster engine hivtrace httpwwwhivtraceorg

 we divided dataset6 into four clades ie clade a clade b clade c and clade d with clade a designated as the query groupdataset70 included 70 genomes of sarscov2 strains sampled from australia n  4 belgium n  1 china hubei province n  19 guangdong province n  16 zhejiang province n  4 taiwan n  1 finland n  1 france n  4 germany n  1 japan n  1 korea n  1 singapore n  3 thailand n  2 uk n  2 and usa n  10 with sampling dates between 24 december 2019 and 3 february 2020 table s1 the samples were primarily from china 5714 and hubei province 2714 the chinese province was acknowledged as the original epicenter of the sarscov2 outbreakfor dataset70 and dataset6 hky and gtr  g were the models of bestfit respectively across the two different substitution schemes ie 24 and 88 candidate models according to the bic method and were thus used in subsequent likelihoodmapping and phylogenetic analyses for the two data sets the phi tests of dataset70 did not find statistically significant evidence of recombination p  10 likelihoodmapping analysis of dataset70 revealed that 697 of the quartets were distributed in the center of the triangle indicating a strong starlike topology signal reflecting a novel virus which may be due to exponential epidemic spread figure 1a likewise 259 of the quartets from dataset6 were distributed in the center of the triangle indicating a strong phylogenetic signal figure 1b the split network generated for dataset70 using the neighbornet method was highly unresolved and the phylogenetic relationship of dataset70 was probably best represented by a network rather than a tree figure 1c the existence of polytomies indicatedin contrast to that expected in a strictly bifurcating treean explosive starlike evolution of sarscov2 both the nj and ml phylogenetic analyses of sarscov2 dataset70 also showed starlike topologies in accordance with the likelihoodmapping results figures 2 and s1 the ml phylogenetic tree showed greater starlike topology than the nj phylogenetic tree indicating that the ml method was more reasonable for dataset70 roottotip regression analyses between genetic divergence and sampling date using the bestfitting root showed that dataset70 had a minor strong positive temporal signal r

2  008 figure s2 the estimated evolutionary rate and tmrca were 334  104 substitutions per site per year and 19 october 2019 respectively in accordance with the roottotip regression results based on bayesian timescaled phylogenetic analysis using the constrained evolutionary rate method with a lognormal prior mean  10  103 substitutions per site per year 95 bci 1854  104 to 4  103 substitutions per site per year placed on the evolutionary rate parameter the estimated tmrca dates and evolutionary rates for sarscov2 from dataset70 ranged from 21 may 2019 to 13 october 2019 95 bci 27 and 30 january 2020 and from 157  104 to 106  103 substitutions per site per year 95 bci 108  104 to 310  103 respectively table 1 furthermore based on bayesian timescaled phylogenetic analysis using the tipdating method the estimated tmrca dates and evolutionary rates from dataset70 ranged from 22 to 24 november 2019 95 bci 23 october 2019 and 16 december 2019 and from 119  103 to 131  103 substitutions per site per year 95 bci 622  104 to 196  103 respectively table 1 thus the estimated tmrca dates and evolutionary rates for sarscov2 from dataset70 were consistent among the different clock models strict and relaxed but were distinct among the different dating methods constraineddating and tipdating the estimated tmrca dates and evolutionary rates for sarscov2 from dataset70 using the tipdating method exhibited much narrower 95 bcis than the constraineddating method in addition the estimated tmrca dates and evolutionary rates for sarscov2 from dataset70 were consistent between the different coalescent tree models ie constant and exponential when using the tipdating method but were distinct when using the constraineddating method for each data set we employed the hky nucleotide substitution model as well as a constant size coalescent tree prior and strict molecular clock model to estimate the tmrca the estimates of the mcc phylogenetic relationships among the sarscov2 genomes from the bayesian coalescent framework using the tipdating method as well as the constant size coalescent tree prior and strict molecular clock are displayed in figure 4 as shown eight phylogenetic clusters number of sequences 2 to 7 posterior probability 099 to 10 were identifiedwe considered individuals as genetically linked when the genetic distance between sarscov2 strains was 001 substitutionssite based on this we identified one large transmission cluster that included 66 of 70 9429 genomes thus suggesting low genetic divergence for dataset70 figure s3 we also considered individuals as genetically linked when the genetic distance between sarscov2 strains was 0001 substitutionssite based on this we identified 6 transmission clusters that included 37 of 70 5286 genomes for dataset70 figure 5 clusters ranged in size from 2 to 23 genomesthe nj and ml phylogenetic topologies of dataset6 were consistent with each other figure s4 indicating that the use of a small number of sequences could show similar topological results homology plot analysis of dataset6 also revealed that betacovbatyunnanratg132013 was more similar to the sarscov2 virus than the coronavirus obtained from the two pangolin samples srr10168377 and srr10168378 consistent with phylogenetic analysis figure s5 of note clade d batslcovzc45 and batslcovzxc21 had higher similarity to the sarscov2 virus in the first 12 000 bp region of the full alignment than to the pangolin coronavirus figure s5 we also found that a unique peptide prra insertion region in the spike protein at the junction of s1 and s2 junction in the human sarscov2 virus clade a induced a furin cleavage motif rrar which could be a predicted polybasic cleavage site and thus a unique feature of sarscov2 in comparison with the other three clades clade b clade c and clade d figure s6on the basis of dataset70 our likelihoodmapping analysis confirmed additional treelike signals over time compared with our previous results

 this result implies increasing genetic divergence of sarscov2 in human hosts figure 1a consistent with the findings of our earlier studies

 split network analysis for sarscov2 dataset70 using the neighbornet method was highly unresolved indicating an explosive starlike evolution of sarscov2 and recent and rapid humantohuman transmission figure 1c these results are consistent with the ml phylogenetic analyses which showed polytomy topology from dataset70 figure 2 however nj phylogenetic analyses showed a more bifurcating tree topology compared with the ml phylogenetic analyses figure s1 this is a good example showing the differences between nj and ml phylogenetic construction methods dataset70 had a minor strong positive temporal signal based on roottotip regression and ml dating analyses figures 3 and s2 with the estimated tmrca dates and evolutionary rates for sarscov2 found to be nearly identical using both analyses table 1 the estimated tmrca dates and evolutionary rates for sarscov2 were very similar across different clock models and coalescent tree priors using the tipdating method the estimated tmrca dates and evolutionary rates for sarscov2 were also very similar across different clock models using the constraineddating method but highly distinct across the different coalescent tree priors table 1 the tmrca estimated by the tipdating method was relatively narrower than that determined by the constraineddating method consistent with our previous studies
46
 
47
 bayesian analyses with the tipdating method using a strict clock as well as constant size coalescent tree prior indicated that sarscov2 is evolving at a rate of 124  103 substitutions per site per year table 1 in accordance with our prior research

 and similar to that found for other human coronaviruses
41
 our results also suggest that the virus originated on 24 november 2019 which is in further agreement with our earlier studies

 we identified eight phylogenetic clusters number of sequences 2 to 7 with posterior probabilities between 099 and 10 using bayesian inference figure 4 we also identified six transmission clusters number of sequences 2 to 23 when the genetic distance between the sarscov2 strains was 0001 substitutionssite figure 5 however our conclusions should be considered preliminary and explained with caution due to the limited number of sarscov2 genome sequences presented in this study as more genome sequences become available there may be stronger amonglineage rate variation over time as to warrant using a relaxed clock model but we anticipate that the evolutionary rates and tmrca dates will be broadly similar to those estimated here as the number of substitutions is still small it is tempting to speculate that sequencing errors could have a considerable impact on the evolutionary rate and tmrca date estimates we removed three sarscov2 genome sequences ie betacovwuhanipbcamswh022019 epiisl403931 betacovshenzhenszth0012020 epiisl406592 betacovshenzhenszth0042020 epiisl406595 with potential sequencing errors but these may have less impact on the above estimates when more substitutions of sarscov2 are accumulated over time we also expect that as more sarscov2 genome sequences become available the estimated 95 bcis of the evolutionary rates and tmrca dates will be narrowerwe found that the pangolincov virus from the two pangolin samples was clustered with the sarscov2 virus with 100 bootstrap support however betacovbatyunnanratg132013 was more similar to the sarscov2 virus than to the pangolin coronavirus and the human sarscov2 virus clade a showed a unique peptide prra insertion not found in the other three clades clade b clade c clade d this insertion constitutes an rrar motif in the spike protein at the junction of s1 and s2 junction in the human sarscov2 virus after considering the next amino acid r of the unique peptide prra figure s6 of note the highly favored motifs for furin cleavage are argxarglysarg rxrr or rxkr and the minimal motifs for furin cleavage can be rxxr
48
 we also note that some of the other coronaviruses have a furin motif in almost the same location in their spike proteins
49
 
50
 lentiviruses have an rkxr r arginine k lysine x any amino acid site between gp120 and gp41 cleaved by furin to convert gp160 into subunits

 therefore it is tempting to speculate that cleavage or lack of cleavage of the spike protein at this site could significantly impact host range and transmissibility taken together the pangolin coronavirus samples srr10168377 and srr10168378 were less similar to the sarscov2 virus than to the betacovbatyunnanratg132013 virus and did not have the rrar motif therefore we concluded that the human sarscov2 virus which is responsible for the current outbreak of covid19 did not come directly from pangolins however due to the limited viral metagenomic data obtained from pangolins we cannot exclude that other pangolins from china may contain coronaviruses that exhibit greater similarity to the sarscov2 virusin conclusion our results emphasize the importance of further epidemiological investigations genomic data surveillance and experimental studies of the role of the unique furin cleavage motif rrar of sarscov2 in the spike protein at the junctions of s1 and s2 such work could positively impact public health in terms of guiding prevention efforts to reduce sarscov2 transmission in real time and to stem future outbreaks of zoonotic diseasesthe authors declare that there are no conflict of interestsxl conceived and designed the study and drafted the manuscript xl bf and ac analyzed the data xl qn jz qz yl bf and ac interpreted the data and provided critical comments all authors reviewed and approved the final manuscriptin the short amount of time since a novel coronavirus was identified as being the cause of the ongoing outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars around the world 1 several sars coronavirus cov isolates have been cloned and several complete genomic sequences have been determined 24 preliminary sequence analyses have indicated that sars cov is a new type of coronavirus that does not belong to any group of coronaviruses yet characterized 2 3 however the phylogenetic position and origin of sars cov remain elusive most reported phylogenetic analyses have been based on either individual proteins 2 3 5 short nucleotide sequences 1 or whole-genome similarity 6 although these analyses have not yielded conflicting results the phylogenetic relationship between sars cov and its relatives remained inconclusive whereas most reported phylogenetic trees have placed sars cov between group 2 covs and group 3 covs a few trees have indicated that there is a relationship between sars cov and group 3 covs 13 5it is notable that both sars cov and infectious bronchitis virus ibv a group 3 cov form long branches in all reported phylogenetic trees because it implies that theremight have been a problem associated with a long-branch attraction lba artifact during the tree reconstructions 7 an lba artifact might be caused by limited taxa a small number of amino acid or nucleotide positions or highly variable regions of nucleotide sequences any of which could generate misleading phylogenetic information during the tree-reconstruction process to further define the phylogenetic relationship between sars cov and other coronaviruses we took advantage of recently published sars cov genome sequences and constructed a single large data set composed of 3364 well-aligned amino acid positions because the 7 proteins used to construct the data set appeared to have different long branches 13 5 the effect of an lba artifact in tree reconstruction should be minimized the aim of the present study was to apply reliable analytical methods to the construction of a robust hypothesis about the phylogeny of sars cov in relation to other coronaviruses

results the data set was composed of 7 concatenated protein sequences ie 3clpro pol hel s e m and n obtained from 7 coronavirus isolates and a partition-homogeneity test 14 revealed no significant incongruence between phylogenetic trees derived from different proteins the best trees were inferred from the data set by the ml bi and mp methods 811 all of which yielded the same tree topology and supported the hypothesis that the relationship between sars cov and group 2 covs is monophyletic figure 1 the statistical supporting values at all nodes were 100 by ml quartet-puzzling bi posterior-probability and mp bootstrapping analyses pairwise comparison of protein distances corrected by the ml method also showed that the intergroup distance between sars cov and group 2 covs was the shortest compared with those between sars cov and other coronaviruses table 1 the sars cov  group 2 covs clade was subsequently joined by ibv a group 3 cov the separation of sars cov and ibv was more evident in the trees resulting from the present study than in previously reported protein trees in which sars cov and ibv were either minimally separated by very short branches or artificially joined at deep branches 13 the hypothesis that the relationship between sars cov and group 2 covs is monophyletic was fully supported by the kh test in which the ml values of all the other 944 possible trees were shown to be significantly worse than that of the present best tree when a more conservative sh test was employed only 19 suboptimal trees did not show significant differences in their ml values compared with the tree shown in figure 1 among these 19 trees 13 supported the hypothesis that the relationship between sars cov and group 2 covs is monophyletic and only 6 either placed sars cov at the base of group 2 covsgroup 3 covs or identified it as a sister to group 3 covs therefore the sh test did not reject the best tree but rather implied that there are strong links between sars cov group 2 covs and group 3 covs in addition the hypothesis that the relationship between sars cov and group 2 covs is monophyletic is supported by a recently reported phylogenetic analysis using the replicase gene 15
discussion despite the evidence supporting a monophyletic relationship between sars cov and group 2 covs the data currently available still support the preliminary conclusion that sars cov might be a new type of coronavirus ie group 4 the problem of the origin of sars cov cannot be resolved hereit may require the identification and sequencing of additional closely related coronaviruses from humans andor animals nonetheless the establishment of a solid phylogenetic relationship between sars cov and other coronaviruses may provide us with valuable information to use in the development of vaccines and therapeutics and may in the near future help shed light on the true origin of sars covin december 2019 a novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was identified in wuhan china as the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease covid-19 as of may 2020 this virus had spread to more than 187 countries 12 common symptoms of infection include fever cough and shortness of breath while severe cases are characterized by advanced respiratory distress and pneumonia often resulting in death 3 it is still unknown how many infected people who present mild or no symptoms can spread the virus however a recent study showed that in wuhan roughly 60 of all infections were spread by asymptomatic people 4 this characteristic significantly thwarts the work of public health officials who are attempting to detect transmission clusters such as the ones identified in china 56 and singapore 7 through epidemiological contact tracingsoon after the first epidemiological and genetic sequence data of sars-cov-2 were made available a glut of phylogeny-based analyses began to circulate in scientific papers as well as on social media discussing the origin and variants of the virus as well as the countries that may have fueled its spread 8-10 the implications of misunderstanding the real dynamics of the covid-19 pandemic are extremely dangerous ethnic or social discrimination resulting from unsupported assumptions on viral contagionwhich are often amplified by irresponsible uncontrollable communicationscan be highly damaging for people and countries although social media platforms are often vehicles for fake news and hype tremendous efforts are being made by the scientific community to provide free up-to-date information on ongoing studies as well as critical evaluations in particular the us-based nextstrain 11 team has been posting real-time updates on the tracing of the epidemic by molecular analyses several discussions and evidence-based debates on controversial hypotheses on the epidemic have ensued eg the number of untraced infections in the us the putative introduction of the virus to italy through germany 12 and the alleged lineage diversification in china 13 which was later criticized 14 another example is a recent study that identified three geographically separated variants of sars-cov-2 based on a phylogenetic network inferred from 160 full genomes available on march 3 2020 10 this work was widely covered by the news media 15 however it was also highly criticized by experts in the field for its inaccurate use of phylogenetic methods incorrect rooting of the phylogeny and significant sampling bias 16-18 an editorial published in science 19 also highlighted how unsupported or misleading claims circulating in forums social media and even peer-reviewed articles have resulted from substantial overinterpretation of the available data hence there is an urgent need to reframe the current debate in more rigorous scientific terms and quantitatively evaluate whether sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies currently exists or whether gaps need to be addressed here we present an in-depth longitudinal analysis of the phylogenetic information on sars-cov-2 genomes that became available between march and april 2020 to assess their reliability for molecular epidemiology studiesthe gisaid global initiative on sharing all influenza data database 20 was accessed on march 18 march 25 march 30 and april 24 2020 table s1 in multimedia appendix 1 and table s2 in multimedia appendix 2 our main analyses compared the march 30 data set with the april 24 data set after quality control of sequences that were not full genomes or contained extensive stretches of unknown nucleotides separate sequence alignments were generated using mafft alignment software 21 each sequence alignment included all sequences collected on a given date march 18 794 genome sequences from 35 countries march 25 1662 genome sequences from 42 countries march 30 2608 genome sequences from 55 countries and april 24 8992 genome sequences from 63 countriesbefore carrying out any phylogeny-based analysis of virus evolution and spatiotemporal spread it is crucial to test the quality of the sequence data since uneven sampling the presence of phylogenetic noise and the absence of a temporal signal can affect the reliability of the results eg ancestral state reconstructions molecular clock calibrations 22 sars-cov-2 full genome alignments generated from sequences in gisaid 23 at different time points were analyzed as follows transitiontransversions vs genetic distance plots were generated using dambe6 24 the presence of phylogenetic signals satisfying resolved phylogenetic relationships among sequences was evaluated by likelihood mapping analysis 25 using iq-tree and allowing the software to search for all possible quartets using the best-fitting nucleotide substitution model 25 likelihood mapping analysis estimates the likelihood of each of possible tree topology for any group of four sequences quartet randomly chosen from an alignment and reports them inside an equilateral triangle the likelihood map where the corners represent distinct tree topologies and the center represents star-like trees quartets are considered to be resolved when the three likelihoods are significantly different ie a phylogenetic signal and most dots equally distributed in the corners indicate that the data are suitable for robust phylogeny inference quartets are considered to be unresolved or partially resolved when two or all three of the likelihood values are not significantly different ie phylogenetic noise and most dots distributed in the side or center areas indicate that the data may not be sufficient for robust phylogeny inference extensive simulation studies have shown that for sequences to be considered robust in terms of the phylogenetic signal the sidecenter areas of the likelihood mapping must include 40 of the unresolved quartets 26 maximum likelihood tree reconstruction was performed in iq-tree based on the best-fit model chosen according to the bayesian information criterion 2728 exploration of the temporal structure ie the presence of a molecular clock in the data was assessed by regression of divergence root-to-tip genetic distance vs sampling time using tempest 29 in this case the absence of a linear trend indicates that the data do not contain a temporal signal and that the data are not appropriate for phylogenetic inference using molecular clock models the recently developed transphylo software package was employed to estimate how many intermediates in the putative transmission chain connected each pair of viral sequences from two infected individuals using a transmission matrix 30 the transphylo r package was used to infer the transmission matrices of sars-cov-2 30as of march 30 2020 we compared the number of full genomes sampled per country with the number of confirmed cases at the time of sampling as well as with the countrys total population figure 1 we obtained 2608 full genomes from 55 countries during the pandemic the number of full genomes with high coverage has been steeply increasing by considering countries with at least 25000 confirmed cases or 3 or more genomes in our set we found the spearman rank correlations between confirmed cases a proxy for sampling homogeneity and genomes per country to be fairly weak 047 on march 30 and 052 on april 24 however correlation could only be investigated with confirmed cases since not all affected countries have publicly reported the total number of coronavirus tests performed as of march 30 within the same country sequenced genomes were usually sampled from a few hotspots thus these data are not necessarily representative of the whole epidemic in that country sars-cov-2 full genome sequences available from patients in the united states the country with the highest number of confirmed cases were mainly sampled in washington state 66 during the early epidemic while less than one-third 32 available from the epicenter of the us epidemic the state of new york italy the country with the second highest number of confirmed cases uploaded 26 genomes 1 of which came from the marche region 4 from friuli venezia giulia 7 from abruzzo 9 from lazio and only 5 from lombardy which is the epicenter of the italian epidemic 31 table s1 as of march 30 2020 the top 10 contributors per number of genomes were the united states n612 iceland n343 uk n321 china n300 the netherlands n190 france n119 japan n83 canada n80 australia n64 spain n40 and belgium n46 notably some countries uploaded a high number of genomes despite having a relatively low number of cases eg georgia iceland senegal and the democractic republic of the congo as of april 24 2020 the top 10 contributors per number of genomes were the united states n2413 the united kingdom n1779 australia n891 iceland n533 the netherlands n514 china n449 belgium n329 denmark n250 france n217 and spain n159 table s2 in multimedia appendix 2lack of resolution and uncertainty in the sars-cov-2 phylogenetic tree is to be expected considering that relatively little genetic diversity can be accumulated during the first 3 months of an epidemic even for an exponentially spreading and rapidly evolving rna virus overall the phylogenetic signal of the current data has been increasing with the number of genomes released the percentages of unresolved quartets detected in the sars-cov-2 full genome alignments on march 3 and march 10 were still too high to allow reliable inferences figure s1 in multimedia appendix 3 in other words this lack of phylogenetic signal likely resulted in overall unreliable topologies of any sars-cov-2 trees obtained using these data and even clades with high bootstrap values should be interpreted with extreme caution a preliminary maximum likelihood tree inferred from the full genome viral sequences available on march 3 2020 showed a well-supported cluster of european and asian sequences reported in figure s2 in multimedia appendix 3 which contained a subclade subclade a figure 2a including a sequence isolated in germany that appeared to be paraphyletic with strong bootstrap support to an italian sequence clustering in turn with sequences from finland mexico germany and switzerland based on this observation which is available on nextstrain a heated discussion circulated on social media about a transmission event from germany to italy followed by further spread from italy to other countries however in a new tree inferred just one week later when more than 135 new full genome sequences were made available on gisaid 23 the direct link between germany and italy in subclade a disappeared due to additional clustering of previously unsampled sequences from portugal brazil wales and the netherlands figure 2b in addition the likelihood that alternative tree topologies generated arbitrarily switching branches in the tree arrows in figure 2b implying different dissemination scenarios was not significantly different shimodaira-hasegawa test table 1 than the likelihood of the tree inferred from the real data in other words it is not possible with the present data to decide which branching pattern and therefore which phylogeographic reconstruction most likely represents actual dissemination routes among european countriesas the number of available genome sequences is rapidly growing sars-cov-2 full genome data sets are steadily showing less than 40 unresolved quartets in the center 386 on march 18 figure s1c in multimedia appendix 3 323 on march 25 figure s1d in multimedia appendix 3 289 on march 30th figure s1e in multimedia appendix 3 and 276 on april 24 figure s1f in multimedia appendix 3 this indicates that the amount of phylogenetic information can now potentially be used to define phylogenetic relationships among strains by plotting the mean genetic distance of each sequence from the root of a phylogeny versus the sequence sampling time we can test for a significant linear correlation which is necessary to calibrate a reliable molecular clock 29 figure s3 in multimedia appendix 3 as expected in genomes obtained over a very short period of time approximately 3 months since the beginning of the outbreak the correlation in the current data is fairly weak table 1 reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships of the same european sub-clade a discussed above with the sequences available on march 18 2020 showed a much more complex snapshot of the spread of sars-cov-2 figure s4 in multimedia appendix 3 a closer look at subclade a reveals that even with more genomes available inference is biased by oversampling of some countries and undersampling of others figure s4 in multimedia appendix 3 moreover when estimating the number of intermediates in the putative transmission chain we found that numerous links among samples were still missing figure s5 in multimedia appendix 3 in such a scenario it is not advisable to extrapolate conclusions on the origin and dissemination of strainsthe phylogenetic signal is increasing in the global alignment however likelihood mapping per country using data from countries reporting the highest numbers of cases united states italy spain germany and france indicates that some local data sets lacked sufficient signals up to march 30 2020 figure s6 in multimedia appendix 3 in particular a lack of signal was found in sequence sets from italy 26 genomes 45 variant sites 02 of total sites in the genome 11 parsimony informative the united states 612 genomes 675 variant sites 23 of total sites in the genome 158 parsimony informative and china 300 genomes 742 variant sites 25 of total sites in the genome 98 parsimony informative the top 5 contributing states in the united states are

shandong 9300 30 20 genomes 67 are not labeled with a province or city neither china nor the united states showed a phylogenetic signal despite the high number of genome sequences available figure s6 in multimedia appendix 3 contrastingly and unexpectedly countries with low numbers of genome sequences germany spain and france did show a phylogenetic signal figure s6 in multimedia appendix 3 the presence of a phylogenetic signal 40 unresolved quartets in the center was detected only for germany 27 genomes 34 variant sites 02 of total sites in the genome 15 parsimony informative with dsseldorf and north rhine westphalia being the highest contributing regions 12 and 11 genomes respectively spain 40 genomes 60 variant sites 02 of total sites in the genome 23 parsimony informative with madrid and comunidad valenciana being the highest contributing regions 18 and 10 genomes respectively and france 119 genomes 155 variant sites 05 of total sites in the genome 44 parsimony informative with auvergne-rhne-alpes hauts de france and bretagne being the highest contributing regions 42 30 and 13 genomes respectively despite the presence of a phylogenetic signal in these countries only the genomes from france also showed a temporal signal that would allow the calibration of a molecular clock and reframing of the phylogenetic and phylogeographic inferences in the spatiotemporal dimension figure s7 in multimedia appendix 3 on the other hand the transmission matrix for france indicates that considerable links are still missing due to unsampled infected individuals limiting the reliability of transmission cluster studies based on the sequence data figure s8 in multimedia appendix 3 when we looked almost a month later at the phylogenetic signals for the countries that reported the highest numbers of confirmed cases as of april 24 2020 we found that these countries showed sufficient phylogenetic signals figure s9 in multimedia appendix 3 however while france and germany also displayed sufficient temporal signals to allow in-depth molecular epidemiology studies at least in principle data sets from the united states 39-fold increase on april 24 with respect to march 30 the united kingdom 55-fold increase and spain 39-fold increase still showed weak or no temporal signals figure s10 in multimedia appendix 3 despite the substantial increases in the number of available sequencescharacterization of transmission events is fundamental to understand the dynamics of any infectious disease from a public health standpoint it is crucial to be able to trace transmissions at the local level within-country identification of active transmission clusters would open the way to more effective public health interventions the most optimal inference of transmission events would contain a combination of genetic and epidemiological data for a joint analysis indeed transmission investigations that have been performed to date have been based on contact-tracing epidemiological and clinical data 3334 bayesian analysis 35 which infers phylogenetic and phylogeographic patterns from a posterior distribution of trees can facilitate comparisons of different evolutionary scenarios aid retrieval of the correct topology and estimate an accurate evolutionary rate using relaxed clock methods 36 more genome sequences sampled at different time points and from diverse geographic areas are becoming available daily therefore in-depth bayesian phylodynamic and phylogeographic analyses of the covid-19 pandemic will soon be a viable option however it is important to consider the dramatic effects of inhomogeneous sampling lack of phylogenetic signal and missing data on phylogeographic reconstructions 37published scientific data and media are currently easily accessible to a worldwide audience proper weighing of the information being shared is more important than ever in the first months of the epidemic many researchers rushed to study local dynamics and to publish their findings without assessing the bias in sampling or the presence of a phylogenetic or temporal signal as shown by our analysis as of march 2020 the united states and italy the two countries with the highest numbers of confirmed cases did not show sufficiently large or representative sampling this finding is extremely worrisome and raises questions regarding the generalizability of the results of studies investigating the origin of the introduction of sars-cov-2 in italy 812 or of the circulation of sars-cov-2 in the state of washington in early march 2020 9 rushed studies 1013 that are acclaimed by news media despite being criticized in the literature 16-18 and on social media 14 may do more harm than good to recapitulate the importance of examining phylogenetic information in available data before performing phylogenetic inferences that may lead to erroneous or unreliable conclusions we propose the use of a well-established phylogenetic checkpoint pipeline figure s11 in multimedia appendix 3 22 the first step that researchers must take before they complete their phylogenetic studies is determining whether the data set is biased in terms of the number of genomes per given location host source etc in the specific case of sars-cov-2 it would be advisable to calculate the correlations between the confirmed cases and genomes per country if this first step is completed the second step is to build a proper codon-based alignment while ensuring that the alignment is in frame this is extremely important when researchers study selective pressures the third step consists of assessing the presence of a sufficient phylogenetic signal and the absence of nucleotide substitution saturation which decreases the phylogenetic information contained in the sequences 38 the analysis can proceed to the fourth step determining the presence or absence of recombination only if the previous criteria are met recombination can impair the phylogenetic signal 3940 and this is another important checkpoint before inferring a phylogeny in this study we did not test for recombination for the sars-cov-2 data set as absence of recombination in the human lineage has previously been shown 41 however because coronaviruses are prone to recombination events this step should be performed as more sequences become available detecting the presence of a temporal signal is an additional step that must be performed before the inference of a phylogeny scaled in time without a correlation between genetic divergence and time it is not possible to calibrate a molecular clock and therefore to obtain a phylogeny scaled in time regardless of whether the method employed to date the phylogeny is bayesian 35 maximum likelihood 42 or least-squares dating 43 only when all these checkpoints have been considered and given proper weight should subsequent analyses be considered by choosing adequate phylogeny inference methodsthe genomic data set available on gisaid is rapidly growing thus a limitation of our study is that we can only provide a snapshot of the past and this may not reflect the most current situation we have already shown an increase in phylogenetic and temporal signals that may allow researchers to attempt to estimate the origin and spatiotemporal dissemination of sars-cov-2 as long as sampling bias is properly taken into account however it is important to reiterate that during the month of march 2020 we deem that the molecular epidemiology data and studies were not sufficiently solid to provide a scientifically sound analysis of sars-cov-2 spread thus we suggest that any conclusions drawn about existing lineages and the direction of viral spread that were based on the sequence data available up to march 30 2020 should be considered preliminary and hypothesis-generating at best the evolutionary dynamics of sars-cov-2 spread is revealing an unprecedented amount of information which is essential to make policy decisions the whole of humanity is threatened by the current pandemic and policymakers must adjust their mitigation measures while the pandemic itself is developing some of the urgent answers required lie in the timely availability of abundant high-quality genetic data not only from countries experiencing a high number of reported cases but also from countries that appear to be experiencing at least currently a lower number of infectionswe are currently faced with a potential global epidemic of a new coronavirus that has infected thousands of people in china and is spreading rapidly around the world in the end of january 2020 the who has declared it a global emergency who 2020 the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 first isolated in wuhan china has already caused more infections than the previous severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak of 2002 and 2003 the virus is a sars-related coronavirus sarsr-cov and it is genetically associated with sarsr-cov strains that infect bats in china lu et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 it causes severe respiratory illness which the who recently named covid-19 disease it has high fatality rate huang et al 2020 can be transmitted from person to person has infected over 70 000 individuals and has spread to over 30 countries in less than 2 months who 2020this coronavirus outbreak has been unprecedented so too is the way that the scientific community has responded to it they have openly and rapidly shared genomic and clinical data as never seen before allowing research results to be released almost instantaneously this has helped the understanding of the transmission dynamics the development of rapid diagnostic and has informed public health response here we present a new contribution that can speed up this communal effort the genome detective coronavirus typing tool is a free-of-charge web-based bioinformatics pipeline that can accurately and quickly identify assemble and classify coronaviruses genomes the tool also identifies changes at nucleotides coding regions and proteins using a novel dynamic aligner to allow tracking new viral mutations fig 1a reference dataset of previously published coronavirus whole-genome sequences wgs was compiled from the virus pathogen resource vipr database wwwviprbrcorg this dataset consisted of 386 wgs of nine important coronavirus species these included 132 sequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus sarsr-cov 121 sequences of beta coronavirus 97 sequences of middle east respiratory syndrome related coronavirus mersr-cov 19 sequences of human coronavirus hku1 9 sequences of murine hepatitis virus 4 of rousettus bat coronavirus hku9 3 of rat coronavirus and 1 wgs of tylonycteris bat coronavirus hku4 zariabatcoronavirus and longquan rl rat coronavirus to this reference dataset we added 47 whole genomes of the current coronavirus 2019 sars-cov-2 outbreak that originated in wuhan china in december 2019 the sars-cov-2 sequences were downloaded from the gisaid database httpswwwgisaidorg together with annotation of its original location collection date and originating and submitting laboratory the sars-cov-2 data generators are properly acknowledged in the acknowledgements section of this article and detailed information is provided in supplementary table s1the 431 reference wgs were aligned with muscle edgar 2004 the alignment was manually edited until a codon alignment was attained in all coding sequences cds a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree 1000 bootstrap replicates were constructed in phyml guindon and gascuel 2003 lemoine et al 2018 and a bayesian tree using mrbayes ronquist and huelsenbeck 2003 were constructed the trees were visualized in figtree rambaut 2018 we selected 25 reference sequences that represent the diversity of each well-defined phylogenetic cluster with bootstrap support of 100 and posterior probability of 1 we identified five well-supported phylogenetic clusters with more than two sequences of sarsr-cov and used them to set up our automated phylogenetic classification tool cluster 1 included sars strains from the 2002 and 2003 asian outbreaks in our tool we named this cluster sars-cov outbreak 2000s but may rename it as sars-cov-1 if a new proposed naming system for sarsr-cov is adopted in the near future cluster 2 provisionally named as sars related cov includes seven sequences from bats which did not cause large human outbreaks cluster 3 named as bat sars-cov hku3 includes three wgs sampled from rhinolophus sinicus ie chinese rufous horseshoe bats cluster 4 bat sars-cov zxc21zc45 includes two sarsr-cov sampled from rhinolophus sinicus bats in zhoushan china cluster 5 virus named sars-cov-2 by the ictv committee and disease named covid-19 by the who includes three public sequences from the outbreak we identified this cluster with many sequences from gisaid but kept only three ones as these were the first genbank sequences the first whole genome of sars-cov-2 was kindly shared by prof yong-zhen zhang and colleagues in the virologicalorg website detailed information about the phylogenetic reference datasets is available in supplementary table s2the phylogenetic reference dataset was used to create an automated coronavirus typing tool using the genome detective framework fonseca et al 2019 vilsker et al 2019 to determine the accuracy of this tool each of the 431 test wgs was considered for evaluation ie 384 reference sequences from vipr and 47 public sars-cov-2 sequences the sensitivity specificity and accuracy of our method were calculated for both species assignment and phylogenetic clustering of sarsr-cov sensitivity was computed by the formula tptpfn specificity by tntnfp and accuracy by tptntpfpfntn where tp  true positives fp  false positives tn  true negatives and fn  false negativesclassifying query sequences in an automated fashion involves two steps the first step enables virus species assignments and the second which is restricted to sarsr-cov includes phylogenetic analysis the first classification analysis subjects a query sequence to blast and aga analysis aga is a novel alignment method for nucleic acid sequences against annotated genomes from ncbi refseq virus database aga deforche 2017 expands the optimal alignment algorithms of smith and waterman 1981 and gotoh 1982 based on an induction state with additional parameters the result is a more accurate aligner as it takes into account both nucleotide and protein scores and identifies all of the polymorphisms at nucleotide and amino acid levels in the second step a query sequence is aligned against the phylogenetic reference dataset using -add alignment option in the mafft software katoh and standley 2013 in addition a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree is constructed using the hky distance metric with gamma among-site rate variation with 1000 bootstrap replicates using paup swofford 2003 the query sequence is assigned to a particular phylogenetic cluster if it clusters monophyletically with that clade or a subset of it with bootstrap support 70 if the bootstrap support is 70 the genotype is reported to be unassignedthe result of the phylogenetic and mutational analysis performed by aga is available in a detailed report this report contains an interactive phylogenetic tree and genome mapper supplementary fig s1 it also presents the virus species and cluster assignments and a detailed table that provides information about open reading frames orfs cds and proteins this table can be expanded to show nucleotide and amino acid mutations that differentiate a query sequence from their species refseq or from a sequence in the phylogenetic reference dataset all results can be exported to a variety of file formats xml csv excel nexus or fastathe genome detective coronavirus typing tool correctly classified all of the 175 sarsr-cov sequences at species level ie specificity sensitivity and accuracy of 100 furthermore all of the 47 sars-cov-2 wgs that were isolated in china n  36 usa n  5 france n  2 thailand n  2 japan n  1 and taiwan n  1 were correctly classified at phylogenetic cluster level as sars-cov-2 which may be renamed as sars-b in addition we classified with very high specificity sensitivity and accuracy ie 100 all of the 112 sars outbreak wgs of 2002 and 2003 we also achieved perfect classification ie specificity sensitivity and accuracy of 100 for all of beta coronavirus humancoronavirushku1 mers-cov rousettus bat coronavirus hku9 and tylonycterisbatcoronavirushku4 at species level for a detailed overview of assignment performance please refer to the supplementary table s3our tool also allows detailed analysis of coding regions and proteins for each of the coronavirus species for example the analysis of the first released sars-cov-2 sequence the whhuman1china2019dec genbank mn908947 demonstrated at genome level the nucleotide nt identity was 790 to the reference strain of sarsr-cov accession nc0047183 and that the envelop small membrane protein protein e is the most similar protein in total 948 7377 of the amino acids were identical the four amino acid differences were located at positions 55 t55s 56 v56f 69 69deletion and 70 g70r the spike protein protein s which can be associated with virulence was 762 identical to the reference strain of sarsr-cov supplementary table s4a interestingly there were four amino acid insertions at position 237 a237f238inshrsy genome nt position 2220222203inscatagaagttat which is just upstream from a cleavage site there is also a four amino acid insertion prra at the spike protein at positions 681 to 684 this is at the junction of s1 and s2 and creates a new polybase cleavage site our tool also allows us to compare mutations with other-related sequences such as the pangolin bat ratg13 the bat sars-cov and sars sin940 figure 2 and supplementary table s2 the most diverse coding regions were the cds sars8a and sars8b in these two regions only 30 of the amino acids were identical sars8b protein was truncated early and its cds had four stop codons supplementary table s4aour coronavirus typing tool also allows a query sequence to be analyzed against a sequence in the phylogenetic reference dataset for example the whhuman1china2019dec genbank mn908947 the identity was 875 to the bat sequence batslcovzxc21 genbank mg772934 this was one of the bat-cov sequences that were most related to n2019-cov lu et al 2020 the envelop small membrane protein protein e was 100

in fasta format takes approximately 60 swe developed and released the genome detective coronavirus typing tool as a free-of-charge resource in the third week of january 2020 in order to help the rapid characterization of covid-19 infections this tool allows the analysis of whole or partial viral genomes within minutes it accepts assembled genomes in fasta format or raw next-generation sequencing data in fastq format from illumina ion torrent pacbio or oxford nanopore technologies ont can be submitted to the genome detective virus tool vilsker et al 2019 to automatically assemble the consensus genome prior to executing the coronavirus typing tool user effort is minimal and a user can submit multiple fasta sequences at oncethe tool uses a novel and dynamic aligner aga to allow submitted sequences to be queried against reference genomes using both nucleotide and amino acid similarity scores this allows accurate identification of other coronavirus species and the tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally it also performs detailed analysis of the coding regions and proteins moreover it can easily be updated to add new phylogenetic clusters if new outbreaks arise or if the classification nomenclature changes the tool has been able to correctly classify all the recently released sars-cov-2 genomes as well as all the 20022003 sars outbreak sequencesin conclusion the genome detective coronavirus typing tool is a web-based and user-friendly software application that allows the identification and characterization of novel coronavirus genomescoronaviruses covs are members of the subfamily coronavirinae in the family coronaviridae and the order nidovirales they can cause respiratory and intestinal infections in animals and humans 1 and are considered to be highly pathogenic to humans since the outbreak of sars severe acute respiratory syndrome in guangzhou china in 2003 2 another highly pathogenic coronavirus middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov emerged ten years after sars and caused hundreds of fatalities four other types of coronaviruses which can infect humans but only cause mild symptoms are hcov-229e hcov-hku1 hcov-nl63 and hcov-oc43 1 coronaviruses are divided into alpha-coronaviruses and beta-coronaviruses which may infect mammals gamma-coronaviruses and delta-coronaviruses which primarily infect birds among the six human coronaviruses hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 are alpha-coronaviruses while the other four hcovs are beta-coronaviruses the viruses were initially sorted into these genera based on serology but are now taxonomically classified by genomic phylogeny 23in december 2019 a severe respiratory disease was reported in wuhan china and spread in many provinces radiating outwards now it has become a global pandemic which has already caused over 3 million confirmed cases and 235290 deaths in the globe chinese health authorities were the first to report the complete genome of sars-cov-2 in genbank nc045512 and annotated 11 open reading frames orfs 4 the genomic structure of coronavirus sars-cov-2 is shown in figure 1 which is similar to other beta-coronaviruses the 5-terminal two-thirds of the genome encodes replicase polyprotein 1ab pp1ab with a length of 21290 nt and contains 16 predicted non-structural proteins the 3 terminus encodes four structural proteins and other non-structural proteins including spike glycoprotein s orf3a envelope small membrane protein e membrane protein m orf6 orf7a orf7b orf8 nucleocapsid protein n and orf10 in order especially the spike s protein with the receptor-binding domain rbd is the primary determinant of viral tropism and is responsible for host receptor binding and membrane fusion 56 during the sars-cov infection s protein first binds to the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 and the ace2virus complex is then translocated to endosomes where the s protein is cleaved by the endosomal acid proteases cathepsin l to activate its fusion activity 7 therefore sars-cov-2 s protein may be the target of new sars-cov-2 vaccines 7considering the epidemic nature sars-cov-2 in the covid-19 outbreak identifying the intermediate and original host of sars-cov-2 is crucial for preventing new large-scale infection and transmission of viruses coronaviruses can spread with direct or intermediate hosts such as avians bats bovines camels canines civets felines murines and porcines 2 pangolins are recently identified as possible hosts for coronaviruses 8 it is well acknowledged that controlling first-generation infection cases has more significant effects than later person-to-person transmission stage a series of policies such as locking down wuhan had been established by the chinese government with significant effects it is therefore of great importance to identify the correct host and to cut off the transmission from animals to humans as soon as possible bats were suggested as the natural reservoir hosts for sars-cov and most coronaviruses 91011 and subsequently the discovery of sars-related coronaviruses globally supports the connection between bats and coronaviruses among the intermediate hosts masked palm civets were first considered as the host of sars-cov 12 while later research revealed that the coronavirus strains found in civets were transmitted from other animals 13 on the other hand dromedary camels were considered highly related in the case of mers-cov 14genomic phylogenetics provides insights on the evolution and classification of viruses and is especially important for tracking the origin of sars-cov-2 151617 based on alignment approaches current research only associated the sars-cov-2 strains with sars-covs therefore in this study we first apply an alignment-free approach named natural vector to compare 791 complete genomes of human coronaviruses and 95 sars-cov-2 strains collected since the outbreak in wuhan to construct phylogenetic analysis the analysis of protein sequences and structures of the viruses infers the relationship among coronaviruses as well the mutations in genomes can be an indicator of the further change in protein sequences while proteins serve as the functional units to proceed infection on animals or humans thus using both genome and protein information in the study could validate each other and provide us with a comprehensive understanding of the sars-cov-2 strains on the one hand the genomes include all the necessary information that a speciesvirus inherits and selecting a partial region would lead to a loss of information on the other hand proteins perform a variety of functions in almost the whole process of infection therefore in our work the phylogenetic study was based on the genomes data and the identification of host relies on both the results from genomes and proteinsfurther our main study is to infer the intermediate host of sars-cov-2 based on the coronaviruses found in various animal hosts by calculating the distance between sars-cov-2 and coronavirus genomes found in animals we may elucidate the infection chain among animal hosts and finally to humans notably we also utilized the spike proteins data in the coronaviruses of various hoststheoretically it has been proved that the natural vector gives a true distance among dna or protein sequences other similar researches have also utilized the spike protein sequence to identify the host of sars-cov-2 previous studies suggested snakes being hosts depending on condo usages 18 however in a later work 19 this conclusion was refuted by showing that codon usage does not determine the hosts our work here considers each host source as a group and applies the hausdorff distance in mathematics to compare the coronaviruses from different hosts the transmission path we found here was another proof of pangolins as intermediate hosts firstly proposed by 8the phylogeny study of coronavirus was based on the comparison between sars-cov-2 strains and known human coronaviruses the sars-cov-2 strains were downloaded from gisaid httpsplatformgisaidorgepi3frontend on 23 february 2020 which were collected from patients at the early stage of the outbreak in wuhan china 731 known human coronavirus complete genomes were downloaded from ncbi directly which consist of 29 hcov-229e strains 52 hcov-nl63 strains 34 hcov-hku1 strains 153 hcov-oc43 strains 214 sars-covs and 249 mers-covs the genomes from non-human hosts were filtered and excluded all sequences used in this research consisted of only four nucleotides a c g t without ambiguous n resulted from low sequencing accuracy we also selected 38 coronavirus genomes from recent and previous research to construct another phylogenetic tree with the accession numbers listed in the tree as wellthe host identification was also based on these 95 complete sars-cov-2 records from gisaid in addition we downloaded the animal coronaviruses from ncbi genbank our analysis covered the ten common animal hosts avian bat bovine camel canine civet feline porcine and pangolin the coronaviruses in three hosts bat camel and murine can be either alpha or beta types though coronaviruses found in canines were also claimed to contain both alpha and beta types we didnt find the reliable beta coronaviruses genomes from canines on ncbi genbank therefore we considered the covs in three hosts bat camel and murine as different groups giving 13 host sources as shown in the following sections two samples from pangolin were sequenced in guangxi province china in 2017 while the third was sequenced in guangdong province in 2019 these pangolin samples were smuggled into southern china according to a source 8 pangolin is a popular wild animal in the chinese market the covid-19 outbreak in wuhan this time was firstly located at a so-called seafood market but actually it was a live animal market because a variety of animals were for sale in this seafood market for a long time we collected 823 coronaviruses with other animal hosts on ncbi and 3 pangolin-covs from gisaid and compared these 826 records with the 95 sars-cov-2 strainsfor the research based on protein data the corresponding spike protein sequences of these 826 host-covs and 95 sars-cov-2 strains were downloaded from ncbi polyproteins of a coronavirus were processed by viral proteinases to yield mature proteins among them 3cl proteinase performs at least eleven proteolytic cleavages within the polyprotein 1ab pp1ab which was considered to be the drug target 20 the spike protein which is critical for sars-cov-2 infection and differs cov types is responsible for ace2 receptor binding and membrane fusion the spike protein sequence of betacovpangolinguangxip2v2017 was obtained in 8 five protein structures of human coronavirus 3cl proteinase and five structures of spike protein were downloaded from rcsb httpswwwrcsborg all the accession numbers of the datasets are shown in supplementary files s1 s2 and s3many alignment-free methods have been proposed in recent years such as feature frequency profiles ffp 21 fourier-based method 222324 one important alignment-free method named natural vector nv 25 describes a nucleotide sequence by a 12-dimensional numerical vector based on the distribution of nucleotides the natural vector method has been successfully applied in the molecular evolution of bacteria and viruses 262728 given an arbitrary dnarna sequence its natural vector can be calculated instantaneously with little computational cost and the correspondence between the natural vector and the sequence is one-to-one this indicates that the key information hidden in the sequence can be extracted by the natural vector method here the key information refers to the information that can reflect the real evolutionary pattern and therefore the corresponding distances can represent the true phylogenetic relationship so we apply the natural vector approach to study the genetic relationships of coronaviruses on both genome data and protein data for a comprehensive understanding of sars-cov-2 strainslet ss1s2sn be a dna sequence of length n where siacgt let ski be the location of the i-th occurrence of nucleotide k the distribution of a specific nucleotide k within a dna sequence can be described by three quantitiesnk the number of occurrences of nucleotide k within the sequencek the mean distance of nucleotide k from the first position

d2ki1nkskik2nnktherefore the 12-dim natural vector nv of dna sequence can be defined as nancngntacgtd2ad2cd2gd2t by replacing four types of nucleotides to 20 amino acids siarndceqghilkmfpstwyv natural vector can be also applied to protein sequences then each dna or protein sequence is converted to a numerical unit thus using the nv representation we can efficiently perform mathematical analysis on dna sequences and further infer the relationship of the sequences through the corresponding natural vectorsthe biological distance between two sequences can be expressed as the euclidean distance between the two corresponding natural vectors in 12-dim space as applied on many datasets 25 therefore for a dataset of n sequences the relationship is here described as a nn pairwise distance matrix the pairwise distance matrix is a symmetric distance with all positive non-diagonal elements where element ij represents the distance from ith sequence to the jth diagonal elements are all zero because diagonal ii represents the distance from i to itself by defining the distance between two vectors we gave a reliable measurement of the similaritydissimilarity between two dna sequences based on the correspondence between a dna sequence and its nvin the host identification the distance between the coronaviruses from two hosts was measured by mathematical techniques as well here we first applied hausdorff distance to calculate the distance between two groups of coronaviruses with different hosts 29 in mathematics the hausdorff distance named after felix hausdorff 30 measures how far two subsets of a metric space are from each other it turns the set of all non-empty compact subsets of a metric space to form a metric space in its right let x and y be two non-empty subsets and the hausdorff distance dxy is defined as followsdxymaxsupxxinfyydxysupyyinfxxdxythe matlab code of calculating hausdorff distance can be downloaded from mathworks httpswwwmathworkscommatlabcentralfileexchange26738-hausdorff-distance hausdorff distance satisfies the three requirements of a real distance from the mathematical perspectivethe distance between two sets is always non-negative the distance is zero if and only if the two sets are exactly the samethe direction doesnt change the distance value ie dxydyxthe distance satisfies the triangular inequality ie dxydxzdzy for any x y and zanother way to measure the distance between two sets is proposed here named center distance based on convex hulls after the transformation from sequences to vectors in euclidean space let anv1nv2nvn represent a point set of nvs of n protein sequences then the convex hull of a is defined as
cappi1ninvii1ni1i01inbased on the definition above we can know that a convex hull is the smallest convex set containing the given point set for two sets of vectors each set can be depicted by its convex hull and the barycenter of each hull is considered as the representative of the hull therefore the euclidean distance between the two barycenters represents the average distance between two sets as wellit is crucial to define a correct distance when studying the similarity between two groups of sequences we showed above that hausdorff distance is a mathematical distance which can reflect the biological distance among the sequences with different hostsafter obtaining the pairwise distance matrix between sequences phylogenetic analysis was constructed firstly by constructing the evolutionary tree fastme is a distance-based phylogeny reconstruction program that works on distance matrices 31 fastme provides distance algorithms to infer phylogeny based on balanced minimum evolution which is the very principle of neighbor-joining nj algorithm it improves over nj by performing topological moves using fast sophisticated algorithms 323334 we applied bionj an improved version of nj based on a simple model of sequence data 35 to construct the tree and then adjusted the tree using figtree software httpsbeastcommunityfigtree the phylogenetic study visualized the distance matrix results by clustering the similar units together in the evolutionary treewe drew the natural graph of sars-cov-2 strains and coronaviruses groups with different animal hosts as well natural graph was first proposed in 2015 27 for a dataset of n units we first find the neighbor of each unit by searching for the smallest distance from each unit to any other units during this step we usually draw a blue arrow connecting each unit with its neighbor this gives the result of the first-level natural graph which also shows the closest relationships among all units several groups will be formed after this step and then we find the neighbor of each group by the smallest distance between groups the distance between group a and group b is defined as the smallest distance among all distances from any unit in group a to any unit in group b therefore by finding the closest neighbor of all units in several layers in most cases two layers are enough natural graph successfully classifies units into several groups in the first layer and also reveals the relationships between groups in further steps combining the results from phylogenetic study one can easily understand the relationship among units and also among groups of unitsall calculation in this project was performed using matlab r2018b on a computer with intelr core rm u7-5500u cpu 240ghzthe phylogenetic tree based on the sars-cov-2 strains and 731 complete genomes of human coronaviruses hcovs is shown in figure 2 in which different colors represent different virus types we also selected 38 coronavirus genomes of interest to construct the phylogenetic tree in figure 3 both the results in figure 2 and figure 3 show that the sars-cov and mers-cov are under the same branch as the sister clade of this new sars-cov-2 the phylogeny indicates the close relationship between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 the branch of hcov-hku1 hcov-oc43 sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov is for beta-coronavirus while hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 are both alpha-coronavirusesprotein analysis was also applied to these human coronaviruses we downloaded five crystal structures of 3cl proteinase and five crystal structures of spike protein from pdb bank then pairwise root-mean-square deviation rmsd of the structures and pairwise nv-distances of the corresponding protein sequences were calculated the results are shown in table 1 all the rmsd and nv-distance of 3cl proteinase and spike protein between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov are the smallest which concurs with the classification by the complete genomes although current sars-cov-2 is in a distinct clade to sars-cov previous drug study on sars-cov may have helpful implications for antiviral researchthe detailed phylogenetic tree of 95 records of sars-cov-2 strains is shown in figure 4 most of the confirmed cases had been identified in hubei province china and still most of the confirmed cases had been to hubei or related to someone in hubei guangdong province china on the other hand was the location of the outbreak of sars in 2003 and the fact that both provinces have a booming market for wild animals might contribute to the outbreak during this outbreak starting from december 2019 guangdong also has a high number of confirmed cases at the early stage of the pandemic though it is not geographically close to hubei hence we labeled the units in several colors in figure 4 based on the country of each patient from the results in figure 4 some sars-cov-2 strains from the same city or province are clustered together which indicates that the spread of sars-cov-2 was rapid compared to its variation speed therefore the current branches are mainly formed based on the movement of populations rather than the genome mutations this should be emphasized in the further determination of the geographical origin of sars-cov-2 these 95 records were all collected at a relatively early stage and data from afterward patients would reflect the spread of sars-cov-2 rather than the origin of sars-cov-2 strainsvariants within the same country tend to be clustered together in figure 4 such as all samples from japan this can be explained by the limited number of movement of populations between the corresponding country and china especially wuhan because of the long distance and also further policies of travel restrictions however within china mainly because of the tradition of returning home at the chinese spring festival in the first few days when the outbreak happened transportation was even more often than common days patients from the same province might be genetically distant from each other if they have different sources of infection patients possibly became infected during their stay in wuhan but showed no obvious symptoms during the incubation and after returning to home cityprovince had fever or dry cough that further confirmed to be covid-19 in this assumption the distance will mostly rely on their infection source in wuhan rather than the distance between their current locations where they were confirmedour main work is to identify the animal hosts of sars-cov-2 the host identification is of essential importance to the control of virus spread and to prevent another round of emergence outbreak the correct identification of host source or intermediate could lead to the effective policy to isolate humans and hosts therefore eliminating the risk of human exposure to new viruses and limiting further transmission during the sars epidemic in 2003 many patients were found to have had animal exposure especially during the early stage of the outbreak sars-cov and anti-sars-cov antibodies were found in masked palm civets and the animal handlers in a market place but civets are not commonly considered as the origin of sars-cov several independent groups have shown that bats are the most likely natural hosts for sars-cov or found more sarsr-covs in bats from china european african and southeast asian countries 133637383940414243444546474848 other animal origins of human coronaviruses include avian bovine camel canine feline murine porcine and pangolin 2we collected the coronaviruses found in these animal hosts and compared them with sars-cov-2 strains to detect the similarity between the genome sequences bats camels and murines contain both alpha and beta coronaviruses thus they were considered as two different host groups all together there were 13 groups of coronaviruses found in animal hosts and each group was then compared to the sars-cov-2 group which included 95 sars-cov-2 strains the corresponding phylogenetic tree based on hausdorff distance is shown in figure 5 both the hausdorff distance and center distance between sars-cov-2 strains and host-cov groups are shown in table 2 both results show that the beta coronaviruses found in pangolins and civets are closely related to the sars-cov-2 group based on the genome divergences though both civets and camels were considered to be intermediate hosts for other coronaviruses the coronaviruses found in them are more distinct than the pangolin-covs group in table 2based on the genome data only the coronaviruses found in four animal hosts pangolin civet canine and feline show closer relationship to sars-cov-2 than bat does the coronaviruses found in pangolins and civets are beta-coronaviruses while the other two are alpha-coronaviruses thus these four animals are possible intermediate hosts of sars-cov-2 but the analysis of the s protein can lead to more accurate resultsthen we analyzed the spike proteins of sars-cov-2 and known coronaviruses found in these animal hosts receptor-binding domain rbd is located on the s protein and thus s protein is essential for infectivity the protein id of spike protein of sars-cov-2 is yp0097243901 the center distances between the spike protein of sars-cov-2 and the spike protein group of the coronaviruses of each host are shown in table 2 which clearly indicates the significant similarity between sars-cov-2 and pangolin-cov as well this result coincides with the genome analysisthe results agreed with each other and we further constructed the natural graph in figure 6 using the hausdorff distance based on the coronaviruses genomes the blue arrows represent the first-level arrow after the first-level grouping all alpha-coronaviruses are clustered together and the beta coronaviruses form two clusters the green values are the corresponding hausdorff distance between the two groups the arrow from virus a to b means that among all viruses here b has the smallest distance from a the red thick arrows represent the second-level arrow presenting the relationship among clusters that were forms from the first-level natural graph in this case all units are connected together after two levels the natural graph shows that the most likely host is pangolin with the corresponding distance as 33389 assuming that bats are the natural reservoir of coronaviruses pangolin should be the intermediate host of sars-cov-2besides in figure 6 the coronaviruses found on many other hosts such as civets canines and felines have a relatively smaller distance to sars-cov-2 compared with the distance from bat-covs to sars-cov-2 further protein analysis excludes the similarity between sars-cov-2 and coronaviruses found in civets canines and felines according to the last column in table 2 therefore combined with our results based on genomes and proteins the natural graph indicates that the most possible path of transmission should be from bats to pangolins to humans this transmission path is predicted from mathematical analysis rather than biological experiments and the determination of the natural reservoir and any intermediate host of sars-cov-2 requires further study and analysissars-cov-2 has been spreading rapidly by human-to-human transmission and phylogenetic analysis of sars-cov-2 strengthens our understanding of its origin and transmission paths genetic relationship between sars-cov-2 and known coronaviruses provides insights into the host identification and protein analysis reveals the similarity more directly because proteins are the basic functional elements in the transmission and infection process from the phylogenetic analysis performed in this study we confirm that sars-cov-2 is most similar to sars-cov from a range of coronavirus sequences examined but also forms a distinct separate cluster thus sars-cov-2 should be classified as a new member of coronaviruses the seventh cov member that infects humansthe host identification found the most possible transmission chain is from bats to pangolins to humans regarding this chain we should also pay attention to civets because the distance between civet-cov group and sars-cov-2 is also relatively small from genome comparison but a little larger than bat-covs though protein analysis the sequencing results from the current technology sometimes include many ambiguous letters such as n which would lead to inaccurate results in the transformation from dna sequences to a numerical vector though we have filtered out these sequences it also decreases the size of dataset it is possible that laboratories can get more sequences without these ambiguous letters and therefore the distances need to be modified which might bring back civets into our consideration besides although canine-cov is not in the same group with sars-cov-2 on the first level blue arrows shown in figure 6 the distance is within a comparable distance as 89311 feline-covs are listed 4th closest neighbor to sars-cov-2 group closer to canine-cov both canine-cov and feline-cov are alpha coronaviruses and the recombination between alpha and beta coronaviruses are also possible in the evolution of sars-cov-2 if so the close relationship between feline-cov and sars-cov-2 strains might be due to the second possible chain from felines to canines to humans this might be also another missing transmission path but more evidence from biology is required to reach this conclusionin general the limited number of the coronaviruses found in hosts especially for pangolins might be an issue the calculation of natural vector is of high computational efficiency thus once more sequencing experiments are performed and uploaded online by biological labs we can add them into the current dataset and the results would be even more persuasivemeanwhile currently available protein data of sars-cov-2 are mainly the primary sequences which consist of 20 amino acids and if the structure of 11 proteins can be experimentally determined it is possible to use the yau-hausdorff distance to study the relationship between protein structures 49 moreover protein structures could be a powerful tool to detect protein-to-protein interaction and enhance our knowledge about the mechanics of sars-cov-2 therefore making it possible to develop medicines and vaccines for treating sars-cov-2 pathogenssince the outbreak of sars-cov-2 globally more and more researchers have published their phylogenetic analysis using various techniques in 50 the author collected 86 complete or near-complete genomes of sars-cov-2 strains on gisaid and performed pair-wise nucleotide sequence alignment by clustalx2 the analysis revealed 93 mutations over the entire genomes of sars-cov-2 located on either coding or non-coding regions in contrast to our analysis of extracting the key information in the whole genome on the other hand liu et al and anderson et al have done research on the alignment of protein sequences from different sources 1951 and they concluded that other than pangolins snakes and turtles may also act as the potential intermediate hosts transmitting sars-cov-2 to humans the host identification would always be updated based on new findings on experimental data and we are also working on similar projects the most significant difference between this work and other research is that we consider the coronaviruses found in each animal host as a single group and study the relationship between groups using mathematical techniquesthe result in 52 coincided with our results that pangolins are the probable zoonotic origin of sars-cov-2 outbreak despite the similar conclusion their statement of the similarity between pangolin-cov and sars-cov-2 is 9102 is based on alignment in 53 the alignments of the spike surface glycoprotein receptor binding domain revealed four times more variations in the bat coronavirus ratg13 than in pangolin-cov compared with sars-cov-2 suggesting the pangolin as a missing link in the transmission of sars-cov-2 from bats to human our approach provides a well-defined measurement of the distance between two groups of sequences and both genomic and protein data suggested that pangolins are the most likely intermediate host of sars-cov-2 some other research 56 focused on the phylogenetic analysis of spike protein data as well which also provided insight into the study of the interaction with antiviral drugsthe outbreak of atypical pneumonia referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars was first identified in guangdong province china and spread to several countries later drosten et al 2003 ksiazek et al 2003 lee et al 2003 peiris et al 2003 poutanen et al 2003 tsang et al 2003 a novel coronavirus was isolated and found to be the cause of sars although sars has been under control some scattering cases infected by sars-covs were reported no effective drugs are currently available to cure this disease gaining insight into the phylogenetic relationships among coronaviruses would be helpful to discover drugs and develop vaccines against the virusthe sars-coronavirus is a new member of the order nidovirales family coronaviridae and genus coronavirus they consist of a diverse group of large enveloped positive-stranded rna viruses that cause respiratory and enteric diseases in humans and other animals rota et al 2003 excluding sars-covs coronaviruses can be divided into three groups according to serotypes group i and group ii contain mammalian viruses while group ii coronaviruses contain a hemagglutinin esterase gene homologous to that of influenza c virus lai and holmes 2001 group iii contains only avian viruses previous work showed that sars-covs are not closely related to any of the previously characterized coronaviruses and form a distinct group group iv within the genus coronavirus marra et al 2003 rota et al 2003an intuitive method is proposed to infer the phylogenetic relationships of coronaviruses in this article historically cork et al proposed a three-dimensional representation of genomic sequences called the w-curve wu et al 1993 since then the w-curve has been used to analyze genomic sequences and study the phylogeny of bacteria cork 2003 cork et al 2002 cork and toguem 2002 instead of the sequence alignment we adopt a geometric method based on the z-curve of the whole genome the z-curve is a three-dimensional space curve constituting the unique representation of a given dna sequence in the sense that each can be reconstructed given the other zhang and zhang 1991 zhang and zhang 1994 based on the z-curve method a coronavirus-specific gene-finding system zcurvecov has been developed chen et al 2003 and the software is especially suitable for gene recognition in sars-cov genomes the system is further improved by taking the prediction of cleavage sites of viral proteinases in polyproteins into consideration gao et al 2003 here we use the differences between the three-dimensional space curves as the foundation to derive the phylogeny of coronaviruses the key problems are what parameters should be used to describe a curve and how to determine evolutionary distances among organisms based on a group of curves in this paper we use a series of parameters such as the geometric center and the covariance matrix to reflect the center position and the distribution pattern of a curve respectively the result shows that sars-covs form an independent group which is consistent with previous analysesthe 24 complete coronavirus genomes used in this paper were downloaded from genbank of which 12 are sars-covs and 12 are from other groups of coronaviruses the name accession number abbreviation and genome length for the 24 genomes are listed in table 1
 according to the existing taxonomic groups sequences 13 belong to group i and sequences 411 are members of group ii while sequence 12 is the only representative of group iii refer to table 1 for detailsthe z-curve is a three-dimensional curve that constitutes a unique representation of a given dna sequence in the sense that each can be uniquely reconstructed given the other zhang and zhang 1991 zhang and zhang 1994 the resulting curve has a zigzag shape hence the name z-curve the z-curve is briefly presented as follows consider a dna sequence read from the 5 to the 3-end with n bases beginning from the first base inspect the sequence one base at a time in the nth step where n

zobviously the matrix is a real symmetric 3  3 one using a 3  3 matrix to represent a three-dimensional z-curve is a very rough approximation resulting in information loss considerably however the advantage is that this approximation makes it possible to compare genomes with different lengths it is seen that a 3  3 covariance matrix is uniquely derived based on eq 6 for each given genome regardless of its length from a geometrical point of view the distribution pattern can be reduced to a three-dimensional ellipsoid approximately each direction of the main axis of the ellipsoid can be denoted by an eigenvector and its length should be proportional to the square root of its associated eigenvalue the eigenvectors and their associated eigenvalues are defined as follows7ckkckckck1ck2ck3tk123

3 respectively its easy to obtain the eigenvalues and associated normalized eigenvectors using the jacobi algorithm the geometric center and three eigenvectors for each of the 24 genomes are obtained in the same way refer to table 2 for details about the parametersii the distance matrix derived from the above parameters in this paper the euclid distance is used to reflect the diversity between two points8dijxi-xj2yi-yj2zi-zj2ij12mwhere d
ij denotes the distance between the geometric centers of the ith and the jth genomes and m is the total number of all genomes m

m symmetric matrix whose elements are d
ijto reflect the differences between the trends of every two three-dimensional curves the angles between the corresponding eigenvectors of every two genomes are used the three-dimensional vectors are denoted as follows9ckickxickyickziti12mk123where cki is the kth vector of the ith genome each genome has three such eigenvectors according to the projections on the three axes the vectors can be divided into three groups the three groups of vectors are represented with arrows of different styles refer to fig 2
a obviously they can be separated apart depending on their space distribution the dark group x group has the greatest projections on the x-axis while the vectors represented with dot y group and grey z group arrows have the greatest projections on the y-axis and the z-axis respectively for each genome the three vectors can be divided into three groups ie each genome has three vectors belonging to three groups respectivelythe three groups of eigenvectors are obtained and denoted by cxi cyi and czi respectively see table 2 the cosine between any two vectors in a certain group can be computed as follows10cosijkckickjckickjij12mkxyz
repeating this procedure for all the three groups we obtain three real m

the sum of ijk over k for given i j can be used to reflect the trend information of the eigenvectors involved12ijijxijyijzij12m
consequently two sets of parameters are obtained the first reflects the difference of center positions represented by the euclid distance between the geometric centers the second indicates the difference of the trends of the z-curves represented by the related eigenvectors the overall distance d

ij is obtained and used to reflect the evolutionary distance between the species i and j the clustering tree is constructed using the upgma method in phylip package httpevolutiongeneticswashingtoneduphyliphtml the final phylogenetic tree is drawn using the drawgram program in the phylip package the branch lengths are not scaled according to the distances and only the topology of the tree is concernedas mentioned above one of the advantages of the z-curve is its intuitiveness the feature of a genome can be viewed intuitively regardless of how long the genome is therefore global and local compositional features of a genome can be grasped quickly in a perceivable form zhang et al 2003 to give an intuitive comprehension of the difference among the three-dimensional curves we take sars-cov strains tor2 bj01 and bcov as examples tor2 and bj01 are sars-covs and bcov belongs to another group of coronaviruses from the coordinates and the trends in figs 1ac we can see that the z-curves of tor2 and bj01 are almost the same while that of bcov is significantly different from both of them indicating that the former two have close phylogenetic relationship whereas the relationships between the former two and the latter are more distant similarity of related z-curves implies close evolutionary relationship of the organisms involved zhang et al 2003 and vice versa this constitutes the basis of the current algorithmthe z-curve is approximately described by the geometric center and eigenvectors which indicate its center position and the trends respectively fig 1d in fig 1d the three arrows represent the three eigenvectors and the point from which they start is the geometric center the three eigenvectors of a certain genome can be divided into three groups according to their relationships with the axes refer to fig 2 the trends of z-curves carry a part of the information used to construct the phylogenetic tree and some interesting results can be revealed by this figure it can be seen from fig 2b that the vectors in the y group which have the greatest projections on the positive y-axis are coplanar perfectly they are almost in the xy plane as can be seen from the plot the 24 vectors are almost superposed with each other as a single vector the phenomenon can also be seen from the data in table 2 all of the absolute value of cyzii12m are smaller than 00059 that is to say they all have very small projections on the z-axis and are constrained into the xy plane the vectors in the x group and z group represented with black and grey arrows respectively in fig 2b are also coplanar in the xz plane though their coplanarity is not as good as that of the y groupas mentioned above there are three groups of coronaviruses group i includes hcov-229e tgev and pedv and group ii contains bcov bcovl bcovm bcovq mhv mhv2 mhvm mhvp etc all the viruses in these two groups are mammalian viruses group iii contains only avian viruses of which only the genome of ibv has been completely sequenced many researchers have analyzed the phylogenetic relationships among coronavirus genomes based on the 3c-like proteinase polymerase the structural proteins s e m and n respectively marra et al 2003 rota et al 2003 their results indicated that sars-covs are not closely related to any of the previously characterized coronaviruses and form a distinct group group iv within the genus coronavirus marra et al 2003 rota et al 2003 as shown in fig 3
 four groups of coronaviruses can be seen from the phylogram the sars-covs appear to cluster together and form a separate branch which can be distinguished easily from other three groups of coronaviruses ibv belonging to group iii is situated at an independent branch whereas the tgev pedv and hcov-229e which belong to group i tend to cluster together in another branch the group ii coronaviruses including bcov bcovl bcovm bcovq mhv mhv2 mhvm and mhvp tend to cluster together first group i and group ii which are all mammalian viruses cluster together forming a bigger group second this group joins group iii which contains only avian viruses to form a much bigger group finally sars-covs join them and result in the phylogenetic tree shown in fig 3 the resulting monophyletic clusters agree perfectly with the established taxonomic groups to validate the current method a set of random sequences were used as a control we generated 100 random sequences meeting the requirements in the method each time a phylogenetic analysis was done using 25 sequences including one random sequence and the 24 genomes consequently 100 phylogenetic trees were obtained ninety-eight out of the 100 trees showed that the random sequence formed a distinct group without disturbing the other four groups only two of the random sequences disturbed the four groups suggesting that the current method is solid with respect to the situation that a random sequence is addedalmost all of the previous analyses revealed that sars-covs form a distinct group different from the other three groups of coronaviruses however the question that how sars-covs emerged suddenly still remains open rota et al and marra et al performed phylogenetic analysis based on sequence alignments using different genes the results indicated that sars-covs belong to a new group but the original group that sars-covs were derived from could not be determined rota et al 2003 the detection of sars-cov-like viruses in himalayan palm civets and other small animals in live retail market indicates a rout of interspecies transmission although the natural reservoir is unknown virus infection was also detected in humans working at the same market all the animal isolates retain a special 29-nucleotide fragment which is not found in most human isolates guan et al 2003 stavrinides and guttman made phylogenetic analysis on the sars virus replicase surface spike matrix and nucleocapsid proteins the results support a mammalian-like origin for the replicase protein an avian-like origin for the matrix and nucleocapsid proteins and a mammalianavian mosaic origin for the host-determining spike protein they proposed that a recombination event between mammalian-like and avian-like parent viruses within the s gene might have taken place stavrinides and guttman 2004 however the phylogenetic inference based on genome contents tends to locate the recombinant outside of related genomes such as seen in fig 3 therefore we emphasize that it is very unlikely to trace back the evolutionary history such as the recombination event using the method presentedthe present method reflects the global characters of genomes because the whole genome is taken into consideration the phylogenetic tree fig 3 reveals that the sars-covs have undergone an independent evolution path after the divergence from the other coronaviruses as can be seen from fig 3 the distance between the sars-covs and all the others is the greatest we supposed that the precursor of sars-cov may have existed in some hosts and developed separately for many years grigoriev found that the mutational patterns in sars-cov genome were strikingly different from the other coronaviruses in terms of mutation rates grigoriev 2004 phylogenetic analysis based on codon usage pattern suggested that sars-cov was diverged far from all the three known groups of coronavirus gu et al 2004 the overall level of similarity between sars-covs and the other coronaviruses is low rota et al 2003 we suppose that this is due to different evolution paths the isolation of sars-cov-like virus in himalayan palm civets indicates a route of interspecies transmission we hypothesize that some events such as the nucleotide deletion or mutation in some important genes of the precursor may have resulted in the change of host rangedue to the lack of morphological features and frequent gene exchanges it is highly valuable to develop methods of molecular phylogeny for viruses now phylogenetic analysis based on sequence alignments is well developed sequence alignments are always based on some special genes or some conserved fragments saitou 1996 such analysis can be done at both the amino acid level and the nucleotide level to overcome the biases caused by individual genes or genome segments it is valuable to develop methods of molecular phylogenetic analysis based on whole genome sequences being different from the sequence alignment method the current method is a geometric approach which is based on measuring the differences of z-curves of whole genomes including coding and non-coding sequences there is no need to search for similar sequences probably the most remarkable advantages of the present method is its simplicity and intuitivenessthe increasing availability of complete genomes has cast doubt instead of adding details to the phylogenetic tree qi et al 2004 phylogenetic analysis based on sequence alignments is usually done on the most conservative part of a gene these fragments are usually coding sequences especially the sequences coding for catalytic sites or the core of proteins because they tend to be more evolutionarily conserved it was said by a virologist that people could not simply assume that a virus can be represented by its polymerase httpwwwncbinlmnihgovictv a virus must be viewed as a whole non-coding sequences also play an important role in the virus so do the less conserved genes in addition analyses based on different genes may lead to different results consequently by using complete genomes one can avoid choosing which genes to be aligned therefore methods that are based on the whole genome are likely to be more objective recently a k-string composition approach was proposed to analyze prokaryote phylogeny based on the whole proteome and satisfactory results were obtained qi et al 2004 however such analysis must rely on the annotation information in contrast the complete genome sequence is the only input of the current method neither the annotation information nor any adjustable parameters are needed it is noteworthy that the current method is performed automatically without any human interventionthe z-curve which serves as the foundation of the present method is a powerful tool to study the complete genome sequence the z-curve contains all the information that the corresponding dna sequence carries many characteristics of a genome with biological meaning can be observed from the corresponding z-curve such as the replication origins and genomic islands for some bacterial and archaeal genomes zhang et al 2003 we can inspect a genome in an intuitive way regardless of the gene content and gene order even though the sequences are of different lengths if the z-curves of two species show similar pattern even though the genomes have different lengths one may infer that they are evolutionarily close organisms and vice versa in this paper we use the geometric center and the eigenvectors to describe the pattern approximately although this is only a rough approximation it represents just an attempt to apply the z-curve method to the phylogenetic analysis and the results obtained agree well with previous analysesthis method is aimed to analyze the phylogeny of the genomes which have close phylogenetic relationships phylogenetics analysis is based on the differences among the three-dimensional z-curves in this paper the 24 genomes under study all belong to the same genus coronavirus additionally the differences of length among genomes are not very large if the genomes under study have much farther phylogenetic relationships and the differences in length are considerably large the present method may not work consequently cautions must be taken when using the present method to study the phylogeny of organisms with far evolutionary distances in addition unlike the estimation based on comparison of orthologous genes the z-curve approach is also sensitive to genome rearrangements a single large-scale inversion can change the form of z-curve drastically therefore the method presented here is considerably limited in the cases of genome rearrangements in addition as mentioned above the three-dimensional z-curve is approximately depicted by a few parameters such as the geometric center and the associated three eigenvectors consequently information contained in the z-curve is lost considerably in so doing it is reasonable to suppose that the more information is extracted from the z-curve the more accurate result can be gained therefore the current method can be improved if new and more effective algorithms are proposed to extract information contained in the z-curves in summary although the present method has some advantages it is still in its premature stage the method may not be applied to some general cases therefore the applications of it are considerably limited at presenta geometric approach to infer phylogenetic relationships based on the z-curves of complete genomes is proposed in this article phylogenetic analysis of the 24 coronaviruses shows that sars-covs belong to a new cluster named group iv and this result is consistent with those of previous analyses the method has much room to be improved because of the possibility to extract information from the whole genome instead of some individual genes although having some limitations the current whole-genome-based geometric approach represents a new direction to infer phylogenetic relationships of organisms in the post-genome era however the method is still in its premature stage and its applications are considerably limited at presentsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 has emerged in wuhan li et al 2020 spread across continents and eventually resulted in the covid-19 pandemic although there are significant differences between the current and previously known sars-cov genomes the reason behind its pandemic behaviour is still unclear genome sequences around the world were revealed and deposited into public databases such as gisaid shu and mccauley 2017 with those genomic datasets it is possible in fact crucial to reveal the evolutionary events of sars-cov-2 to understand the types of the circulating genomes as well as in which parts of the genome differ across these typesthe sars-cov-2 virus is homologous to sars-cov and its closer versions were characterized in bats and pangolins li et al 2020 the virus has been under a strong purifying selection li et al 2020 with the isolates obtained so far the sequences of sars-cov-2 genomes showed more than 999 percent identity indicating a recent shift to the human species tang et al 2020 yet there are unambiguous evolutionary clusters in the genome pool various studies use snp tang et al 2020 or entropy zhao et al 2020 based methods to identify evolving virus types to reveal genomic regions responsible for transmission and evolution tang et al identified s and l types among 103 sars-cov-2 genomes based on 2 snps at orf1ab and orf8 regions which encode replicasetranscriptase and atf6 respectively tang et al 2020 the entropy-based approach generated informative subtype markers from 17 informative positions to cluster evolving virus genomes zhao et al 2020 another study defined a competitive subtype based on the d614g mutation in the spike protein which facilitates binding to ace2 to receptor on the host cell surface bhattacharyya et al 2020 although whether there is any effect of d614g substitution on the transmissibility is inconclusive van dorp et al 2020 this mutation has been 1 of the landmarks for major groupings of the virus family in this work we used publicly available sars-cov-2 genome datasets we aligned the sequences of more than 15000 whole genomes and built a phylogenetic tree with the maximum likelihood method we clustered the genomes based on their clade distribution in the phylogenetic tree identified their genomic characteristics and linked them with the previous studies we further analysed clusters mutations and transmission patterns of the genomes from turkeythe entire sars-cov-2 genome sequences along with their metadata were retrieved from the gisaid database table s1 shu and mccauley 2017 we retrieved the initial batch of genomes 3228 from gisaid on 02042020 we used augur toolkit to align whole genome sequences using mafft algorithm --reorder --anysymbolnomemsave katoh and standley 2016 the sars-cov2 isolate wuhan-hu-1 genome genbank nc0455122 was used as a reference genome to trim the sequence and remove insertions in the genomes since the initial batch the new sequences in gisaid were periodically added to the preexisting multiple sequence alignment --existing-alignment the final multiple sequence alignment msa contained 15501 genomes that were available on may 1st 2020 in the metadata file some genomes lacked month and day information and contained the year of the sample collection date the genomes with incomplete metadata were filtered out and the filtered msa consisted of 15277 sequences maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was built with iq-tree with the following options -nt auto on a 112-core server -m gtr -fast augur was used to estimate the molecular clock through timetree sagulenko et al 2018 for the sample epi-isl-428718 we additionally built a separate maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree by using iq-tree multicore version 161 with ultra-fast bootstrapping option and 1000 bootstrapsthe subtree consisting of turkey isolates table 1 were retrieved from the master time-resolved tree by removing the rest of the genomes with the pruning method from ete3 toolkit huerta-cepas et al 2016 the tree was visualized in figtree v144 u1d3c and rerooted by selecting epiisl428718 as an outgroup the branch lengths of epi-isl-417413 and epi-isl-428713 samples were shortened for better visualization ggtree yu et al 2017 package in r was used to generate the tree and corresponding clusterswe generated phylo-clusters with treecluster balaban et al 2019 which is specifically designed to group viral genomes the tool supports different clustering options and we used the default option max clade which identifies clusters based on 2 parameters -t and -s these parameters define the threshold that two leaf nodes can be distant from each other and assign a minimum support value that connects the two leaf nodes or clades respectively for this analysis we only used the distance threshold the max clade algorithm requires leaves to form a clade and satisfy the distance threshold the number of clusters that can be generated using a phylogenetic tree depends on the pair wise leaf distance cutoff we manually searched for a meaningful cutoff for the number of phylo-clusters and phylo-subgroups based on their similarity with the previously reported clusters see below we used the -t parameter as 00084 and 000463 for phylo-clusters and phylo-subclusters respectively after retrieving the groupings from treecluster we eliminated clusters containing less than 100 sequences except a subcluster with 99 sequences we categorized those clusters having less than 100 sequences as not clustered as a result we obtained 4 primary clusters and seventeen subclustersls types of the sars-cov-2 genomes were previously defined based on the nucleotides at 8782nd and 28144th positions tang et al 2020  we categorized tc and ct haplotypes s and l type respectively in the cases both these positions correspond to a gap the sequences as well as all other cases were classified as unknown 614 gd clustering was applied based on the amino acid at the 614th position of the spike protein jaimes et al 2020 combinations of the nucleotides at positions 241 1059 3037 8782 11083 14408 14805 17747 17858 18060 23403 25563 26144 28144 28881 28882 28883 determined the subtypes for barcode clustering sequences that belong to the 10 major subtypes with more than 100 sequences which constitute 86 percent of all sequences were labelled with their respective 17 nucleotides zhao et al 2020 all other sequences were categorized as unknown for barcode classification six major clusters morais jnior et al 2020 were assigned by the previously determined 12 positions 3037 8782 11083 14408 17747 17858 18060 23403 28144 28881 28882 28883 the lineages were assigned using the proposed nomenclature by rambaut et al through pangolin covid-19 lineage assigner web server rambaut et al 2020 sequences that cannot be assigned to any group were categorized as unknown for each classification schemewe rooted the maximum-likelihood tree for distance calculations by selecting samples that belong to bats and pangolin as an outgroup namely epi-isl-412976 epi-isl-412977 and epi-isl-412860 we measured the distance from leaf to root for every leaf node that is present in the phylogenetic tree with the ete3 toolkit huerta-cepas et al 2016mutations for each position relative to the reference genome genbank nc0455122 were catalogued in a table with a custom script a table of all the mutations of selected sequences was created and ordered according to the phylogenetic tree of the corresponding genomes table s2 mutations that do not correspond to a nucleotide such as a gap or n were labeled as gap or n the other mutations were marked as nongap for variations that do not correspond to gap or n respective nucleotides in the reference genome were obtained and added to the table the gff file of the reference genome gcf0098588952 was extracted from ncbi genome database open reading frame orf information of each mutation was retrieved from the gff file and added to the table positions that are not in the range of any orf were labelled as noncoding region codon information and position of each mutation in the reference genome were retrieved according to their respective orf start positions and frame in this process reported frameshifts in orf1ab dos ramos et al 2004 kelly and dinman 2020 and the overlap between orf7a 3 and 7b 5 ends were taken into account coding information was used to assign amino acid substitution information to the variations eventually the variants were categorized as nonsynonymous synonymous and noncoding regionsthe maximum-likelihood phylodynamic analysis was performed with treetime sagulenko et al 2018 to estimate likely times of whole-genome sequences of sars-cov-2 by computing confidence intervals of node dates and reconstruct phylogenetic tree into the time-resolved tree the slope of the root-to-tip regression was set to 00008 to avoid inaccurate inferences of substitution rates with this model we eliminated the variation of rapid changes in clock rates by integration along branches standard deviation of the fixed clock rate estimate was set to 00004 the coalescent likelihood was performed with the skyline strimmer and pybus 2001model to optimize branch lengths and dates of ancestral nodes and infer the evolutionary history of population size the marginal maximum likelihood assignment was used to assign internal nodes to their most likely dates clock rates were filtered by removing tips that deviate more than four interquartile ranges from the root-to-tip versus time regression jc69 model was used as general time-reversible gtr substitution models to calculate transition probability matrix actual substitution rate matrix and equilibrium frequencies of given attributes of sequences the distribution of subleading migration states and entropies were recorded for each location through augur trait module sampling bias correction was set to 25 closest child-parent pairs that do not go beyond their given locations were identified and evaluated as transmissions using auspice hadfield et al 2018the first covid-19 case in turkey was reported on march 10th 2020 later than the reported earliest incidents in asian and european countries since then the number of cases increased dramatically we used all the genomes available in the gisaid database as of may 1st 2020 and built a phylogenetic tree after we filtered out the samples with incomplete date or location information the total number of samples we eventually used was 15277 the phylogenetic tree was built with the maximum likelihood method and a time-resolved tree was generated figure 1 to verify the accuracy of the phylogenetic tree as well as to assess the distribution of well-characterized genomic features we mapped several classification schemes on the tree i sl type tang et al 2020 ii d614g type bhattacharyya et al 2020 iii barcodes zhao et al 2020 iv six major clusters morais jnior et al 2020 although the methodologies of the clustering attempts were different between these studies in general the previously established groups were in line with our phylogenetic tree besides the already established clustering methods we classified the clades based on the phylogenetic tree only there are 2 levels of clustering we termed phylo-clusters and phylo-subclusters small clusters were not taken into account see methods the phylogenetic map of the virus genomes clearly shows the 2 major s and l type clades as the ancestral clade s-type is seen as limited in the number of genomes twenty-nine of the 30 isolates in turkey were classified in the l-type groupthe samples from turkey are dispersed throughout the phylogenetic tree figure 1 the 30 samples are classified in 3 out of 4 different phylo-clusters and one remained unclassified the dispersed groups suggested multiple independent introductions to the country seven of the 30 genomes encode aspartic acid d at the 614th position of the spike protein the remaining 23 genomes encode glycine g in the same position the d614g mutation is hypothesized to dominate because it enables smoother transmission of the virus bhattacharyya et al 2020 however this correlation might simply be a founder effect which is basically the loss or gain of genetic information when large population arises from a single individualone of the genomes isolated in turkey epi-isl-428718 clustered together with the early subtypes of the virus this isolate contains t at the position 8782 which is a characteristic of the s-type however it has t at the position 28144 which coincides with the l-type therefore we characterized this sample as neither s- nor l-type in the phylogenetic tree this genome is placed between s and l strains which suggests a transitioning genome from s to l strain figure 2 the number of variant nucleotides between this sample and root is lower relative to other turkey samples phylogenetic placement in the earliest cluster which is closer to the root suggests that the lineage of epi-isl-428718 entered turkey as one of the earliest genomes by the time this sample was isolated in turkey the l-strain had started to spread in europe primarily in italy although the isolation date of this early sample is one week later than the first reported case the existence of an ancestral genome sequence suggests an earlier introduction of sars-cov-2 to turkeyturkey has genome samples from at least 3 of the 4 major clusters by taking the transitioning genome into account samples of turkey are genuinely scattered in the phylogenetic tree based on the groupings applied we analyzed the relative abundances of the clusters in turkey and other countries figure 3a the most samples of turkey belong to cluster 4 iran denmark and france are also enriched in cluster 4 most european countries are enriched in cluster 3 although turkey has cluster 3 genomes the fraction of them is lower compared to european countries with the available genome sequences the overallcluster profile of turkey does not resemble any countrythe divergence of the samples from to tree root was calculated for each subcluster the subclusters observed in turkey were analyzed along with the other countries figure 3b the divergence rates are comparable in general however within the same subclusters 4 and 8 virus genomes collected in turkey have averagely more diverged than their relatives in other countries the isolated genomes assigned to subcluster 4 and 8 show higher divergence rates in turkey compared to the others in the same cluster p-values 000001 and 0006 respectively one-tailed t-test between turkey and the rest we used the turkey isolates 30 to analyze their mutational patterns and their corresponding clusters from the master tree we pruned all the leaves except for the samples of interest we rooted the subtree at the transitioning sample we aligned the assigned clusters and all the mutations relative to the reference genome figure 4 illustrating a correlation between the mutation pattern and the phylogenetic tree clades observation of no recurrence of a mutationshows that the multiple mutations are the results of founder effectsin total 55 unique mutations were detected 2 and 20 of which are noncoding and synonymous respectively thirty-three unique amino acid substitutions were detected table 2 twenty-three out of 30 genomes we analyzed have the 614g mutation the d614g mutation seems to have mutated with the 2 synonymous mutations in orf1ab figure 4 besides 614g 3 more amino acid substitutions were identified in the spike protein table 2 g206a t951i g227s s911f a1420v a3995f in orf1a and v772i t1238i in spike protein v66l in orf5 and s54l in orf8 were found to be specific to some isolates in turkey table 2 the most abundant amino acid substitutions 2330 are p314l orf1b and d614g spike which are dispersed worldwide and not specifically enriched in turkey orf1a v378i and orf9 s194l are found in 7 and 6 of the 30 isolates respectively and show high frequency 15 folds with respect to general in turkeythe mutational landscape represents the natural classifications of major groupings and subclusters these mutational footprints can be used to identify the clusters of the future genomes the combinations of mutations can be used as barcodes to group upcoming virus genomes efficiently without a need for establishing evolutionary associations across lineages which is a computationally expensive procedure considering the accumulating genomic data the number of mutations since december 2019 indicates that the sars-cov-2 genome mutates twice a month on average genome sequencing reveals mutations and enables a better understanding of the epidemiology by revealing the patterns of virus transmission the time-resolved phylogenetic distributions of the genomes collected in turkey suggested multiple independent sources of introduction figure 5a out of the 30 genomes analyzed in this work the earliest introduction seems to have originated from china other international imports include the us australia and europe probably from the uk there is a connection between saudi arabia and the 2 cities in turkey based on the model this association is reciprocal the europe-based introductions are observed with the genomes isolated in stanbul within turkey a transmission hub appears to be ankara figure 5b the isolates in 5 cities are associated with genomes collected in ankara figure 5cwe have published a web application powered by auspice sarscov2adebalilaborglatest we employed the front-end package auspice that nextstrain uses hadfield et al 2018 with increasing number of virus strains not far from now it will be infeasible to display the entire phylogenetic tree even in modern browsers nextstrain handles this problem by grouping the datasets based on the continents as the aim of this platform is to trace the spread of virus genomes associated with turkey we will use representatives in the phylogenetic tree the representative sequences will cover all the subtypes the genomes of the samples collected in turkey and their neighboring sequences will be kept in the tree with this approach the web application will always contain the genome data from turkey and necessary information of the subtypes with the representative sequences an additional dimension we added to the application is that it enables to trace virus across the cities of turkey this approach is applicable to create a comprehensive platform for migration analysis for any country or region of choicethere are 2 most abundant lineages of isolates in turkey subclusters 4 and 8 if the 30 samples unbiasedly represent the overall distribution of the strains in turkey subclusters 4 and 8 might comprise approximately 80 of the genomes in the country the high divergence of the samples in these subclusters in turkey relative to their equivalents in other countries figure 3b possibly suggests either or both of the 2 scenarios i the viruses dominantly circulating in turkey were introduced to the country later than other countries or ii this subcluster has been circulating in turkey at a relatively higher rate than other countries and because of that it is more likely to select the more diverged isolates by random sampling much more genomes should be sequenced and analyzed to gain more insight into virus evolution it is essential to continuously follow up on the upcoming mutations when new samples are added to gisaid database the phylogenetic analysis of the circulating genomes in a country is necessary to identify the specific groups and their unique mutational patterns the success of the covid-19 diagnosis test kits antibody tests and protein-targeting drugs possibly depend on genomic variations for antibody tests if a mutation affects protein recognition the sensitivity of the test might drastically reduce therefore mutation profiles of the isolates abundantly circulating in the country should be taken into account to modify these tests as international travels are limited viral genome profiles of the countries differ from each other which is known as bottleneck effect if international transmissions are kept being restricted distinct cluster profiles might establish therefore each country might need to develop their specific tests targeting the abundant genomes circulating in localwe must note that sample distribution is not in line with the case distribution across turkish cities due to this sampling bias as well as the low number of genomes the spread history is undoubtedly incomplete for instance only 3 of the 30 samples were collected in stanbul which hosts approximately 60 of the covid-19 cases it is highly probable that stanbul will be revealed as the central hub when additional genomes are sequenced moreover there was no sample from zmir 3rd largest city it should also be noted that the lack of a sufficient number of genomes could have resulted in indirect associations between the cities more genomes are needed to complement this study with confidencethe spread of the virus is traced by the personal declarations and travel history of the infected people as sars-cov-2 genomes spread they leave foot prints behind mutations allowing us to trace them it is feasible to complement the conventional approach with genome sequencing in an unbiased way implemented feature of city-based tracing of the virus should be useful for authorities to take necessary measures to prevent spread this approach will be automated with a standard

manuscript writing and revisingthe outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars that emerged in china in 20022003 is one of the most significant public health events leading to a global epidemic in the twenty-first century1 sars caused more than 8000 human cases with 774 deaths1 2 3 sars coronavirus sars-cov is the etiologic agent of sars4 5 6 since then several outbreaks including avian influenza ebola and middle east respiratory syndrome have emerged from animal populations causing considerable disease and mortality7 investigations regarding the direct progenitor and natural reservoirs of sars-covs have demonstrated that bats are the natural reservoir for several viruses that are closely related genetically to sars-cov known as bat sars-like covs8 9 bat sars-like covs are thought to be the precursors of sars-cov however their genomes are not identical to those of sars-cov10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 the main differences between bat sars-like covs and sars-covs are found in the third non-structural protein nsp3 spike protein s open reading frame orf-3 and orf-8 regions which exhibit the lowest nucleotide nt and amino-acid aa identities among different parts of the genome8 10 19 particularly in the receptor-binding domain rbd of s protein which is responsible for human infection via binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 bat sars-like covs share only low sequence identity and contain a 19-aa deletion compared with sars-covs19 20 21 these differences indicate that the known bat sars-like covs are not the immediate progenitors of sars-covs21 22recently two bat sars-like covs rs3367 and lyra11 from chinese horseshoe bats family rhinolophidae were shown to be more closely related to sars-cov than any previously identified bat sars-like cov moreover these covs contain rbds similar to that in the sars-cov s protein for binding to ace2 suggesting that they can cause direct human infection without an intermediate host23 24 however it remains unknown whether bat sars-like covs that are even closer to sars-cov exist identification of the immediate progenitors of sars-covs and their bat hosts will not only shed light on the animal source of sars-covs but might also have implications in the formulation of strategies to prevent the re-emergence of sars-like covs in humanhere we report the genetic and evolutionary characteristics of covs identified from least horseshoe bats collected in yunnan province china in addition the whole-genome sequence of one isolate was obtained genetic antigenic and recombination analyses of the

for the whole genome of f46 primer sequences are available upon request in addition the 5 and 3 ends of f46 were confirmed by 5- and 3-race respectivelythe 405-bp amplicons were aligned with their closest phylogenetic neighbors in the genbank using clustalw v20 software httpwwwclustalorgclustal2 representatives of various species in the genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus and

analyses using the simplot v351 software26 27 28 maximum likelihood trees of genomic regions generated by breakpoints were constructed to investigate the phylogenetic origin of parental regionsthe full genome of f46 and amplicon sequences generated in this study were deposited in genbank under accession numbers ku973686 to ku973692 the accession numbers of other sequences from genbank used in this study are indicated in the tables and figure legendswe collected ten rhinolophus luctus ten r affinis and ten r pusillus at tengchong ten r affinis ten r pusillus and ten myotis daubentonii at mangshi and six fruit bats at wanding a total of 66 urine and fecal specimens from the bats representing various local bat species table 1 were collected using plastic sheeting laid in the bat cages

gene sequences corresponding to nt 15 23415 638 of the genome of bat strain rp32004 dq071615 were aligned with those derived from representatives of the three established cov genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus phylogenetic analysis revealed that seven sequences derived from least horseshoe bats were distributed in different clades of the phylogenetic tree f23 is grouped in one clade of sars-covs and separated from other sars-like covs sl-covs f46 is grouped in one clade with strain rs3367 and rsshc014 which were more closely related to sars-covs than to other sl-covs f21 f22 and f29 are clustered with other sl-covs f41 was grouped with the alphacoronaviruses -covs f24 was located in an independent branch this finding demonstrates great phylogenetic diversity and the viruses were distributed in relatively separated branches figure 1rt-pcr-positive virus isolated from fecal samples was used to inoculate bhk-21 and tb1lu cell lines no obvious viral cytopathic effect was observed after four continuous passagesidentification of virus isolates was accomplished by rna extraction and rt-pcr amplification after three freezethaw cycles in one to four generations of inoculated bhk-21 and tb1lu cells pcr amplification of sample f46 was positive after the first generation of virus propagation in both cell types but negative in the second through fourth generations after inoculation indicating that f46 did not propagate well in generations 24 of successive cell passages pcr amplification of other samples in the first through fourth generations of inoculation showed no positive results suggesting that isolation of potential viruses in these samples failed at the inoculation step in these two cell lines pcr sequence analysis of the first generation revealed identical sequences with that of the original f46 strainf46 rna was extracted from the cell supernatant after one passage in tb1lu cells whole-genome sequencing was performed using the ion torrent pgm next generation sequencer life technologies south san francisco ca usa and 16-fold coverage was generated according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer a total of 754 mb of data with 397 895 reads 168249 bp was obtained the clc genomics workbench was used for sequencing data analysis assembly resulted in 450 contigs with lengths from 192 to 3500 bp following blast and mapping analyses we obtained 145 viral reads 2003217 bp related to covs de novo assembly of these sequence reads generated the complete sequences of f46 and no regions had notably lower coveragethe full length of the f46 genome is 29 699 nt excluding the poly a tail with a gc content of 412 its genome organization and coding potential appear similar to sars-cov sz3 with the exception of orf 4 which is absent from f46 but present in sz3 table 2 the full genome of f46 shared 917 to 918 nt identity with those of sars-covs f46 orfs were compared with human sars-cov tor2 civet sars-cov sz3 and five bat sars-like covs lyra11 rs3367 rf1 cp and rp3 table 2 and the results indicate that f46 is closely related to sars-covsphylogenetic analysis based on the whole genome of f46 and representatives of three established coronavirus genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus including the humancivet and bat sars-like covs demonstrated that f46 clusters with bat sars-like covs figure 2b the location of f46 in the phylogenetic tree is between lyra11 and rs3367 but they are distributed in relatively separate clades f46 likely represents an intermediate between lyra11 and rs3367 in the evolutionary pathway further verification of this finding is presented below in the recombination analysisthe spike s proteins of covs are responsible for receptor-binding and host species adaptation and their genes constitute one of the most variable regions within cov genomes similar to counterparts in other sars-covs or sars-like covs the s gene of f46 exhibited wide variation sharing 763765 aa identity with sars-covs and 765835 aa identity with bat sars-like covs table 2 spike protein is post-translationally cleaved into s1 and s2 subunits the s1 domain of sars-cov s protein mediates virus binding with ace2 the functional receptor for sars-cov on susceptible cells the rbd of s1 mediates receptor binding of the virus to host cells and determines the host spectrum29 30 rbd aa sequence comparisons among f46 humancivet viruses and bat sars-like covs revealed that f46 shares 761 to 765 identity with humancivet sars-covs and 765 to 835 identity with bat sars-like covs the s2 domain of f46 exhibited less diversity between f46 and other bat sars-like covs or sars-covs s2 domain of f46 shares 945 to 950 aa identity with humancivet sars-covs and 937 to 983 aa identity with bat sars-like covs f46 has three aa deletions 432436 aa 457460 aa and 464472 aa compared with humancivet covs and bat sars-like covs lyra11 and rs3367 of the five key aa residues 442 472 479 487 and 491 involved in human ace2 receptor recognition and enhancement of receptor binding three mutations y442s n479s and t487v were observed in f46 compared with sars-covs figures 2a and 331 32covs commonly undergo rna recombination between strains at high frequency to understand the evolutionary origin and identify the recombination events of f46 we conducted a recombination analysis using rdp and available genome sequences of humancivet and bat sars-like covs four breakpoints were detected in the f46 genome with strong p-values 1030 supported by similarity plot and bootscan analyses figures 4b and 4c the breakpoints generated recombination of fragment a covering 18 and 848 nts a total of 8 and 848 nt including the 5-utr and partial orf 1a and fragment b covering 21 684 to 23 271 nt a total of 1587 nt including a partial orf of the spike gene both similarity plots and bootscan analyses revealed that f46 was highly phylogenetically related to sl-cov lyra11 in the first 9000 nt of the genome downstream of the first 9000 nt of the genome f46 shared similar sequence similarity to sars-cov bj01 and sl-cov rs3367 phylogenetic analysis using the major and minor parental regions showed that f46 is grouped in the sl-covs and close to sl-cov lyra11figures 4d and 4e these results indicate that f46 could be a new recombinant virus from sars-like covs or sars-covssars and middle east respiratory syndrome-cov are two novel covs discovered in recent years that cause considerable disease and mortality1 2 5 33 34 the origin of the viruses and the extent of their involvement in both human and animal populations remain hot topics33 34 35 36 37 it is believed that middle east respiratory syndrome-cov like many other covs originated in bats33 34 this hypothesis proved to be true with sars based on several studies35 36 37 38 recent metagenomics studies have identified sequences of closely related sars-like viruses circulating in chinese bat populations that may pose a future threat references in 2005 two independent studies identified sars-like covs from bats20 33 since then additional sars-like covs in various bat species have been reported24 25 among them horseshoe bats rhinolophus are the main reservoir to harbor genetically diverse sars-like covs10 11 13 15 17 19 20 23 24 25 several of these sars-like covs such as rs3367 and lyra1 appear to be most closely related to sars-covs and the gap-filling viruses between bat sars-like covs and human sars-covs23 24 in this study several covs belonging to the groups of sars-like covs and -covs were detected in samples from least horseshoe bats r pusillus samples from other bat species r luctus r affinis m daubentonii and fruit bat were negative for these viruses further confirming that the least horseshoe bat is a prominent natural reservoir or mixer of genetically diverse alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus species and plays a pivotal role in the evolution and dissemination of these virusesalthough we failed to isolate infectious virus from the collected samples we obtained the complete genome sequence of f46 from the tb1lu cell line culture after one passage the s protein rbd of f46 possesses identifying features typical of those belonging to bat sars-like covs namely three deletions and mutations within the key residues required for binding ace2 figures 2a and 331 32 predicting from these features f46 should be incapable of infecting humans directly phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that f46 is placed in one clade with strain rs3367 and rsshc014 which were more closely related to sars-covs than to other sl-covs figure 1 and particularly between lyra11 and rs3367 figure 2 f46 likely represents an intermediate between lyra11 and rs3367 to understand the evolutionary pathway of f46 we conducted recombination analysis using available genome sequences of humancivet and bat sars-like covs a total of four breakpoints were detected in the f46 genome with strong p-values 1030 the results showed that f46 is a recombinant from rs3367 lyra11 and bj01 lineagesin conclusion horseshoe bats carry genetically diverse sars-like covs owing to the high likelihood of recombination among bat covs additional bat sars-like covs are likely to be identified in the future to better predict and prevent the next emergence of disease caused by covs of bat origin it is necessary to maintain long-term surveillance of bat covsthe coronavirus sars-cov-2 previously known as ncov-19 has been associated with the recent epidemic of acute respiratory distress syndrome 2 recent studies have suggested that the virus binds to the ace2 receptor on the surface of the host cell using spike proteins and explored the binary interaction of these two partners 823 in this work we focused our analysis on the interface residues to get insight into four main subjects 1 the architecture of the spike protein interface and whether its evolution in many isolates supports an increase in affinity toward the ace2 receptor 2 how the affinity of sars-cov-2-rbd and sars-cov-rbd toward different ace2 homologous proteins from different species is dictated by a divergent interface sequences 3 a comparison of the interaction hotspots between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 and finally 4 whether any of the studied ace2 variants may show a different binding property compared to the reference allele to tackle these questions we used multi-scale modelling approaches in combination with sequence and phylogenetic analysisfull genome sequences of 10 coronaviruses

rattus norvegicus were also computed and retrievedhuman variants of the ace2 gene were collected from the gnomad database only variants that map to the protein coding region and belonging to the interface of interaction with the rbd of the spike protein were retained for further analysesmafft 7450 was used to align the whole genome sequences and the protein sequences of viral rbds 5 supplementary materials 1 prediction of the n-glycosylation sites was made for all studied ace2 sequences using netnglyc server httpswwwcbsdtudkservicesnetnglyc for the genome comparison we selected the best site model based on lowest bayesian information criterion bic calculated using model selection tool implemented in mega 6 software 16 the general time reversible gtr model was chosen as the best fitting model for nucleotide substitution with discrete gamma distribution g with 5 rate categories for the rbd sequences the best substitution model for maximum likelihood ml calculation was selected using a model selection tool implemented on mega 6 software based on the lowest bic score therefore the wag model 20 using a discrete gamma distribution g with 5 rate categories has been selectedphylogenetic trees were generated using a ml method in mega 6 the consistency of the topology for the rbd sequences was assessed using a bootstrap method with 1000 replicates the resulting phylogenetic tree was edited with itol 9the co-crystal structure of the spike protein of sars-cov complexed to human-civet chimeric receptor ace2 was solved at 3 of resolution pdb code 3scl we used this structure as a template to build the complex of spike protein from different virus isolates with the human ace2 protein uniprot sequence q9byf1 the template sequences of the ligand spike protein and the receptor ace2 were aligned locally with the target sequences using the program water from the emboss package 12 modeller version 922 14 was then used to predict the complex model of each spike protein with the ace2 using a slow refining protocol for each model we generated ten conformers from which we selected the model with the best dope score 15to calculate the binding energy scores we used prodigy server 22 mm-gbsa method implemented in the hawkdock server 19 and foldx5 3 the contribution of each amino acid in protein partners was calculated hawkdock server different 3d structures of human ace2 hace2 each comprising one of the identified variants were modeled using the buildmodel module of foldx5 because it is more adapted to predict the effect of punctual variations of amino acids we used dynamut at this stage of analysis 13we ran a protocol to simulate the spike rbd fluctuation of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov using the standalone program cabs-flex version 0914 7 three replicates of the simulation with different seeds were conducted using a temperature value of 14 dimensionless value related to the physical temperature the protein backbone was kept fully flexible and the number of the monte carlo cycles was set to 100phylogenetic analysis of the different rbd sequences revealed two well supported clades clade 1 includes rm1 isolate bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 these three isolates are closely related to sars-cov-2 as revealed by the phylogenetic tree constructed from the entire genome fig 1
a clade 2 includes sars-cov-2 ratg13 sz16 zs-c wiv16 ma15 and sars-cov-sino1-11 isolates fig 1a sars-cov-2 and ratg13 sequences are the closest to the common ancestor of this clade the exact tree topology is reproduced when we used only the rbd segment corresponding to the interface residues with hace2 this is a linear sequence spanning from residue n481 to n501 in sars-cov-2multiple sequence alignment showed that the interface segment of sars-cov-2 shares higher similarity to sequences from clade 2 fig 1b however we noticed that s494 q498 and p499 are exclusively similar to their equivalent amino acids in sequences from clade 1 sars-cov-2 interface sequence is closely related to ratg13 sequence isolated from rhinolophus affinis batto investigate whether the interface of the spike protein isolate evolves by increasing the affinity toward the ace2 receptor in the final host we predicted the interaction models of the envelope anchored spike protein sp from several clinically relevant coronavirus isolates with hace2 receptor pdb files for the complexes are listed in supplementary materials 1 the construction of the complex applies a comparative-based approach that uses a template structure in which both partners ligand and receptor are closely related to those in the target system respectively in our study we only modeled the interaction of the rbd which was shown to be implicated in the physical interaction with ace2 fig 2
a the lowest sequence identity of the modeled spike proteins as well as those of any of the orthologous ace2 sequences human civet bat pig rat chicken and snake do not fall below 63 toward their respective templates at such values of sequence identities it is expected that the template and the target complexes share the same binding mode 6we calculated the binding energy scores of the rbd from different virus isolates interacting with hace2 fig 2b all three methods used for the calculation are in agreement that rbds from bat-sl-covzc45 bat-sl-covzxc21 and rm1 show the worst energy scores while the binding energy score falls in the boundary limit of the incertitude margin for prodigy calculation section 2 supplementary material 2 the differences in the scores calculated by foldx and mm-gbsa are not therefore we consider that such differences in energies compared to sars-cov-2 are consistent between the three methods except for foldx the affinity is predicted to be more favorable for rbd from sars-cov-2 compared to sars-cov however mm-gbsa only marginally discriminates between the two valuesto investigate the tendency of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov to interact with different orthologous forms of ace2 we analysed the divergence in their respective interacting surfaces we have also mapped the putative glycosylation sites that overlap with the interface with rbd overall the binding energy scores are similar between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov considering the estimation of error for each method variances are more important for the calculations made by foldx and although of different formalism mm-gbsa and prodigy scores are relatively in agreement compared to hace2 only the canidae form shows better energy scores both in prodigy and mm-gbsa for sars-cov-2 moreover we found that putative glycosylation sites overlap significantly with rbd interaction in snake rat and bat forms section 3 supplementary data 2the docking also shows that key residues of rbd sars-cov-2 tend to interact with conserved residues on ace2 fig 3
 supplementary data 2 residues 3653 in hace2 which can explain the similar values of energy scoresmm-gbsa allowed us to assign the contribution of each amino acid in the interface with hace2 in the binding energy score we conducted this analysis using both sequences of the sars-cov-2 wuhan-hu-1 fig 3a and the sino1-11 sars-cov fig 3b isolates residues f486 y489 q493 g496 t500 and n501 of sars-cov-2 rbd forming the hotspots of the interface with hace2 protein were investigated we only consider values 1 or 1 kcalmol to ignore the effect due to the thermal fluctuation all these amino acids form three patches of interaction spread along the linear interface segment fig 3c two from the n and c termini and one central t500 establishes two hydrogen bonds using its side and main chains with y41 and n330 of hace2 n501 forms another hydrogen bond with ace2 residue k353 buried within the interface on the other hand sars-cov rbd interface contains five residues fig 3d l473 y476 y485 t487 and t488 corresponding to the equivalent hotspot residues of rbd from sars-cov-2 f487 y490 g497 t501 and n502 therefore q493 as a hotspot amino acid is specific to sars-cov-2 interface the equivalent residue n480 in sars-cov only shows a non-significant contribution of 018 kcalmolthe similarity matrix analysis was conducted to assess the divergence of the interaction interface of rbds qualitatively ie the specific set of residues implicated in the interaction with ace2 and quantity ie the contribution of each residue in the binding energy score the similarity matrix was calculated from free energy decomposition of interface residues of rbds from sars-cov-2 and sars-cov in complex with ace2 orthologous and reported as a network representation figs 3e fig 1 fig 2 in supplementary materials 2 we noticed the existence of densely interconnected edges involving all the protein-protein complexes for sars-cov-2 and sars-cov except those involving ace2 from sus scrofa and rattus norvegicus complexes involving the rbd of sars-cov-2 show less intrinsic similarity compared to rbd of sars-cov however similarity scores tend to be uniform in the group involving ace2 from human civet dog bat snake and chicken the complex including hace2 does not seem to diverge from the rest of the members of the sars-cov-2 group such as the case of sus scrofa and rattus norvegicussequence analysis and the visual inspection of rbdhace2 complex might reflect the substitution of p499 in sars-cov-2 rbd as a form of adaptation toward a better affinity with the receptor in order to further investigate its role we performed a flexibility analysis using a reference structure sars-cov-2 rbd containing p499 and an in silico mutated form p499t a residue found in sars-cov and most of the clade 2 our results show that the mutation caused a significant decrease in stability for nine residues of the interface corresponding to segment 482491 fig 3f indeed the rmsf variability per amino acid for this sequence increases compared to the reference structurea total of eight variants of hace2 that map to the interaction surface are described in the gnomad database fig 4
a all these variants are rare table 1
 and mostly found in european non-finnish and african populations considering both the enthalpy ddg and the vibrational entropy in our calculation dds we found no significant changes 1 or 1 kcalmol in neither the folding energy of the complex fig 4b nor the interaction energy of the protein-protein partners fig 4csince the covid-2019 outbreak several milestone papers have been published to examine the particularity of sars-cov-2 spike protein and its putative interaction with ace2 as a receptor 21 in the current study we focused our analysis on the interface segments of sars-cov-2 spike rbd interacting with ace2 from different species by estimating interaction energy profileswe have studied the effect of eight variants of ace2 in order to detect polymorphisms that may increase or decrease virulence in the host our results showed that if ace2 is the only route for the infection in humans variants interacting physically with rbd are not likely to disrupt the formation of the complex and would have a marginal effect on the affinity therefore it is unlikely that any form of resistance to the virus related to the ace2 gene exists however this analysis merits to be investigated in depth in different ethnic groups for a better assessment of the contribution of genetic variability in host-pathogen interaction the similar values of binding energy scores with different ace2 orthologues suggest that the ability of binding to different ace2 orthologous is preserved in many species either for sars-cov-2 or sars-cov therefore the transition to the zoonotic form is trivial if that depends only on ace2 as the primary route to the infection in both the intermediate and the final host however we know that such a process is very complex since it requires many protein-protein interactions to acquire the specific capacity of infecting and replicating in the host cells 18 consequently it makes sense to assume that many other types of receptors or co-receptors may be critical to determine the capacity of crossing the species barrier this has been already suggested for sars-cov 1 and similarly sars-cov-2 may show the same feature moreover our results show that the significant overlap of glycosylation sites with the protein-protein interface implies a likely interaction of sars-cov-2 progenitors with receptors other than ace2 finally recent transcriptomic profiling has suggested the possibility of multiple route infections via the interaction of many human receptors for sars-cov-2 11whole-genome phylogenetic analysis of the different isolates included in this study is consistent with previous works that place the wuhan-hu-1 isolate close to bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 isolates 1017 within the betacoronavirus genus the use of rbd sequences however places the virus in a clade that comprises sars-cov related homologs including isolates from bat and civet the clade swapping as seen in fig 1a seems also to occur for ratg13 and rm1 isolated from bat this is expected as the use of different phylogenetic markers may considerably affect the topology of the tree however the significant divergence in the interfaces segments as a key molecular element contributing to the determination of the tree topology has driven our work toward studying their impact on the interaction with hace2 the binding of the spike glycoprotein to ace2 receptor requires a certain level of affinity in the case where the rbd evolves from an ancestral form closer to that of bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 we expected a decrease of the binding energy scores through the evolution process following incremental changes in the rbd in such a scenario we presume that there are other intermediary forms of coronavirus that describe such variation of the binding energy score to reach a level where the pathogen can infect humans with high affinity toward hace2 on the other hand our results show that the binding energy score and the interface sequence of sars-cov-2 rbd are closer to sars-cov related isolates either from human or other species therefore a recombination event involving the spike protein that might have occurred between sars-cov and an ancestral form of the current sars-cov-2 virus might be also possible this will allow for the virus to acquire a minimum set of residues for the interaction with hace2 the recombination in the spike protein gene has been previously suggested by wei et al in their phylogenetic analysis 4 thereafter incremental changes in the binding interface segment will occur in order to reach a better affinity toward the receptor one of these changes may involve p499 residue which substitution to threonine seems to drastically destabilize the interface segment and has a distant effect moreover the decomposition of the interaction energy showed that 5 out of 6 hotspot amino acids in sars-cov-2 have their equivalent in sars-cov including n501 contrary to what wan et al 17 have stated the single mutation n501t does not seem to enhance the affinity rather the residue q493 might be responsible for such higher affinity due to a better satisfaction of the van der waals by the longer polar side chain of asparagine indeed when we made the same analysis while mutating q493 to n493 the favorable contribution decreases from 255 kcalmol to a non significant value of 001 kcalmol thus supporting our claimno major divergence of the interaction interface of sars-cov-2 rbd with hace2 was noticed from the similarity matrix analysis this suggests that the molecular elements required for the binding with the receptor might also be involved in the interaction with other orthologous forms of ace2 and that these elements are not optimized specifically for the human form therefore it is unlikely that the interface of rbd from sars-cov-2 is a result of human intervention via genetic engineering aiming to increase the affinity toward ace2 for example residue e484 contributes unfavorably to the binding energy with 224 kcalmol due to an electrostatic repulsion with e75 from hace2 this residue is an apparent choice for engineering a protein-protein complex with high affinity by substituting e484 with a polar residue it is however noteworthy that the lesser homogeneity of the nodes of sars-cov-2 group in comparison to sars-cov may suggest a higher tolerance for the mutation of the new virus which would allow it to cross the species barrier more easily and to efficiently optimize the interaction in the hostno conflicts of interestfears are mounting worldwide over the cross-border spread of the new coronavirus denoted as sars-cov-2 that originated in wuhan the largest city in central china after its spread to many countries around the world the newly emerging pathogen belongs to the same virus family as the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome and middle east respiratory syndrome coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov respectively the world health organization who has
recently published surveillance recommendations for a possible large epidemic or even pandemic pandemic declared on march 11
th 2020 of the novel coronavirus and it has issued guidelines for hospitals across the world however many questions about sars-cov-2 remain unanswered i what is the origin andor natural reservoir of the virus ii is it easily transmitted from human to human and iii what are the potential diagnostic therapeutic and vaccine targets currently only nucleotide sequences of eight human sars-cov-2 isolates are available without any additional information about biological properties of the virus beyond the morphological confirmation of the virion using electronic microscopy this is likely not enough information to answer the important abovementioned questionsthe informational spectrum method ism a virtual spectroscopy method for analysis of proteins is based on the fundamental electronic properties of amino acids and requires only nucleotide sequence availability to investigate proteins
1 for this reason ism was previously used for analysis of novel viruses for which little or no information were available

5 here the sars-cov-2 was analyzed with ism to identify its possible origin and natural host as well as putative therapeutic and vaccine targetsthe s1 surface protein sequences from the first 8 human sars-cov-2 deposited in the publicly available
gisaid database assessed on january 19 2020 were analyzed by ism the studied sequences were betacovwuhanivdc-hb-042020 betacovwuhanivdc-hb-012019 betacovwuhanivdc-hb-052019 betacovwuhanipbcams-wh-012019 betacovwuhanwiv042019 betacovwuhan-hu-12019 betacovnonthaburi612020 and betacovnonthaburi742020in the phylogenetic analysis different amino acid sequences of other coronaviruses were also included i s1 proteins from the following viruses avp78042 avpvp78031 ay304486 ay559093 jx163927 yn2018b ky417146 used already by other authors in the study of the phylogenetic relationship between sars-cov-2 and nearest bat and sars-like covs

2 according to this approach sequences protein or dna are transformed into signals by assignment of numerical values of each element amino acid or nucleotide these values correspond to electron-ion interaction potential
6 determining electronic properties of amino acidnucleotides which are essential for their intermolecular interactions the signal obtained is then decomposed in a periodical function by the fourier transformation the result is a series of frequencies and their amplitudes the obtained frequencies correspond to the distribution of structural motifs primary structure with defined physico-chemical characteristics responsible for the biological function of the putative protein corresponding to the analyzed sequence when comparing proteins that share same biological or biochemical function the technique allows detection of codefrequency pairs that are specific for their common biological properties the method is insensitive to the location of the motifs and therefore does not require previous alignment of the sequences in addition this is the only method that allows immediate functional analysisthe phylogenetic tree of s1 proteins from coronaviruses was generated with the ism-based phylogenetic algorithm istree previously described in detail elsewhere
7 in the presented analysis we calculated the distance matrix with the amplitude on the frequency f0257 as the distance measure between sequencesin order to compare informational similarity between sars-cov-2 sars-cov mers-cov and bat sars-like cov the cross-spectra cs of s1 proteins from these viruses were calculated
figure 1a shows the cs of sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov these cs contain only one dominant peak corresponding to the frequency f0257
figure 1b displays the cs of s1 proteins from sars-cov-2 and bat sars-like cov amplitudes in these latter cs are significantly lower than in those cs presented in
figure 1a these results show that i s1 proteins from sars-cov-2 sars-cov mers-cov and bat sars-like cov encode common information which is represented with the frequency f0257 and ii s1 proteins from sars-cov-2 are remarkable more informationally similar with s1 from sars-cov and mers-cov than with s1 from bat sars-like cov this suggests that biological properties of sars-cov-2 are apparently more similar to sars-cov and mers-cov than to bat sars-like covto confirm this conclusion the ism-base phylogenetic tree for s1 proteins was calculated 
figure 2 in this calculation the amplitude on the frequency f0257 was used as the distance measure as observed in
figure 2 all analyzed sars-cov-2 s1 amino acid sequences are grouped with sars-cov and mers-cov and separated from bat sars-like cov this indicates that sars-cov-2 are more phylogenetically similar to sars-cov and mers-cov than to bat sars-like cov this result differs from those obtained with the homology-based phylogenetic analysis which showed that sars-cov-2 are closely related to bat sars-like cov 
httpsplatformgisaidorgepi3frontendlightbox1296857287it has been previously shown that the dominant frequency in the informational spectrum of viral envelope proteins corresponds to interaction between the virus and its receptor

8 the ism analysis showed that the frequency component f0257 is present in the cs of s1 sars-cov and its receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2
9 but not in the cs of s1 mers-cov and its main receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4
10 of note is that both receptors ace2 and dpp4 are expressed in airway epithelia presence of f0257 in the informational spectrum of mers-cov 
figure 1 suggests also possible interaction between this virus and the ace2 the dominant peak on the frequency f0257 in the cs of s1 from sars-cov and mers-cov and ace2 supports this possibility 
figure 3 although this has not been formally proved for mers-cov
11as it is shown in
figure 1a the frequency f0257 is also present in the informational spectrum of the sars-cov-2 suggesting that ace2 might be the receptor for this novel coronavirus too this prediction was subsequently confirmed by functional studies in vitro
12 calculation of the cs for s1 protein from the sars-cov-2 and all ace2 sequences available at the uniprot database revealed that the highest amplitudes on the frequency f0257 correspond to ace2 from civet and chicken this result indicates that these species can be included as potential candidates for the natural reservoir of the sars-cov-2 however it is possible that sars-cov-2 viruses use very different receptors in the natural hosts and not only the ace2 as it is the putative case in humans an experimental study performed on chicken however indicated lack of susceptibility of this species to the novel virus
13 civets so far have not been tested but the indicated study confirmed susceptibility of domestic cat to sars-cov-2finally the s1 amino acid sequence from the sars-cov-2 was scanned to look for the domain that gives the highest contribution to the information represented by the frequency f0257 
figure 4a this analysis revealed domain 266330 numbering concerns the maturated protein is essential for interaction of sars-cov-2 with ace2 of note is the striking homology between these domains of s1 proteins from sars-cov-2 and sars-cov but not from mers-cov for which ace2 is not the main receptor 
figure 4bfurther s1 spike proteins from sars-cov 
table 1 and sars-cov-2 
table 2 were compared the cs of s1 proteins from sars-cov 
figure 5a and sars-cov-2 
figure 5b were assessed principal information encoded in s1 proteins from sars-cov and sars-cov-2 is represented with two different frequencies f0222 and f0478 respectively this result indicates some potential differences in the virus-host interaction of these two viruses although they apparently use the same receptor ace2to identify the host proteins involved in the attachment andor internalization of the sars-cov-2 the uniprot database 
httpswwwuniprotorg was screened by ism for human proteins with the dominant peak on the frequency f0478 the list of human proteins that have a dominant peak in is at the frequency f0478 are given in
table 3 according to the is criterion these proteins are potential candidate interactors with the sars-cov-2 s1 protein further literature data mining was performed to identify which proteins presented in
table 3 might be involved in the processes of infection with human coronaviruses this analysis revealed that the actin protein plays an important role in the early entry events during human coronavirus infections
14 actin proteins were selected as the best candidate interactors for the sars-cov-2 among the host proteins that are characterized with frequency f0478
figure 5c shows that cs of actins from different mammalian species 
table 4 contains the dominant peak on f0478 suggesting that actin probably encodes the conserved information important for their biological functionthe data mining of the pubmed database 
wwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed also showed that actin protein plays an important role in the rapid virus cell-to-cell spread and dissemination of infection
15 additionally the actin filament reorganization is a key step in lung inflammation induced by systemic inflammatory responses caused by infectious agents
16 these findings indicate that interaction between actin proteins and the s1 could be involved in the infection and pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 in consequence the possibility to interfere on this interaction might represent a valid hypothesis for development of promising prevention and therapeutic strategiesinterestingly further data mining revealed that ibuprofen fda approved drug with excellent safety record attenuates interleukin-1-induced inflammation as well as actin reorganization
17 actin was also found to be the primary component by which ibuprofen can bind to the tissue in different organs
18 this suggests that ibuprofen might impact the sars-cov-2-induced disease by indirect interaction with actin proteins previously ibuprofen was predicted as a candidate entry inhibitor for ebola virus using the same
in silico approach
19 and this prediction was confirmed experimentally at a later time point
20
21 these results prompt the possibility to experimentally test the effects of ibuprofen on sars-cov-2 infection under
in vitro and
in vivo conditions
in silico methods are considered very important tools to generate first hypotheses and identify first drug candidates against newly discovered agents like in the case of sars-cov-2 especially in the short-term ism a technology based on electronic biology allowed identifying potential importance of human actin proteins for viral infectiondissemination as well as one fda approved drug that may have an indirect antiviral activity within weeks of the initial outbreak however additional experiments are required to confirm our initial findingsin conclusion results of the presented
in silico analysis suggest the following i the newly emerging sars-cov-2 is highly related to sars-cov and to a lesser degree mers-cov and ace2 is a likely receptor of it ii civets and poultry are potential candidates for the natural reservoir of the sars-cov-2 iii human actin proteins possibly participate in attachmentinternalisation of sars-cov-2 iv drugs which interact with actin proteins eg ibuprofen should be investigated as possible therapeutics for treatment of sars-cov-2 infection and v domain 266-330 of s1 protein from the sars-cov-2 represents promising therapeutic andor vaccine target further research on these issues are needed including the development of reverse genetics and animal models to study the biology of sars-cov-2 due to the fast evolving of scientific knowledge on sars-cov-2 the first prediction has been already confirmed while the chicken as potential candidate as intermediate host has not been supported importantly link between ibuprofenactin interactions and viral entry remains an exciting path for future therapeutic investigationssequence data of the viruses were obtained from the

terms of usethe first sars case was reported in late 2002 in chinas guangdong province 1 the disease was contagious and spreaded rapidly resulting in a sars outbreak in hong kong in mid-february 2003 and other outbreaks elsewhere in the world at the end of march 2003 a virus of the coronaviridae family was identified as the causative agent of the disease 2 3 4 this identification has been confirmed by the world health organization and the virus concerned has been designated as the sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov during the sars outbreaks in 2002 and 2003 sars cases were identified in 19 countries and in total 8605 individuals became infected of whom 774 died httpwwwwhointcsrsarscountrytable20030923enin addition to its cost in human lives the sars outbreak also had a great impact on the health care system and economy of hong kong and other infected regions in hong kong the estimated economic loss was about hk46 billion us59 billion ref 5 the possibility that sars-cov transmission can occur between human beings without reinforcement from the animal reservoir 5 and the capability of the virus to infect multiple cell types 6 and animals 7 further increased the epidemiological burden of the sars pandemic although the spread of the virus had seemed to be confined by july 2003 through rigorous quarantine measures httpwwwwhointcsrsarscountrytable20030923en it may still be circulating in the animal reservoir and it is impossible to say that it will not return 8 9 10 because of this possibility better monitoring of sars outbreaks through accurate diagnostic tests and the development of effective anti-viral therapies are urgently required these in turn depend on better molecular knowledge about the sars-cov such research is therefore of vital importance if the community is to be properly prepared for a possible recurrence of the sars pandemicthe etiological entity of a viral infection relies on both molecular and traditional virological methods including serological techniques virus isolation by cell culture and electron microscopy 2 10 both molecular approaches and conventional approaches were employed for the initial characterization of the sars pathogen 2 peiris et al
2 firstly isolated the virus from in vitro tissue culture and subsequently yielded a 646-bp genomic fragment by rt-pcr using degenerate primers which showed more than 50 homology to the rna polymerase gene of bovine coronavirus bcv and murine hepatitis virus mhv the use of gene chip further confirmed the coronavirus as a possible cause of sars 11soon after the identification of the sars-cov laboratories started to investigate the phylogenetic relationship between the virus and the other members of the same family through extensive comparison of their genome sequences in mid-april 2003 the british columbia cancer agency bcca genome science center in canada 12 the center of disease control in the united states 13 and the university of hong kong 14 announced at nearly the same time that the complete genome sequence of the sars-cov had been isolated in the corresponding areas 15 the results of independent sequencing of the sars-cov genome all indicated that it was a polyadenylated genomic rna of 297 kb in length comparative analysis of the genome with other coronaviruses suggested that the virus genome was very similar to previously characterized coronaviruses with the order starting from the n-terminal replicase r spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n gene where there are few accessory genes or motifs spanning between the structural genes and at the 3 utr untranslated region which may not be necessary for viral replication 12 the replicase gene with two open reading frames orf 1a and 1b covering more than two thirds of the genome is predicted to encode only two proteinases 12 13 14 that regulate both the replication of the positive-stranded genomic rna and the subsequent transcription of a nested set of eight subgenomic sg mrnas table 1 ref 16 which is a common transcription strategy adopted by coronavirus members 17 18 19 20 21the 5 utr of the sars-cov genome was characterized by 5 rapid amplification of cdna ends 5 race ref 14 and northern blot assay 13 16 22 these procedures elucidated the leader sequence and the transcription regulatory sequence trs the leader sequence found in the viral sg mrna transcripts is at least 72 nucleotides long through the alignment of the leader sequence at the 5 end of the eight sg mrnas there is a minimal consensus trs namely 5-acgaac-3 which participates in the discontinuous synthesis of sg mrnas as a signaling sequence the degree of sequence variance flanking the trs showed no clear relationship with the abundance of the sg mrnas 22 a highly conserved s2m motif with 32 nucleotides was also identified in the 3 region of the genome which had also been described in avian infectious bronchitis virus aibv ref 12 14the replicase gene of the sars-cov encodes for at least two proteins as a consequence of the proteolytic processing of the large polyprotein orf 1a and 1b ref 16 the translation of segment 1b of such polyprotein is interrupted by the 1 ribosomal frame shifting by a putative slippery sequence and a putative pseudoknot structure 16 two functional domainspapain-like cysteine proteinase pl2pro and 3c-like cysteine proteinase 3clpro were identified experimentally and were responsible for the proteolytic processing of the polyprotein into 16 subunits 16 22 23 a 375-aa sars-cov unique domain was identified upstream of the pl2pro domain which is unparalleled in any other known coronaviruses 16 in addition seven more putative regions encoding rna processing enzymes were identified namely rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp rna helicase hel poly u-specific endoribonuclease xendou 30-to-50 exonuclease exon s-adenosylmethionine-dependent ribose 20-o-methyltransferase 20-o-mt adenosine diphosphate-ribose 100-phosphatase adrp and a cyclic phosphodiesterase cpd ref 16the translation of two polyproteins from orf 1a and 1b starts the genome expression the two proteinases pcl2pro and 3clpro are then coupled with the proteolytic processing of the two polyproteins into 16 units pcl2pro is responsible for the n-proximal cleavage and 3clpro is responsible for the c-proximal cleavage the helicase is then released atpase activity and dna duplex-unwinding activity were demonstrated by purified helicase indicating that the protein has rna polymerase activity 16 24together with the m protein the spike protein is believed to be incorporated into the viral envelope before the mature virion is released 17 initial analysis of the 1255-aa peplomer protein of the virus reveals the possible existence of a signal peptide that would likely be cleaved between residues 13 and 14 12 the whole structure is predicted to contain a receptor-binding unit s1 in the n-terminus 14 25 26 27 and a transmembrane unit s2 in the c-terminus 13 14 25 27 molecular modeling of the s1 and s2 subunits of the spike glycoprotein 26 28 suggested that the former unit is consisted of mainly anti-parallel -sheets with dispersed  and  regions in addition to the three domains identified in the s2 unit the confidence level of the predicted molecular models was strengthened by the good correlation between predicted accessibility and hydropathy profiles and by the correct locations of the no-glycosylation sites and most of the disulfide bridges whether the experimentally determined n-glycosylated sites from purified spike protein treated by tryptic digest together with pngase followed by time-of-flight tof mass spectrometry 29 are correctly located in the proposed model remains to be clarified in the aspect of biological activities receptors for the binding of the sars-cov remain mysterious as comparative genomics did not point out any significant similarity with the s1 domain of other human coronaviruses implying that these viruses are using different receptors for cell entry 12 subsequently angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 was demonstrated to be a functional receptor for the sars-cov in vitro synctia was observed in cell culture expressing ace2 and the sars-cov s1 domain which could be inhibited by anti-ace2 antibody 30 fine mapping on the n-terminal unit of the spike protein indicates that the receptor-binding domain is probably located between the residues 303 and 537 31the sequence of the gene product from orf 3a shows no homology to any known proteins 12 14 signal peptide or a cleaved site is likely to be present in the protein except three predicted transmembrane domains 12 the exact function of the protein is yet to be determined though the c-terminal of the protein may be involved in atp-binding properties 12the envelope protein of the sars-cov is thought to be the component of the virus envelope topology prediction suggested that the e protein is a type ii membrane protein with the c-terminus hydrophilic domain exposed on the virion surface comparative protein sequence analysis suggested the sars-cov e protein resembles the protein connected with mhv 12 32 33the matrix glycoprotein is not likely to be cleaved 12 and contains three putative transmembrane domains 12 13 14 its hydrophilic domain is believed to interact with the nucleocapsid protein and is located inside the virus particle 12 linear epitope mapping of the m protein using synthetic peptides revealed that amino acid residues 2137-2158 interacted with sars patient sera by elisa assay implying the potential capability of the m protein to induce immune response 34 35like orf 3a sequence homology search yielded no significant result for any existing proteins but the existence of a cleavage site between residues 15 and 16 and a transmembrane helix were predicted for orf 7a it is a putative type i membrane protein 12the n gene sequence showed high homology with the nucleocapsid protein of other coronaviruses a putative short lysine-rich nuclear localization signal ktfpptepkkdkkkktdeaq was identified 12 a potential and well-conserved rna interaction domain was also identified at the middle region of the gene in which its basic nature may assist its role 12 14 the n protein was reported to activate the ap-1 signal transduction pathway indicating that the protein may play a role in the regulation of the host cell cycle 36 apart from the possible role in pathogenicity n gene was also believed to be the most abundant antigen in the host during the course of infection making it an excellent candidate for diagnostic purposes the linear epitopes of the protein have been mapped 35 37 38 and the possibility of using these antigenic peptides or recombinant proteins in the diagnosis was discussedthe phylogenetic relationship by the comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the replicase gene and four structural genes s e m n with other coronaviruses was described 12 13 14 the conclusions drawn by the different research groups were similar with the observation that sars-cov itself forms a distinct clusterthe fourth group of coronaviridae a notion supported by the high bootstrap values above 90 as a result it has been concluded that the sars-cov is phylogenetically equidistant from all other known coronaviruses moreover no detectable recombination event was concluded in the similarity plot on the whole genome alignment with other coronaviruses 14 the above findings suggest that the sars-cov is neither a mutant nor a recombinant of existing coronaviruses and that the possibility of such a virus emerging as a product of genetic engineering can be excluded as it is unlikely to generate an infectious coronavirus with 50 of its genome different from the existing coronaviruses 9snijder et al
22 conducted an extensive phylogenetic analysis concerning the replicase gene of the sars-cov by using torovirus as an outgroup these authors criticized the phylogram construction based on different sars-cov proteins as unconvincing and suggested the possibility that the sars-cov can be clustered into an existing group as the structural and other accessory genes can either be gained or lost throughout the evolutionary process and in view of their low level of conservation the author decided to target the replicase gene to perform the phylogenetic analysis for this reason the phylogenetic relationship was reconstructed through a rooted tree the construction of the phylogram was done with the fused replicase gene with manual adjustment and exclusion of poorly conserved region the resulting tree reveals that the gene was mostly related to group 2 coronaviruses and was assigned as a subgroup 2b the author further pointed out that the sars-cov contains homologues of domains that are unique for group 2 coronaviruses in the region of nsp1 and nsp3 pl2pro in addition to the differences in the sequence and arrangements of the 3-located orfs and the lack of antigenic cross-reactivity do not contradict their conclusion as such a phenomenon was also observed in group 1 coronavirusesusing bayesian phylogenic inference approach a recombination break point within the sars-cov rdrp was identified at protein sequence level 39 phylogenetic analysis on the 5 end of the domain indicated that it might originate from the common ancestor of all existing coronaviruses while the same analysis on the 3 end gave another tree topology that suggests a sister relationship with group 3 avian coronaviruses these results suggested that a recombination event occurred between the common ancestor of the sars-cov and that of other coronaviruses or alternatively that the 5 fragment of the sars-cov diverged before the one between or within other known coronaviruses and the 3 fragment diverged more recently 39based on the antigenic cross reactivity and genome characteristics existing coronaviruses are generally classified into three subgroups 40 all coronaviruses share a very similar organization in their functional and structural genes but the arrangement of the so-called non-essential genes is remarkably different among the subgroups group 1 coronaviruses are mainly characterized by the presence of orfs following the n gene group 2 coronaviruses have two additional orfs non-structural protein 2 ns2 and he gene located between orf 1b and the s gene only group 3 species have orfs located between the m and n gene and a conserved stem-loop motif s2m at their 3 utr figure 1 accessory orfs are found between the s and e genes in all of the subgroups however these accessory orfs within the s-e intergenic region do not seem to be homologous between the subgroups though they are conserved within subgroups the rate of evolution of these accessory genes is obviously higher than that of the essential genes which provides an alternative to access the phylogeny of the coronavirus familybased on the confirmed orfs of the sars-cov described above a comparison of all homologous accessory and essential orfs of known coronaviruses with the novel sars-cov is shown in figure 1 from the results it does not seem that the coding regions are a consequence of a newly occurring recombination event between any of the existing known coronaviruses similar to the conclusion made by holmes 9 interestingly the sars-cov genome has a very similar organization to that of group 3 avian coronaviruses ibv and tcv with the presence of three orfs within the m-n intergenic region two orfs spanning between the s and e genes 65 and a stem-loop motif s2m in 3 utr the presence of s2m and the finding that the 3 fragment of sars-cov rdrp clustered into group 3 in the phylogenetic analysis 39 suggest that the avian coronaviruses and the sars-cov might share a common ancestor which gained the s2m from a single rna horizontal transfer event from a non-related virus family as the astroviruses did 39 66 another possibility that a common coronavirus ancestor had once gained the motif but subsequently lost it except the group 3 and sars-cov cannot of course be excluded pairwise sequence homology search among the accessory orfs at the s-e intergenic region of the sars-cov and all other coronaviruses shows no significant sequence homology 12 13 14 but they are homologous within subgroups the orf 5a5b of group 3 coronaviruses and orfs 6-8 of the sars-cov are in a homologous location but they do not have any significant sequence homology the above results imply that although the sars-cov and group 3 coronaviruses have a very similar genome organization they might have acquired these accessory genes from several rna recombination events with different hosts or viral sources it is observed that the accessory orfs are group-specific but are usually truncated to a different extent within a subgroup figure 1 another interesting observation is the genetic diversity at the s-e intergenic region usually two or three group-specific orfs are found within this region of each subgroup but only one confirmed orf orf 3 is found in this region of the sars-cov genome 12 13 14 16 22 the diversity mainly due to truncation and deletion of these s-e intergenic orfs within the subgroups is higher than that of other accessory orfs their sequence divergence implies their common ancestors might have acquired these orfs by rna recombination which is a common phenomenon in large rna viruses 67 68 rather than evolved from mutations of a single ancestral rna sequence segment 9 typical examples are the acquirement of the he gene from influenza c 69 and recombination events with berne virus at the he-ns2 region 52based on the recombination and truncation events occurring within these intergenic regions the phylogenetic relationship between the sars-cov and other group 3 coronaviruses has been reconstructed figure 2 at least four subgroup common ancestors  in figure 2 have acquired their s-e intergenic orfs and other group-specific orfs from several independent rna recombination events moreover there is a tendency of deletions or truncations of these orfs when crossing the species barriers within the subgroups eg orf 4ab in group 2 54 55 56 57 58 orf 3ab and orf 7ab in group 1 41 42 47 48 50 70 71 72 the deletions of these redundant accessory orfs are likely to be the result rather than the cause of crossing the host barriers as coronavirus host range specificity and tropism have been demonstrated at least in four studies 7 73 74 75 as determined by the receptorbinding domain of the spike glycoproteinrecombination within certain types of viruses is a common phenomenon in various virus families 67 particularly for large rna viruses as a means of shedding the deleterious effects of the errors accumulated during its genome replication 68 recombination events within the coronavirus family 70 76 77 or with other non-related virus families 52 66 69 have been reported apparently the diversity of the redundant accessory genes has been accompanied by extensive genome rearrangement by heterogeneous or homogenous rna recombination events providing useful information for the taxonomy of the coronaviruses from this point of view the sars-cov is definitely a new and unique member of the coronavirus family the divergence of these redundant orfs between the sars-cov and other known coronaviruses suggests that the sars-cov might have been circulating in other animal hosts long before its emergence and somehow crossed into a human host several months ago either by a sudden bottleneck mutation event or a rna recombination event with unknown sourcesit has been demonstrated that the sars-cov possesses the ability to infect macaques which display symptoms similar to the clinical signs of sars patients 78 and to replicate in cats and ferrets 79 together with the evidence implied by the phylogenetic studies it is tempting to identify the possible animal reservoir of the coronavirus recent studies of domestic and wild animals in guangdong where the sars epidemic was first reported identified the existence of the sars-cov from several animals found in the livestock market including himalayan palm civets paguma larvata and raccoon dogs nyctereutes procyonoides ref 80 in spite of the failure of another group to identify any sars-cov after the screening of more than 60 animal species 81 the genome sequences of the coronaviruses isolated from these animals are almost identical 998 to that of the sars-cov revealing the extremely close phylogenetic relationship between them another major finding from the sequence analysis highlighted a 29-bp deletion upstream the n gene which was noted only in one guangdong isolate available from the gen-bank gd0l accession number 278489 such deletion leads to the fusion of the two orfs identified in mrna 8 into one orf yet its biological significance remains to be elucidated 8 comparison of the s gene nucleotide sequence of the animal and human sars-cov indicated 11 consistent nucleotide signature mutations that appeared to distinguish them the phylogenetic analysis of the s gene sequence between human and animal sars-cov likely ruled out the possibility that it is a consequence of human to animal transmission implying the infected animals may acquired the virus from a true animal source that has yet to be identified 80 this was also supported by the host-association analysis of coronaviruses based on the nucleocapsid gene 39 which pinpointed that host-shifts had played an important role in the evolution of the virus and the host the occurrence of avian-mammal host-shift supports the hypothesis that the sars-cov emerged from an unknown animal coronavirusthe reverse genetics system a very useful tool in studying function of viral proteins and its mutations was firstly described by masters group 82 for mhv in coronaviridae in less than six months since the first identification of the sars-cov 2 yount et al
83 developed the reverse genetic systems for this coronavirus using the full-length cdna clone of urbani strain by combining six component clones spanning through the entire genome following in vitro transcription and the transfection of the resulting rna transcripts a rescued recombinant virus was found to be capable of replication in the same way as the wild type expected marker mutations introduced were also identified the success of the experiment offers hope for the development of attenuated strains of live vaccine against the sars-cov 9there is considerable scientific interest in the identification of the genetic agents responsible for the unusual susceptibility of the sars-cov in some ethnic groups a molecular survey of the hla system a common method adopted to identify autoimmune disorders and emerging infectious diseases was conducted in taiwan during the sars epidemic 84 using pcr amplification plus sequencespecific oligonucleotide probing pcr-ssop researchers identified the hla genotype of sars patients healthy unrelated taiwanese were used as controls and the hla genotype of sars patients was compared with probable cases and with high-risk uninfected health care workers the results indicated that a higher frequency of hla-b4601 allele was found in severe sars cases which may explain the severity of sars in these patients such genotype as stated in the report is common in southern han chinese singaporeans and vietnamese but not in indigenous taiwanese there was no reported sars case within the latter ethnic group such findings may explain the unusual sars epidemic in south asiaadvances have been made in molecular diagnostic techniques in recent years and such rapid and sensitive methods allow efficient monitoring of infectious viral diseases for sars the first genetic fragment of the virus was generated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction rtpcr ref 2 two rt-pcr protocols were then developed by two who sars network laboratories httpwwwwhointcsrsarsprimersen the sensitivities of the assay were demonstrated to be at least 50 with the highest percentage found in throat swab specimens 85 no false positive was found in these assaysthe first rapid real-time assay was developed based on the most conserved region of the orf1b gene sequence 86 87 a person will be confirmed to be infected by the sars-cov if viral rna is detected by either the two pcr assays two aliquots of specimen or two sets of primers httpwwwcdcgovncidodsarsspecimencollectionsars2htm the second generation of this test protocol can detect the existence of the virus within 10 days after the onset of fever 87 88 89 and provides 80 sensitivity and 100 specificity in the testing of 50 npa samples collected from sars patients within three days after the onset of the disease 87 to further increase the sensitivity one-step real-time rt-pcr has been recently developed 89 specificity of the pcr can be enhanced by coupling it with the use of an additional amplification target using the virus n gene fragment 89 which is theoretically the most abundant subgenomic mrna produced during transcription 13 the technique provides information on viral load during anti-viral treatments in real time so that the efficacy of the therapy can be evaluated 10 however although the pcr assays are powerful their performance is also technically demanding and labor intensive 10the development of microarray technology for viral discovery was firstly described by wang et al in 2002 90 the capability of the rapid high throughout screening of unknown viral pathogen gives it great potential to be used as a diagnostic tool in the identification of the sars-cov wang et al
11 employed the use of an improved microarray platform which comprised conserved 70mers from each of the 1000 viruses to characterize the coronavirus genome four hybridizing oligonucleotides from astroviridae which share the s2m motif and three from coronaviridae sharing conserved orf1ab fragment were firstly recognized in the experiment the sequence recovered from the surface of the microarray further confirmed that it is a member of the coronavirus family the identity of the sars-cov was confirmed within 24 hours and this feat was followed by the partial sequencing of the novel virus a few days later such technique demonstrated a rapid and accurate means of unknown virus characterization through genetic datavirus isolation by cell culture is used extensively as a traditional technique in virology coronavirus presenting in the clinical specimens of sars patients was detected by inoculating the clinical specimens in cell cultures to allow the infection and the subsequent isolation of the virus fetal rhesus kidney frhk-4 ref 2 and vero cells 3 were found to be susceptible to sars-cov infection after the isolation procedure the pathogen was identified as the sars-cov by further tests such as electron microscopy rt-pcr or immunofluorescent viral antigen detection virus isolation is the only means to detect the existence of live virus from the tissue the methodology is generally employed only for a preliminary identification of an unknown pathogen as the procedure requires skillful technicians and is time consuming the requirement of infectious viruses and that the duration of live virus existence varies add on further problems for conducting such assays but they are nevertheless of very high specificitythe n protein is usually chosen as the antigen for anticoronavirus antibody detection assay 91 92 as it is believed to be a predominant antigen of the sars-cov 35 36 it is also the only viral protein recognized by acute and early convalescent sera from patients recovering from sars 29 in addition to the n protein the s protein in the sars-cov was also reported as an antigen eliciting antibodies in human body 29 but at a much lower titer than that of the n protein 35 36the assay based on the presence of sars-cov antibodies is suggested to be valid only for specimens obtained more than three weeks after the onset of fever 88 89 although some patients have detectable sars-cov antibodies within 14 days of the onset of illness nevertheless the negative result ie absence of sars-cov antibodies within the first three weeks cannot conclude that the patient is free of the virus though the elisa method was still defined as a good standard for rapid diagnosis of sars 85 seroconversion from negative to positive or a four-fold rise in antibody titer from acute to convalescent serum indicates recent infection httpwwwwhointcsrsarsdiagnostictestsenthe epidemiology of sars has been extensively investigated since the outbreak of sars in november 2002 in guangdong 1 this traditional method was used to access the epidemiology of sars initially molecular epidemiology can be used to trace the disease transmission by using phylogenetic analysis of viral nucleotide sequence which can quickly identify and aid in monitoring the transmission 93in coronavirus variations in the spike protein can drastically affect viral entry pathogenesis 94 antiviral immune response 29 virulence 95 cellular 6 or even species tropism 7 the s gene has been used as a target for genotyping most coronaviruses like human coronaviruses 96 and ibv 97 study of the n-terminal region of the sars-cov spike protein produced similar conclusions by conventional epidemiology methods 98 the investigation included the collection s1 gene sequences from sars patients in hong kong and guangdong during february-april 2003 mainly by direct sequencing of rt-pcr products derived from clinical specimens and compared it phylogenetically to additional 27 other sequences available from genbank the majority of the hong kong viruses including those from a large outbreak in a high-rise apartment block amoy garden clustered to a single index case that came from guangdong to hong kong in late february figure 3 most of the viruses derived from hong kong patients belong to the same lineage with viruses derived from the hong kong index case outbreaks in canada singapore taiwan and vietnam were also derived from the sars-cov of the same initial virus lineage as judged from the same phylogenetic analysis a number of viruses derived from the early patients were excluded from the major lineage and formed distinct cluster implying multiple introductions of the virus have occurred although these viruses did not caused large-scale outbreaks viral sequences identified in guangdong and beijing are genetically more diverse 1 98 implying that the sars-cov has been circulating there for a while before the introduction to hong kong the hong kong index case that initiated the first super-spreading incident to affect 12 other patients might be simply a matter of chance or the viruses found in that patient were contagious to initiate super-spreading events but these still need further investigations apart from findings that indicate the possible transmission routes transitional isolates that possess both the characteristics of two lineages were also identified ruan et al
99 and tsui et al
100 performed similar analysis based on the comparison of full genome sequences of different sars-cov isolates they independently identified some of the variations as guan et al
98 did chiu et al
101 have recently identified the nucleotide substitution in the s gene that is unique to the taiwan isolates and was linked to the hong kong index case sequence comparison of the amoy garden isolates revealed no significant variations within the s1 gene or across the whole genome implying that other non-viral factors may contribute to the abnormal transmission and clinical presentation of sars in this cluster of high-rise apartments 98 102 in summary the transmission route of the sars-cov in different countries and areas correlates well with the traditional epidemiological findings implying the successful application of molecular epidemiological techniques in tracing the virus transmission historyconcerning viral evolution zeng et al
103 have performed a linear regression analysis and tried to estimate the last appearance of the sars-cov common ancestor with such effort which has been successfully applied in timing of the ancestral sequence of human immunodeficiency virus hiv ref 104 the ancestral sequence is believed to have appeared last in late 2002 these preliminary findings provide important information for tracing the origin of the sars-cov and monitoring its spreadcurrent knowledge on coronavirus immunity has mainly been acquired from research on animal coronaviruses clinical observations have shown that humoral and cell-mediated immune responses may be both necessary against sars-cov infection 105 it was reported that t cell cd3 cd4 and cd8 depletion was observed in early infection but that levels returned to normal as the disease was improved 106 igg antibody could be detected at the 7th day after the onset of symptoms and kept at high titer at least three months 107 another report indicated that the virus was still detectable in respiratory and stool specimens by rt-pcr diagnosis but could not be cultured more than 40 days after presentation 108 implying that the antibody could be stimulated rapidly and might restrict the virus infection however it has also been reported in fowl and feline coronaviral diseases that low-level antibody may exacerbate diseases 109 it is therefore important to conduct further investigations into the immune response to sars patients in the future so as to benefit the vaccine development and disease controlconcerning the candidate target for vaccine development the s1 unit of the spike proteins has been identified as the host protective antigen and used as a vaccine candidate in other coronaviruses 110 an extensive structural analysis of the corresponding protein in sars is thus desirable with the identification of the sars-cov functional receptor 30 and the mapping of the receptor-binding domain on the spike protein 31 subunit vaccine targeting the receptorbinding domain and the preparation of killed or attenuated vaccine using ace2 expression cell line may be promising 30antiviral drugs represent an alternative anti-sars strategy to vaccination inhibiting chemicals targeting the sars-cov replication-related proteins were considered as anti-sars-cov drug candidates eg inhibition the enzymatic activity of 3clpro an extensive structural analysis of 3clpro encoded from nsp5 on orf 1a was performed 28 111 the 3clpro structure showed a considerable degree of conservation of the substrate-binding sites with the evidence that it could retain its proteolytic activity upon tgev transmissible gastroenteritis virus main proteinase 111 though another group mentioned that the inactive property of the enzyme might exist in vitro
112 from this result these authors suggested that the use of rhinovirus 3cpro inhibitor might be useful in anti-sars therapy two months later a research group from the us conducted a study on the interaction of two chemicals kz7088 and the avlqsgfr octapeptide with 3clpro
113 further highlighting the importance of the main proteinase as a target for anti-viral drug design fan et al
114 provided valuable additional information and concluded that only the dimeric form of the 3clpro is active and that the proteinase-substrate interaction can be speeded up if more beta-sheet-like structure is involved in the substrate recently the crystal structure of 3clpro was reported by yang et al
115 the 3clpro crystal underwent conformational changes under different ph conditions while complexing with the specific inhibitor at the same time a serine-protease fold with a cys-his at the active site was recognized on the other hand the modeling of the structure of 20-o-mt domain located at nsp16 was proposed by von grotthuss et al
116 using the 3d jury system with high reliability 3d jury score 100 the conservation of the unique tetrad residues k-d-k-e of the domain assigned a proposed mrna cap methylation function of this domain suggesting an alternative target for anti-viral drug design in addition to main proteases blocking the virus entry should be considered as well structural analysis of the s2 domain of the sars-cov s protein which plays a role in fusion of the virus with host cell revealed a conservation of sequence motifs with the wellstudied gp41 protein of hiv-1 and other viruses with class i transmembrane domain 27 such a structure may be another target for drug designthe collaborative efforts of the global scientific community have provided invaluable insights into the molecular biology of the sars-cov the development of a rapid and accurate method of diagnosis based on the molecular findings has helped to identify sars patients at an early stage of the disease thereby providing valuable information for national authorities to monitor the spread of the disease and take effective quarantine measures and contributing to the understanding of the clinical presentations of the syndrome the elucidation of the molecular biology of the sars-cov has provided a foundation for vaccine design and narrowed down the targets for large-scale high throughput drug screening program for anti-viral therapy these advances helped the global community to contain the spread of sars within four months since its first identification however much remains to be discovered about this novel coronavirus and it may yet pose a serious threat unlike other recently identified viral diseases like ebola and west nile virus it seems the transmission of sars-cov does not need a visible vector for spreading and that a tiny invisible respiratory droplet is sufficient to infect another person 117 the nearly undetectable symptom presented by the recently confirmed sars case in singapore suggests that the virus may continue to circulate undetectably 65 the possibility that common domestic animals are also a virus reservoir for sars further complicates the struggle to contain and ultimately eradicate this disease in these aspects sensitive accurate and rapid diagnosis plays an extremely important role in limiting the disease spread especially in the developing world and densely populated countries luckily the aggressive quarantine measures imposed by the who proved to be effective in containing the outbreak and the experience gained in the last sars outbreak has prepared us to face another outbreak with some confidence nevertheless nobody can predict exactly when an effective vaccine or anti-viral drug will be developed all that can be said is that based on our growing knowledge of the molecular epidemiology and evolution of the virus the successful development of countermeasures to sars is very possiblecoronaviruses are zoonotic pathogens that are well known to evolve environmentally and infect many mammalian and avian species 1 these diverse viruses often have effective transmission and immune evasion strategies especially when outbreaks occur within dense human populations in the past two decades coronavirus outbreaks have arisen in human populations around the world each with unique features but also sharing several similarities severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov emerged in 2002 in guangdong province china causing an outbreak that spread to 26 countries with more than 8000 infections and 774 deaths and a case fatality rate of 95 2 more recently the ongoing middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov outbreak that originated in 2012 in saudi arabia has spread to 27 countries with 2494 infections and 858 deaths with a case fatality rate of 344 3 the recent surfacing of the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 first identified on december 12th 2019 was initially detected in wuhan hubei province china and has now spread globally via travelers and breached the boundaries of 182 countriesregions 45 on march 11th 2020 the world health organization officially declared a global pandemic the rapidly evolving situation has prompted most affected countries to impose tight restrictions on border movements and unprecedented statewide lockdown measures at the time of writing april 06th 2020 over 12 million cases and approximately 70000 fatalities have been reported globally 5 similar to sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 infections in the early stages of the outbreak were observed in family clusters and hospital personnel 46 7 8 the outbreak occurring during the winter is another commonality between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 9 currently sustained community-based spread is occurring which would make sars-cov-2 a community-acquired respiratory coronavirus along with the other less pathogenic human community-acquired respiratory coronaviruses 229e oc43 hku-1 and nl63 10clinical signs associated with sars-cov-2 include pneumonia fever dry cough headache and dyspnea which may progress to respiratory failure and death 7911 the incubation period for sars-cov-2 seems to be longer than for sars-cov and mers-cov which have a mean incubation time of 5 to 7 days leading to challenges in contact tracing 12 preexisting conditions and comorbidities such as hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disease or kidney disease affect the severity of pathogenesis attributed to sars-cov and mers-cov and thus far similar patterns seem to exist with sars-cov-2 711 sars-cov and mers-cov seem to exhibit deleterious morbidity and mortality on the elderly population  60 years of age with most deaths occurring in this age group and sars-cov-2 is currently portraying a comparable trend 7the coronaviruses belong to the coronaviridae family and the orthocoronaviridae subfamily which is divided in four genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 are all betacoronaviruses a genus that includes many viruses that infect humans bats and other domesticated and wild animals 13 betacoronaviruses have many similarities within the orf1ab polyprotein and most structural proteins however the spike protein and accessory proteins portray significant diversity 14 mers-cov has maintained a stable genome since its emergence in 2012 unlike other coronaviruses that readily evolve and can undergo notable recombination events 15alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses including sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 and other human coronaviruses like hcov-nl63 are thought to have originated in bats 14 15 16 gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses are reported to have an avian origin but are known to infect both mammals and avian species 17 human infections of bat-origin viruses typically occur through intermediate hosts for sars-cov these hosts are palm civets paguma larvata and racoon dogs nyctereutes procyonoides for mers-cov the known host is the dromedary camel camelus dromedarius 1418 sars-cov antibodies were first detected in palm civets and the animal handlers in wet markets 14 mers-cov is thought to have been circulating for at least 30 years within the dromedary camel population based on retrospective antibody testing of serum from 1983 14 the source of the sars-cov-2 outbreak has been linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market in wuhan where it was initially confirmed that the majority of cases with onset prior to january 1st 2020 were linked to the market 19 the market sells many species including seafood birds snakes marmots and bats 7 the market was closed on january 1st 2020 and sampling and decontamination have occurred in order to find the source of the infection origination of sars-cov-2 from bats has been strongly supported but the presumed intermediate host remains to be identified recent reports have suggested the malayan pangolins manis javanica as a possible intermediate host for sars-cov-2 with putative recombination signals found between pangolin bat and human coronavirus sequences 7920 21 22 however the direct precursor sequence to the currently circulating human sars-cov-2 and putative intermediate host remain to be identifiedthe coronavirus spike protein s is the primary determinant of viral tropism and is responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion it is a large approx 180 kda glycoprotein that is present on the viral surface as a prominent trimer and it is composed of two domains s1 and s2 23 the s1 domain mediates receptor binding and is divided into two sub-domains with the n-terminal subdomain ntd often binding sialic acid and the c-terminal subdomain also known as c-domain binding a specific proteinaceous receptor 24 the receptor for sars-cov has been identified as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 similar to what has been recently identified with sars-cov-2 91425 hela cells transfected to express or not the ace2 receptor from either human chinese horseshoe bat mouse civet and pig were infected with sars-cov-2 and it was reported that the virus was able to use all receptors except mouse ace2 9 sars-cov-2 was not found to use dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 the receptor for mers-cov 91425 following receptor binding the s2 domain mediates viralmembrane fusion through the exposure of a highly conserved fusion peptide 2627 the fusion peptide is activated through proteolytic cleavage at a site found immediately upstream s2 which is common to all coronaviruses in many but not all coronaviruses additional proteolytic priming occurs at a second site located at the interface of the s1 and s2 domains s1s2 28 the use of proteases in priming and activation combined with receptor binding and ionic interactions eg h and ca2 together control viral stability and transmission and modulate the conformational changes in the s protein that dictate the viral entry process into host cells 232629 specifically sars-cov and mers-cov both infect type ii pneumocytes in vivo however they individually infect ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and non-ciliated bronchial epithelial cells respectively 14 sars-cov-2 can infect ex vivo with the same range of cell culture lines as sars-cov and mers-cov eg vero e6 huh-7 cells though primary human airway epithelial cells have been reported to be its preferential cell type 152530 overall how cell tropism of sars-cov-2 reflects a balance of receptor binding endosomal environment and protease activation and the specifics of these mechanisms remain to be determinedthe rapid dissemination and sharing of information during the sars-cov-2 pandemic has surpassed that of both mers-cov and sars-cov where the latter virus was only identified after several months and with a genome available a month later 7 the sars-cov-2 was identified and a genome sequence was available within a month from the initial surfacing of the agent in patients 7 initial reports identified that sars-cov-2 contains six major open-reading frames in the viral genome and various accessory proteins 9 the sars-like sl virus batcov-ratg13 also named bat-sl-ratg13 was observed to have a remarkably high degree of genomic sequence identity with that of sars-cov-2 at over 96 overall sequence identity and with two other bat sars-like viruses bat-sl-cov-zc45 and bat-sl-cov-zxc21 both having around 88 sequence identity compared with sars-cov-2 on a genome-wide level 9 when sars-cov-2 is compared to the clinically relevant human coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov pairwise percent identities fall to around 796 and 50 on a genomic level respectively 49 the s protein of sars-cov-2 was found to be approximately 75 homologous to the sars-cov spike 79in this study we perform phylogenetic bioinformatic and homology structural modeling analyses of sars-cov-2 s in comparison with closely related viruses we identify a distinct four residue insert featuring two arginine residues that maps to the s1s2 priming loop of sars-cov-2 which is missing from all other sars-cov-related viruses but present in mers-cov s and in many other coronaviruses we discuss the importance of this extended basic loop for s protein-mediated membrane fusion and its implications for virus transmissionto obtain an initial assessment of shared andor specific features of the sars-cov-2 spike s envelope glycoprotein a protein sequence alignment was performed to compare the sequence of the wuhan-hu-1 strain of the novel coronavirus with that of the closely related human sars-cov s strain tor2 sequence supplementary figure 1 the overall percent protein sequence identity found by the alignment was 76 figure 1a a breakdown of the functional domains of the s protein based on the sars-cov s sequence reveals that the s1 receptor-binding domain was less conserved 64 identity than the s2 fusion domain 90 identity within s1 the ntd was found to be less conserved 51 identity compared to the receptor binding domain rbd 74 identity which is part of the c-terminal subdomain figure 1a the relatively high degree of sequence identity for the rbd is consistent with the view that sars-cov-2 like sars-cov may use ace2 as its host cell receptor 92531 interestingly when the more defined receptor binding motif rbm was analyzed ie the region of sars-cov s containing residues that were shown to directly contact the ace2 receptor the identity between the two sequences drops to 50 figure 1a in this case hinting at possible differences in binding residues involved in the interaction with the receptor andor binding affinities 31 32 33 as expected within the well-conserved s2 domain subdomain identities were high for the fusion peptide region fp 93 identity high for the heptad-repeat 1 region hr1 88 identity identical for hr2 100 identity and high for both the transmembrane and the c-terminal endodomain tm 93 identity e 97 identity figure 1aearly phylogenetic studies on sars-cov-2 genomic sequences revealed that it clustered closely with sequences originating from sars-like sequences from bats within lineage b of the betacoronavirus genus lineage a groups prototypical coronaviruses such as murine hepatitis virus mhv and human coronaviruses hcov-hku1 and hcov-oc43 the other highly pathogenic coronavirus mers-cov is found within lineage c along with related camel-derived mers-cov lineage c also groups viruses from bats and other mammals such as hedgehogs lineage d contains viral species infecting bats to gain a better understanding of both shared and specific features of sars-cov-2 s protein a phylogenetic analysis centered on s protein sequences of representatives of the four betacoronavirus lineages was carried out figure 1b fifteen sequences of sars-cov-2 s sequences obtained from ncbi and gisaid from china and various export locations worldwide were analyzed along with representative members of lineages ad betacoronaviruses the analysis confirmed that all sars-cov-2 s sequences clustered very closely with bat sars-like sequences with the closest matching sequence corresponding to a bat coronavirus bat-cov strain named bat-sl-ratg13 other closely related sequences found were from bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 the sub-clade that groups sars-cov-2 bat-sl-ratg13 bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 is distinct from the one grouping human and civet sars-cov along with other related bat sars-like viruses such as bat-sl-lyra3while bat coronaviruses are the established reservoir for sars-cov-2 the presumed intermediate host remains to be determined based on the high degree of sequence identity in the rbd of sequences found in malayan pangolins m javanica it was proposed that these mammals could be intermediate hosts 20 21 22 subsequent whole-genome analysis revealed 85592 identity to sars-cov-2 which is less than what is observed for bat-sl-ratg13 963 34 to explore the relationship of pangolin covs to sars-cov-2 we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the spike gene of pangolin covs isolated from animals smuggled into china in 2017 guangxi province gx and 2019 guangdong province gd compared to sars-cov-2 batcov-ratg13 and other betacoronaviruses figure 2
 pairwise comparison between sars-cov-2 s protein and that of batcov-ratg13 and representative sequences from guangxi pangolin 2017 abbreviated gx here and guangdong pangolin 2019 abbreviated gd confirm that overall batcov-ratg13 had the highest identity 97 overall 96 and 100 for s1 and s2 respectively figure 2a the analysis reveals that pangolin s protein sequences are more divergent overall 92 identity for gx and 89 identity for gd with most of the divergence concentrating in the s1 domain notably while the ntd domain of both gx and gd pangolin sequences fell to 88 and 67 identity respectively the rbd domain of the gd domain was confirmed to be remarkably well conserved compared to sars-cov-2 97 identity compared to 87 identity for gx pangolin and 89 for batcov-ratg13 these observations are in line with previously reported putative recombination events occurring between pangolin bat and human betacoronavirus sequences 22 phylogenetically pangolin spike sequences from 2017 gx form a subclade that groups with ratg13 figure 2b interestingly the 2019 pangolin gd sequence appears to branch off early ie it could represent an s protein sequence that diverged earlier and forms its own subclade distinct from the ratg132017pangolin and sars-cov-2environmental subcladesan s protein sequence alignment focusing on the rbd region of sars-cov-2 sars-cov and bat-sars-related viruses reveals that the n-terminal half of the rbd is relatively well conserved whereas the c-terminal half which contains the rbm exhibits more variation figure 3a notably bat-sl-cov-zc45 and bat-sl-cov-zxc21 both have two deletions of 5 and 14 residues within the rbd the composition of residues found at the two known coronavirus s cleavage sites was performed using alignment data figure 3b and c the region around arginine 667 r667 of sars-cov s the s1s2 cleavage site aligned well with sars-cov-2 and the bat sars-related sequences 56 notably an arginine at the position corresponding to sars-cov r667 is conserved for the other five sequences analyzed the alignment shows that sars-cov-2 contains a four amino acid insertion 681prra684 that is not found in any other sequences analyzed including the closely related bat-sl-ratg13 figure 3b together with the conserved r685 amino acid found in sars-cov-2 at the putative s1s2 cleavage site the insertion introduces a stretch of three basic arginine residues that could potentially be recognized by members of the pro-protein convertase family of proteases 3536 this insertion was conserved for all 15 sars-cov-2 sequences analyzed supplementary figure 2 within the betacoronavirus genus the presence of a basic stretch of residues at the s1s2 site is found for a number of species from lineages a hcov-hku1 mhv hcov-oc43 and c mers-cov batcov-hku5 the four-amino-acid insertion feature appears unique among lineage b viruses as all other species analyzed in the extended alignment none contained the stretch of basic residues identified in sars-cov-2 s supplementary figure 2 as expected from previous analyses the s2 cleavage site located immediately upstream of the fusion peptide and corresponding to the residue position r797 in the case of sars-cov was strictly conserved for sars-cov-2 and closely related bat sars-related sequences figure 3c of note the leucine l residue found at position 792 of the sars-cov sequence is substituted to serine s residue for sars-cov-2 s as well as the bat sars-related sequences the fusion peptide sequence was found to be well conserved for all sequences analyzednotably protein alignment analyses show that pangolin sequences as for other viruses in betacoronaviruses lineage b do not show the presence of the predicted proteolytically sensitive s1s2 fusion activation site present in sars-cov-2 figure 4
 only environmental samples taken from the huanan seafood market appear to also harbor the s1s2 insert interestingly the 2019 pangolin sequence shares the same motif immediately upstream of the s1s2 insert found in sars-cov-2 s 675qtqtns680 sars-cov-2 numbering this is also shared with batcov-ratg13 but not with the other pangolin sequences from 2017 which harbor a distinct motif 673hsmsslf678 betacovpangolinguangxip4l2017  epiisl410538 numberingto gain a deeper understanding of common and possibly distinguishing structural features found in sars-cov-2 s protein homology modeling was undertaken the analysis of modeled proteins provides a powerful tool to identify predicted structural characteristics which can translate into structurefunction changes in the studied protein our laboratory has previously taken advantage of these tools for structurefunction studies of other covs s proteins 233738 to perform the modeling it is first necessary to identify a suitable protein structure to be used as template which will determine the accuracy of the predicted model the s protein structure of several covs including the following have been reported previously alphacoronavirus hcov-nl63 and feline coronavirus uu4 fcov-uu4 betacoronavirus hcov-hku1 mhv sars-cov and mers-cov gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus ibv and deltacoronavirus porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 considering that genome and s protein alignments have showed that the sars-cov-2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genus we focused our analysis on the s structures from viruses belonging to this genus to select the template structure the s protein amino acid sequences from four representative betacoronaviruses hcov-hku1 mhv sars-cov and mers-cov were aligned and the solved s protein structures were compared to determine their amino acid identity and the overall structural organization similarities among these proteins supplementary figure 3a we observed an average of  30 identity among the four viral s proteins at the amino acid level with the exception of hcov-hku1 and mhv which share an amino acid identity of 59 at the s protein supplementary figure 3a despite the differences at the amino acid level the overall structure of the four betacoronavirus s proteins showed a similar folding pattern supplementary figure 3b and major differences can only be spotted at specific sections of the functional domains where flexible loops are abundant eg rbd and cleavage sites considering this we used modeller v 923 university of california to build a first set of models for the sars-cov-2 s protein based on each of the above-mentioned structures supplementary figure 4 interestingly we found no major differences at the secondary structures among the sars-cov-2 s protein-predicted models depending on the s structure that was used as template for the modeling construction however extended flexible loops at the rbd andor clashes between s monomers at the s2 domain level were observed in the sars-cov-2 s models based on hcov-hku1 mhv and mers-cov supplementary figure 4 first three panels in contrast the predicted sars-cov-2 s model based on the sars-cov s structure displayed a much better organized folding and no major clashes were observed between the s monomers supplementary figure 4 last panelas we described previously the identity between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov at the s protein amino acid level was 76 and phylogenetic analyses grouped sars-cov-2 in the lineage b of the betacoronavirus genus closely related to sars-cov as well as to other covs originating in bats figure 1b these two considerations in addition to our preliminary modeling results suggested sars-cov s as the most suitable template for modeling the sars-cov-2 s protein taking an alternative approach the s protein sequence of sars-cov-2 was submitted to two structure homology modeling servers phyre 2 and raptorx 4647 for both cases the structural models with highest homology scores were based on the sars-cov s template structure pdb id 5x58 data not shown confirming the choice of using sars-cov s as template for generating structural models of sars-cov-2to better compare the predicted structural characteristics of the sars-cov-2 we also performed homology modeling of four s proteins from bat-covs belonging to lineage b in our phylogenetic analysis which are closely related to sars-cov-2 the modeled s proteins from the bat-covs ratg13 covzc45 covzxc21 and lyra3 were compared to the predicted structure of sars-cov-2 s and to the template structure of sars-cov figure 5
 the amino acid homology of the modeled s proteins in comparison to the template sars-cov s was  71 for all the bat-cov s with the exception of the lyra3 s which shares a homology of 847 with the template s overall all the modeled s proteins shared a similar folding pattern in comparison to sars-cov s and both s1 and s2 domains showed a uniform organization figure 5 as expected differences were mostly observed at the flexible loops forming the head of the s1 domain especially at the ntd region rbd region where most of the amino acid variation was observed figures 3a and 5 the s protein amino acid identity among the bat-cov including sars-cov-2 ranged between 753 and 967 with lyra3 and ratg13 s proteins having the lowest and highest identity to sars-cov-2 respectively despite amino acid variability no major changes in the secondary structures and the overall folding of the proteins were observed among the modeled s structures of these viruses suggesting a conserved organization for all the s proteins of the lineage b including sars-cov-2 nevertheless differences at the flexible loops in both domains were observed and their impact in the sars-cov-2 s protein function must be further studiedit was recently reported that the sars-cov-2 binds ace2 as a receptor to infect target cells 9253348 this finding appears to agree with previous reports describing the ability of bat-covs to successfully bind and use ace2 as a cellular receptor for infection 49 50 51 this conservation in the receptor usage among sars-cov and sars-like bat-covs contrasts with the high variability that are observed at the amino acid sequence of the rbm figure 3a considering this high variability we compared the predicted rbm structure of the sars-cov-2 and bat-covs to the one of sars-cov interestingly despite the variability the modeled sars-cov-2-predicted rbm displayed a similar organization to sars-cov figure 6
 top panel this was also observed in the ratg3 and lyra3-predicted rbm structures figure 6 middle left and bottom right panels suggesting that the rbm organization is well conserved among these viruses in contrast the predicted rbm of the covzc45 and covzxc21 viruses showed a different folding at this region in comparison to sars-cov figure 6 middle right and bottom left panels these two last viruses showed a 5- and a 14-amino-acid deletion respectively in the rbm sequence figure 3a which can explain the differential folding in the modeled proteinsthe alignment in figure 3b shows a four-amino-acid insertion 681prra684 as well as a conserved arginine corresponding to r685 at the s1s2 site of the sars-cov-2 this insertion which appears to be unique among lineage b betacoronaviruses suggests a differential mechanism of activation for the sars-cov-2 compared to other sars-cov and sars-like batcov at the structural level the s1s2 site has been shown to be difficult to solve for most covs structures resulting in either incomplete structures missing the complete s1s2 site or structures with an altered ie mutated s1s2 site 424445 solving the structure of the s1s2 site was also found to be an issue in the sars-cov s structure we used for our modeling analyses we have previously shown that the s1s2 site can be modeled in other cov s proteins and it appears to be organized as a flexible exposed loop that extends from the s structure and suggest it could be easily accessible for proteolytic activation 37to better study the s1s2 site structural organization we modeled the sars-cov s protein based on the s structure of mhv s1s2 site mutated in the structure and mers-cov and sars-cov s1s2 site missing in the structure to see if the predicted structure of the s1s2 site was similar despite the template structure we observed no differences in the modeled sars-cov s protein at the s1s2 site predicting an exposed flexible loop in all the three models data not shown based on this we proceeded to compare the s1s2 site as well as other major functional elements of the s2 domain ie s2 site and fusion peptide in the predicted structure in our sars-cov sars-cov-2 and bat-cov s models figure 7
 remarkably two features appear to exhibit distinctive characteristics in the sars-cov-2 s model the fusion peptide which is predicted to be organized in a more compact conformation for sars-cov-2 s than in sars-cov s figure 7 surface models and the region corresponding to the s1s2 cleavage site which contains r667 in the case of sars-cov figure 7 s1s2 alignment box and ribbon models for sars-cov and the bat-cov proteins the s1s2 site forms a short loop that appears flanking closely to the side of the trimeric structure in the case of sars-cov-2 s the s1s2 site is predicted to form an extended loop that protrudes to the exterior of the trimer figure 7 this feature suggests that the s1s2 loop in sars-cov-2 s could be more exposed for proteolytic processing by host cell proteases as mentioned before solving the structure of the s1s2 site appears to present difficulties for most of the reported cov s structures figure 8
 top panel however the exposed loop feature has been demonstrated in both modeled and cryo-em cov s structures with similar amino acid sequences at the s1s2 site ie fcov and ibv respectively figure 8 top panel interestingly fcov viruses do not always display a s1s2 site figure 8 top panel which results in distinct cell entry mechanisms we also performed an analysis of the s2 site of the sars-cov-2 in comparison to sars-cov and bat-cov s proteins as expected differences in the modeled s2 site structure were not predicted in any of the studied spikes figure 7 s2 ribbon models this agrees with the fact that the s2 site appears to be conserved in the studied sequences figure 7 s2 alignment box and as we described previously the sars-cov functional r797 residue at the cleavage position 1 p1 as well as the serine at position 798 cleavage position p1 are conserved in the sars-cov-2 and among the compared bat-covs this feature also appears to be conserved in other covs figure 8 bottom panel however mutations in the residues immediately upstream of the sars-cov r797 residue or equivalent in each virus have been shown to result in changes in the proteolytical requirements in other covs 28 we observed mutations l to s and t to s which are located upstream of the p1 arginine at positions p3 and p6 in the s2 site of the sars-cov-2 in comparison to sars-cov these mutations are not predicted to alter the structure of the s2 in the sars-cov-2 figure 7 s2 ribbon modelsthe current covid-19 pandemic caused by sars-cov-2 is evidence of the potential of coronaviruses to continuously evolve in wild reservoirs and jump to new species our study aims to contribute to our understanding of the sars-cov-2 from a phylogenetic and structural point of view focusing on the functional and the proteolytically sensitive sites of the s protein using phylogenetic analysis we showed that the sars-cov-2 s protein is closely related to other sars-like viruses originating in bats figure 1b which agrees with early similar reports 34 the identity of the s protein of batcov-ratg13 strain of bat coronavirus was shown to be 9665 suggesting this virus as the closest relative to sars-cov-2 while the origin of the novel coronavirus appears to be in bat reservoirs there is still no definitive evidence of the possible intermediate host that could transmit the virus to humans recent reports have suggested the malayan pangolins as an intermediate host for the sars-cov-2 in our analysis we found that the pangolin spike sequences grouped in a subclade branching from ratg13 we additionally observed that the 2019 guangdong pangolin sequence appeared to branch off early in a distinct subclade from ratg13 based on these findings we hypothesize that despite of having a common origin in bats the phylogenetic relationship between pangolin covs and sars-cov-2 is not sufficient to support the claim that pangolins harbor the direct precursor to the currently circulating human sars-cov-2 in fact our analysis suggests that both humans and pangolins could be considered final hosts of their respective coronavirusin this study we show the presence of a distinct insert that maps to the s1s2 priming loop of the sars-cov-2 spike protein and is not shared with sars-cov or any sars-related viruses in betacoronavirus lineage b during the preparation of this manuscript the cryo-electron microscopy structures of sars-cov-2 s have recently been determined 335253 these studies have revealed in detail the structure of the sars-cov-2 spike rbd and how it contacts the ace2 host cell receptor with notable differences compared to sars-cov 54 it has been described that the sars-cov rbm down conformation packs more closely to the ntd of the s protein 33 in the same report the sars-cov-2 rbd was shown to be angled to the center of the trimmer in its down conformation which differs to the sars-cov rbm structure interestingly we observed in our models that the rbd is predicted to pack similarly to sars-cov and the rbm is also predicted to organize as a flexible loop with similar structure despite the lower amino acid identity between these two proteins figure 6 in a more recent report it has been shown that ace2-binding mode of both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 rbds is nearly identical which supports the claim that the flexibility in the rbm is key to compensate the amino acid differences between the two covs proteins and agrees with our predicted models 54one of the common difficulties of the covs s protein cryo-em studies is the difficulty to solve proteolytically sensitive regions in the protein 3955 since the s1s2 region is proteolytically sensitive it is common to introduce mutations in this site to prevent proteolytic priming and to allow efficient heterologous expression and purification 42 this has resulted in a difficulty to solve the s1s2 region in most of the available cov s protein structures with a few exceptions for the s proteins of viruses belonging to the alphacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus genera 4044 considering that this region is proteolytically sensitive and has been shown to play a major role in the s protein function in other covs the use of in silico modeling tools has become a useful alternative to study this region in the context of the structural organization of the protein 3738 the sars-cov-2 s protein is not an exception to this issue and the recently reported structures do not allow resolution of the s1s2 priming loop andor have the loop mutated we used the structural modeling approach to better understand the organization of this region which is not only suggested to be functionally active but has been reported as one of the major differences between the sars-cov-2 and its closest relative ratg13 2533 we observed that the sars-cov-2 s1s2 site is predicted to be organized as an exposed flexible loop suggesting that the site is easily available for protease cleavage and suggesting a major role in sars-cov-2 s function figure 7the significance of the sars-cov-2 spike protein s1s2 priming loop is yet to be explored experimentally but we consider it may fundamentally change the entry pathway of this virus compared to other known viruses in betacoronavirus lineage b the presence of the extended s1s2 priming loop containing paired basic residues predicts that sars-cov-2 s would most likely be cleaved by golgi-resident proprotein convertases such as furin during virus assembly and delivery to the cell surface indeed analysis of western blots of vsv-pseudoparticles containing sars-cov-2 s have shown the presence of cleaved s in contrast to pseudoparticles containing sars-cov s 25 in the case of mers-cov but not sars-cov it is known that priming of s by pre-cleavage occurs at the s1s2 site giving sars-cov-2 cleavage activation properties more in line with mers-cov than sars-cov 2556 57 58 the extended structural loop may also allow enhanced priming by trypsin-like proteases ttsps or even cathepsins sars-cov-2 is currently believed to be highly sars-cov-like with respect to its receptor binding and the modeling studies reported here are broadly in line with this finding despite the relatively low amino acid identity in the rbm however it is important to remember that changes in protease usage may allow coronaviruses to undergo receptor-independent entry viruscell fusion as well as affect syncytia formation cellcell fusion and tissue pathology 59 60 61our study provides a structural context to the s1s2 insert which has also been reported by others 5262 the presence of a distinct insert containing paired basic residues in the s1s2 priming loop is common in many coronaviruses in betacoronavirus lineage c eg mers-cov as well as in lineage a eg mouse hepatitis virus mhv and lineage d and is universally found in gammacoronavirus s eg ibv 40 it is noticeably absent in most alphacoronaviruses with the clear exception of type i canine and feline coronaviruses 2837 one feature of the distinct insert for of sars-cov-2 that warrants attention relates to potential changes as the virus evolves an equivalent loop is present in influenza ha in this case adjacent to the fusion peptide and insertions of basic residues into the loop are a primary marker of conversion from low pathogenicity to highly pathogenic avian influenza virus eg h5n1 63 in coronaviruses such loop modifications are known to affect mhv pathogenesis and to modulate neurovirulence and neuroinvasiveness of hcov-oc43 6465 the fcov is another example where s1s2 loop modifications appear to lead directly to changes in viral pathogenesis 376667 in the case of fcov the equivalent proteolytically sensitive structural loop is within a hypervariable region of the spike gene suggesting that this region of spike is a significant driver of virus evolution 67at present sars-cov-2 is behaving in a distinct manner compared to sars-cov we believe our findings are of special importance considering that the available data indicates ace2 as a suitable cellular receptor for sars-cov-2 entry 4868 in our modeling analysis we observed that the rbm of the sars-cov-2 predicted a similar organization as sars-cov and that deletions at this rbm region in other bat-covs are reported to not impact its ability to bind ace2 49 50 51 this suggests that instead of receptor binding the s1s2 loop is a distinctive feature relevant to sars-cov-2 pathogenesis and marks a unique similarity to mers-cov we would predict that the distinct insert in sars-cov-2 s would give the virus biological properties more in line with mers-cov and not sars-cov especially with regard to its cell entry pathway however it may also impact virus spread and transmission while many epidemiological features of sars-cov-2 still need to be resolved there are many features of transmission that appear to align more with mers-cov than sars-cov one component of transmission is the reproductive number r0 which is currently thought to be approximately 2030 for sars-cov-2 broadly in line with than for sars-cov and while mers-cov has a low r0 in humans  1 it is high in camels and in outbreak situations  3 69 70 71 72 73 another study has reported that the serial interval time from the disease onset in a patient to the onset of the disease in secondary case can be estimated to be below 4 days suggesting that transmission can occur before the onset of clinical signs 74 these two parameters highlight the high transmissibility of the sars-cov-2 one notable feature of the s protein s1s2 cleavage site was first observed during the purification of the mhv s protein for structural analysis 42 mhv with an intact cleavage loop was unstable when expressed and so we consider that the s1s2 loop controls virus stability likely via access to the down-stream s2 site that regulates fusion peptide exposure and activity as such it will interesting to monitor the effects of s1s2 loop insertions and proteolytic cleavability in the context of virus transmission in addition to virus entry pathogenesis and evolutionamino acid sequences

rapidly around the world this week the who has declared it an global emergency who 2020 the wuhan novel coronavirus 2019-ncov has already caused more infections than the previous severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak of 2002 and 2003 the virus is a sars related coronavirus sarsr-cov and it is genetically associated with sarsr-cov strains that infect bats in china zhu et al 2020 lu et al 2020 it causes severe respiratory illness has high fatality rate huang et al 2020 can be transmitted from person to person and has spread to over 15 countries in less than two months who 2020this coronavirus outbreak has been unprecedented so too is the way that the scientific community has responded to it they have openly and rapidly shared genomic and clinical data as never seen before allowing research results to be released almost instantaneously this has helped the understanding of the transmission dynamics the development of rapid diagnostic and has informed public health response here we present a new contribution that can speed up this communal effort the genome detective coronavirus typing tool is a free-of-charge web-based bioinformatics pipeline that can accurately and quickly identify assemble and classify coronaviruses genomes the tool also identifies changes at nucleotides coding regions and proteins using a novel dynamic aligner to allow tracking new viral mutations figure 1a reference dataset of previously published coronavirus whole genome sequences wgs was compiled from the virus pathogen resource vipr database wwwviprbrcorg this dataset consisted of 386 whole genome sequences wgs of nine important coronavirus species these included 132 sequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus sarsr-cov 121 sequences of beta coronavirus 97 sequences of middle east respiratory syndrome related coronavirus mersr-cov 19 sequences of human coronavirus hku1 9 sequences of murine hepatitis virus 4 of rousettus bat coronavirus hku9 3 of rat coronavirus and one wgs of tylonycteris bat coronavirus hku4 zariabatcoronavirus and longquan rl rat coronavirus to this reference dataset we added 47 whole genomes of the current coronavirus 2019 2019-ncov outbreak that originated in wuhan china in december 2019 the 2019-ncov sequences were downloaded from the gisaid database httpswwwgisaidorg together with annotation of its original location collection date and originating and submitting laboratory the 2019-ncov data generators are properly acknowledged in the acknowledgements section of this paper and detailed information is provided in supplementary table 1the 431 reference wgs were aligned with muscle edgar 2004 the alignment was manually edited until a codon alignment was attained in all coding sequences cds a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree 1000 bootstrap replicates was constructed in phyml guidon  gascuel 2003 lemoine et al 2018 and a bayesian tree using mrbayes ronquist  huelsenbeck 2003 were constructed the trees were visualized in figtree rambaut 2018 we selected 25 reference sequences that represent the diversity of each well-defined phylogenetic cluster with bootstrap support of 100 and posterior probability of 1 we identified five well supported phylogenetic clusters with more than two sequences of sarsr-cov and used them to set up our automated phylogenetic classification tool cluster 1 included sars strains from the 2002 and 2003 asian outbreaks in our tool we named this cluster sars-cov outbreak 2000s but may rename it as sars-a if a new proposed naming system for sarsr-cov is adopted in the near future rambaut 2020 cluster 2 provisionally named as sars related cov includes 7 sequences from bats which did not cause large human outbreaks cluster 3 named as bat sars-covhku3 includes three wgs sampled from rhinolophus sinicus ie chinese rufous horseshoe bats cluster 4 bat sars-cov zxc21zc45 includes two sarsr-cov sampled from rhinolophus sinicus bats in zhoushan china cluster 5 provisionally named as wuhan 2019-ncov which may be renamed as sars-b includes one public sequence from the outbreak in wuhan china we identified this cluster with many sequences from gisaid but kept only this one as this is the only genbank sequence accession number mn908947 which was kindly shared by prof yong-zhen zhang and colleagues in the virologicalorg website detailed information about the phylogenetic reference datasets are available in supplementary table 2the phylogenetic reference dataset was used to create an automated coronavirus typing tool using the genome detective framework vilsker et al 2019 fonseca et al 2019 to determine the accuracy of this tool each of the 431 test wgs was considered for evaluation ie 384 reference sequences from vipr and 47 public 2019-ncov sequences the sensitivity specificity and accuracy of our method was calculated for both species assignment and phylogenetic clustering of sarsr-cov sensitivity was computed by the formula tptpfn specificity by tntnfp and accuracy by tptntpfpfntn where tp  true positives fp  false positives tn  true negatives and fn  false negativesclassifying query sequences in an automated fashion involves two steps the first step enables virus species assignments and the second which is restricted to sarsr-cov includes phylogenetic analysis the first classification analysis subjects a query sequence to blast and aga analysi aga is a novel alignment method for nucleic acid sequences against annotated genomes from ncbi refseq virus database aga deforche 2017 expands the optimal alignment algorithms of smith-waterman smith  waterman 1981 and gotoh gotoh 1982 based on an induction state with additional parameters the result is a more accurate aligner as it takes into account both nucleotide and protein scores and identifies all of the polymorphisms at nucleotide and amino acid levels in the second step a query sequence is aligned against the phylogenetic reference dataset using -add alignment option in the mafft software katoh  standley 2013 in addition a neighbor joining phylogenetic tree is constructed using the hky distance metric with gamma among-site rate variation with 1000 bootstrap replicates using paup swofford the query sequence is assigned to a particular phylogenetic cluster if it clusters monophyletically with that clade or a subset of it with bootstrap support 70 if the bootstrap support is 70 the genotype is reported to be unassignedthe result of the phylogenetic and mutational analysis performed by aga is available in a detailed report this report contains an interactive phylogenetic tree and genome mapper supplementary figure 1 it also presents the virus species and cluster assignments and a detailed table that provides information about open reading frames orfs cds and proteins this table can be expanded to show nucleotide and amino acid mutations that differentiate a query sequence from their species refseq or from a sequence in the phylogenetic reference dataset all results can be exported to a variety of file formats xml csv excel nexus or fastathe genome detective coronavirus typing tool correctly classified all of the 175 sarsr-cov sequences at species level ie specificity sensitivity and accuracy of 100 furthermore all of the 47 2019-ncov wgs that were isolated in china n36 usa n  5 france n2 thailand n2 japan n1 and taiwan n1 were correctly classified at phylogenetic cluster level as 2019-ncov which may be renamed as sars-b in addition we classified with very high specificity sensitivity and accuracy ie 100 all of the 112 sars outbreak wgs of 2002 and 2003 we also achieved perfect classification ie specificity sensitivity and accuracy of 100 for all of beta coronavirus humancoronavirushku1 mers-cov rousettusbatcoronavirushku9 and tylonycterisbatcoronavirushku4 at species level for a detailed overview of assignment performance please refer to the supplementary table 3our tool also allows detailed analysis of coding regions and proteins for each of the coronavirus species for example the analysis of the first released 2019-ncov sequence the whhuman1china2019dec genbank mn908947 demonstrated at genome level the nucleotide nt identity was 790 to the reference strain of sarsr-cov accession nc0047183 and that the envelop small membrane protein protein e is the most similar protein in total 948 7377 of the amino acids were identical the four amino acid differences were located at positions 55 t55s 56 v56f 69 69deletion and 70 g70r the spike protein protein s which can be associated with virulence was 762 identical to the reference strain of sarsr-cov supplementary table 4a interestingly there were four amino acid insertions at position 237 a237f238inshrsy genome nt position 2220222203inscatagaagttat which is just upstream from a cleavage site the most diverse coding regions were the cds sars8a and sars8b in these two regions only 30 of the amino acids were identical sars8b protein was truncated early and its cds had four stop codons supplementary table 4saour coronavirus typing tool also allows a query sequence to be analysed against a sequence in the phylogenetic reference dataset for example the whhuman1china2019dec genbank mn908947 the identity was 875 to the bat sequence batslcovzxc21 genbank mg772934 this was one of the bat-cov sequences that were most related to n2019-cov lu et al 2020 the envelop small membrane protein protein e was 100 identical supplementary table 4b when the 2019-ncov isolated from france betacovfranceidf03732020 was analysed with our tool and compared with the 2019-ncov whhuman1china2019dec strain accession mn908947 this sequence was 999 identical and had only two nt mutations supplementary table 4c these two differences were located on positions 22551gt  26016gt which caused three amino acid mutations e2 glycoprotein protein mutation v354f 22551gt sars3a protein mutations g250v 26016gt and sars3b protein mutations v110f 26016gt detailed in supplementary table 4c-ii the analysis of a wgs in fasta format takes approximately 60 secondswe developed and released the genome detective coronavirus typing tool as a free-of-charge resource in the third week of january 2020 in order to help the rapid characterization of ncov-2019 infections this tool allows the analysis of whole or partial viral genomes within minutes it accepts assembled genomes in fasta format or raw ngs data in fastq format from illumina ion torrent pacbio or oxford nanopore technologies ont can be submitted to the genome detective virus tool vilsker et al 2019 to automatically assemble the consensus genome prior to executing the coronavirus typing tool user effort is minimal and a user can submit multiple fasta sequences at oncethe tool uses a novel and dynamic aligner aga to allow submitted sequences to be queried against reference genomes using both nucleotide and amino acid similarity scores this allows accurate identification of other coronavirus species and the tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally it also performs detailed analysis of the coding regions and proteins moreover it can easily be updated to add new phylogenetic clusters if new outbreaks arise or if the classification nomenclature changes the tool has been able to correctly classify all the recently released ncov-2019 genomes as well as all the 20022003 sars outbreak sequencesin conclusion the genome detective coronavirus typing tool is a web-based and user-friendly software application that allows the identification and characterization of novel coronavirus genomesa novel coronavirus outbreak took place in wuhan hubei province china in december 2019 wang et al 2020 this novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 causes pneumonia in patients zhu et al 2020 and it has rapidly spread to other provinces in china and other countries who 2020 this novel coronavirus outbreak had raised global concern but current knowledge on the origin and transmission route of the pathogen is still limited the sars-cov-2 belongs to the genus betacoronavirus which also includes two highly virulent human coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov apart from human many animal species such as bat rat camel swine and hedgehog can be infected by different types of coronaviruses further sequence analyses of this novel and other betacoronaviruses might provide additional information to better understand the evolution of sars-cov-2preferential codon usage is commonly seen in different organisms and it has been evident that the uneven codon usage is not neutral but related to gene expression or other selection pressures akashi and eyre-walker 1998 percudani and ottonello 1999 pepin domsic and mckenna 2008 there are two levels of codon usage biases one is at amino acid level and the other is at synonymous codon level the first one mainly originates from preferential usage of certain amino acids for example integral membrane proteins maybe enriched in hydrophobic amino acids and respective codons perriere 2002 the synonymous codon usage bias in viruses can be driven by selective pressures from the host cells wong et al 2010 fan et al 2015gu et al 2019 and studies on different viruses have shown that selection pressures can be dominant in the evolution of codon usage patterns of the virus liu et al 2011 fan et al 2015 kumar et al 2016 wang et al 2016 correspondence analysis ca is a tool for visualization high dimension discrete-state data which has been applied in many codon usage studies perriere 2002 charif et al 2005 wong et al 2010 lobry 2018 the recently developed within-group ca wca and between-group ca bca are derivatives to the conventional ca lobry 2018 and the application of block structure in these methods allows separating the codon usage bias at amino acid and synonymous codon levels as the natural history of the sars-cov-2 remains largely unknown an in-depth codon usage analysis of this newly emerging virus might provide some novel insightsin this study we used both ca bca and wca to analyses codon usage patterns of 3076 betacoronavirus sequences we found sars-cov-2 and bat sarsr-cov have similar amino acid usage however our analyses suggested that the spike and membrane genes of sars-cov-2 have relatively distinct synonymous codon usage patterns to the orf1ab or nucleocapsid genesto construct a reference sequence dataset available full-length complete genome sequences of coronavirus were collected through virus pathogen resource database httpswwwviprbrcorgbrchomespgdecoratorcorona accessed 13 july 2019 ticket 958868915368 the sequences were filtered by the following steps 1 remove sequences without protein annotation 2 keep only sequences with complete set of desired replicase and structural proteins sequences coding for orf1ab spike membrane and nucleocapsid 3 filter out sequences that are unusually long and short 130 or 70 of the median length for each group of gene sequences 4 limit our analysis to genus betacoronavirus and 5 concatenate orf1a and orf1b sequences to form orf1ab if necessarythe final dataset comprised 769 individual strains 3076 individual gene sequences that contain complete sets of coding regions for orf1ab spike membrane and nucleocapsid genes the sequences for envelope gene were not included in the analysis because of the short length and potential bias in codon usage corresponding metadata for the sequences were extracted by the sequence name field twenty-four complete genome sequences of the newly identified sars-cov-2 and its phylogenetically close relatives were retrieved from genbank and gisaid accessed 22 jan 2020 six genomes in this study were used as references

calculated by the synmut gu and poon 2019 package the implementation of the different correspondence analyses in this study was performed by functions in the package ade4 dray and dufour 2007 three stop codons taa tag and tga were excluded in the cacorrespondence analysis ca is a dimension reduction method applied to a contingency table that is well suited for amino acid and codon usage analysis the concept in ca is similar to pearsons 2 test ie the expected counts are calculated under the hypothesis of independence based on the observed contingency table with the deduced expected count table the 2 distance supplementary method can be used to evaluate the difference between two observations the total inertia calculated from the 2 distance is proportional to the statistic used in pearsons 2 test lobry 2018 the pearson residuals were applied in the ca as input for singular value decomposition suzuki et al 2008 and resulted eigenvalues were visualized and interpreted in the study k-means clustering k  7 was performed based on the results from ca analysis to provide quantitative measurement on the proximity between data pointsall the correspondence analyses in this study were performed individually for each gene to achieve better resolution on gene specific codon usage patternin contrast to the previous global ca the within-block ca benzcri 1983 wca can segregate the effects of different codon compositions in different amino acids by introducing a block structure into the analysis wca becomes model of choice for analysing synonymous codon usage in recent years as it is more robust than other traditional methods eg ca with relative codon frequency or ca with relative synonymous codon usage values perriere 2002 suzuki et al 2008 wca focuses on the within-amino acid variability and it technically excludes the variation of amino acid usage differences the implementation of wca was based on the existing global ca with additional information for factoring details included in supplementary method between-group ca bca is complementary to wca and it focuses on the between-group variability bca can be interpreted as the ca on amino acid usage we used bca in this study to investigate the amino acid usage pattern in different coronavirusesthe grand average of hydropathy gravy score provides an easy way to estimate the hydropathy character of a protein kyte and

total of 3076 individual gene sequences passed the filtering criteria and were included in this study viral sequences from three different species middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus mersr-cov betacoronavirus 1 sars-related coronavirus sarsr-cov were the three most dominant species see supplementary fig s1 in the filtered datasetfour conserved protein sequence encoding regions of betacoronavirus were analysed separately the median lengths of the studied sequence regions were 21237 nt for orf1ab gene 4062 nt for spike gene 660 nt for membrane gene and 1242 nt for nucleocapsid gene spike gene has the lowest average and median g  c contents among these four genes median 3745 3731 4260 and 4722 for orf1ab spike membrane and nucleocapsid respectively the gc contents of the orf1ab and spike genes were found distributed in bi-modal patterns and the g  c contents of sars-cov-2 were found located at the lesser half of the data of these two genes the g  c contents for membrane and nucleocapsid genes of studied viral sequences were distributed in unimodal pattern fig 1athe overall amino acid and codon usage of the dataset are plotted in an ascending order fig 2 we observed that leucine and valine were the two most frequently used amino acids in the four studied genes while tryptophan histidine and methionine were the three least used ones we also found that codons ending with cytosine or guanine were generally less frequent than the codons ending with adenine or thymine this pattern of uneven usage in synonymous codons is in accordance with the g  c content distribution results codons ending with guanine or cytosine were less frequently observedwe found a substantial bias in amino acid usage among these four genes and this bias is well explained by the hydropathy of the encoded proteins collectively results from global ca on all the four genes data not shown we discovered that the nucleocapsid protein sequences had significantly lower gravy scores when compared with those from other genes while the membrane protein sequences had highest gravy scores fig 1bof all the four global correspondence analyses for the four genes the extracted first factors explained more than 50 per cent of the total variance see supplementary fig s2 the first two factors in orf1ab global ca represented 677 and 168 per cent of total inertia similarly the first two factors of the spike membrane and nucleocapsid global ca represented 510 and 185 per cent 526 and 202 per cent and 548 and 142 per cent respectively of total inertia with only these two factors we could extract 70 per cent of the variability of the overall codon usage for each studied gene these levels of representations were higher than or similar to those deduced from other codon usage analyses zhou et al 2005 suzuki et al 2008lobry 2018the data points in global ca analysis are shown in different colours that represent different features of the sequences eg viral host or viral species there were no neighbouring human viruses in the same k-means cluster around sars-cov-2 in ca results of orf1ab spike and membrane fig 3 supplementary fig 3a suggesting that the overall codon usage of sars-cov-2 in the orf1ab spike or membrane gene was significantly different from those of human betacoronaviruses in contrast the nucleocapsid genes of sars coronavirus and sars-cov-2 are found to be relatively similar supplementary fig s3a except for the nucleocapsid gene virus sequences adjacent to the sars-cov-2 were all from bat coronaviruses coloured in purple in fig 3 the five groups of viral sequences sars-cov-2 betacoronavirus 1 human coronavirus hku 1 mers-cov and sars-cov were well separated from each other in three genes except that in nucleocapsid sars-cov-2 and sars-cov have similar overall codon usage we also found that sars-cov codon usage processed more similarity to sars-cov-2 compared with the other three types of human coronaviruses ie yellow point always closest to sars-cov-2 in supplementary fig s3acompared with human coronavirus sequences the bat coronavirus sequences have more scattered codon usage even within the same viral species supplementary fig s3b some viral species in bats formed their own clusters in all four genes eg sarsr-cov sarsr-cov is a group of coronavirus that can be found in both humans and bats the codon usage of sars-cov-2 in orf1ab spike and membrane were slightly different from the sars-cov clusters and these data points are located in between sarsr-cov and other coronavirus species eg mersr-cov and bat coronavirus hku9 etcthe global codon usages of bat ratg13 virus were found most similar to sars-cov-2 in orf1ab spike and nucleocapsid genes but not in membrane gene fig 3 in membrane protein pangolin p1e virus had a more similar codon usage to sars-cov-2 than all the other viruses we found the similarity in codon usage between pangolin p1e and sars-cov-2 were also high in orf1ab where p1e was the second closest data point to sars-cov-2 but this is not the case for spike and nucleocapsid geneswe also observed that the codon usage pattern in spike gene was more complex than in other genes for example we found that the p1e virus was in different k-means cluster with sars-cov-2 which was not observed in the other three genes moreover data points adjacent to the spike gene of sars-cov-2 were coronaviruses not only from bat and human but also from rodent hosts which is unseen in the other three genes fig 3 supplementary fig s4b although the ca results suggested relatively novel codon usage pattern it captured a large proportion of the variance between hosts or virus species this was supported by significant differences between the ca distances in both host anosim statistic r 0085 p  0001 and virus species groups anosim statistic r 0506 p  0001the codon usage from camel swine and other coronaviruses were found to be well clustered and relatively distant to sars-cov-2 see supplementary fig s4a c and dwca and bca were used to further differentiate codon usage of these betacoronaviruses at synonymous codon usage and amino acid usage levels respectively we found that most of the variability in codon usage can be explained at synonymous codon usage level 9036 for orf1ab gene 8529 for spike gene 8371 for member gene and 8407 for nucleocapsid gene table 1results from the bca suggested that the amino acid usage of sars-cov-2 is closely related to bat and human sarsr-covs in all four genes figs 4b and 5b specifically we discovered that the sars-cov-2 had amino acid usage pattern most similar to bat ratg13 virus followed by pangolin p1e bat covvzc45 and bat covzxc21 the sequences of btky72 and bm48-31 were from a more phylogenetically distant clade and accordingly they had relatively distinct amino acid usage to sars-cov-2 as expected in all four studied genes this result agrees with the result in the full-genome phylogenetic analysis supplementary fig s5the difference between sars-cov-2 and ratg13 at synonymous codon usage level was marginal in orf1ab and nucleocapsid sequences however our results suggest the synonymous codon usage patterns in the spike and membrane gene of sars-cov-2 are different from those of its genetically related viruses ie ratg13 and other reference relatives for example the pangolin p1e virus was not grouped in the same k-means cluster with sars-cov-2 in spike and the synonymous codon usage pattern of sars-cov-2 was found to be closer to a cluster of rodent murine coronaviruses at the first two factorial levels figs 4a and 5afurther analysis on spike gene however suggested that the codon usage of sars-cov-2 and rodent murine coronaviruses were distinct at the third factorial level supplementary fig s6a the results show that although ratg13 became the most adjacent to sars-cov-2 when adding the third dimension wca values our results suggest a complex genomic background in the spike gene of sars-cov-2 which made its synonymous codon usage harder to differentiate from other genomic sequences in our wca analysis the distances between k-means clusters are smaller despite the relative proximity between ratg13 and sars-cov-2 at three-dimensional level they were still at significantly different positions supplementary fig s6a it is evident that the synonymous codon usage pattern of sars-cov-2 is distinct from other bat origin coronaviruses the difference in synonymous codon usage is largely explained by the first factor more than 50 and our analysis on codon usages suggest that the first factor maybe highly related to the preferential usage of codons ending with cytosine supplementary fig s7 we also had similar observation for the membrane gene our three-dimensional analysis revealed that the synonymous codon usage of sars-cov-2 in membrane was most similar to p1e and covzxc21 supplementary fig s6b it is worth noting that comparing to ratg13 p1e and covzxc21 had lower synonymous codon usage similarity to sars-cov-2 in the other three genesoverall our wca results support a more complex synonymous codon usage background on spike and membrane genes though we identified unique codon usage patterns of sars-cov-2 on these two genescodon usage can be affected by many sequence features including nucleotide composition dinucleotide composition amino acid preference host adaption etc hershberg and petrov 2008 suzuki et al 2008 gu et al 2019 the codon usages of viral sequences can vary by genes and host origins jenkins and holmes 2003 wong et al 2010 cristina et al 2015 the bias in codon usage is a unique and distinctive characteristic that can reflect the signature of a genomic sequence codon usage analyses are often complementary to ordinary sequence alignment-based analyses that focus on the genetic distance at nucleotide level whereas codon usage analyses enable capturing signals at different sequence parameters therefore codon usage bias can be another good proxy for identifying unique traits eg virus origin host origin or some functions of proteins of a genome the goal of this study was to investigate the codon usage bias of betacoronaviruses by studying the codon usages of these viruses in a systematic manner we identified viral sequences carrying traits similar to those of sars-cov-2 which provided useful information for studying the host origin and evolutionary history of sars-cov-2the codon usage of different genes in betacoronaviruses is very different the g  c content especially the gc3 content is known to be influential to the codon usage of some bacteria and viruses perriere 2002 gu et al 2004 woo et al 2010 the gc3 content has pronounced effects on our wca analysis of the orf1ab and spike genes the gc3 content was found correlated with high wca values on the first factor of orf1ab in contrast codons ending with cytosine had lower factorial values in the spike gene analysis supplementary fig s7 the g  c contents in membrane and nucleocapsid genes were less suppressed fig 1a this can be partly explained by the fact that membrane and nucleocapsid are two genes with shorter lengths which may limit the flexibilities for mutation or codon usage adaptation in addition to global ca analysis the application of wca and bca can eliminate the effects caused by amino acid compositions and synonymous codon usage respectively these alternative analytical tools were important because the amino acid sequences are expected to be more conserved such that they can preserve biological functions of the translated genes in contrast mutations at synonymous level tend to be more frequent as most of these codon alternatives do not affect the biological function of a proteinof all the existing genomes in the dataset ratg13 best matched the overall codon usage pattern of the sars-cov-2 although the sars-cov-2 had amino acid usage similar to bat and human sarsr-covs the synonymous codon usages between them were relatively different which indicates similar protein characteristics but maybe different evolutionary histories the codon usage of bat coronaviruses is more scattered than coronaviruses of other hosts this result agrees with the fact that bat is a major host reservoir of coronavirus calisher et al 2006 thus it harbours coronaviruses with more complex genomic backgroundssars-cov-2 was first identified in human but its codon usage pattern is very different from those of other human betacoroanviruses supplementary fig s3a in fact the codon usage at both the amino acid level and synonymous level denote that the orf1ab gene in sars-cov-2 had closest relationship to sarsr-cov especially ratg13 the covzx45 and covzxc21 had similar amino acid usage but relatively different synonymous codon usage to sars-cov-2 fig 4 besides bat-origin sarsr-cov the pangolin p1e also had similar codon usage to sars-cov-2 both at amino acid and synonymous codon levels the result in orf1ab is in accordance with the full-genome phylogenetic analysis supplementary fig s5 showing a close relationship between sars-cov-2 and ratg13 by the overall backbone of the genomethe s protein is responsible for receptor binding which is important for viral entry the genetic variability is extreme in spike gene gallagher and buchmeier 2001 and this highly mutable gene may possess more information about recent evolution history in our results the synonymous codon usage of sars-cov-2 in spike gene was distinct from those of p1e and other phylogenetic relatives fig 4a which was not observed in orf1ab or nucleocapsid gene although the codon usage in spike of sars-cov-2 ratg13 and p1e were similar at amino acid level the difference at synonymous codon usage level indicates that they are unlikely to share a very recent common ancestor it is more likely that sars-cov-2 ratg13 and p1e might have undergone different evolution pathways for a certain period of time the amino acid usage of sars-cov-2 in membrane was clustered with bat sarsr-cov however the synonymous codon usage of sars-cov-2 was still distinct to these bat coronaviruses notably in membrane gene pangolin p1e had a more similar synonymous codon usage to sars-cov-2 than ratg13 these findings suggest that there may be different selection forces between genes our result supports different evolutionary background or currently unknown host adaption history in sars-cov-2 the codon usage of sars-cov-2 in nucleocapsid gene was similar to bat sarsr-cov both at amino acid level and synonymous level suggesting that no highly significant mutation happened in this genecodon usage can be shaped by many different selection forces including the influence from host factors some researchers have hypothesized that the codon usage in sars-cov-2 maybe directly correlated to the codon usage of its host ji et al 2020 however our recent study on influenza a viruses implied that these may not be the most influential factors shaping the codon usage of a viral genome gu et al 2019 our analysis took advantage of the existing genomes of betacoronavirus to study the complex host effect on codon usage which warrants more accurate but relatively conserved estimation however we also understand that the results from codon usage analysis cannot be deterministic or direct evidence revealing the origin of the virus as the number of available genomic data is currently limited and virus with high 99 genetic similarity to sars-cov-2 was yet to be identified we cannot draw a conclusion on the origin of sars-cov-2 at this stage another potential limitation of the study maybe from the ca method itself although ca have been widely applied in codon usage studies in many different organisms the codon usage data are usually not independent observations the phylogenetic relationship among observations make it hard to differentiate source of the codon usage bias as the codon usage bias may both affected by selective pressures and descent relationships unfortunately there is currently no established method for adjusting phylogenetic relationships in ca analysis in codon usage data an alternative method addressing the above concern is neededsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 emerged in wuhan china in late december 2019 since then it has rapidly spread across the world and was finally declared as a public health emergency of international concern pheic by the world health organization on january 30th 2020 1sars-cov-2 is taxonomically classified under nidovirales order coronaviridae family coronavirinae subfamily and betacornoavirus genus it is an enveloped virus with non-segmented positive-sense single-stranded rna although sars-cov-2 presents with a lower pathogenicity than severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov which emerged in 20022003 and middle-east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov which emerged in 2012 it reveals more rapidly human-to-human transmission 2the genome of sars-cov-2 consists of non-segmented rna that includes a 5 untranslated region utr structural proteins non-structural proteins several accessory proteins open reading frames and a 3 utr the orf1ab of several orfs is proteolytically cleaved into 16 putative non-structural proteins nsp116 for genome maintenance and replicase complex formation in viral replication the structural proteins essential in viral particles include the spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n proteins the receptor-binding domain rbd of the s protein is crucial for binding directly to the human receptor ace2 inducing viral entry and determining host tropism and transmission capacity 35 the s protein is cleaved into 2 subunits s1 and s2 the s1 subunit directly recognizes and attaches to human receptor ace2 while s2 fuses the host cell membrane with viral membranes allowing entry of sars-cov-2 6 in general rna viruses like sars-cov-2 undergo rapid mutation enabling evolutionary and genetic diversity which result in alterations such as viral transmissibility receptor affinity host tropism and pathogenicityin recent years several studies based on mutation analysis of sars-cov-2 genome have attempted to understand phylogenetic relationships host infectivity human-to-human transmission viral tropism and pathogenicity of sars-cov in humans firstly the comparative evolutionary diversity in point mutations synonymous-non-synonymous mutations are suggestive that sars-cov-2 should to be classified into 3 major clades s g and v and other clades according to amino acid changes 79 secondly the high affinity and stable structure of rbdace2 have been associated with amino acid variations in the rbd such as the high affinity group n354d d364y v367f and w436r 10 and the high ace2-binding affinity and stability group 484-ngvegfn-490 q496n and q496y 11 thirdly the deletion of 382 nucleotides towards the 3 end of the viral genome may have an impact on viral phenotype 12 and the qtqtn motif adjacent to the polybasic cleavage site rrar chain of amino acids at the bridge between s1 and s2 may be related to host adaptation 13 in addition insertion of the rrar which has been well known to determine high or low pathogenicity in avian influenza virus may be important in determining transmissibility and pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 14 finally primer-template mismatch has been known to affect the stability and functionality of polymerase in particular the primer-template mismatch located in the primer 3 end region can interfere with polymerase active sites and this may have a significant impact on the accuracy of the molecular diagnosis using primers or probes 15therefore we analyzed the mutations of the sars-cov-2 genome by focusing on phylogenetic evolution rbd region deletion mutations in polybasic cleavage site and primer-template mismatches in the genome although the mechanisms responsible for rapid transmission pathogenicity and tropism in sars-cov-2 remain unclear identification of mutations in the sars-cov-2 genome may help to interpret the high infectivity of the virus with the hostthe set of 4254 sars-cov-2 genome sequences and acknowledgment files were downloaded from the epicov browser httpsepicovorgepi3 of the gisaid 16 the raw data were processed by removing unnecessary genome sequences with low-quality reads base calling errors unsolved nucleotides as n and small gaps to investigate the genome-wide phylogenetic analysis we recombined 12 coding sequences orf1a orf1b s m e n orf3 orf6

identifying the types of point mutation synonymous and non-synonymous mutation from 4254 sequences we separately extracted 12 fully coding sequences cdss determining the sequence of amino acids in a protein from the genomes and then conducted an in-house program based on perl computer programming language to analyze mutations among the cdss and the reference genome in nomenclature for the replacement from one amino acid to a different amino acid in a gene we illustrated it as the gene name surrounded by parenthesis after the substitution of amino acids for example d614g s means that an aspartic acid is converted into a glycine at amino acid position 614 of the s gene in comparison with the reference strain hcov-19wuhan-hu-12019 for the comparative analysis of primer- and probe-template mismatches we referred several lists published on the of centers for disease control and prevention cdc websites

out with 178 representative strains to comprehend monophyletic distribution of the sars-cov-2 population the phylogenetic tree showed 3 major clades s g and v clades similar to previous reports by gisaid these clades s g and v clades were determined by the mutations l84s orf8 g251v orf3a and d614g s respectively figure 1 of the three mutations determining the clades the significant d614g s in g clade is located in the adjacent polybasic cleavage site but its actual function on rdbace2 affinity is unclear in addition to the three clades two subclades belonging g clade were observed and they were named g1 and g2 clades referring to their parent clade name the g1 and g2 subclades were determined by three mutations g204r n r203k n and p214l orf1b and one mutation q57h orf3a respectively figure 2 in this respect the derivation of g1 and g2 subclades from the g clade shows that a clade can be also determined by one or more mutationsto identify the number and the types of mutation across a total of sars-cov-2 strains the 12 different types of cds from the 4254 strains were completely extracted in accordance with the genomic positions presented by the ncbis genbank format file sequence id nc0455122 the unsuitable sequences with base calling errors unsolved nucleotides as n and undefinable gaps were excluded a total of 47176 cdss were gathered from orf1a orf1b s m e n orf3 orf6 orf7a orf7b orf8 and orf10 we identified 767 types of synonymous and 1352 types of non-synonymous mutation from them genes with high frequency mutations were orf1a orf1b s n and orf3a orf1a showed the highest frequency mutations containing 302 types of synonymous and 530 types of non-synonymous mutation table 2 figure 3 the non-synonymous mutations with high frequency in the genes were representative mutations in the clades l84s orf8 in s clade d614g s in g clade g251v orf3a in v clade p214l orf1b r203k n and g204r n in g1 clade and q57h orf3a in g2 clade figures 4 and 5orf1a and orf1b encode replicase polyproteins essential component of the viral rna replication therefore conserved structure of them have been the focus of antiviral drugs 18 rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp located between orf1a and orf1b is an important component for application and translation and has a functionally conserved region known as high sequence similarity 19 the conserved region of rdrp has been widely used as a target for designing primers and probes based on rt-pcr technology in genetic diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 in this regard the mutations from orf1a and orf1b were analyzed and we identified 302 types of synonymous and 530 types of non-synonymous mutation in orf1a and 179 types of synonymous and 305 types of non-synonymous mutation in orf1b also a total of 144 types of mutation were identified in the rdrp region corresponding to the 13442 to 16236 genomic position of which 56 types of synonymous and 88 types of non-synonymous mutation were detected figure 6 since the non-synonymous mutation with the highest frequency of in the rdrp region was p214l which determines the g1 subclade together with g204r and r203k of the n gene it was necessary to further study the functional interaction amongst these mutations of the orf1a and n gene on one hand 9 types of primer-template mismatch were identified in the rdrp region although it is not understood how these mismatches affect the stability of primer-template complexes it is necessary to determine the interrelationshipsthe s gene of sars-cov-2 plays an important role in escaping the immune system of host the rbd in the s gene is directly or indirectly concerned with the binding and affinity to ace2 the strong binding between rbd and ace2 may have led to the worldwide transmission and rapid infectivity of sars-cov-2 on the other hand the rrar which is located between s1 and s2 681685 amino acid position of the s gene may be related to the pathogenicity of sars-cov-2 therefore it is might be inferred from the mutations in the rbd and the polybasic cleavage site in the s gene that the mutations will provide important clues to understanding immunity and pathogenicity of sars-cov-2 we identified 109 types of synonymous and 182 types of non-synonymous mutation in the s gene figure 7 d614g is a major non-synonymous mutation in g clade and accounts for 1764 130 in a total of 13537 non-synonymous mutations above all it is located in the s1s2 junction region near the polybasic cleavage site but its biochemical and structural relationships with ace2 has been unclear so far in the rbd region 2247823191 genomic position we found 12 types of synonymous and 27 types of non-synonymous mutation among them the d467v i468f i468t i472v g476s s477g v483a p491r y508h r509k and v510l were located within the zone 443510 amino acid position of the s gene adjacent to ace2 in particular the v483a and g476s mutations have previously been reported to be related to human receptor-binding affinity in mers and sars-cov research 20 21 we detected a r682q mutation from the rrar where arginine residue was replaced by glutamine residue the arginine residue is not only electrically charged but also strongly basic while the glutamine residue is polar uncharged therefore it is necessary to study how this biochemical difference may affect functional and structural changes of the proteins of s1 or s2 according to a recent study the fact that a deletion of the qtqtn amino acid motif near the polybasic cleavage site is related to adaptation of sars-cov-2 has been reported hence we tried to confirm whether some deletions occurred in this region 675679 amino acid position of the s gene we identified no deletion of qtqtn in this region but confirmed 5 types of non-synonymous mutation type 1 with n679y and s680p type 2 with n679k type 3 with q677h type 4 with q675h and type 5 with q675r except for type 1 type 2 to 5 had a common feature where glutamine and asparagine with a polar uncharged side chain were converted into lysine histidine or arginine with basic property although deletion of the qtqtn motif was not identified near the polybasic cleavage site it may be informative to study the functional significance of the five mutations in this regionthe e m orf6 orf7a orf7b orf8 and orf10 are less frequent mutations than other genes orf3a is a novel short positive protein essential to viral adaptation in vitro and is involved in the viral pathogenicity the major types of synonymous mutation of orf3a are q57h and g251v which are significant mutations in determining g2 clade and v clade respectively it is inferred from this result that q57h and g251v may have a positive effect on viral adaptation in the e gene known to be involved in viral budding along with the m gene we confirmed a relatively small number of mutations in it this means that there are high conserved regions so it seems reasonable to infer that the preserved sequence is important to encode protein participating in viral reproduction like the region of rdrp the e gene has been also used to design primers and probes for the diagnosis of sars-cov-2 we identified 10 types of synonymous and 12 types of non-synonymous mutation in the e gene figure 8 of these mutations 7 primer-template mismatch mutations 3 types of synonymous and 4 types of non-synonymous mutation occurred the m gene which is associated with cellular immunogenicity showed 28 types of synonymous and 21 types of non-synonymous mutation of which mutations with high frequency were observed as t175m and d3g several types of synonymous mutation in orf6 orf7 and orf10 were identified but mutations with high frequency were not observed however l84s in orf8 was identified as a mutation with high frequency the n gene packaging of the viral rna genome into the medical ribonucleocapsid has been regarded as a candidate target region for primers and probes like the e and rdrp genes in the n gene we detected 63 types of synonymous and 119 types of non-synonymous mutation among them r203k and g204r showed high frequencies in g2 clade together with p214l orf1b in addition 51 primer-template mismatch mutations 17 types of synonymous and 34 types of non-synonymous mutation occurredfrom the non-synonymous mutation is overall more frequent than the synonymous mutations in the set of 4254 sars-cov-2 genome sequences it is inferred from this results that the evolution of the sars-cov-2 has been accepted to be positive selection in consequence several point mutations may directly or indirectly influence the interaction between sars-cov-2 and human and the diversity of mutations in sars-cov-2 may enhance the evolution of the virus towards rapid transmission based on our analysis the d614g s mutation of g clade which revealed the highest frequent in our phylogenetic analysis may have a positive advantage in natural selection according to the frequency of mutations within sars-cov-2 strains orf1a orf1b s and n genes were shown at high frequency and they may advantageously evolve to adapt to not only external interactions with host cells such as recognizing a cell surface receptor attaching to the host receptor and fusing with cellular membranes but also internal interactions in host cells such as replicating and transcribing viral genome and budding by cellular exocytosis although d614g in the s gene is not a mutation within rbd the fact that it occurred as the highest frequency in all sars-cov-2 genomes suggests it may be related to host infection and transmission therefore we believe that it is necessary to continuously monitor the accumulation of mutations and to further study how these mutations affect receptor affinity propagation ability and pathogenicity on the other hand rdrp e and n genes are the target genes for designing primers and probes in rt-pcr-based sars-cov-2 diagnosis owing to their high sequence conservation it has not been known how the primer-template mismatches affect the accuracy and precision of the genetic diagnosis of covid-19 but we suggest that it is desirable to avoid the variable hotspot regions as much as possible our results about genomic mutations of sars-cov-2 strains may be helpful for interpreting the potential relationships of pathogenicity infectivity and transmission between sars-cov-2 and human hosttraditionally viruses were characterized and classified by culture electron microscopy and serological studies using these phenotypic methods coronaviruses were defined as enveloped viruses of 120160 nm in diameter with a crown-like appearance the name coronavirus is derived from the greek  meaning crown based on their antigenic relationships coronaviruses were classified into three groups group 1 and 2 are composed of mammalian coronaviruses and group 3 avian coronaviruses the invention of and advances in nucleic acid amplification technologies automated dna sequencing and bioinformatics tools in the recent two decades have revolutionized the characterization and classification of all kinds of infectious disease agents using molecular methods coronaviruses are classified as positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses furthermore the results of using phylogenetic methods for classification also supported the group boundaries of the traditional antigenic classification phylogenetic methods have also enabled the classification of sars-related coronavirus sarsr-cov as a subgroup of group 2 group 2b coronavirus as well as the discovery of group 2c 2d 3b and 3c coronaviruses 13 recently the coronavirus study group of the international committee for taxonomy of viruses has proposed three genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus to replace these three traditional groups of coronaviruses 4the first complete genome of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus mhv was sequenced more than 50 years after it was isolated before the sars epidemic in 2003 there were less than 10 coronaviruses with complete genome sequences available these include two human coronaviruses hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 four other mammalian coronaviruses mhv bovine coronavirus bcov transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv and one avian coronavirus ibv the sars epidemic that originated from southern china in 2003 has boosted interest in all areas of coronavirus research most notably coronavirus biodiversity and genomics 57 after the sars epidemic up to april 2010 15 novel coronaviruses were discovered with their complete genomes sequenced among these 15 previously unrecognized coronaviruses were two globally distributed human coronaviruses human coronavirus nl63 hcov-nl63 and human coronavirus hku1 hcov-hku1 810 10 other mammalian coronaviruses sars-related rhinolophus bat coronavirus sarsr-rh-batcov rhinolophus bat coronavirus hku2 rh-batcov hku2 tylonycteris bat coronavirus hku4 ty-batcov hku4 pipistrellus bat coronavirus hku5 pi-batcov hku5 miniopterus bat coronavirus hku8 mi-batcov hku8 rousettus bat coronavirus hku9 ro-batcov hku9 scotophilus bat coronavirus 512 sc-batcov 512 miniopterus bat coronavirus 1ab mi-batcov 1ab equine coronavirus ecov and beluga whale coronavirus sw1 361115 and three avian coronaviruses bulbul coronavirus hku11 bucov hku11 thrush coronavirus hku12 thcov hku12 and munia coronavirus hku13 muncov hku13 2 most of these genomes were sequenced using the rna extracted directly from the clinical specimens such as nasopharyngeal aspirate or stool as the template while the viruses themselves were still non-cultivable 2361115 this provided more accurate analysis of the in situ viral genomes avoiding mutational bias during in vitro viral replication these sequence efforts have resulted in a marked increase in the number of coronavirus genomes and have given us an unprecedented opportunity to understand this family of virus at the genomic and in silico levels these understandings have also led to generation of further hypotheses and experiments in the laboratory in this article we reviewed our current understanding on the genomics and bioinformatics analysis of coronaviruses details of the bioinformatics tools will not be discussedorf1ab of coronaviruses occupy about two thirds of their genomes it encodes the replicase polyprotein and is translated from orf1a 11826 to 13425 nt and orf1b 7983 to 8157 nt in all coronaviruses a slippery sequence uuuaaac followed by sequences that form a putative pseudoknot structure are present at the junction between orf1a and orf1b translation occurs by a -1 rna-mediated ribosomal frameshift at the end of the slippery sequence instead of reading the transcript as uuuaaacggg it will be read as uuuaaaccggg the replicase polyprotein is cleaved by papain-like proteases plpro and 3c-like protease 3clpro proteins encoded by orf1ab of the coronavirus genome at consensus cleavage sites into 15 to 16 non-structural proteins nsps named nsp1 nsp2 nsp3 etc table 1 as the number of coronavirus genomes is expanding novel cleavage sites have been discovered 318 some of these non-structural proteins encode proteins of essential functions such as plpro nsp3 3clpro nsp5 rna-dependent rna polymerase pol nsp12 and helicase nsp13 figure 1 the genomes of all known members of alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus subgroup a possess two plpro pl1pro and pl2pro while those of all known members of betacoronavirus subgroup b c and d and gammacoronavirus possess only one plpro table 1 figure 1 the gene sequences that encode these conserved proteins are frequently used for phylogenetic analysisin addition to the nsps with essential functions bioinformatics analysis of some other nsps revealed their putative functions downstream to plpro or pl1pro in nsp3 is the x domain which contains putative adp-ribose 1-phosphatase adrp

processing 19 adp-ribose 12-cyclic phosphate apprp is produced as a result of trna splicing apprp is in turn converted to adp-ribose 1-phosphate appr-1p by cpdase and appr-p is then further processed by adrp as for nsp13 nsp14 and nsp15 they possess a putative 3-to-5 exonuclease exon domain of the dedd superfamily 1 a putative polyu-specific endoribonuclease xendou domain and a putative s-adenosylmethionine-dependent ribose 2-o-methyltransferase 2-o-mt domain of the rrmj family respectively 1 adrp cpdase exon xendou and 2-o-mt are enzymes in rna processing pathways contrary to the pre-trna splicing pathway that adrp and cpdase belong to exon xendou and 2-o-mt are enzymes in a small nucleolar rna processing and utilization pathwayin all members of betacoronavirus subgroup a a haemagglutinin esterase he gene which encodes a glycoprotein with neuraminate o-acetyl-esterase activity and the active site fgds is present downstream to orf1ab and upstream to s gene figure 1 the he gene of coronavirus is believed to be acquired from influenza c virus and is the most notable example of acquisition of new genes from non-coronavirus rna donors by heterologous recombination 20 the presence of he genes exclusively in members of betacoronavirus subgroup a but not members of betacoronavirus subgroup b c and d suggested that the recombination had probably occurred in the ancestor of members of betacoronavirus subgroup a after diverging from the ancestor of other subgroups of betacoronavirusthe s proteins are responsible for the spikes present on the surface of coronaviruses and give this family of virus the characteristic crown-like appearance under electron microscopy the s proteins are type i membrane glycoproteins with signal peptides the s proteins are used for receptor binding and viral entry and are the proteins with the most variable sequences in the coronavirus genomes in some coronaviruses the s proteins are cleaved into the s1 and s2 domains at consensus cleavage site rrsrr of bcov rrsr of hcov-oc43 rrkrr of hcov-hku1 rsrr of phev rradr of mhv rrfrr of sdav and rrfrr of ibv table 1 with the sequences of the s1 domains much more variable than the s2 domains in all coronaviruses most of the s protein is exposed on the outside of the virus with a short transmembrane domain at the c terminus followed by a short cytoplasmic tail rich in cysteine residues two heptad repeats are present at the c termini of the extracellular parts of the s proteins at the moment no bioinformatics tool is available for accurate prediction of the receptor by analyzing the amino acid sequences of the s proteins of the corresponding coronavirusesthe e and m proteins are small transmembrane proteins associated with the envelope of all coronaviruses in some coronaviruses such as mhv and sdav and possibly hcov-hku1 the translation of the e protein is cap-independent via an internal ribosomal entry site although these two genes are conserved among all coronaviruses they are not good targets for phylogenetic studies because of their short sequencessimilar to the conserved proteins encoded by orf1ab the n gene is also another common target for phylogenetic analysis due to its immunogenicity it is also a common target for cloning and generation of recombinant proteins for serological assaysvariable numbers of small orfs are present between the various conserved genes in different lineages in the coronaviridae family table 1 figure 1 in some coronaviruses small orfs are present downstream to the n gene table 1 figure 1 most of these small orfs are of unknown function one exception is the small orfs downstream to n in feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv and tgev which are important for virulence and viral replicationassembly respectively 2123 another notable exception is the 3a protein of sarsr-cov which forms a transmembrane homotetramer complex with ion channel function and modulates virus release 24 for some of these small orfs such as orf3a and orf8 of sarsr-cov genomes their sequences are as highly variable as those of the s proteins in particular the most significant difference between human sarsr-cov and civet sarsr-cov genomes was a 29-bp deletion in the orf8 of human sarsr-cov 25the first impression of the phylogenetic position of a strain or species of coronavirus is usually acquired by constructing a phylogenetic tree using a short fragment of a conserved gene such as pol or n however this can sometimes be misleading because the results of phylogenetic analysis using different genes or characters can be different when sarsr-cov was first discovered it was proposed that it constituted a fourth group of coronavirus 2627 however analyses of the amino-terminal domain of s of sarsr-cov revealed that 19 out of the 20 cysteine residues were spatially conserved with those of the consensus sequence for betacoronavirus 28 on the other hand only five of the cysteine residues were spatially conserved with those of the consensus sequences in alphacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus 28 furthermore subsequent phylogenetic analysis using both complete genome sequence and proteomic approaches it was concluded that sarsr-cov is probably an early split-off from the betacoronavirus lineage 1 and sarsr-cov was subsequently classified as betacoronavirus subgroup b and the historical betacoronavirus as betacoronavirus subgroup a therefore the phylogenetic position of a coronavirus is best appreciated and confirmed by constructing phylogenetic trees using different genes in the coronavirus genome the most commonly used genes along the coronavirus genome for phylogenetic studies include chymotrypsin-like protease pol figure 2 helicase s and n because these genes are present in all coronavirus genomes and are of significant length the envelope and membrane genes although present in all coronavirus genomes are too short for phylogenetic studies it is noteworthy that the cluster formed by the three novel avian coronaviruses bucov hku11 thcov hku12 and muncov hku13 which was originated proposed as group 3c 2 might represent a new coronavirus genus provisionally designated deltacoronavirus figure 2using this approach of multiple gene phylogenetic studies unique phylogeny of individual gene that may have biological significance may be discovered during our phylogenetic study on rh-batcov hku2 another coronavirus that has was also found in the stool samples of chinese horseshoe bats its unique s protein phylogenetically distinct from the rest of the genome was discovered 15 the s protein of rh-batcov hku2 is the shortest among s proteins of all coronaviruses and had less than 30 amino acid identities to those of all known coronaviruses in contrast to other genes that showed higher amino acid identities to the corresponding genes in other members of alphacoronavirus when the s protein of rh-batcov hku2 is aligned with those of other members of alphacoronavirus many of the amino acid residues conserved among and specific to alphacoronavirus were not found rather the s protein of rh-batcov hku2 shares the two conserved regions of deletions both of 14 amino acids among members of betacoronavirus in its c-terminus suggesting that this segment of the s protein of rh-batcov hku2 may have co-evolved with the corresponding regions in betacoronavirus most interestingly a short peptide of 15 amino acids in the s protein of rh-batcov hku2 was found to be homologous to a corresponding peptide within the rbm in the s1 domain of sarsr-cov a similar peptide was also observed in sarsr-rh-batcov but not in any other known coronaviruses these suggested that there is a common evolutionary origin in the s protein of sarsr-cov sarsr-rh-batcov and rh-batcov hku2 and rh-batcov hku2 might have acquired its unique s protein from a yet unidentified coronavirus through recombinationin 1992 sanchez et al analyzed 13 enteric and respiratory tgev related isolates and estimated the mutation rate of tgev to be 7104 nucleotide substitutions per site per year 29 1n 2005 using linear regression maximum likelihood and bayesian inference methods vijgen et al estimated the rate of evolution in bcov to be 43 95 confidence internal 27 to 60 104 nucleotide substitutions per site per year 30 the estimation of time of divergence was first extensively used in coronaviruses after the sars epidemic for estimating the date of interspecies jumping of sarsr-cov from civets to humans and that from bcov to hcov-oc43 3132 subsequently when various novel human and animal coronaviruses were discovered evolutionary rates and divergence time in the coronaviridae family were estimated by various groups using different approaches 313335 although bayesian inference in beast is probably the most widely accepted approach and was used by most researchers the use of different genes orf1ab helicase s and n genes and datasets by different groups have resulted in considerable difference in the estimated history of coronaviruses it was found that the s and n genes of phev bcov and hcov-oc43 evolved at different rates and the divergence time of the phev lineage and the hcov-oc43 and bcov lineage based on these two rates were 100 years different 31 one group using the helicase gene for analysis has estimated the life history of coronaviruses to be as short as about 420 years 35recently we used the uncorrelated exponentially distributed relaxed clock model uced in beast version 14 36 to estimate the time of divergence of sarsr-cov based on an alignment of a large set of sarsr-rh-batcov orf1 sequences collected over a period of five years under this model the rates were allowed to vary at each branch drawn independently from an exponential distribution using this model and large dataset the time of emergence of sarsr-cov was at 1972 about 31 years before the sars epidemic that of sarsr-cov in civet was at 1995 about eight years before the sars epidemic and the most recent common ancestor date of human and civet sarsr-cov was estimated to be 200136 which was comparable to the dates estimated by other groups table 2 37as a result of their unique random template switching during rna replication thought to be mediated by a copy-choice mechanism coronaviruses have a high frequency of homologous rna recombination 4142 recombination in coronaviruses was first recognized between different strains of mhv and subsequently in other coronaviruses such as ibv between mhv and bcov and between feline coronavirus fcov type i and canine coronavirus ccov 4346 as shown below such recombination can result in the generation of coronavirus species or different genotypes within a coronavirus species in our experience the possibility of homologous rna recombination and the possible part of the genome that recombination has taken place are usually first appreciated using bootscan analysis or phylogenetic analysis using different parts of the coronavirus genome other methods for recombination analysis such as those in the rdp3 package are also available then the exact site of homologous rna recombination would be best revealed by multiple sequence alignmentthe best documented example of generation of coronavirus species through homologous rna recombination is the generation of fcov type ii by double recombination between fcov type i and ccov it was first observed that the sequence of the s protein in fcov type ii was closely related to that of ccov 4748 but the sequence downstream of the e gene in fcov type ii was more closely related to that of fcov type i strain than to ccov 4950 this observation suggested that there might have been a homologous rna recombination event between the genomes of ccov and fcov type i resulting in the generation of fcov type ii further analysis by multiple sequence alignments pinpointed the site of recombination to a region in the e gene a few years later an additional recombination region in the pol gene was also discovered and it was concluded that fcov type ii originated from two recombination events between the genomes of ccov and fcov type i 43as for the generation of different genotypes in a coronavirus species through homologous rna recombination the best documented example is hcov-hku1 the possibility of homologous rna recombination was first suspected when a few strains of hcov-hku1 showed differential clustering when the pol s and n genes were used for phylogenetic tree construction 51 this observation has led to our subsequent study on complete genome sequencing of 22 strains of hcov-hku1 recombination analysis by bootscan analysis and phylogenetic analysis using different parts of the 22 complete genomes revealed extensive recombination in different parts of the genomes resulting in the generation of three genotypes a b and c of hcov-hku1 52 using multiple sequence alignment two sites of recombination were pinpointed the first one was observed in a stretch of 143 nucleotides near the 3 end of nsp6 where recombination between hcov-hku1 genotype b and genotype c has generated genotype a and the second one in another stretch of 29 nucleotides near the 3 end of nsp16 where recombination between hcov-hku1 genotype a and genotype b has generated genotype c 52recently using the complete genome sequences of the 19 coronavirus genomes we analyzed the codon usage bias in coronaviruses as well as selection of cpg suppressed clones by the immune system and cytosine deamination being the two major independent biochemical and biological selective forces that has shaped such codon usage bias 53 in the study we showed that the mean cpg relative abundance in the coronavirus genomes is markedly suppressed 53 however we observed that only cpg containing codons in the context of purine-cpg acg and gcg pyrimidine-cpg ucg and ccg and cpg-purine cga and cgg but not cpg-pyrimidine cgu and cgc are suppressed however when trinucleotide frequencies were analyzed in the 19 coronavirus genomes all the eight trinucleotides with cpg were suppressed 53 these indicate that another force that has led to an increase use of cgu and cgc as codons for arginine but does not act on trinucleotides over the whole genome in general is probably present furthermore this force is probably unrelated to the relative abundance of the corresponding trna molecules in the hosts of the coronaviruses as the pattern of bias in the hosts is not the same as that in the coronavirusesin addition to cpg suppression marked cytosine deamination is also observed in all the 19 coronavirus genomes 53 using the six amino acids that are only encoded by nnc or nnu asparagine histidine aspartic acid tyrosine cysteine and phenylalanine hence excluding most other pressures that may affect the relative abundance of cytosine and uracil it was observed that all nnu are markedly over represented with usage fractions of more than 0700 whereas the usage fractions of all nnc are less than 0300 53 for all codons that encode the same amino acid and with either u or c in any position the usage fraction of the codon that uses u is always higher than the one that uses c in all coronaviruses furthermore the percentage of u showed strong inverse relationships with the percentage of c in the coronavirus genomes these suggest that cytosine deamination is another important biochemical force that shaped coronavirus evolutioninterestingly among all the 19 coronaviruses hcov-hku1 showed the most extreme codon usage bias hcov-hku1 is the only coronavirus that had effective number of codons outside the mean  2 standard deviations range in addition hcov-hku1 also possessed the lowest g  c content highest gc skew lowest percentages of g and c and highest percentage of u among all coronavirus genomes furthermore hcov-hku1 showed extremely high nnunnc ratio of 8835 the underlying mechanism for the extreme codon usage bias cytosine deamination and g  c content in hcov-hku1 is intriguingrapid and accurate batch sequence retrieval is always the cornerstone and bottleneck for all kinds of comparative genomics and bioinformatics analysis during the process of batch sequence retrieval for comparative genomics and other bioinformatics analysis of the coronavirus genomes that we have sequenced we encountered a number of major problems about the coronavirus sequences in genbank and other coronavirus databases first in genbank the non-structural proteins encoded by orf1ab are not annotated second in all databases the annotations for the non-structural proteins encoded by orfs downstream to orf1ab are often confusing because they are not annotated using a standardized system third multiple accession numbers are often present for reference sequences these problems will often lead to confusion during sequence retrieval fourth coronaviruses especially sarsr-cov amplified from different specimens may contain the same gene or genome sequences which will lead to redundant work when they are analyzed in view of these problems we have developed a comprehensive database covdb of annotated coronavirus genes and genomes which offers rapid efficient and user-friendly batch sequence retrieval and analysis 54 in covdb first annotations on all non-structural proteins in the polyprotein encoded by orf1ab of every single sequence were performed second annotation was performed for the non-structural proteins encoded by orfs downstream to orf1ab using a standardized system third all sequences with identical nucleotide sequences were labeled and one can choose to show or not to show strains with identical sequences fourth this database contains not only complete coronavirus genome sequences but also incomplete genomes and their genes this is useful because some genes of coronaviruses such as pol s and n are sequenced much more frequently than others because they are either most conserved or least conserved and therefore are particularly important for primers design for rt-pcr assays and evolutionary studiesafter the sars epidemic there has been a marked increase in the number of coronaviruses discovered and coronavirus genomes being sequenced this increase in the number of coronavirus species and genomes a comprehensive and user-friendly database for efficient sequence retrieval and the ever improving bioinformatics tools have enabled us to perform meaningful genomic phylogenetic evolutionary rate and divergence recombination and other bioinformatics analyses on the coronaviridae family three genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus have been used to replace the traditional group 1 2 and 3 coronaviruses a fourth genus deltacoronavirus which includes bucov hku11 thcov hku12 and muncov hku13 is likely to emerge under this new classification system bat coronaviruses dominate the alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus genera and bird coronaviruses dominate the gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus genera this huge diversity of coronaviruses in bats and birds has made them excellent gene pools for coronaviruses in these four genera 55in late 2019 the first clusters of people with severe respiratory infections and pneumonia were reported in the hubei province of china13 the novel betacoronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has since emerged as the cause of an unprecedented worldwide healthcare crisis with more than 7 million confirmed cases worldwide and more than 400000 attributable deaths during the first six months of 202045 the spread of the novel coronavirus disease covid-19 has proceeded at different rates across the globe but ongoing community transmission is widespreadin the united states us the first confirmed case of covid-19 was reported on january 20th in washington state with a second confirmed case reported shortly thereafter in chicago illinois on january 23rd both cases were linked with recent travel to china6 the chicago patient later passed the virus to her husband in the first reported case of local transmission on january 30th6 the state of new york reported its first case on march 1st and rapidly developed into a hotspot by the end of march the us had confirmed cases in all 50 states and reported the most cases of any country in the world stay-at-home orders went into effect in an attempt to mitigate virus spread in illinois new york and washington on march 21st 22nd and 23rd respectivelybased on publicly available data prevalence and mortality rates differ on a state-by-state basis as of april 27th 2020 new york 282143 cases 58 mortality washington state 13319 cases 55 mortality illinois 41777 cases 45 mortality supplemental figure 178 these differences can be attributed to a multitude of factors including geography population density demographics the timing and extent of community mitigation measures testing availability healthcare infrastructure and public health reporting practices9 whether variability in viral genotype may also contribute to these observed differences in transmission and disease burden remains unknownin parallel with the unprecedented speed and scale of the pandemic the sharing and integration of clinical and epidemiological data has also occurred at an exceptional pace with over 40000 viral genome sequences of sars-cov-2 from across the globe currently available via online databases such as gisaid10 rapid whole-genome sequencing wgs of emerging viruses allows for informed development of molecular diagnostic assays as well as tracing of patterns of spread across multiple epidemiological scales11 understanding the molecular epidemiology of the virus through evolutionary models and phylogenetic analysis can further aid in estimating the genetic variability and evolutionary rate which can have significant implications for disease progression as well as drug and vaccine developmentwhile extensive wgs has been reported in washington state and new york there are relatively few sequences available from illinois here we present a phylogenetic analysis of 88 sars-cov-2 viruses from the airways of covid-19 patients seeking care in a single healthcare system in chicago illinois from march 14 2020 through march 21 2020 we further assessed these viral genomic data for correlations with clinical and demographic features of our cohortindividuals suspected of covid-19 within two hospitals of the northwestern medicine healthcare system were screened for sars-cov-2 infection as per the cdc protocol12 samples were collected between march 14 2020 through march 21 2020 participants included individuals presenting to emergency departments at northwestern memorial hospital nmh or lake forest hospital lfh patients admitted to the hospital at nmh and outpatient or corporate health clinic patients nasopharyngeal swab andor bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens were collected from screened individuals and stored in either phosphate-buffered saline pbs or viral transport medium viral rna was extracted from clinical specimens utilizing the qiaamp viral rna minikit qiagen clinical testing for sars-cov-2 presence was performed by quantitative reverse transcription and pcr qrt-pcr with the cdc 2019-ncov rt-pcr diagnostic panel utilizing n1 and n2 probes as previously described12 all specimens with a cycle threshold ct less than or equal to 35 were considered positive and

study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit this work for publicationbetween march 14 and march 21 2020 a total of 127 qrt-pcr clinical tests performed at nmh were positive for sars-cov-2 supplemental figure 2a residual rna from these diagnostic tests was collected for wgs of these 37 specimens failed to achieve sufficient amplification required for sequencing or had inadequate read coverage after sequencing almost half of the 90 successfully sequenced specimens had been collected from patients evaluated in emergency departments at nmh or lfh 25 from non-icu hospitalized patients at nmh and 12 from patients in the nmh icu supplemental figure 2b two sequenced specimens were found to be redundant and were excluded from further analysis leaving 88 sequenced specimens from 88 individuals the qrt-pcr cycle threshold ct values of these specimens ranged from 1452 to 3237 after applying alignment quality filters and normalizing segment coverage to a maximum of 200 reads in each direction the average median genome coverage across non-overlapping amplicon sequences was 348 reads per specimen min 56 max 395we first performed a maximum likelihood ml phylogenetic analysis of the 88 sars-cov-2 specimen genomes in this study supplemental methods this analysis showed that most of the sequences 93 clustered in three main clades support 85 alrt and 85 ufboot figure 1a for the purposes of this report we will refer to these clades ordered by relative abundance in the sequence set as clades 1 n51 579 2 n24 273 and 3 n7 79 using the pangolin software method of lineage classification1819 isolates in clade 1 were assigned mainly to lineage b1 92 assigned to lineage b1 2 to b11 and 6 to b15 the majority of isolates in clade 2 belonged to lineage a3 92 to a3 8 to a and isolates in clade 3 belonged mainly to lineage a1 86 to a1 14 to a supplemental table 1 the intra- and inter-clade variability of the sequences showed a mean intra-group variability of 116104 base differences per site sem 316105 versus a mean inter-group variability of 480 104 base differences per site sem 117104 confirming the higher within-clade sequence similarity in the observed phylogenetic clusteringto place the three observed clades in a broader geographic context we expanded our analysis to include 901 sars-cov-2 sequences from the us deposited in gisaid as of april 4 2020 with the complete us dataset we performed ml phylogenetic reconstruction of the sequences generated a temporal phylogeny and reconstructed the ancestral states of the tree to identify clade-defining mutations figure 1b and possible geographical transitions these analyses confirmed our previous clustering with a bulk of the chicago sequences falling into three distinct clades figure 2a overall the local epidemic in the chicago area was broadly reflective of the epidemic in the us as a whole clade 1 viruses clustered predominantly with those from new york while clade 3 viruses clustered with those circulating on the west coast particularly in washington state these two clades showed a broader spread across the us than clade 2 which was comprised almost exclusively of our newly sequenced specimens in illinois with only a few representatives from elsewhere in the us figure 2a supplemental figure 3 clade 2 also contained a few previously sequenced sars-cov-2 specimens identified in illinois at the end of january 20206we next studied the phylodynamic and phylogenomic characteristics of these three clades using a bayesian approach to infer possible differences in their population dynamics these analyses suggested very limited spread of clade 2 with an average proportion of branches residing in illinois of 081 95 ci 066088 supplemental figure 3b illinois was found to be the most probable origin of clade 2 in the us with an estimated most recent common ancestor tmrca around january 18 2020 95 highest posterior density hpd interval january 9  january 21 2020 the timing location and the sequences close to the inferred root of this tree usail1 and usail2 coincide with the first reported covid-19 cases in illinois6 though alternate early introductions cannot be ruled out these results suggest that clade 2 was introduced to the chicago area early in the us epidemic with limited spread beyond illinois figure 2b middle panela similar analysis of clade 1 suggested multiple introductions a high degree of diversity and the existence of several probable sub-clades although the highest proportion of branches were found to reside in new york this proportion was relatively low at 034 95 ci 031037 in agreement with the broad geographic spread of this clade supplemental figure 3a these findings are most consistent with clade 1 being centered in new york but rapidly expanding throughout the region and to many other locations across the us figure 2b bottom panel the tmrca of this clade in the us was calculated to be february 10 2020 95 hpd interval january 28  february 20 2020 an estimated date in close alignment with prior reports20 these results are suggestive of this clade having had multiple introductions into the chicago area with some occurring early during the epidemic in february and march of 2020finally us isolates in clade 3 are estimated to have originated in washington state and remained centered there throughout the investigated time course proportion of branches residing in washington of 083 95 ci 081085 supplemental figure 3c this clade was also estimated to have been introduced into the us early in the epidemic tmrca  january 16 2020 95 hpd interval january 11  january 17 2020 though we cannot rule out the possibility that this clade was independently introduced on more than one occasion21 these data are most consistent with subsequent expansion of clade 3 from washington state to multiple locations throughout the us including illinois followed by limited spread elsewhere figure 2b top paneloverall our results suggest that as of mid-march 2020 three main clades of sars-cov-2 were circulating in the chicago area clade 2 appears to have been introduced in illinois early in the epidemic and seems to have undergone more limited spread when compared to clade 1 centered in new york and clade 3 centered in washingtonto further investigate the origin and population dynamics of the clade 2 we performed a phylogenetic analysis at the global level we included an additional 3099 sars-cov-2 sequences deposited in gisaid from outside the us up through april 4 2020 we conducted similar ml analyses as those performed on the us sequences above supplemental figure 4 these results further confirmed strong statistical support for clade 2 916 alrt and 92 ufboot again the detected spread of this clade has been exceptionally limited with a majority of sequences derived from this study china or australia ancestral reconstruction of these global sequences showed low divergence of these samples from those first sequenced in wuhan china figure 3ato better discern the most likely origin of clade 2 we performed a phylogeographical analysis using all available clade 2 sequences and related global sequences as suggested above these results determined the most likely origin of this clade to be china at our current state of global sampling figure 3b clade 2-like sequences from other areas outside the us most likely represent introductions of similar viruses into those areas rather than secondary seeding from illinois one exception to this is a cluster of sequences in australia that appear to be more closely related to those in illinois than china figure 3b together these findings are most consistent with an introduction of clade 2 into illinois from china in january 2020 additionally global analysis with the other two clades supplemental figure 4 suggest that the new york-centered clade 1 was likely to have been introduced into the us from europe while the washington-centered clade 3 was most likely introduced directly from china consistent with other reports21together these analyses show distinct global phylodynamics of the three main clades observed in the chicago area clade 1 was introduced by way of new york through europe clade 2 was introduced directly from china and clade 3 was introduced through washington state from china while clade 1 is well-represented on the east coast and clade 3 is well-represented on the west coast to date clade 2 is almost exclusively found in the chicago areathe limited spread of clade 2 sars-cov-2 viruses both in the us and worldwide could suggest phenotypic variability that may impact transmission rate to further investigate this we compared the ct values for each sample which serves as a proxy for viral load in the patients upper airways at the time of diagnosis we grouped the viruses according to their assigned clade creating an additional group for the viruses that did not fall into any of the three major clades we fit a linear model to test for differences in ct values between the clades controlling for the date of isolation hospital location age sex race severity of illness and specimen collection source supplemental table 2 we detected significantly higher ct values corresponding to lower viral loads in clade 2 chicago-centered compared to clade 1 new york-centered q0008 and clade 3 washington-centered q0027 figure 4a due to the limited sample sizes for clade 3 n  7 and ungrouped specimens n  6 our subsequent analyses focus solely on clades 1 n  51 and 2 n  24next we tested whether the source of the sample nasopharyngeal swab np vs bronchoalveolar lavage fluid bal influenced the viral load as measured by the ct value andor could account for the differences between clades 1 and 2 we tested for differences between sample source clade and both accounting for their potential interaction in the linear model we found a significant difference between np and bal samples q 00484 with lower ct values in the bal specimens supplemental figure 5a when considering only np samples the ct values of clade 1 viruses were still significantly lower than clade 2 viruses as observed previously q00062 however no significant difference in ct value was detected by clade in the bal samples while the numbers of bal samples are low this result suggests that the viral load differences between the two clades are primarily observed in the upper airways of infected patientsit has been reported that viral loads in the upper airways generally decrease over the course of infection2223 to determine whether the difference in average ct values between samples from patients infected with clade 1 or clade 2 viruses corresponded with the time of specimen collection the number of days between reported symptom onset and specimen collection was determined for each patient from available case files no significant difference in time from symptom onset to specimen collection between patients infected with clade 1 or clade 2 viruses was observed supplemental figure 5b additionally the date of possible virus exposure was able to be determined for 29 patients and again no significant difference was found between clades supplemental figure 5c consistent with prior reports we did find that later dates of specimen collection after symptom onset significantly correlated with higher ct values among patients infected with clade 1 viruses though this same trend was not observed among patients infected with clade 2 viruses supplemental figure 5d these results suggest that the average viral load in the upper airways of patients infected with clade 2 viruses is lower relative to those infected with clade 1 viruses at the time of diagnosis independent of time since symptom onsetgiven early reports that covid-19 disease severity is correlated with sars-cov-2 viral load2425 we next looked for associations between viral clades 1 and 2 and maximal disease severity disease severity was binned as mild outpatient or ed only moderate inpatient hospitalization or severe icu admission andor death and set as the outcome variable we then fit a logistic regression model including all available demographic and clinical variables interestingly we found no significant association between any available variable and disease severity in our dataset including clade figure 4b we finally fit a logistic regression model including all available demographic and clinical variables with clade as the outcome variable supplemental table 3 consistent with our previous results ct value was the only variable associated with viral clade and vice versa these data suggest that ct value in the upper airway at the time of diagnosis may not be associated with disease severity though it is associated with the viral cladein this study we report the phylogenetic and phylodynamic analyses of 88 sars-cov-2 genomes from covid-19 patients in chicago illinois us which largely fall into three major clades two of these three clades are broadly representative of the major circulating clades that expanded and disseminated rapidly across the us through early april 2020 with points of origin in new york clade 1 and washington state clade 3 in addition we identified a third major clade clade 2 that is relatively unique in the us and predominantly found in the chicago area based on current sampling viruses in this clade lack the rapid and wide dispersion evidenced with the other viral clades notably patients infected with clade 1 viruses presented with significantly higher viral loads in the upper airways at the time of diagnosis compared to patients infected with clade 2 viruses these data suggest that differences in sars-cov-2 genotype may impact viral load which in turn may influence transmission and overall viral spreadchicago illinois is the third-largest city in the us and is located centrally in the country with direct flights to all continents except antarctica despite recording the second confirmed case of covid-19 and the first confirmed case of person-to-person transmission in the us relatively little sars-cov-2 sequencing data has been reported from the chicago area with only 11 sequences available on gisaid as of may 11 2020 the data presented here add an additional 88 sequences to this collection and constitute the first systematic analysis of sars-cov-2 whole genome sequences from covid-19 patients in the chicago areaphylogenetic analyses of these sequences demonstrate that the major clades circulating in chicago in mid-march 2020 represent separate introduction events that can be traced back to distinct sources although the chicago-centered clade 2 and the washington-centered clade 3 are phylogenetically related this analysis shows that they were the result of geographically and temporally separate introductions into the us from china our analysis suggests that clade 2 viruses were introduced into the chicago area from china and began community transmission around mid-january 2020 while clade 3 viruses are related they are more consistent with an independent introduction event through an intermediate in washington state we additionally find that that clade 1 viruses are most likely to have been introduced to chicago via new york through europe a model which is also supported by a recent pre-print report describing the european origin of sars-cov-2 in new york city20both the us and global sequence data suggest relatively little dispersion of clade 2 strains beyond illinois as of mid- to late-march 2020 indeed though the clade appears to have originated from china as early as mid-january 2020 there is little evidence to date of spread beyond a few likely cases in other midwest states and a secondary cluster in australia this is in contrast to clade 3 and especially clade 1 viruses which have spread over a larger geographic area in less time though a large number of isolates collected in the us and globally were available to this study through the gisaid collective under-sampling of some regions andor patient groups could have resulted in imprecise estimates of transmission patterns or potentially have missed a broader distribution of clade 2 specimens however the proportion of viruses sampled from chicago in this study that were clade 2 24 of 88 273 was far greater than the proportion in the database sampled across the us 10 of 901 11 or from non-us countries 34 of 3099 11 suggesting that clade 2 was more abundant in the chicago area relative to other sampled locations as of late march 2020 as more genomes both from illinois and elsewhere are sequenced we will continue to assess for changes in the population structure and distribution of sars-cov-2notably we found that clade 2 viruses had significantly lower viral loads in patient upper airways relative to clade 1 viruses at the time of diagnosis this is among the first reports of sars-cov-2 phylogenetic lineage correlating with phenotypic differences clade 1 viruses are defined by nonsynonymous mutations in the rna-dependent rna polymerase nsp12 p322l and spike s d614g proteins other studies have likewise linked the spike d614g mutation to a broader global spread and to higher viral loads2627 similarly other reports have noted the rapid spread of the nsp12 p322l mutation28 our study was not designed to determine causal relationships between mutations and phenotypes and it is possible that the virus is adapting multiple independent changes that aid in its propagation lower viral loads in the upper airways of infected patients may decrease viral transmissibility and impact the overall spread but further laboratory and clinical studies will be required to test the impact of these variants on viral replication disease severity and transmissibilityother than the potential for lower viral loads there are other factors that could account for the muted spread of clade 2 viruses outside the chicago region first the state of illinois instituted a relatively rapid and stringent lockdown by implementing restrictions on mass gatherings on march 13th closing schools on march 17th and issuing stay-at-home orders on march 21st while these restrictions went into place concurrent with sample gathering for this study they may have contributed to a slower spread of clade 2 viruses outside the state second the virus may be more prevalent among members of a relatively more insular community within the state with comparatively less travel or socialization with non-community members third these viruses may be found to have distinct clinical manifestations that lessen the opportunity for asymptomatic transmission to multiple other individuals ongoing studies of clinical and demographic patient data associated with ongoing specimen collection may provide support for these or other scenariosthe other clinical and demographic data we examined including disease severity did not correlate significantly with clade or ct value previous reports suggested that disease severity may be correlated with viral load as measured by ct value during disease but our data suggest the same may not hold true for ct values collected at diagnosis29 although patients in the icu had lower ct values than patients in other locations supporting a link between viral load and severity most icu samples were bal specimens not np specimens this correlation may therefore simply be reflective of different ct values in the lower vs upper airways finally we did observe a correlation between ct value and the time since symptom onset confirming previous reports2223 though this did not change significantly by clade and did not explain the higher ct values of clade 2 viruses further studies with more specimens and associated clinical data will be needed to elucidate these relationshipsas the specimens in this study were collected over the first 8 days during which testing was broadly available at our institution the phylogenetic patterns and abundances observed represent a cross-sectional snapshot of our region longitudinal evaluations could reveal more detailed clade dynamics and population structure additionally these specimens were collected from one healthcare system primarily serving patients from the north and west sides of chicago potentially limiting generalizability to other regions in and around chicago or other parts of illinois nevertheless these data suggest chicago is an ideal location for observational and interventional studies to capture the breadth of sars-cov-2 genetic diversity this ability to compare diverse viral genotypes in a single hospital setting allowed us to identify clade-specific differences in viral load at the time of diagnosis which may in turn have consequences for transmissibilitysevere acute respiratory syndrome sars is a new infectious disease reported first in the autumn of 2002 and diagnosed for the first time in march 2003 1 it is still a serious threat to human health and sars coronavirus cov has been associated with the pathogenesis of sars according to kochs postulate 2significant research efforts have been made into investigation of the sars-cov genome sequence aimed at establishing its origin and evolution to help eventually in preventing or curing the disease it causes although the task is a hard one it opens up the opportunity amongst others for comparative investigation of different sars-cov isolates aimed at identification of genome regions properties expressing different levels of sequence polymorphism 3-8the genome of sars-cov consists of a single positive rna strand approximately 30 kb in length consisting of about 10 open reading frames orf and about 10 intergenic regions igrs the first two overlapping orfs at the 5 end encompass two-thirds of the genome while the rest of the orfs at the 3 end account for the remaining thirdwe investigated 38 isolates of the sars-cov complete genome two pairs of which were identical sequenced and published by october 31st 2003 with updated revisions up to february 20th 2004 sequences were taken from the pubmed ncbi entrez site 9 in gbk and fasta formats table 1 the main goal was twofold first to analyze and compare nucleotide sequences to identify snps positions insertions and deletions and second to group them according to sequence similarity eventually pointing to phylogeny of sars-cov isolatesaccording to the length of isolates insertions and deletions and the presence of snps we classified them into three main groups with subgroups regular isolates with no insertions or deletions with different numbers of snps isolates with long insertions and isolates with many individual insertions and deletions with different positions of snps which is close to phylogenetic analysis resultsall the sequences are between 29573 and 29757 in length table 1 with a high degree of similarity 99 pairwise still they can be differentiated on the basis of sequence polymorphism insertions and deletions number and sites of snps 8 results of the comparison of genome primary structure of the analyzed isolates are given in figure 1analysis of genomic polymorphism of the isolates resulted in the following factsi some of the isolates are nucleotide-identical or almost identical there are two pairs of nucleotide-identical isolate sequences twh twc2 and tor2 with accession numbers ay274119 nc004718 therefore instead of 38 we consider the dataset to contain 36 isolates further the isolate twc3 differs in just one position with twh see table in additional file 1 which is about randomly expected 11 isolates frankfurt 1 and fra are identical up to the poly-a of length 13 present at the 3 end of fra figure 1ii similarity analysis showed that a significant number of isolates have the same length 29727 bases the same beginning and ending subsequences that seem to be exact starts and ends of the complete sars-cov genome up to the poly-a at the 3 end thus forming a kind of referent group these are the isolates twh twc3 twk tws twy urbani frankfurt 1 figure 1 the fully sequenced isolate twh then has been chosen as the referent isolate for sequence comparisons since its average number of snps compared to other isolates is the smallest for example twh and urbani have an average number of snps 157 and 176 respectively for all the isolates and 57 and 105 respectively for the referent group for snps see the tables in the additional files 1 and 2iii most isolates compared to twh are shorter at the 5end eg sin2500 sin2679 sin2774 sin2677 sin2748 as have various length poly-a strings at the 3 end eg tor2 hsr1 fra bj02 tw1 hku-39489 whu or both bj01 bj03 bj04 cuhk-w1 cuhk-su10 three of the isolates taiwan tc1 taiwan tc2 taiwan tc3 have both starting and ending deletions at the 5 end 69 at the 3 end 85 nucleotides several isolates eg twj twc sin2677 sin2748 have some short deletions inside the sequence figure 1iv there is a group of isolates that have significant length insertions 29 nucleotides inside the sequence these are the isolates gd01 sz3 sz16 a significant number of individual insertions have been identified in zj01 and zmy 1 isolates figure 1 additional files 345among the snp contents of isolates there is a significant difference in the number of snps for different pairs of isolates for twh as the referent isolate this number varies from 1 to 80 snps isolates may be classified into three groups based on the number of snps with twh figure 21 with less than 15 twc3 twk tws twy urbani twj twc tw1 tor2 hsr1 cuhk-su10 as sin2500 sin2679 sin2774 sin2677 sin2748 taiwan tc1 taiwan tc2 taiwan tc3 frankfurt1 fra hku-39849 cuhk-w12 between 15 and 30 whu gz50 bj01-bj04 zj013 with equal to or greater than 30 snps gd01 sz3 sz16 zmy 1finally besides the number there are differences in positions of snps potential mutation sites in order to avoid nucleotide changes that probably arose during propagation of the virus in cell culture and sequencing figure 3 represents positions on the relative scale of all isolates and on twh scale where two or more snps occurred not taking into consideration isolates with long insertions gd01 sz3 and sz16 the positions of multiple snps of these three isolates similar as far as these three are concerned are highly different from all the others and are represented in figure 4 these results coincide with those published in marra et als paper 4 for urbani and tor2 isolates but differ from those published in ruans paper 8 for the 14 isolates therein analyzed sin-group bj-group tor2 urbani cuhk-w1 hku-39849 gd01 which were obviously based on different revisions of the pubmed ncbi entrez database 9 lengths of the sequences tor2 cuhk-w1 gd01 bj01-bj04 differ from the revisions we analyzed and consequently in some nucleotides and the number of base changes at given positions differences include the following positions based upon urbani and twh sars-cov 2601 tor2 t instead of c bj04 t instead of missing base 7919 bj03 c instead of t 8559 bj04 t instead of a

567 represent density distribution of snps insertions and deletions on the twh scale for the same groups of isolates figure 8 represents the overall density distribution of snps insertions and deletions for all the 36 isolates along with the gene map for twh which is quite similar to gene maps of other isolates density distributions do not show regularities yet with respect to the number of available sequences that could provide for precise statistical characterization still they exhibit crowding regions close to the 3 end which is also characterized by the presence of a number of proteins of unknown functionit can also be noted that the proposed grouping of 36 isolates based on different criteria still conserves the previous classification t-t-t-t  c-g-c-c 8 all the isolates from groups a1 and c have t-t-t-t configuration while all the isolates from groups a2 and b have c-g-c-c configuration except for gz50 bj04 being tgcc figure 2 figure 9 the two sequence variants

hong kong cuhk-w1 sz3 and sz16 beijing bj01-bj04 the fact that the enlarged number of isolates exhibits the same properties relating to the four loci supports the assumption that the mutations could not have arisen by chance base substitution during propagation in cell culture and the sequencing procedure 8we analyzed amino acid changes in proteins for the annotated isolates 19 out of 36 and presumed proteins in non-annotated ones for multiple snps in all the isolates results of the analysis are represented in figures 3 and 4 figure 3 shows that silent mutations occurred in envelope protein e while nucleotide changes resulted in amino acid changes in spike s membrane m and nucleocapside n proteins all three snps in the spike protein are situated in the outer membrane region and not within the potential epitope region amino acid position 469882 as proposed by ren y et al 13 amino acid changes occurred in two multiple snps in m protein one multiple snps in n protein and 7 out of 13 multiple snps of the polyprotein 1ab as well as in one multiple snp of a hypothetical protein while the silent mutations occurred in three hypothetical proteins figure 3 also represents properties of the corresponding amino acids resulted by snps the only significant change in amino acid properties is in s protein glyasp a2 b groups ie in cuhk-w1 gz50 bj01-bj03 gd01 sz3 and sz16 isolates and hypothetical protein cysarg the same isolates bj04 in addition the only addition in non-annotated sequences is in hypothetical protein following s protein in twh exhibiting silent change and in non-annotated bj02 and bj03 corresponding to the hypothetical protein glyglu similar analysis can be done for amino acid changes corresponding to snps at positions specific for b group isolates figure 4 taking into account the only annotated isolate gd01 there are five amino acid changes in polyprotein 1ab two amino acid properties changes in s protein serleu and tyrasp the second being within the epitope region one amino acid change in m protein and one amino acid property change cisarg in bgi-pupthe sars-cov isolates have been multialigned using the clustalw program 10 as the very first step in obtaining a phylogenetic tree the aligned sequences have been submitted then to clustalw for bootstrapping and phylogenetic tree production enlargement of the sequence set resulted in the refinement of the phylogenetic tree produced as compared to previous results such as ruan 8 and zhangzheng 14 obtained for 14 and 16 isolates respectively the phylogenetic tree obtained drawn using the phylodraw program 15 is represented in figure 9 it is similar to our structural tree based on qualitative analysis of the isolates figure 2the results of the analysis of dissimilarities described in previous paragraphs are in accordance with the alignment obtained by clustalw but regrouped and formatted in a way that facilitates further interpretation and applicationcomparative analysis of genome sequence variations of 38 sars-cov isolates resulted in some conclusions that might be of interest in further investigation of the sars-cov genome1 all of the sars-cov isolates are highly homologous more than 99 pairwise most of them have similar nucleotide structure with the same 5 and 3 ends and poly-a at the 3 end of different length 024 some of them with a single short deletion close to the 3 end of the sequence out of 312 snps in total only two are in igrs2 three of the 38 isolates have long insertions within the sequence3 two of the isolates have a large number of individual insertions  deletions exhibiting different snp positions4 all the isolates may be grouped according to sequence polymorphism into three groups with up to two subgroups reflecting their similarities  dissimilarities since the isolate sequences have a high degree of homology different properties of groups are represented in a more transparent way in the classification tree obtained by such a qualitative analysis than in a bootstrapped phylogenetic tree obtained from multialigned sequences using the clustalw program 105 the total number of amino acid changes caused by multiple snps is 15 in isolates of a c groups and 34 in isolates of b group the total number of silent mutations is 10 for a c groups and 7 for b group6 since s protein is of special interest regarding its receptor affinity and antigenecity it is interesting to notice that all amino acid properties changes are located in its outer membrane region one for a c groups and two for b group7 the results obtained may be useful in further investigation aiming at identification of sars-cov genome regions responsible for its infectious naturewe investigated the complete genomes of 38 sars-cov isolates nucleotide sequences are taken from the pubmed ncbi entrez database 9 in gbk and fasta formats table 1the coverage included all the isolates published by october 31st 2003 with updated revisions the identifiers accession numbers genomic size in nucleotides revision dates and country or source of the isolates considered are included in the table together with labels as referred in this paper the fully sequenced isolate twh has been chosen as the referent isolate since its average number of snps was the lowest as compared to all other isolatesfor similarity analysis of isolates the following procedure has been applied consisting of two steps1 identification of structurally identical parts of isolates ie insertion and deletion sites2 identification of snps in structurally identical partsstep 1 has been carried out by a function performing similarity analysis of subsequences of a given length eg 100 bps and identifying significantly non-matching strings as being inserted in the corresponding sequence ie deleted from the other since significant number of isolates have the same length 29727 bases and starting and ending subsequences that seem to be the exact starts and ends of the complete sars-cov genome up to the poly-a at the 3 end they may be considered as forming a representative group the nucleotide structure of all other isolates was analyzed with respect to this representative group for each pair of isolates xy x from the representative group a file insdelx-y has been produced containing positions and lengths of each of the insertions or deletions in the isolate ystep 2 has been carried out by comparing structurally identical parts of the same length of pairs of isolates the starting and ending positions of those parts have been taken from the file insdelx-y for comparison of x and y produced in step 1 the procedure returns results in a file with snps in the two sequences files mismx-ywe also used the clustalw program 10 for multialignment as a control process as well as for phylogenetic investigationsin order to use similarity analysis results for drawing any phylogenetic conclusions about the sars-cov genome dataset a clustalw 10

found in any oral swab all virus findings in fecal samples are listed by capture site in table 1notably all cov findings were in insect-eating leaf-nosed bats of the genus hipposideros within the genus the species h abae could be discriminated unambiguously by morphology table 1 the remaining hipposideros species were assigned to the complex of forms related to currently recognized species h caffer and h ruber because 2 morphotypes were present figure 2 the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene was sequenced as described 23 both morphotypes belonged to phylogenetic lineages distinct from h caffer and possibly represented 2 distinct species p vallo personal ongoing investigation both are collectively referred to as h caffer cf ruber in this study a fraction of 154 of h cf ruber specimens yielded cov without a difference between sexes 1419 n  5721 mf respectively only adult males and nonlactating adult females but no lactating females juveniles and subadults of h cf ruber were encounteredto estimate the quantity of cov genomes in bat feces we did end-point dilution experiments with the nested pan-cov rt-pcr 18 the previously determined sensitivity limit of the pcr assay was 545 copiespcr 18 in the assay the equivalent of 1 mg feces was tested per pcr tube 100 mg feces collected 110 dilution extracted 110 dilution tested the highest dilution factor that still yielded an

cov was found further analysis was complicated by the low rna content in samples based on alignments of prototype group 1 viruses 5 different nested rt-pcrs were designed and the rdrp fragment could finally be extended by 441 bp to the 5 end providing an 817-nt fragment for phylogenetic analysis all methods of phylogenetic inference placed this virus next to a common ancestor with human

normal-distributed probabilistic prior within the published ranges 25 for calibration of all analyses a first analysis was conducted on the 1225-bp dataset that did not include the novel ghanabt-covgrp1 all virus sequences were assumed to be contemporary phylogeny was inferred using a gtr  4  i model the resulting mrca date of the cov2b sars-likeghanabt-covgrp2 clade was 260 ad and that of the hcov-nl63-229e pair was 981 ad see table 2 for details to include the novel ghanabat-covgrp1 we repeated the same analysis by using the 817-bp dataset the resulting mrca date of the hcov-nl63229e pair was 816 ad in this analysis which was in good concordance with results from the 1221-bp dataset table 2 and also with previously published data 26 the diversification estimate for the novel group 1 bat-cov and hcov-229e then was 1803 adbecause it has been suggested that codon-based evolutionary models may be preferred for bayesian phylogenetic inference from protein-coding datasets 27 analyses on the 817-bp dataset were repeated by using the srd06 substitution model in beast this analysis did not yield a different substitution rate but resulted in older resulting mrca dates table 2 a bayes factor test conducted in tracer yielded a strong estimate of superiority of the codon-based model over the gtr  4  i model log10 bayes factor 139 20 is highly significant to further optimize the prediction of mrca dates the constant population size assumption used in all analyses was exchanged against expansion growth or exponential growth assumptions both assumptions were predicted to fit the data better than the constant size model bayes factors 135 and 139 there was no difference between the expansion and exponential models bayes factor 034 in favor of expansion the mrca date of hcov-229e and the ghanabt-covgrp1 was 1686 expansion or 1800 exponential growth table 2 summarizes the results figure 3 shows a dated phylogeny of coronaviruses with mrcas according to the 2 last mentioned analysesto determine whether cov recombination might play a role in the studied virus population the structural nucleocapsid gene was amplified using 8 nested rt-pcr primer sets that had been designed on alignments of all available cov group 1 nucleocapsid sequences using a similar approach we also tested the same samples for cov group 2 nucleocapsid sequences only group 1 rt-pcrs yielded fragments these fragments could be combined into contiguous 1030-nt sequences for bt-cov ghanakwam 19 and 1176 nt for bt-cov ghanaboo 344 as shown in figure 3 panel b the resulting phylogenetic placement was exactly matching that of the rdrp fragments giving no evidence of recombination between the rdrp region located in the middle of the genome and the nucleocapsid gene located at the extreme downstream end sequencing of the nucleocapsid gene of the ghanabt-covgrp2 was not successful when we used 15 nested rt-pcrs designed on alignments of all available cov 2b nucleocapsid sequences amplification with above mentioned nested rt-pcrs for cov group 1 was also unsuccessfulin the aftermath of the sars epidemic bats have been identified as carriers of cov in china 37 furthermore in addition to our earlier finding of antibodies against covs in various african bats 10 we have confirmed the presence of cov in bats of ghana together with recent data from germany north america trinidad and kenya 111228 these findings suggest that the association of cov with bats is a worldwide phenomenon the prevalence of cov in insect-eating bats 976 matched our previous findings in germany however in that study we sampled during the breeding season and showed that covs are most likely amplified in maternity roosts 11 the composition of the catch in this study no lactating females no young bats suggests sampling outside the breeding season and may not be directly comparable future studies relating to risks of exposure should address whether virus prevalence may change over timethe risk of exposure was also addressed by investigations of virus concentration several groups have shown that covs are almost exclusively detected in bat feces and not as hypothesized earlier in saliva 342829 surprisingly little virus was found in all fecal samples tested in our study we estimated the rna concentration per full sample 100 mg feces  24 fecal pellets to be only up to 45  104 rna copies human pathogenic viruses transmitted by the fecal-oral route generate much higher virus concentrations in stool up to 1012 rna copiesmg eg for different picornaviruses 3032 based on these data it would be difficult to postulate that humans can acquire cov from bat feces however studies in other locations and at different times are needed to address virus concentration in bat droppings in more detail because virus in this study was only observed in insectivorous bats and not in frugivorous bats future studies should investigate whether insects might constitute a source of cov infection for batsto achieve a direct prediction of the potential of bat covs to infect human cells it would be highly relevant to conduct virus isolation studies on bat feces however in our study we sampled no more than 100 mg of feces per bat all samples had to be collected in rnalater solution 05 ml applied biosystems for reasons of storage and transportation although it has been suggested that rnalater solution may preserve virus infectivity 3334 our observations showed that the solution has to be diluted at least 120 in cell culture medium to avoid cytotoxicity data not shown because of the low virus rna concentrations observed we did not attempt to isolate the virus however the absence of successful virus isolation from bat feces in previous studies 3681112 may not reflect the incapability of bat cov to infect human cells recently a synthetic bat cov complemented with an appropriate spike protein has shown potential to infect human cells 35reconstruction of phylogenetic and temporal relationships between bat cov and other mammalian cov is another way to obtain information on their zoonotic potential unfortunately for cov long sequence fragments must be analyzed before valid phylogenies can be inferred from the conserved nonstructural genome portion 2836 because of the low concentration of rna in bat samples generation of long sequences from novel bat cov is tedious and technically demanding which may be why some published phylogenies of bat cov are based on short datasets making it difficult to use these data for reference for molecular clock dating we have therefore relied on reference viruses mainly from other mammals that covered our 1221-bp fragment in the conserved rdrp region we assumed that the rdrp would be under less selective pressure than the structural genes and other nonstructural genes and therefore could be used to infer nucleotide substitution rates over distantly related covs 725263638 we have confirmed all tree topologies using alternative methods of phylogenetic inference including an mcmc algorithm implemented in mrbayes that eliminates artifacts contributed by fixation of mcmc chains in suboptimal prosterior probability maxima 20 calibration was conducted on reliable isolation dates of prototype and novel bat cov from the literature as well as on the mrca of the hcov-oc43bovine cov clade for dating of only this specific cov clade a wide range of dated virus isolates has been available that covered as much as 34 19652004 of the projected time of virus evolution from root to tip 18902004 25 a probabilistic calibration prior was used which is favorable for dating in combination with relaxed molecular clock assumptions 39 the determined mean substitution rates were in good concordance with earlier studies on non-batcov that used maximum likelihood-based methods in addition to bayesian inference 25263840although the exponential growth prior on the virus population seemed equivalent with an expansion growth model by the bayes factor test and produced highly compatible mrcas the exponential model produced a better match with the previously determined mrca of the hcov-nl63hcov-229e pair 26 because pyrc et al generated these data by 3 alternative approaches bayesian serial unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean maximum likelihood 26 we used their mrca to validate our results and consequently prefer the mrca dating from the exponential growth population model as presented in figure 3 in plain type one earlier study on bat and non-bat cov suggested a much faster evolutionary rate for cov than other studies 7 as vijaykrishna et al pointed out their results were associated with large confidence intervals caused by the lack of available data on bt cov at the time the study was conducted 7 the increase of available sequence data now enables a better account of cov evolutionary historyall covs in our study were found in members of the genus hipposideros family hipposideridae the genus rhinolophus from the sister family rhinolophidae was found to host sars-like viruses in several studies in china one of our hipposideros covs was in a basal phylogenetic relationship with the sars-like clade group 2b their most recent common ancestors date back to 400 bc tong et al 17 have detected a sequence fragment of a bat cov in kenya that also belongs to the 2b clade but is associated with the genus chaerephon a free-tailed bat that is rather distantly related to the genus hipposideros although these authors analyzed only a short sequence fragment their 2b cov seems to be related more closely to sars cov than the virus found in our study in the many studies conducted in china only closely related members of the 2b group were detected with the most basal members dating back only to the 17th century according to our analysis the co-occurrence of basal and closely related viruses in africa as well as the existence of the same virus clade in bats other than those of the family hipposideridae may entail speculations about a possible origin of the sars-like group of covs in africa rather than in asiaanother result that should be integrated with earlier findings is the surprisingly recent date of the mrca of the novel grp1 bt cov and the human common cold virus hcov-229e further to the proven recent host switching of sars cov vijgen et al have suggested that hcov-oc43 entered the human population 120 years ago causing a pandemic 25 this virus was most likely acquired by humans from domestic cattle results of our study show that it is not unlikely that hcov-229e which today is circulating worldwide in humans resulted from a host switching event not more than 208322 years ago however as with molecular clock dating of viruses associated confidence limits should not be overlookedbecause h cf ruber bats are found only in sub-saharan africa and are not migratory 23 it would be relevant to know how tightly the associated cov is restricted to its host despite the statistical limitations of our rather small sample size the absence of cov in bats of the closely related species h abae that were tested in our study in two different caves speaks in favour of tight host restriction another supportive argument is the absence of cov in c afra a bat species sampled in sufficient numbers at the booyem cave this cave was coinhabited by cov-positive h cf ruber bats if tight host restriction to nonmigratory h cf ruber bats existed this would indicate an origin of hcov-229e within the geographic range of its host ie the rainforest belt and the wet forested savannahs of sub-saharan africa 23 unfortunately it will be difficult to reconstruct whether the projected host transition event might have been associated with human epidemic diseasesince its first appearance in 2012 middle east respiratory syndrome mers has affected more than 1300 cases in more than 25 countries in four continents and has an alarming fatality rate of more than 301 a novel lineage c betacoronavirus mers coronavirus mers-cov has been confirmed to be the etiological agent of mers2 3 subsequent detection of mers-cov and its antibodies in dromedaries in various countries in the middle east and north africa has suggested that these animals are probably the reservoir for mers-cov4 5 6 in addition both before and after the mers epidemic the discovery of other closely related lineage c betacoronaviruses in various bat species and hedgehogs suggests that these animals may be hosts for an ancestor of mers-cov7 8 9 10 in further support of this hypothesis the spike protein of tylonecteris bat cov hku4 binds dipeptidyl peptidase 411 12 the cellular receptor for mers-covas of august 2016 212 genome sequences of mers-cov were available in genbank although 91 of the sequences were obtained from mers-cov in dromedaries a large proportion of them were from a recent study in saudi arabia13 the small number of dromedary mers-cov genomes obtained from other countries has hindered understanding of the epidemiology and evolutionary history of the virus in camels outside of saudi arabia in our previous report on mers-cov epidemiology in dubai nine dromedary mers-cov strains were sequenced and found to be closely related14 recently we have reported another dromedary mers-cov strain detected in an isolated dromedary herd in the united arab emirates uae15 complete genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis has indicated that this mers-cov strain is a unique member of a cluster of closely related mers-cov strains obtained from patients in the hafr-al-batin region of saudi arabia and qatar16 17 as well as those from patients in the recent korean outbreak18 from the results of these two studies we hypothesized that diverse mers-cov strains may be circulating in dromedaries of the uae to test this hypothesis we performed complete genome sequencing of 10 additional strains of mers-cov isolated from dromedaries in different regions of the uae the results support a polyphyletic origin of mers-cov in dromedaries and the co-circulation of diverse strains from multiple sources in the same farm a novel clade a strain the first identified in the uae may belong to a separate lineage a2 circulating in dromedariesten mers-covs isolated from 10 respiratory samples from 10 dromedaries sent to the central veterinary research laboratory in dubai uae in 2014 and 2015 were included in this study isolation of mers-cov was performed as previously described15 briefly the samples were diluted 10-fold with viral transport medium and filtered two hundred microliters of the filtrate was inoculated into 200 l of minimum essential medium gibco grand island ny usa four hundred microliters of the mixture was added to 24-well tissue culture plates containing vero cells for adsorption inoculation after 1 h of adsorption excess inoculum was discarded the wells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and the medium was replaced with 1 ml of minimum essential medium gibco the cultures were incubated at 37 c with 5 co2 and were inspected daily by inverted microscopy for cytopathic effect cpe for five days each of the cultures exhibited the typical cpe of detachment and rounding of cells all cultures with a cpe were confirmed to be infected with mers-cov through a real-time quantitative rt-pcr assay targeting a region of the viral genome upstream of the envelope gene and isothermal amplification with a genie instrument optigene limited horsham ukviral rna was extracted from the cultures using a qiaamp viral rna mini kit qiagen hilden germany the rna was eluted in 60 l of buffer ave and was used as the template for rt-pcrthe complete genomes of the 10 isolated dromedary mers-cov strains were sequenced as previously described14 15 briefly the rna extracted from the mers-cov strains was converted to cdna by using a combined random priming and oligodt priming strategy the cdna was amplified by primers designed on the basis of multiple sequence alignments of available mers-cov genome sequences using previously described strategies19 the 5 ends in the viral genomes were confirmed via rapid amplification of cdna ends race using a 53 race kit roche diagnostics gmbh mannheim germany sequences were assembled and edited to produce the final sequences of the mers-cov genomesnucleotide and amino acid sequences of predicted open reading frames orfs and the full genomes of 10 mers-cov were aligned with 85 human mers-cov and 87 camel mers-cov genomes using multiple alignment using fast fourier transform mafft ten mers-cov genome sequences from genbank were not included in the analysis because of an incomplete 5 genomic region or having redundant sequences of a single strain pairwise identity of the 182 mers-cov genome sequences as well as their orfs and predicted proteins was calculated using mega5maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees with 1000 bootstrap replicates were constructed using phyml v30 montpellier france on the basis of the complete genome orf1a orf1b and s genes of 85 human and 97 camel mers-cov genomes the best-fit substitution model was selected using jmodeltest and used in the maximum-likelihood analysisto detect possible recombination bootscan analysis was performed by using the nucleotide alignment of the genome sequences of mers-cov and simplot version 351 as previously described20 21 the analysis was conducted using a sliding window of 1500 nucleotides moving in 200 nucleotide steps with genome sequences obtained in the present study as the query possible recombination sites suggested by the bootscan analysis were confirmed through multiple sequence alignmentsin addition to the bootscan analysis possible recombination breakpoints were also detected using rdp geneconv bootscan maximum chi square chimaera siscan and 3seq implemented in recombination detection program version 4 rdp4 automasking was used for optimal recombination detection the rdp analysis was run without a reference and with a window size of 60 the bootscan window size was increased to 500 the maxchi and chimaera number of variable sites per window was increased to 120 and the window size and step size for siscan were increased to 500 and 20 respectively potential recombination events detected by four or more of the seven independent recombination detection methods in the ten genomes in this study were further analyzed with phylogenetic trees constructed using sequences upstream and downstream of the potential recombination breakpointdivergence times for the mers-cov strains were calculated using a bayesian markov chain monte carlo mcmc approach implemented in beast version 180 as described previously22 23 one representative strain was selected for mers-cov strains with close sequence similarity and obtained from the same outbreak analyses were performed under the srd06 substitution models for the concatenated main coding regions of the genome orf1ab s e m and n with an uncorrelated lognormal molecular clock and a gmrf skyride coalescent model the mcmc run was 1  108 steps long with sampling every 1000 steps convergence was assessed on the basis of the effective sampling size after a 10 burn-in using tracer software version 16022 the mean time to the most recent common ancestor tmrca and the highest posterior density regions at 95 hpds were calculated the trees were summarized in a target tree by using the tree annotator program included in the beast package by choosing the tree with the maximum sum of posterior probabilities maximum clade credibility after a 10 burn-inthe nucleotide sequences of the ten dromedary mers-cov genomes sequenced in this study have been submitted to the genbank sequence database under accession nos kx108937kx108946we isolated 10 mers-cov strains from nasal swabs of two live and eight dead dromedary calves from different regions in the uae including a breeding herd which returned from its winter pasture in saudi arabia and calves from dromedary dairy farms in dubai and umm al quwain the clinical and epidemiological data of the 10 dromedaries infected with mers-cov strains isolated and sequenced in this study are summarized in table 1 and figure 1 the median age of the dromedaries was 1 month range 15 days to nine months two of the eight dead dromedaries exhibited nasal discharge before they diedphylogenetic analysis of the complete genomes of the ten sequenced mers-cov isolates showed that one isolate belongs to clade a and nine belong to clade b table 2 figure 2 phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome orf1a orf1b and the s gene sequences all showed that the clade a strain d99815 isolated from a 1-month-old dromedary calf from a special dairy farm in dubai is a unique member of clade a being most closely related to another dromedary isolate nrce-hku205 which was previously detected in egypt figure 3 moreover these two isolates formed a separate cluster distinct from the other two known clade a strains emc2012 and jordan-n32012 both isolated from humans the results suggest that clade a isolates from humans and camels may form two separate lineages a1 and a2 this hypothesis is further supported by analysis of amino acid substitutions along the whole genome sequencescomparison of deduced amino acid sequences of proteins among clade a1 clade a2 and the six lineages of b strains showed a total of 16 substitutions most occurring in the viral nsp3 and s proteins table 2 notably two substitutions in nsp3 at positions 1574 and 1717 were found within the catalytic domain of plpro24 highly variable residues were observed at position 1574 which has been reported to be under positive selection25 another substitution in the s protein at position 1020 glutamine in clade a strains and histidinearginine in clade b strains was found within heptad repeat 1 of the s2 region interestingly the heptad repeat region has recently been reported to be a major selection target among mers-covs and different residues at position 1020 may affect the stability of the six-helix bundle formed by the heptad repeats26 there were nine amino acid substitutions between clade a and b strains and five amino acid substitutions between clade a1 and a2 strains from these results we propose that the two clade a dromedary isolates d99815 and nrce-hku205 should be classified under a new lineage a2 which is distinct from the two clade a human isolates emc2012 and jordan2012the nine clade b isolates belong to three distinct lineages figure 2 five isolates from a dairy farm in dubai and one from a dubai breeding herd returning from saudi arabia belong to lineage 1 one isolate from a dairy farm in dubai and one from umm al qaiwain belong to lineage 3 one isolate from a dairy farm in dubai belongs to lineage 5 figure 2 phylogenetic trees based on orf1a orf1b and the s gene were further constructed to assess strains that had an inconsistent phylogenetic position in the different trees the two lineage three strains in this study d127115 and d1189115 along with other lineage three strains were found to cluster more closely with lineage 4 mers-cov in the tree constructed for orf1a but cluster more closely with lineage 5 mers-cov in the tree constructed for orf1b figure 3 for the tree constructed for the s gene these lineage three strains did not cluster closely with either lineage 4 or lineage 5 mers-cov figure 3 the remaining eight strains identified in this study were found to consistently cluster within the same lineages in all three trees figure 3because phylogenetic analyses showed inconsistent phylogenetic positions for strains d127115 and d1189115 in the orf1a and orf1b trees we performed bootscan analysis and multiple sequence alignments for these two strains for both strains bootscan analysis showed high bootstrap support for clustering between the two strains and lineage 4 mers-cov in two parts of their genomes position 115000 but for position 1500024000 bootscan analysis showed high bootstrap support for clustering between the two strains and lineage 5 mers-cov figure 4a a multiple sequence alignment using these two strains a lineage 4 mers-cov and a lineage 5 mers-cov further indicated that upstream of position 14697 the two strains possessed nucleotides identical to lineage 4 mers-cov but from position 1615523785 the two strains possessed nucleotides similar to lineage 5 mers-cov figure 4afor the analysis using rdp4 recombination breakpoints were detected in the two genomes at positions 14958 and 28835 phylogenetic trees constructed using concatenated nucleotides sequences from position 1 to 14957 and 28836 to 30087 and from position 14958 to 28835 confirmed the inconsistent phylogenetic position of these two newly detected strains in the two trees figure 5the inferred evolutionary rate of mers-cov was 855  104 95 hpd 709  104 101  103 the divergence time of the present 10 dromedary strains is shown in figure 6 on the basis of time-resolved phylogeny the root of the tree is january 2011 95 hpd june 2010 august 2011 the time of the most recent common ancestor tmrca of clade a was dated back to march 2011 95 hpd august 2010 september 2011 and that of clade b to november 2011 95 hpd july 2011 march 2012 figure 6in this study we showed that mers-covs isolated from dromedaries in the uae were of polyphyletic origin for the eight mers-cov strains isolated from dromedaries from dairy farms in dubai one belongs to clade a d98815 and seven d2597214 d25215 d37415 d38315 d38915 d115715 and d127115 belong to clade b figure 2 interestingly the source clade a strain d98815 was isolated from a young female dromedary in a special dairy farm with camel mothers from pakistan therefore the source of this virus was most probably different from that of the seven clade b strains which were isolated from dromedaries from a different dairy farm the latter farm is a large closed system which may explain the relative genetic closeness of the circulating mers-cov strains yet the seven clade b isolates belonged to three distinct lineages with five isolates d2597214 d25215 d37415 d38315 and d38915 clustered with several other mers-cov from dubai27 for the mers-cov isolated from a dromedary calf returning from saudi arabia 1164114 the dromedary was from a herd of approximately 50 female breeding dromedaries in dubai every year these camels were brought to saudi arabia for 6 months because of the better grazing conditions due to the higher amount of rainfall in saudi arabia than in dubai the dromedary calves from this herd were born in saudi arabia young dromedaries are usually removed from the herd and start their training as racing camels when they are one year old although this mers-cov was most probably acquired in saudi arabia its genome sequence is closely related to two human mers-cov strains from oman kt156560 and abu dhabi kp209312 respectively figure 2 the mers-cov isolated from the dromedary in umm al quwain d1189115 is closely related to d127115 in this study and to a human mers-cov strain isolated in thailand kt225476 figure 2 the present data showed that the genome sequences of the mers-cov strains isolated in the uae were intermingled with other mers-cov strains found elsewhere in the middle east or strains from patients who acquired their infections directly or indirectly in the middle east moreover diverse mers-covs are co-circulating in dromedaries in the uae which derive from different sourcesthis polyphyletic origin of mers-cov is unique among human covs such a polyphyletic origin of mers-cov in dromedaries is similar to the diverse lineages of sars-cov-like viruses in horseshoe bats28 29 but in contrast to the monophyletic origin of most human sars-cov strains mers-cov strains from humans are polyphyletic as a result of multiple camel-to-human transmission events30 31 according to the existing evidence a single interspecies transmission event probably occurred from bats to palm civets as the intermediate or amplification host and then from palm civets to humans before the sars epidemic in 200328 32 33 the rapid expansion of the epidemic arose after efficient human-to-human transmission of the human sars-cov strains in contrast mers-cov has become endemic in dromedaries of the uae and other countries in the middle east with diverse strains being introduced into the human population this finding is in line with the overall mers-cov phylogeny in the middle east with the tmrca of all mers-covs being dated back to around january 2011 thus suggesting that mer-cov has emerged in humans relatively recently figures 2 and 6 the difference in evolutionary pathways between sars-cov and mers-cov also provides an explanation for why mersunlike sars which disappeared rapidly after civets were segregated from humans by closing wild animal markets in provinces in southern chinahas persisted for more than three years and will probably continue to circulate in dromedaries and humans unless effective vaccines are available recently viruses closely related to human coronavirus 229e hcov 229e have also been found in camels34 however in contrast to the polyphyletic origin of human and camel mers-covs the hcov 229e and related dromedary-derived viruses were each monophyletic thus suggesting that this endemic human coronavirus may constitute a descendant of camelid-associated virusesthe clade a isolate d98815 the first clade a mers-cov detected in the uae may belong to a separate lineage a2 within clade a at present there are only a few clade a isolates including the first human mers-cov isolated in saudi arabia emc2012 another human isolate from jordan jordan-n32012 two dromedary strains from egypt nrce-hku205 and nrce-hku270 with partial sequence available only35 and six nigerian strains genome not completely sequenced36 although clade a strains are much less common than clade b strains our results suggest that diverse clade a mers-covs may be present in various countries in the middle east and africa both phylogenetic and amino acid substitution analyses showed that the current clade a strains may consist of two distinct lineages one from humans a1 and one from camels a2 further studies to isolate and sequence more clade a strains in humans and camels may provide insights on the role of clade a strains in mers-cov evolution and the potential significance of the observed amino acid changes for host adaptationthe present results show that recombination events are common among certain strains of mers-cov recombination is a well-recognized mechanism by which covs generate diversity we have previously described recombination among the three human cov hku1 genotypes and other human or animal coronaviruses21 37 38 and other researchers have also found recombination in coronaviruses such as feline coronavirus type ii and infectious bronchitis virus39 a number of studies have also reported recombination among mers-covs from different countries13 40 however we should be cautious when interpreting possible recombination events solely on the basis of phylogenetic analysis to avoid drawing premature conclusions for example by phylogenetic tree analysis strains d127115 and d1189115 in the present study and strain d2731314 which we have reported previously15 showed inconsistent phylogenetic clustering in trees based on different viral genes figure 3 however bootscan analysis and multiple alignments did not reveal evidence of recombination for strain d2731314 figure 4b only strains d127115 from dubai and d1189115 from umm al quwain showed evidence of a likely recombination event after stepwise examination using phylogenetic analysis bootscan analysis and multiple sequence alignments figure 4a it is also important to note that the nucleotide sequences of all mers-cov genomes are 99 identical therefore even for the strains with possible recombination there are only approximately 10 base pair differences upstream and downstream of the potential recombination site between the recombinant and parent strains although these sequence differences may have arisen through recombination they may also have resulted from individual nucleotide mutations further studies with careful interpretation of recombination analysis results will be important to understand the role of recombination in the emergence and evolution of mers-covcoronaviruses covs have a large-scale spreading worldwide and infect human and
various animal hosts causing diseases which range from mostly upper respiratory
tract infections in humans to gastrointestinal tract infections encephalitis and
demyelination in animals and can be lethal1 bat covs have been given extraordinary consideration as 2 emerged covs have
been linked to unpredicted human disease outbreaks in the 21st century resulted in
high mortality rate and extremely economic disruption2 these 2 viruses are the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov which
were suggested to be originated from bats2 based on genotypic and serological characterization the international
committee for taxonomy of viruses ictv has reported 4 covs genera namely
alphacoronaviruses betacoronaviruses gammacoronaviruses and
deltacoronaviruses3 the covs are enveloped with positive-sense single-stranded rna genomes
ranging between 262 and 317 kilobyte kb length and they are the largest among
known rna viruses4 the genome of most covs encodes 2 replicates and expressed in a form of 2
polyproteins the first is open reading frame orf 1a measuring approximately
450 kda and the second is orf1ab measuring approximately 750 kda these
polyproteins have processed into numbers of nonstructural ns proteins and 4
structural proteins namely spike s protein envelope e protein membrane m
protein and nucleocapsid n protein5 these structural proteins are important components as they play key roles in
cov infectivity in which the integral membrane protein m adapts a region of
membrane for virus assembly and captures other structural proteins at the budding
site the n protein chaperones and protects the viral rna genome s protein
which consists of 3 copies of the s glycoprotein promoting receptor-binding and
membrane fusion and the small membrane protein e which presents in
sub-stoichiometric amounts and acts as budding enhancer6it has previously been identified that mers-cov is a beta cov causing high morbidity
and mortality in humans7 in saudi arabia it has been detected in a patient clinically diagnosed with
a severe respiratory infection8 in june 11 2014 mers-cov infection has been diagnosed in 699 patients
mainly from the arabian peninsula with a case fatality rate potentially exceeding
the rate reported during the sars-cov pandemic9 a research has reported a high rate of neutralizing antibodies against
mers-cov found in camels in the arabian peninsula showing high relationship at
genetic level to those from human cases suggesting that these camels are
constituting the source of human infections10 at molecular level the covs have a high frequency of recombination due to
their unique replication mechanism which increases the propensity to result in high
rates of mutation allowing the viruses to acclimatize to new hosts and ecological niches11 de benedictis et al have characterized small genomic sequence fragments of
bat covs btcovs that were closely related to mers-cov and suggested that mers-cov
ancestors may have evolved in bats12 in china since 2002 sars-cov was implicated as a causative agent of sars
and caused atypical pneumonia that spread rapidly throughout parts of asia north
america and europe during 2002 to 2003 with cases having been reported in 30 countries13 according to the world health organization report the mortality rate of
sars-cov was more than 105 close person-to-person contact has been shown to be the major transmission
way of sars-cov principally via contact with aerosolized droplets or other bodily fluids14 shortly after sars-cov outbreak and the subsequent implication of bats as
reservoir hosts of the causative agent cov drove numerous studies on bats and the
viruses they harbor a specimen from neoromicia cf zuluensis bat in 2011 yielded a
novel betacoronavirus called neocov15according to the ndapewa ithete and his colleagues results in 2013 neocov differed
from mers-cov by only one amino acid aa exchange 03 in the translated 816-nt
rdrp gene fragment and by only a 109 aa sequence distance in
the gene that encodes the glycoprotein responsible for cov attachment and cellular
entry thus neocov was much more related to mers-cov than any other known virus16 victor max corman et al10 reported that 85 of the neocov genome was identical to mers-cov at the
nucleotide level therefore neocov shared essential details of genome architecture
with mers-cov and thus they have suggested that neocov and mers-cov belonged to one
viral species the presence of a genetically divergent s1 subunit within the neocov
spike gene indicated that intra-spike recombination events may have been involved in
the emergence of mers-cov9 despite the clinical similarities between mers and sars mers-cov is distinct
from sars-cov in several biological aspects such as it uses a distinct receptor
dpp4 and was classified as a generalist cov which enable it to infect a broad
range of cells in culture7in this study we have attempted to provide a better understanding of the
relationship between mers-cov sars-cov and neocov at the level of amino acids
regarding 6 similar proteins including e m n s orf1a and orf1ab using
different bioinformatics tools the leading force for this study was the previous
studies which constructed phylogenetic tree between different species of
coronaviridae based on either structural protein and nonstructural protein or whole
genome and they have found that there was some relationship between mers-cov and
sars-cov while others studied the relationship between mers-cov and neocov but
there was no study included mers-cov sars-cov and neocov in the same study to know
whose is the most related to whom bioinformatics tools and phylogenetic analysis
enables us to understand relationships between ancestral sequences and its
descendantsin this study genome sequences of the 3 target species of cov were retrieved
from the national center for biotechnology information ncbi genome and
nucleotide databases httpswwwncbinlmnihgovgenome httpswwwncbinlmnihgovnuccore namely mers-cov genome
id 31360 sars-cov genome id 10320 and neocov genome id kc869678
however 4 structural proteins e s n and m and 2 ns proteins orf1a and
orf1ab of each species were obtained from the ncbi protein database wwwncbinlmnihgovprotein table 1 presents general information
about all retrieved both nucleotide and protein sequences these genome and
protein sequences were then subjected for comparison using different
bioinformatics prediction toolsnucleotide composition of the target genomes mers-cov sars-cov and neocov was
calculated as shown in table 2 using molecular evolutionary genetics analysis software
version 70 mega7 httpswwwmegasoftwarenethome furthermore pairwise
alignment was done for each pair of target genomes using blast needleman-wunsch
global align nucleotide sequences httpsblastncbinlmnihgovblastcgi as it is presented in
figure 1for the purpose of protein sequences comparison first the multiple sequence
alignments msa was done using the clustal method implemented in clustal omega

were constructed they were viewed by treedyn viewer tool httpwwwtreedynorg as shown in boxes b and c in figures 4 6 8 10 12 and 14 by the same token second scenario
was as follows and msa was done by multiple sequence comparison by
log-expectation muscle method using muscle online tool httpswwwebiacuktoolsmsamuscle after that alignment
results in phylip or clustal format were subjected to gblocks program version
091b alignment curation tool furthermore phyml 30 using
maximum-likelihood method and protpars using parsimony method were used to
generate newick format tree files which have been viewed by treedyn viewer tool19 as shown in boxes a and d in figures 4 6 8 10 12 and 14 previous tools are available at

phyml 30 httpwwwatgc-montpellierfrphyml and protpars httpwwwtrexuqamca the third scenario was revolved
around constructing ultrametric phylogenetic trees using muscle method for
multiple sequence alignments and reltime method to generate the tree then
time-trees were generated by the molecular evolutionary genetics analysis
software version 70 mega7 httpswwwmegasoftwarenethome figures 2 and 3 show the constructed phylogenetic trees
of this scenario that have been done by mega7to determine physical and chemical properties of the protein sequence protparam
tool httpwebexpasyorgprotparam has been used which gives the
computation of various physical and chemical parameters for a given protein

basic local alignment search tool blast httpsblastncbinlmnihgovblastcgi pairwise alignment
was done to determine the matched regions and the number of identicalsimilar
amino acids as described in table 15for the purpose of converting the primary protein structure to secondary protein
structure gor iv tool has been used version 40 httpsnpsa-prabiibcpfrcgi-binnpsaautomatplpagenpsagor4html
which was based on the information theory which gives the 2 outputs the first
output comprised the sequence and the predicted secondary structure in rows
h  helix e  extended or beta strand and c  coil the second presents
probability values for each secondary structure at each amino acid position the
program gives the predicted secondary structure with the highest probability
compatible with a predicted helix segment of at least 4 residues and a predicted

22 to 25the tm-score is defined to assess the topological similarity of 2 protein structures33 zhang tool is designed to solve 2 major problems in the traditional
metrics such as root mean square deviation rmsd 1 tm-score measures the
global fold similarity and is less sensitive to the local structural variations
and 2 magnitude of tm-score for random structure pairs is length-independent
tm-score has the value between 0 and 1 where 1 indicates a perfect match
between 2 structures following strict statistics of structures in the pdb
scores below 017 correspond to randomly chosen unrelated proteins whereas with
a score higher than 05 assume generally the same fold in scopcath httpszhanglabccmbmedumichedutm-score34 table
16in this study we have endeavored to provide a deep understanding of the relationship
between mers-cov sars-cov and neocov at the amino acids level as the proteins are
representing the functional unit of the genome and are directly involved in chemical
processes essential for life the proteins are species and organ-specific in which
the proteins of one species or organs differ from those of another species or
organs however proteins of similar function have similar amino acid composition
and sequence despite the difficulties in explaining functions of protein from its
amino acid sequence understanding the correlations between structure and function
is the key role of protein functionwith respect to the aim of determining the properties of amino acids that compose
proteins of this study table
1 shows the physical and chemical properties of these proteins amino
acids that are present in all cov species of interest35 we have found that the number of amino acids of e m n and s proteins in
addition to all other parameters including molecular weight atomic composition
theoretical pi and structural formula of mers-cov and neocov were close to each
other if not identical and this has supported the previous finding that neocov was
closely related to mers-cov and suggested that mers-covs ancestors may have evolved
in bats12 this finding is in contrary to victor max corman et al10 results which have reported that neocov and mers-cov belonged to one viral
species and that the presence of a genetically divergent s1 subunit
within the neocov spike gene indicated that intra-spike recombination events may
have been involved in the emergence of mers-cov because there were some differences
regarding all 6 proteins and not s protein only9 in accordance with our results agnihothram et al1 have demonstrated that neocov shared essential details of genome architecture
with mers-cov but however disagreement in that 85 of the neocov genome is
identical to mers-cov at the nucleotide levelin this study we used 5 different methods of phylogenetic tree construction
including maximum parsimony mp neighbor-joining nj unweighted pair group
method with arithmetic mean upgma maximum likelihood ml and reltime rt to
depict the relatedness evolution change and relative time between the viruses of
interest in the level of genome and protein according to phylogenetic results of
the whole genomes which had relied on muscle alignment results have shown that
joining of mers-cov and sars-cov with the nearest common ancestor and mers-cov has
the lowest evolutionary change genetic distances the reltime method showed that
neocov was the oldest while mers-cov and sars-cov were belonged to the same time
based on the relative time furthermore according to phylogenetic results of
protein sequences which had relied on muscle and clustalw alignment methods in
general trees have shown that joining neocov and mers-cov proteins in same clades
indicates that they are closest on the basis of all used methods furthermore
according to the horizontal branch length through used methods most neocov proteins
have the shortest branch length comparing to othersregarding proteins primary and secondary structures most of the comparison results
showed the most similarity between neocov and mers-cov another comparison tool has
template modeling score tm-score which is used to measure the topological
similarity between the structure of proteins and this method is insensitive to
local structural variation the tm results confirmed that neocov was more close to
mers-cov than sars-cov generally phylogenetic analysis of the 6 proteins e s m
n orf1a and orf1ab revealed that there were high similarities between the 3
viruses although neocov appeared close to mers-cov this result indicated that they
have the same common ancestor and neocov may implicate in human-related infection
sooner because of high similarity in portions involved in viral infectivityin december 2019 the seventh human coronavirus termed 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was found in wuhan china on february 8 2020 the total number of infections and deaths due to 2019-ncov globally was 34439 and 720 respectively according to the johns hopkins university center for systems science and engineeringcoronaviruses are enveloped rna viruses that infect many species including humans other mammals and birds after infection the host may develop respiratory bowel liver and neurological diseases weiss and leibowitz 2011 cui et al 2019 coronaviruses are members of the order nidovirales and subfamily orthocoronavirinae this subfamily is divided into four genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus generally alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus tend to infect mammals while gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus typically infect birds however some gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus can infect mammals under specific conditions woo et al 2012in immunocompromised individuals infection with one of the four human coronaviruseshuman coronavirus nl63 hcov-nl63 human coronavirus 229e hcov-229e human coronavirus oc43 hcov-oc43 and human coronavirus hku1 ecov-hku1usually results in cold-like symptoms these viruses can cause severe infections in some infants and the elderly due to the frequent interaction between wild animals and humans wild animals are a common source of human zoonotic infections sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov are zoonotic coronaviruses that can cause severe respiratory diseases in humans both belong to betacoronavirus su et al 2016 forni et al 2017 cui et al 2019 luk et al 2019 ramadan and shaib 2019 2019-ncov is the seventh coronavirus discovered that infects humans it causes acute respiratory disease in respiratory infections immediately after its discovery the complete genome sequence of 2019-ncov was determined the sequence mn908947 was released by genbank on 05 january 2020 lu et al 2020 the sequence of 2019-ncov is 96 identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus zhou et al 2020the genomic characteristics and epidemiology of 2019-ncov have been analyzed lu et al 2020 nine inpatient culture isolates were subjected to next-generation sequencing and individual complete and partial 2019-ncov genomic sequences were obtained phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-ncov genomes and other coronaviruses was performed to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and to explore the origin of 2019-ncov at the first onset homology modeling investigated the potential receptor-binding properties of the virus however sars-cov and mers-cov showed approximate similarities of 79 and 50 with 2019-ncov respectively these findings indicated that there is not a close evolutionary relationship of 2019-ncov with sars-cov and mers-cov thus 2019-ncov is considered the seventh novel human betacoronavirus lu et al 2020in this study we comprehensively characterized the relationship of the translated proteins of 2019-ncov to other species of orthocoronavirinae this was done using a combination of the phylogenetic tree constructed from the genome sequences and the cluster tree developed from the profiles retrieved from the presence and absence of homologs of ten 2019-ncov proteins
the genomes and the combination of genome and protein sequences were used to develop a phylogenetic tree and phylogenetic profiling respectively the dataset of the genomes of the orthocoronavirinae subfamily was collected from the refseq database using the orthocoronavirinae ncbi taxonomy id txid2501931 this dataset contains representative complete genomes from each species of that subfamily pruitt et al 2007 federhen 2012 supplementary table 1 additionally we collected genome sequences from bat sars-like coronavirus mg772934 and mg772933 from ncbi and betacovbatyunnanratg132013 epiisl402131 from gisaid httpwwwgisaidorg one species of the okanivirinae subfamily the yellow head virus was also collected as an outgroup supplementary table 1 the genome sequences were aligned using mafft multiple sequence alignment program provided at the xsede portal in the cipres science gateway with an automatic selection strategy miller et al 2012 katoh and standley 2013 a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method with raxml-hpc blackbox in the cipres science gateway stamatakis 2006 the analysis used an automatic bootstrapping option using a general time-reversible substitution model with a gamma-shape parameter gtr g the model was selected as the best-fit model under the akaike information criterion using modeltest-ng darriba et al 2020 phylogenetic trees were viewed using figtree v14 httptreebioedacuksoftwarefigtreethe annotated protein sequences of 2019-ncov were collected from the data of one representative genome from ncbi mn996527 we built a blast database with the retrieved genome sequences data using blast version 2230 camacho et al 2009 we then determined the presence and absence of homolog proteins of one representative set of annotated 2019-ncov proteins against other genome sequences in a database using tblastn with a threshold of 50 and  25 bits score for protein sequences 50 amino acids aa and  50 aa in length respectively the results of the presence and absence of homolog proteins were converted into a binary matrix and used to build a clustering tree using ward hierarchical clustering method ward jr 1963 supplementary table 2 nonstructural protein ns 7b and ns8 local alignments were only positive in the sarbecovirus subgenus sample excluding the sars coronavirus additionally we predicted the structural properties of the 2019-ncov ns7b protein including the secondary structure and order-disorder propensity using jpred4 and dichot respectively fukuchi et al 2014 drozdetskiy et al 2015 we also predicted the structure using the contact assisted protein structure prediction c-i tasser composite approach zhang et al 2018 additionally we specifically collected the sequences that produced significant alignments of ns7b using the mega x software kumar et al 2018the phylogenetic analysis using complete genome sequences showed that 2019-ncov was the most closely related to batcov ratg13 and belonged to the sarbecovirus subgenus of betacoronavirus together with sars coronavirus and bat-sars-like coronavirus bat-sl-covzxc21 and bat-sl-covzc45 with the full support of reliability fig 1
 additionally hibecovirus with bat hp-betacoronaviruszhejiang2013 as the representative species was the most closely related subgenus of betacoronavirus to sarbecovirus as compared to other subgenera including merbecovirus under which mers-cov has been classified nobecovirus and embecovirus these findings agree with previous phylogenetic tree and similarity plot data paraskevis et al 2020 2019-ncov was found to be more closely related to the bat-infecting sarbecovirus species bat sars-like coronavirus and betacov ratg13 than to the sars coronavirus that infects humans this indicated that 2019-ncov more likely originated from bats however the wuhan outbreak was first detected in december which is a time of year when most bat species hibernate moreover the huanan seafood market which is considered as ground zero of the outbreak does not sell bats instead it has been suggested that there is an animal mediator for virus transmission from bats to humans similar to the previous cases of sars-cov and mers-cov wherein the masked palm civet paguma larvata and dromedary camel camelus dromedarius act as intermediate hosts respectively lu et al 2020 although coronaviruses can exchange genetic material during coinfection a recent report described the lack of a mosaic relationship of 2019-ncov to the closely related sarbecovirus indicating the lack of a recombination event in the emergence of 2019-ncov paraskevis et al 2020 hence 2019-ncov likely emerged from the accumulation of mutations responding to altered selective pressures or from the infidelity of rna polymerase perpetuated as replication-neutral mutations these speculations need to be studied furthera previously reported comprehensive similarity plot revealed notable mutational hotspots and conserved regions of the genome nucleotide positions of 2019-ncov against closely related coronaviruses lu et al 2020 paraskevis et al 2020 the present findings provide a different perspective of the similarity among orthocoronavirinae species using a cluster tree developed from the profiles retrieved from the presence and absence of homologs of ten 2019-ncov proteins this cluster was combined with the cladogram of a previously constructed phylogenetic tree fig 2
 both the trees were consistent in their heatmap distributions the tree of 2019-ncov proteins comprised two clades the first indicated with a blue bar in fig 2 contained a group of conserved proteins in most orthocoronavirinae species these comprised orf1ab polyprotein nucleocapsid protein spike glycoprotein and membrane protein spike and orf1a regions of 2019-ncov were previously shown to have the lowest sequence identity as compared to the closely related coronavirus species lu et al 2020 paraskevis et al 2020 however since the translated spike glycoprotein and orf1ab polyprotein from these regions are very long the sequence similarity is still sufficient to classify them as homologs in contrast another clade indicated by the green bar in fig 2 comprised proteins specific to sarbecovirus for all proteins in this clade and hibecovirus for envelope protein only this clade included proteins that were not completely conserved by all orthocoronavirus two ns7b and ns8 of five nonstructural proteins were specific for 2019-ncov and its closely related species batcov ratg13 and bat-sars-like coronavirus bat-sl-covzxc21 and bat-sl-covzc45 the other three nonstructural proteins ns3 ns6 and ns7a were also detected in the sars coronavirus based on these results we propose that the comprehensive analysis of nonstructural proteins especially ns7b and ns8 may provide new insight into the properties of 2019-ncovas shown in fig 2 ns7b and ns8 of 2019-ncov batcov ratg13 and bat-sars-like coronavirus were distinct from other species of orthocoronavirus in sars-cov ns7b is an integral protein localized in the golgi compartment the protein is packaged into sars-cov particles schaecher et al 2007 interestingly open reading frame orf 7b but not orf 7b deletion induces interferon ifn-dependent reporter gene expression as well as apoptosis and the type i ifn response pfefferle et al 2009 moreover the deletion of orf 7b enhance virus growth pfefferle et al 2009 thus we speculate that the property of the non-conserved ns7b in 2019-ncov may affect the human infective property of the virus similarly the existence of 29 nucleotide deletions in orf 8b has been described in sars-cov oostra et al 2007 a study involving mers-cov described that orf 8b strongly antagonizes the inf-beta  promoter and orf4b and 8b significantly suppress ifn induction lee et al 2019b accessory proteins 8b and 8ab of sars-cov can suppress the inf- signaling pathway and thus interferon production by their participation in the ubiquitin-mediated rapid degradation of inf regulatory factor 3 irf3 wong et al 2018 in contrast when we focused on mers-cov from bats and camels orf 8b antagonized melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5-mediated nuclear factor kappa b nf-b activation orf 8b strongly inhibited tank-binding kinase 1-mediated induction of nf-b signaling but not ib kinase epsilon and irf3-mediated activations lee et al 2019a thus we speculate that the properties of the accessory proteins ns7b and ns8 in 2019-ncov may affect its ability to infect humans further studies are required to confirm this speculationns7b is a short peptide of 43 residues a three-dimensional structure is often difficult to obtain from such a short peptide we predicted the three-dimensional structure of the queried ns7b amino acid sequence using dichot and c-i-tasser supplementary fig 1 fig 3
 fukuchi et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 a protein family pf11395 was found but no known three-dimensional structure was found the secondary structure of this query was also predicted using jpred4 supplementary fig 2 drozdetskiy et al 2015 the secondary structure was predicted to be an -helix but that this very likely does not occur depending on the environment fig 3 the alignment of this protein revealed three polymorphism sites between 2019-ncov batcov ratg13 and bat-sars-like coronavirus sequences bat-sl-covzxc21 and bat-sl-covzc45 supplementary fig 3in summary some nonstructural proteins were conserved and others were not conserved between 2019-ncov and sars-cov by focusing on the 2019-ncov-specific proteins ns7b and ns8 we proposed a combination of phylogenetic profiling analysis and structural characterization of the genes that were specifically expressed in 2019-ncov and the closely related bat coronavirus the data provide insight for further characterization of the infective properties of this virusthe following are the supplementary data related to this article

 the phylogenomic tree of our study indicates that the target wuhan-hu-1 genome was closely related to different isolates of sars-cov-2 genomes bat coronavirus ratg13 bat-sars-cov zxc21 and pangolin-cov gx-p5l were found to be an ancestor a separate phylogenomic tree of various isolates of sars-cov-2 was represented in supplementary fig s1 bat sars-like coronavirus was found to be an ancestor of newly identified covid-19 dataset used for the phylogenomic and phylogeographic tree construction and its closely related species are available in supplementary table s1 based on the constructed genomic tree we further summarized and select an isolate of phylogenetic neighbor from each cluster along with two newly sequenced indian isolates accession mt0120981 mt0504931 to identify proteomic differentiation between them based on these criteria a proteome-based phylogenetic analysis was performed it also provides support evidence to the zoonotic evolution theory that sars-cov-2 might have evolved from bat sars-like coronavirus and pangolin coronavirus as represented in fig 2a when compared with the previous study the genome of sars-cov-2 was found to be about 82 96 and 869 identical to the sars-cov bat-cov-ratg13 and bat-sars like-covzc45 respectively zhou et al 2020the genetic diversity analysis of our study revealed that wuhan-hu-1 was closely related to new isolates of two indian sars-coronavirus 2 with 100 query coverage and 9998 sequence similarity respectively the pair-wise genetic distance occurred in the range between 00 and 0001 however the sars-cov-2 genome was genetically distinct from sars-cov and has a relatively long branch length to the bat-cov ratg13 0014 bat-sars like-cov zxc21 0067 and pangolin-cov gx-p5l 0073 fig 2b a total of 9998 similarity was found across the sars-cov-2 genomes obtained from different patients lu et al 2020 genetic recombination events are complex and more likely occurring in bat-cov ratg13 and bat-sars like-cov zxc21than in sars-cov-2 jaimes et al 2020 lu et al 2020 paraskevis et al 2020 the tajimas neutrality test tajima 1989 was estimated to identify the mutations by dna polymorphism it shows that the nucleotide diversity appears in the range 0045977 with a high number of segregating sites 1123 it further confirms that the rate of gene duplication events may occur due to radical changes in the segregating sites with a high recombination rate as described by clark et al 2012 the fluctuation of amino acid frequencies was estimated using jones et al 1992 evolutionary model jones et al 1992 as represented in fig 2c comparing to other amino acids leucine 911 is a highly enriched amino acid found in this group as per the earlier investigation by matsushima et al 2019 the diverse effects of the mutations or recombinant events are occurred due to leucine-rich repeat and it leads to the origin of several human diseasesthese conversions provide keen evidence of variance in chemical composition atputpgtpctp between the species the hierarchical clustering results show that the two indian isolates sars-cov-2humanind292020 and sars-cov-2humanind1662020 are closely related to each other and it can deviate when sars-cov-2wuhan-hu-1 is compared to other ancestral species fig 3a a low abundance of amino acid was found in pangolin cov gx-p5l and bat-sars-cov zxc21 it also indicates that several compositional variances are found in amino acid bases between the selected species it was further proved by principal component analysis it shows that the two indian isolates and bat-cov ratg13 were closely related to each other while compared to wuhan-hu-1 fig 3b therefore these variations may refer that the sars-cov-2 genome has been expanded in human hosts due to the establishment of a hyper-variable genomic hotspot population wen et al 2020 as per the previous investigation magiorkinis et al 2004 and paraskevis et al 2020 stated that these may occur due to altered diverse lineages in the evolutionary rates or either by ancient recombination eventsa dot plot comparison was performed for the function coding region between wuhan-hu-1 and selected phylogenetic neighbors and ancestors fig 4
 it shows that 70 of sequences from the sars-cov-2 wuhan-hu-1 match with selected species represented in the colored block as aligned regions 1 2 and 3 interestingly a few blocks were identified in wuhan-hu-1 isolates in the position 709611500 bp stand for a white block as mismatch or gapped region a total of 4404 amino acid bases were uniquely found in the wuhan-hu-1 while comparing to our analysis approximately 30 of wuhan-hu-1 doesnt match with any isolates and it may offer new ancestry relationships within the subgenus of sarbecovirus paraskevis et al 2020we conducted a detailed genomic survey to understand molecular and functional diversity between sars-cov-2 and its phylogenomic neighbors from our analysis it is inferred that sars-cov-2 of indian origin has highly diverged from the sars-cov-2 of wuhan-hu-1 which might due to the high mutagenicity rate of covid further high mutagenicity rate was occurred due to the variations of transitiontransversion genetic ratio between the selected pairs it is speculated that this divergence in the evolution of indian origin sars-cov-2 is responsible for the lower death rate scenario in india hence the present genomic and proteomic impending of this virus will provide a lead to the researchers in turn to understand the mutation rate among indian strains and helps to unravel the mechanism behind its emergence and also in drug discoveryauthors are thankful to 1013039501100001843serb 1013039100007225ministry of science and technology

blastx program in the blast software package version 2222 wwwncbinlmnihgovblast with parameters -e 1e-5 -f t -b 10 -v 10 no assembly was performed before alignment sequence similaritybased taxonomic assignments were conducted as described 7 we found 1075 reads of betacoronavirus in rhinolophus pusillus bats in shaanxi and 92 reads of betacoronavirus in chaerephon plicata bats in yunnanwe estimated the approximate locations of those reads on the cov genome and their relative distances on the basis of alignment results exported with megan 4metagenome analyzer httpabinfuni-tuebingendesoftwaremegan the located reads were then used for reads-based nested pcr to identify genomic sequences we established the complete genome sequences of 2 betacoronaviruses bat rp-coronavirusshaanxi2011 and bat cp-coronavirusyunnan2011 which are 29484 nt and 29452 nt respectively the gc content of bat rp-coronavirusshaanxi2011 and bat cp-coronavirusyunnan2011 is 416 and 409 respectivelywe conducted complete genome comparison and phylogenetic analysis on the basis of polymerase and spike protein pairwise genome sequence alignment was conducted by using emboss needle software wwwebiacuktoolspsaembossneedle with default parameters the overall nucleotide sequences between bat rp-coronavirusshaanxi2011 and bat cp-coronavirusyunnan2011 indicated 887 nt identity they shared 874895 nt identity with sars-cov 88899 nt identity with the bat sars-like cov bat sars-cov rm1 and 876896 nt identity with the civet sars-like cov civet sars-cov sz16 on the other hand comparison between the betacoronavirus genomes and human betacoronavirus hcov-oc43 showed only 499504 nt overall identity whereas the betacoronavirus genomes and hcov-emc showed 521 nt overall identitythe rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp the 12th nonstructural protein codified to open reading frame 1ab is a highly conserved gene of covs which is frequently used for phylogenetic comparison 89 mega50 wwwmegasoftwarenet was used to construct the phylogenetic trees on the basis of the nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acid sequences first we used the muscle package and default parameters wwwmegasoftwarenet to construct the alignment the best substitution model was then evaluated with the model selection package implemented in mega5 finally we used the maximum-likelihood method with an appropriate model to process the phylogenetic analysis with 1000 bootstrap replicates we constructed a phylogenetic tree based on the nucleotide sequences of the rdrp gene to show the evolutionary relationship between these 2 betacoronaviruses and other covs figure 1 reference cov genome sequences were downloaded from genbank and aligned with the fragments of the newly discovered covs the rdrp genes of bat rp-coronavirusshaanxi2011 and bat cp-coronavirusyunnan2011 were highly similar sharing 931 nt identity the phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that betacoronaviruses and the bat sars-like covs in our study are clustered 931934 nt identity and are close in distance to sars-covs 929948 nt identity and civet sars-like covs 931948 nt identity but that bat cov btcov-hku9 and hcov-oc43 are placed among the relatively distant groups 658659 and 629635 nt identities with the betacoronaviruses respectively therefore collectively we called these betacoronaviruses and bat sars-like covs the bat sars-like cluster of covs bat rp-coronavirusshaanxi2011 and bat cp-coronavirusyunnan2011 showed little genetic similarity 662673 nt identity to hcov-emcthe spike proteins of covs are responsible for receptor binding and host species adaptation and their genes therefore constitute one of the most variable regions within cov genomes 1011 the phylogenetic tree based on the amino acid sequences of spike protein figure 2 suggests that the selected betacoronaviruses were mainly divided into 5 clusters sars cluster bat sars-like cluster civet sars-like cluster human betacoronavirus cluster and emc cluster bat rp-coronavirusshaanxi2011 and bat cp-coronavirusyunnan2011 shared 894 aa identity in spike proteins which consisted of 1240 aa and 1241 aa respectively the spike proteins of the covs in our analysis have 898927 aa identity with those of bat sars-like covs with substantial similarity in the receptor-binding domain the close relationship also was observed with the sars-covs 792794 aa identity and civet sars-like covs 789791 aa identity in contrast the human betacoronaviruses and emc cluster formed separate clusters distinct from sars-related covs that showed only 278294 aa and 288305 aa identities with the betacoronaviruses respectively in our analysis the genome sequences reported here have been deposited into genbank accession nos jx993987jx993988the recent fatal human infection caused by hcov-emc has boosted interest in the discovery of novel covs in humans and animals hcov-emc is a novel betacoronavirus and its closest known relatives are btcovs hku4 and hku5 which have been detected in hong kong only in bats 12 the same animal from which sars is believed to have originated bats are increasingly recognized as natural reservoirs of covs and may serve as intermediate hosts for interspecies transmission of sars-covs 1013 different bat populations from various countries harbor diverse covs that have a high frequency of recombination and mutation rates that enable them to adapt to new hosts and ecologic niches 1415 therefore continuous studies of covs from different bat species and different countries would help better prevent the new global pandemics resulting from novel viral infectionwe detected and characterized 2 novel betacoronavirusesbat rp-coronavirusshaanxi2011 in r pusillus bats and bat cp-coronavirusyunnan2011 in c plicata batsin china the high similarity shown by phylogenetic analysis confirmed the close genetic relationship among the covs sars-like covs and sars-covs that we analyzed in contrast bat rp-coronavirusshaanxi2011 and bat cp-coronavirusyunnan2011 showed little genetic similarity with human betacoronaviruses and hcov-emc although several covs are found in horseshoe bats rhinolophus spp to our knowledge the sars-like covs in r pusillus and c plicata bats in china have not been identified the description presented here will further the understanding of covs distribution in different bat species found in human habitats and provide clues for rapid response to potential public health threatscoronaviruses are enveloped single-strand rna viruses that can infect a wide range of hosts including avian wild domestic mammalian species and humans coronaviruses are well known for their ability to mutate rapidly alter tissue tropism cross the species barrier and adapt to different epidemiological situations 1 six human coronaviruses have been reported since the 1960s four of them oc43 229e nl63 and hku1 cause mild illness similar to the common cold and gastrointestinal tract infection the other two severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov have raised significant public health concerns due to their zoonotic emergence and crossing of the species barrier causing high pathogenicity and mortality in humans 2 sars- and mers-covs were reported to be transmitted from the main host bats to palm civets or dromedary camels respectively then finally to humans 345 both sars- and mers-covs were and are highly pathogenic resulting in 8096 and 2519 human cases with 96 and 343 fatality rate in 20032004 and 2012present respectively 67several clusters of pneumonia cases of unknown causes were reported in wuhan city hubei province china in december 2019 by epidemiological investigations most of these patients were related to the huanan seafood wholesale market the causative agent of this pneumonia was confirmed as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 previously named 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov and the diseases was termed coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 89 based on phylogenetic analysis sars-cov-2 forms a distinct lineage with bat-sars-like coronaviruses that belong to the order nidovirales family coronaviridae genus betacoronavirus and subgenus sarbecovirus 9 sars-cov-2 shares 963 89 and 82 nucleotide similarity with bat cov ratg13 sars-like cov zxc21 and sars-cov respectively which confirms its zoonotic origin 1011at the beginning of the outbreak scientists thought that the disease was initially only transmitted from animals to humans then only between people who are symptomatic until the first human-to-human transmission case from an asymptomatic carrier was documented in germany 101213 this is also now evidenced by cases of community spread in which no direct links between current patients and suspected covid-19 carriers can be made as of 13 april 2020 the disease has caused a worldwide pandemic in more than 200 countries with more than 1700000 confirmed human cases and 111600 deaths as a result of the rapid spread of the virus authorities worldwide have begun limiting international and domestic travel and large gatherings at educational institutions restaurants bars etcsars-cov-2 is reported to be transmitted between humans through direct contact aerosol droplets fecaloral route and intermediate fomites from both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients during the incubation period 914 the disease is characterized by fever dry cough dyspnea and diarrhea in 2025 of patients who do not exhibit upper respiratory signs such as sneezing or sore throat 813 in severe cases the disease is characterized by pneumonia metabolic acidosis septic shock and bleeding 1415several control measures are being instituted by nations around the world to extinguish the sars-cov-2 pandemic including the issuance of travel advisories or even flight bans to and from infected countries strict quarantine measures and traveler screenings implementation of mitigation measures by healthcare specialists application of social distancing measures for schools and popular gatherings strict personal hygiene such as frequent handwashing and wearing face masks 16 currently world public health authorities such as the centers for disease control and prevention cdc world health organization who and other global partners are trying to control and prevent the spread of sars-cov-2 additionally who issued a guide to managing the recent pandemic including instructions for the rapid detection of the disease emergency treatment application of prevention and control strategies supportive therapy and prevention of disease complications 15due to misleading information that is circulating and knowledge gaps about the newly emerged sars-cov-2 this review provides the most recent information about sars-cov-2 with emphasis on 1 the current status of sars-cov-2 outbreaks 2 evidence regarding its origin by phylogenetic analysis 3 epidemiological characteristics required for efficient control strategies 4 diagnosis of the disease 5 current control strategies and effective therapies and 6 challenges to control future epidemics like those caused by coronaviruses this review also provides insights for the control of pathogenic infections in humans with novel coronaviruses and spillovers in the futurecoronaviruses have repeatedly evolved during the past 1000 years 17 the first recovery of coronaviruses involved the identification of illnesses in animals followed by the isolation of infectious bronchitis virus ibv from chickens in 1937 18 and murine hepatitis viruses mhv from mice in 1949 19 pigs were found to carry a transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev in the united states in 1946 19 human coronaviruses were first characterized in the 1960s from respiratory tract infections 20 the two first isolated viruses were b814 and 229e 2122 since then several other coronavirus strains have been isolated from humans using tissue culture oc16 and oc43 2324 the number of identified coronaviruses has continued to increase significantly to include viruses of several additional animal species such as calves dogs cats bats sparrows rabbits and turkeys 25 in 20022003 sars-cov caused a disease outbreak with deaths in 29 countries most cases being in china and hong kong the total number of reported cases was 8096 of which 774 died corresponding to a 96 fatality rate 6 before the disease died out in part due to strict quarantine protocols based on the genome sequence sars-cov appeared to be very closely related to another virus from himalayan palm civets from which it may have emerged 3 later civets were considered an intermediate host for sars-cov with bats as the natural host 5 hu et al 26 conducted a five-year surveillance study of sars-related coronaviruses isolated from horseshoe bats in yunnan province china where 11 sars-like covs were identified genome comparisons revealed high genetic diversity among these viruses in several genes including s orf3 and orf8 despite the differences in s protein sequences all 11 sars-like covs are still able to use the same human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 hace2 receptor demonstrating a close relationship with sars-cov therefore sars-cov likely emerged through recombination of bat sars-like covs before infecting civets from which the recombinant virus spread to humans causing the sars epidemic 526ten years later mers-cov emerged in middle eastern countries where the virus was transmitted to humans from dromedary camels 27 as of january 2020 mers-cov has resulted in 2519 laboratory-confirmed cases and 866 deaths 343 fatality rate with more than 80 of the cases reported from saudi arabia 7 the human and camel mers-cov strains share more than 99 identity with variations substitutions located in the s orf3 and orf4b genes 28 phylogenetically mers-cov is very close to bat coronaviruses hku4 and hku5 29 a comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary relationships indicated that mers-cov may have originated from bats as a result of recombination events within orf1ab and s genes 3031 to gain access into the cell mers-cov uses the human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 receptor 32 this is also the case for mers-related covs isolated from bats in china whose spike proteins are able to bind to the same receptor as mers-cov confirming the possibility of a bat origin for mers-cov 33 in december 2019 sars-cov-2 emerged in wuhan city china causing severe respiratory illness and mortality see the epidemiology section early studies reported that it may have evolved from bats as revealed by phylogenetic analysis 9 and its high identity 963 with the bat coronavirus ratg13coronaviruses are enveloped icosahedral symmetric particles approximately 80220 nm in diameter containing a non-segmented single-strand positive-sense rna genome of about 2632 kb in size 34 coronaviruses covs are one of the largest groups of viruses that belong to the order nidovirales suborder cornidovirineae and family coronaviridae coronaviridae is classified into two subfamilies namely letovirinae and orthocoronavirinae letovirinae includes the alphaletovirus genus while orthocoronaviridae is further classified on the basis of phylogenetic analysis and genome structure into four genera alphacoronavirus cov betacoronavirus cov gammacoronavirus cov and deltacoronavirus cov which contain 17 12 2 and 7 unique species respectively ictv 2018 the most recent classification of the coronaviridae is shown in table 1 corona in latin means crown and this name was attributed to the virus due to the presence of spike projections from the virus envelope that give it the shape of a crown under the electron microscope nido means nest and refers to the ability of the viruses of this order to make a nested set of subgenomic mrna 2535coronaviruses infect a wide range of wild and domestic animals - and covs infect mammals while - and covs primarily infect birds table 1 a human coronavirus hcov was first isolated in 1960 from hospitalized patients who suffered from common cold symptoms and was named b814 36 so far the seven different hcovs that infect humans are 229e nl63 which belong to  covs and hku1 oc43 sars mers sars-cov-2 which belong to covs in 20022003 a pandemic caused by sars-cov lineage b cov originated in china 37 in the middle east mers-cov lineage c cov emerged in 2012 27 in 2019 a newly emerged sars-cov-2 closely related to bat sars-related covs was clustered with lineage b cov chan et al 13 demonstrated that sars-cov-2 represents a distinct lineage in the subgenus sarbecovirus previously lineage 2b of cov 38additionally other coronaviruses have caused pandemic diseases in domestic and wild mammals and birds leading to high mortality rates and severe economic losses these viruses include ibv in chickens 40 beluga whale coronavirus sw1 bwcov-sw1 41 bat coronaviruses cdphe15 and hku10 ictv 2018 porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv tgev and sudden acute diarrhea syndrome sads-cov 42 since the emergence of sars-cov-2 in wuhan city china in december 2019 many laboratories have been working on sequencing the genome of the causative agent as of 14 april 2020 there are a total of 7655 complete genomes from 67 countries in the global initiative on sharing all influenza data gisaid database 43 table 2 a reference genome is now available in the ncbi genome database 29903 nucleotide reference sequence nc0455123 44 to date there are a total of 875 sequences including one refseq sequence and 768 complete genomes at ncbisars-cov-2 is a monopartite single-stranded and positive-sense rna virus with a genome size of 29903 nucleotides making it the second-largest known rna genome the virus genome consists of two untranslated regions utrs at the 5 and 3 ends and 11 open reading frames orfs that encode 27 proteins table 3 the first orf orf1ab constitutes about two-thirds of the virus genome encoding 16 non-structural proteins nsps while the remaining third of the genome encodes 4 structural proteins and at least 6 accessory proteins the structural proteins are spike glycoprotein s matrix protein m envelope protein e and nucleocapsid protein n while the accessory proteins are orf3a orf6 orf7a orf7b orf8 and orf10 as shown in figure 1 2133845the 5utr and 3utr of sars cov-2 are comprised of 265 and 229 nucleotides respectively orf1ab is 21290 nucleotides and encodes either replicase proteins pp1a of 4405 amino acids aa nsp1nsp11 or pp1ab of 7096 aa nsp1nsp16 according to ribosomal frameshift of these proteins 1 nsp1 suppresses the antiviral host response 2 nsp3 is a papain-like protease 3 nsp5 is a 3clpro 3c-like protease domain 4 nsp7 makes a complex with nsp8 to form a primase 5 nsp9 is responsible for rnadna binding activity 6 nsp12 is an rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp 7 nsp13 is confirmed as a helicase 8 nsp14 is a 35 exonuclease exon 9 nsp15 is a polyu-specific endoribonuclease xendou the remaining nsps are involved in transcription and replication of the viral genome 134647 single-stranded rna viruses exhibit a faster biological mutation rate due to the lack of proofreading activity of viral rna polymerases 48 however unlike other mutation-prone rna viruses with the exception of the arenaviridae family covs do have limited proofreading capabilities with the nsp14 protein allowing for the enhanced genome size of cov family members 49recombination is another mechanism of evolution in coronaviruses 50 a high recombination frequency was demonstrated in murine hepatitis virus during mixed infection where the majority of viruses recovered after three passages were recombinants 51 recombination was also reported for mers-cov and sars-cov seven putative recombination regions were detected in orf1ab and s protein between sars-cov and six other coronaviruses by in silico analysis of their genomes 52 similarly bioinformatic analysis of mers-cov genomic data revealed 28 recombinant sequences from humans and camels 53 recombination in sars-cov-2 is not yet clearly understood initial studies suggested that it may have occurred in the course of sars-cov-2 evolution 9 while other researchers excluded the possibility of recombination based on a full genome evolutionary analysis investigating putative recombination events 11 to better understand the evolution of sars-cov-2 we performed a phylogenetic analysis of 45 representative coronaviruses from 18 countries including sars-cov sars-cov-2 hcov bat sars cov bat sars-like cov and mers-cov the viral genomes were obtained from the gisaid and ncbi databases multiple sequence alignment was performed using kalign 3 54 a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on whole-genome sequences coding sequences of all genes in iq-tree using the maximum likelihood method ultrafast bootstrap approximation and modelfinder 5556 the tree was drawn to scale with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site the bootstrap values were determined by 1000 replicates the tree was visualized in mega x 57 figure 2 in the analysis we performed all sars-cov-2 samples from the 18 countries clustered together and were close to bat sars or sars-like coronaviruses with wuhan bat cov ratg13 being the closest virus in addition mers-cov and human cov hku1 were very distant from sars-cov-2 figure 2 within mers-cov samples the south china mers-nl13892 clustered separately from other mers-covs the two bat sars-like covs bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 were the second closest viruses from bats to sars-cov-2 figure 2 all sars-covs from china canada england and the us were in a single clusterzhou et al 9 conducted a phylogenetic analysis of sars-cov-2 against previously identified coronaviruses based on their whole-genome sequences main structural protein genes and non-structural protein genes sars-cov-2 clustering was different depending on whether the whole genome or specific genes were used in the analysis for example sars-cov-2 clustered with the members of the subgenus sarbecovirus including the sars-cov 795 identical that caused the global pandemic in 2003 and other bat sars-like viruses 96 identical at the whole-genome level but the topological position within the sarbecoviruses changed when individual genes orf1ab s e m and n were used for clustering 29 based on the whole-genome sequence alignment sars-cov-2 shares 89 identity with bat sars-like covzxc21 82 with sars-cov and 963 with bat cov ratg13 1113 alignment of the predicted protein sequences of sars-cov-2 to those of sars-cov or sars-like coronaviruses revealed a total of 380 amino acid substitutions between these viruses 2 these amino acid substitutions were distributed as follows 348 mutations in nonstructural proteins orf1ab 3a 3b 7a 7b 9b and orf14 27 in s protein and 5 in n protein no amino acid substitutions were detected in e or m proteins indicating that e and m proteins are highly conserved among these viruses it has been reported that sars-cov-2 uses the same cellular receptor hace2 as sars-cov to gain entry into the cell 95859 the analysis of the receptor-binding domains rbd of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 s protein revealed similar binding affinities 60 wu et al 2 found a total of 27 amino acid substitutions in the s protein but not in the receptor-binding motif rbm that directly interacts with hace2 which may affect host tropism these 27 substituted residues were distributed as follows 17 in the s1 subunit 6 in the rbd and 6 in the subdomain sd and 10 in the s2 subunit wan et al 58 reported similarity in the spike protein rbd including rbm of both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 in addition to the presence of several residues in sars-cov-2 rbm that favor the interaction with human ace2 these results agree with the genomic analysis of sars-cov-2 according to which the s2 subunit of the spike protein shares 99 identity with those of two bat sars-like covs sl-covzxc21 and zc45 and of human sars-cov 13 while the sars-cov-2 s2 subunit was conserved the s1 subunit shares an overall 70 identity with those of bat and human sars-cov the rbd core domain of s1 is highly conserved with most of the amino acid differences located in the external subdomain that is responsible for the direct interaction with host receptors 13 investigators have also reported the presence of a polybasic cleavage site and predicted o-linked glycans that are unique to sars-cov-2 s protein differences in sars-cov-2 s protein and the high contagious nature of this virus suggest that sars-cov-2 has evolved via natural selection for binding to human ace2 receptor 61orf3b also differs in sars-cov-2 orf3b deletion mutations in sars-cov do not affect viral replication in vitro 62 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity in addition to its inhibitory effects on interferon ifn expression and signaling 6364 recently a novel short putative protein was identified in orf3b of sars-cov-2 13 however the function of this novel protein is still not known sars-cov-2 orf8 is closer to those of bat sars cov zxc21 and zc45 and distant from that of human sars-cov 13the assessment of genetic diversity among 86 complete or semi-complete genomes of sars-cov-2 viruses revealed three deletions in the genome of isolates from japan usa and australia in addition to many other substitution mutations the deletion mutations were in the orf1ab gene 3-nucleotide and 24-nucleotide deletion and at the 3 end of the genome 10-nucleotide deletion of the 93 substitution mutations 42 changed the amino acid sequence of structural and non-structural proteins 65 the 3- and 24-nucleotide deletions in orf1ab are expected to reduce the protein sequence by 1 and 8 amino acid residues respectively without changing the reading frame but the functional effects have yet to be investigated the alignment of sars-cov-2 reference s protein gene against all sars-cov-2 sequenced genomes from china usa japan australia and taiwan revealed 9997100 identity with 100 query coverage also confirmed by our phylogenetic analysis figure 2 while the identity and coverage for sars-cov s protein gene were 745 and 91 respectively also the s protein gene from bat sars and sars-like coronavirus isolates shared 76583 identity with that of sars-cov-2 this agrees with previous conclusions regarding the evolutionary analysis of sars-cov-2 1144 in the phylogenetic analysis we performed sars-cov-2 viruses were in the same cluster regardless of the geographic region figure 2 these results strongly suggest the possibility of a recent common ancestor for all sars-cov-2 or the transmission of the same virus strain across countries the origins of more than 75 of coronavirus infections are considered zoonotic ie animals are the main source of the outbreaks for example sars-cov was transmitted from palm civets to humans and mers-cov from dromedary camels to humans bats are currently considered a reservoir for all human coronaviruses as mentioned above 571 many coronaviruses are circulating in animals but have not yet infected humans the type of animal that sars-cov-2 originated from is still unclear at the beginning of the outbreak in wuhan china many patients were linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market suggesting animal-to-person spread after retrospectively studying case reports the number of patients that did not have exposure to animal markets has risen indicating person-to-person spread was also occurring at that time 66 sars-cov-2 is closely related to bat coronaviruses and sars-cov 8 a group of researchers reported early in the outbreak that the novel sars-cov-2 has the highest similarity of codon usage bias with snakes 7273 however this method to determine initial host origins is dubious interestingly researchers also reported one amino acid difference in the receptor-binding domain of the s protein of pangolin-cov compared to that of sars-cov-2 suggesting that pangolins might play a role as an intermediate host xiao et al data currently under review another group of researchers reported that the virus originated from bats based on the genome sequence of sars-cov-2 which is 96 identical to bat coronavirus ratg13 there were speculations that sars-cov-2 is a laboratory-engineered cov and leaked directly from a laboratory in wuhan where a bat cov ratg13 was recently reported however there is no evidence to support this allegation 74 recently a group of researchers found that sars-cov-2 replicates poorly in dogs pigs chickens and ducks but efficiently in ferrets and cats 75 scientists are still trying to find the main source of the disease outbreak and identify the definitive intermediate hostsboth established sars-cov mers-cov and novel sars-cov-2 coronaviruses were reported to spread from an infected person to a non-infected person through direct or indirect contact sars-cov-2 infection was reported to be transmitted directly from person to person like most respiratory viruses via close contact with an infected person or through respiratory droplets aerosol produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes these droplets can be inhaled to reach the lung the virus can be indirectly transmitted via touching a surface or an object that was previously contaminated with the virus and then touching the face eyes or mouth 76 and possibly via the fecaloral route 7778 asymptomatic carriers during the incubation period of the virus and patients after recovery from the acute form of the disease are also considered a potential source of virus transmission to healthy persons 1012 interestingly human coronaviruses are able to survive on steel metal wood aluminum paper glass plastic ceramic disposable gowns and surgical gloves for 29 days high temperature 30 c can reduce the persistence period while low temperature 4 c increases the persistence time up to 28 days 79 transmission of the virus vertically from mother to fetus or via breast milk has not been confirmed yet 80 the transmission cycle of coronavirus among animals and humans is shown in figure 3there are many factors that affect sars-cov-2 transmission and spread these factors include but are not limited to 1 travel to or contact with individuals who have recently visited wuhan china or other places experiencing an outbreak 2 close contact with persons who are diagnosed positive for the disease such as healthcare workers caring for patients with sars-cov-2 3 contact with droplets and secretions produced by sneezing or coughing from an infected person and eating or handling wild animals native to china such as bats additionally the risk of infection is higher for the elderly and for patients suffering from pre-existing illnesses such as cardiovascular disease hypertension diabetes and chronic respiratory disease 66 the reported fatality rate based on age is 148 for people 80 years of age 8 for people between 70 and 79 years 36 for people between 60 and 69 years 13 for people between 50 and 59 years 04 for people between 40 and 49 years 02 for people between 10 and 39 years no fatalities have been reported for children under 10 years of age notably the fatality rate is higher in males 28 than in females 17 8182 the estimated incubation period of the novel coronavirus ranges from 2 to 14 days however some cases had an incubation period of 21 24 or 27 days 83 the complete clinical picture of sars-cov-2 is still unclear the disease begins with flu-like symptoms that include fever fatigue dry cough sore throat shortness of breath headache chest tightness chest pain and muscle pain some of sars-cov-2 patients have runny nose nausea vomiting and diarrhea 84 people can be infected without showing symptoms which allows the virus to spread more effectively from person to person complications can occur due to covid-19 leading to severe infections such as pneumonia infection of the lungs kidney failure and death 8 the mild phase of the disease can last up to 2 weeks while severe or critical disease lasts approximately 3 to 6 weeks this analysis was conducted on 55924 confirmed cases additionally the time from the disease onset to the development of severe disease is one week while the time from the onset of symptoms to death ranges from 2 to 8 weeks 82based on the data analysis of 72314 confirmed cases of sars-cov-2 in wuhan city china by 11 february 809 of the cases were mild with flu-like symptoms and patients recovered at home 138 were severe with pneumonia and shortness of breath 47 were critical with respiratory failure and septic shock resulting in organs failure and approximately 2 of the cases were fatal 85 another study was conducted on 99 hospitalized patients and symptoms were classified as follow fever 83 cough 82 shortness of breath 31 muscle ache 11 confusion 9 headache 8 sore throat 5 runny nose 4 chest pain 2 diarrhea 2 and nausea and vomiting 1 8 the strict monitoring of case history in clinically suspicious patients is considered the first step in the early diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection clinically suspicious patients are those who suffer from fever and lower respiratory tract infection symptoms for details see the clinical characteristics section and reside within or have traveled to endemic regions or had close contact with a confirmed or suspected case additionally sars-cov-2 can be transmitted by symptomatic and asymptomatic patients especially to the high-risk group mentioned above for details see the risk assessment section 13the blood profiles of patients suffering from sars-cov-2 infection revealed the following 1 increased c-reactive protein and erythrocytes 2 increased myohemoglobin liver enzymes and muscle enzymes with a high level of d-dimer in severe cases and 3 normal or decreased white blood cell counts and lymphocytes in the early stage of the disease with advanced lymphocytopenia in severe cases 13 in icu patients high levels of plasma granulocyte colony-stimulating factor gcsf ip10 il2 il7 il10 tnf- and mip1a were reported 38 electron microscope examination of sars-cov-2 revealed the typical coronavirus morphology further sars-cov-2 was successfully isolated from human respiratory epithelial cells or balf samples of infected patients using huh7 cells and vero e6 cells the isolated strain was confirmed by immunofluorescent antibody techniques using the cross-reactive nucleoprotein np antibody serum neutralization tests snt using vero e6 cells were conducted to confirm the neutralization activity in igg-positive viral samples 87igm and igg elisa detection kits using bat sarsr-cov rp3 np were developed with no cross-reaction against human coronaviruses except sarsr-cov 80 using these serological tools viral antibody titers were increased in sars-cov-2-infected patients 38 the procedures of elisa for the determination of sars-cov-2 igg were described before 86 nucleic acid detection is the main fastest and most sensitive test for the diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection recently two nested rt-pcr and two real-time rt-pcr assays have been developed with successful detection of the first 25 positive cases of infection in japan 88 three real-time rt-pcr techniques have been designed based on the e rdrp and n genes 89 also scientists established molecular detection tools for sars-cov-2 based on the s gene 86 chest x-ray examination in the early stage of the disease shows interstitial changes and multiple small plaque shadows chest ct scans play an important role in the diagnosis of acute respiratory disease syndrome ards and pneumonia as well as in the early detection of lung parenchymal abnormalities in patients at risk and provide an impression of secondary infection figure 4 assessing these lungs parenchymal abnormalities conveys disease severity to clinicians using artificial intelligence models in the future may be useful in mass screening to allow risk prioritization and help to minimize turnaround time 90 pan et al 91 conducted a retrospective study to elaborate the time course of lung changes during recovery from infection they described findings using international standard nomenclatures such as ground-glass opacity ggo consolidation and crazy paving patterns they established a semi-quantitative scoring system of 5 grades to quantify the degree of involvement based on an area ranging from 0 to 75 the total score ranged from 0 to 25 max and involvement was subpleural random or diffuse they found that in early stages 04 days after the onset of symptoms ggo was the main finding in lower lung lobes in progressive stages 58 days the progression of lung disease involved three patterns of ground-glass consolidation and crazy paving while in peak stages 913 days dense consolidation became the prevalent feature in absorption stages 14 days ggo was detected with no crazy paving and resolution of consolidations 91 more than 75 of sars-cov-2-affected patients suffered from bilateral lung involvement and 71 have multilobe involvement ct examinations of 21 patients showed 29 consolidation and 86 ggo in the chest 899293 another study examined 51 cases by ct and reported that 77 showed pure ggo 75 exhibited ggo with reticular andor interlobular septal thickness 59 had ggo with consolidation while 55 revealed pure consolidation bilateral lung involvement was reported in 86 of cases in 80 of the cases the posterior part of the lung was involved while in 86 the periphery was involved 94in january 2020 the who issued guidance for the clinical management of sars when sars-cov-2 infection was suspected in this guidance the start of emergency treatments immediate implementation of prevention and control strategies early supportive therapy and prevention of sars-cov-2 complications were described in detail 15 so far there are no approved specific antiviral drugs for sars-cov-2 infection therefore preventive measures and inactivation of the virus are essential to stop and control the spread of the disease human coronaviruses can be inactivated using 05 hydrogen peroxide 6271 ethanol 01 sodium hypochlorite 071 formaldehyde 2 glutaraldehyde or 023 povidone iodine within 1 minute other disinfectants such as 002 chlorhexidine digluconate 055 orthophtalaldehyde or 00502 benzalkonium chloride are less effective 79 in light of the urgent clinical demand many drugs are approved to be used for clinical trials against sars-cov-2 infection such as lopinavirritonavir arbidol interferon-alpha favipiravir chloroquine phosphate darunavircobicistat oseltamivir and methylprednisolone the most used antiviral drugs 95 are summarized in table 5generally coronaviruses are not sensitive to current antiviral drugs and high concentrations of drugs effective on these viruses cannot be used in vivo therefore combinations of different therapies have been used for the treatment of coronavirus infections 96 some drug combinations that could be successful for the treatment of sars-cov-2 patients are lopinavir and ritonavir 9798 lopinavirritonavir plus arbidol 99 and ribavirin and interferon 100101 the use of anti-inflammatory drugs such as glucocorticoids il-6 antagonist janus kinase inhibitors jak and choloroquinehydrocholoroquine in sars-cov-2 patients is a dilemma especially in patients suffering from an impaired immune system balancing the riskbenefit ratio is a critical issue corticosteroids may delay the elimination of the virus and increase the risk of secondary infection in addition drugs targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines can only inhibit specific inflammatory factors and thus may not be very effective in curbing the cytokine storm excessive and uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines moreover some anti-inflammatory drugs such as jak block inf- production which is important in fighting the virus 102 additionally fecal transplantation was approved for clinical trials as a therapeutic option for sars-cov-2-related pneumonia based on the promising results obtained from fecal microbiota transplantation in patients suffering from antibiotic-associated diarrhea active ulcerative colitis and other viral infections 103104105106 recently it was found that intestinal microbiota-derived ifn in lung stroma confers protection against viral diseases such as avian influenza and respiratory syncytial virus 103 moreover based on historical records of the effect of antiviral herbs on sars and influenza h1n1 chinese herbal formulas could be an alternative approach for the prevention of sars-cov-2 in a high-risk population 107 if no scientifically based therapeutics are available it was found that sambucus formasana nakai exhibited a strong antiviral effect against human coronavirus nl63 108to date there is no vaccine to prevent sars-cov-2 infection and trials for vaccine development are in the preliminary stages of research several vaccine candidates such as live attenuated adenovirus-vectored recombinant protein and nucleic acid dna and mrna vaccines are in the pipeline 123the epidemiology of sars-cov-2 is still unclear and data availability is limited therefore it is imperative to follow preventive measures and safety precautions issued by health authorities to limit exposure to the virus and to reduce further spread general hygienic measures should be implemented such as 1 washing hands often with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer 2 cough or sneeze etiquette recommending covering of the mouth 3 avoiding touching eyes nose and mouth if the hands are not clean 4 avoiding close contact with sick persons 5 avoiding sharing dishes glasses bedding and other household items with sick people 6 cleaning and disinfection of surfaces that are often touched and 7 staying home from work school and public areas when feeling sick the transmission route of sars-cov-2 is probably not only through cough respiratory droplets andor contaminated surfaces 13124 but also through fecaloral transmission 78 therefore strict hygienic measures should be followed especially in dense cities or agricultural spaces 125 since the sars-cov-2 spread is primarily driven by travel screening of travelers who arrive at airports from pandemic areas for possible sars-cov-2 infection and entry-screening procedures are necessary also general hygienic precautions during travel are highly recommended travelers who suffered from acute respiratory infection should be tested and reported to the respective public health authorities 73 in addition people should be motivated to notify and report about travel history and close contacts in case of sars-cov-2 infectionasymptomatic carriers during the incubation period and patients after recovery from the acute form are also considered potential sources of the virus 1213 strict hygienic measures should be implemented to avoid virus transmission to healthcare workers and other contacts ie placement of sars-cov-2 suspected or confirmed patients in single-person rooms and wearing personal protection equipment ppe such as masks goggles and protective gowns because early diagnosis and detection of asymptomatic carriers of sars-cov-2 are successful factors for the treatment and prevention of transmission health authorities should designate laboratories to implement tests for a rapid and accurate diagnosis 126 the control of coronaviruses is based on biosecurity regarding animals as well as on shifts in food habits including discouraging the consumption of bushmeat and of animal products without appropriate cooking 127 ban of wet marketplaces where live or dead animals are handled should be implemented surveillance among people who have contact with wildlife and improvement of biosecurity regarding wildlife trade are urgently needed to prevent the next pandemic outbreak 128 the epidemiology of sars-cov-2 is still unclear many unresolved questions related to sars-cov-2 epidemiology and pathogenicity pose great challenges for researchers these unresolved questions include what is the origin of sars-cov-2 what is the intermediate host that transmitted the virus from bats why does the virus cause severe disease and mortality in the elderly or those with co-morbidities while it is milder in children are aerosol saliva feces urine and foodborne the only routes of transmission what are the other unknown routes of transmission control of the sars-cov-2 outbreak and future epidemics requires global efforts among medical and veterinary clinicians diagnosticians epidemiologists public health experts vaccinologists pharmaceutical industries economists and governments to implement a one-health approach 128129 these measures must include 1 writing policies and supporting funds required for the implementation of one health prevention and control measures 2 hiring well-trained and professional personnel 3 performing rapid and accurate diagnosis and treatment of infected persons 4 developing and providing vaccines for virus control in humans 5 conducting surveillance among wildlife for the identification and characterization of possible reservoirs and surveillance among people who are in contact with wildlife to identify risk factors in human behaviors and living environment 6 improving hygienic measures 7 assessing the social and economic impacts of covid-19 on the population 8 utilizing veterinary experience in the disinfection of premises and gatherings under the supervision of health authorities to decrease outbreaks in humans 9 providing antiviral drugs for the treatment of the disease in humans and 10 increasing public health awareness about the virus and its transmissionthe sars-cov-2 outbreak started in wuhan city china in december 2019 it is now a global pandemic with 1773084 confirmed cases 111652 deaths and 467074 recoveries as of 13 april 2020 the virus has the potential for rapid and extensive spread between people and countries there are a lot of misleading information and knowledge gaps on the newly emerged sars-cov-2 therefore we reviewed the latest updates about different aspects including epidemiology source of infection transmission dynamics zoonotic potential virus characteristics and discovery of novel strategies for disease control to avoid spillover of infection in the future bats play an important role in the transmission of the infection to humans coronaviruses are genetically diverse and have a high tendency towards frequent genetic mutations and gene recombination which increases the risk of interspecies transmission information about the incubation period can help in establishing an effective quarantine for asymptomatic carriers thus preventing the virus spread from our perspectives and based on the currently available information about the virus and its epidemiology the control of the sars-cov-2 requires an effective and global disease coordination effort including multidisciplinary research efforts one-health approach through collaboration between governments epidemiologists virologists health authorities veterinarians and physicians at this stage of the disease outbreak developing vaccines is crucial to limit the spread of the infection the world is witnessing increasing instances of emerging and reemerging diseases caused by viruses for instance there have been six public health emergency of international concern pheic declarations by the who since 2009 viz h1n1 swine flu polio west africa ebola zika and the ongoing kivu ebola and sarscov2 coronavirus outbreaks eurosurveillance editorial team 2019 2020 two of these viruses h1n1 and sarscov2 have resulted in pandemics within 10 years who 2020the sars outbreak of 20022004 the mers outbreaks since 2012 and the current covid19 outbreak since 2019 demonstrate the potential of coronaviruses especially batderived betacoronaviruses zhou et al 2020 to cause pheics with covid19 having escalated to a global pandemic viruses in a new host humans have the potential to evolve rapidly and present quasispecies diversity eigen mccaskill  schuster 1988 which is a hallmark of rna viruses that exist as a cloud of variants due to low fidelity high polymorphism and viral polymerases lacking the capability to correct errors drew 2011 wilke wang ofria lenski  adami 2001 as a result most variants are a random accumulation of errors useful for tracing aetiology but typically without substantial functional change grubaugh petrone  holmes 2020 unlike most other rna viruses coronaviruses express a 3to5 exoribonuclease that enables the highfidelity replication of their relatively large 2632 kb ssrna genome minskaia et al 2006snijder et al 2003 coronaviruses have a moderate mutation rate 080238  103 nucleotide substitutions per site per year for the sarscov genome zhao et al 2004 allowing a wider evolutionary space to be explored more deliberately this can complicate the outbreak response in terms of rapid development and evaluation of diagnostics vaccines antivirals and antibody therapies as many diverse strains with unknown functional differences exist figure 1this is particularly exacerbated by increased movement of people enabled by global air travel animals and goods spreading new viruses across the worlds population and exposing them to huge variations in environment demographics age structure socioeconomic status comorbidities and equitable access to health care the sheer number of these interconnected influencing factors often makes an unfolding situation hard to comprehend fully and challenges the traditional virology and public health disciplines by rendering them less effective in coping with the spread of the virusbioinformatic approaches may be able to better inform epidemiology and responses to transboundary viruses by synthesizing complex information more effectively and systematically enabled by the advances in genomic sequencing technology eg oxford nanopore illumina and the willingness to share the sequenced information in the public domain eg genbank gisaid bioinformatic approaches developed in the human domain have enabled comparative analysis of the emerging genomic diversity of a virus as it spreads throughout a host populationfor the ongoing covid19 outbreak as illustrated in figure 1 applying in silico approaches can rapidly provide answers to questions like is the first sequenced sarscov2 genome often called the reference genome in gisaid genbank etc closest to the original or true reference strain which entered humans which may not have been sequenced andor which may still be circulating with minimal mutations combined with epidemiological or experimental evidence bioinformatics can help address questions like are there one or multiple circulating strains and are they different to the most virulent ones if yes can we identify the molecular basis finally can synthetic consensus sequences be used to represent the genetic diversity of individual isolates in larger circulating clustersanswers to these questions are not just of academic interest they can help inform outbreak response and development and evaluation of diagnostics vaccines and countermeasures for instance outbreak response efforts including vaccine evaluation should focus on the most prevalent circulating strain lest we may end up rejecting acceptable candidates by raising the efficacy threshold too high but it would be desirable to evaluate therapeutics against the most virulent strain however with the field not yet using bioinformatic tools to their fullest potential current data collection practices are not capturing the information necessary for advanced analysis for example pathogen sequences derived from patients are typically not annotated with deidentified disease progression and other clinically relevant information and this in turn hampers the identification of the most virulent strain or associating pathogen properties with genomic modificationshere we use bioinformatic analysis to identify emerging trends among the sarscov2 isolates from this we sought to identify the most representative strains for animal models and preclinical research in particular which strains among the emerging australian isolates are good choices for animal model development and which ones are not representativetwo australian isolates betacovaustraliavic022020 and betacovaustraliasa012020 were sequenced with the miseq platform illumina inc in brief rna was purified from each isolate using a directzol rna miniprep kit zymo research purified rna was reverse transcribed using a taqman reverse transcription kit applied biosystems with random octamers linked to a specific primer sequence followed by secondstrand cdna synthesis using klenow dna polymerase i promega complementary dna was further amplified using primers specific to the sequences added to the random octamers used for reverse transcription with a kapa hifi hotstart kit roche resulting dna was purified using a dna clean and concentrator kit zymo research fragmentation and dualindex library preparation was conducted using a nextera xt dna library preparation kit illumina inc and denatured libraries were sequenced using a 300cycle miseq reagent kit v2 illumina inc sequencing reads were trimmed for quality and mapped to the published reference sequence betacovwuhanhu12019 genbank accession number nc0455122 using geneious 1114 consensus genome sequences for the isolates were generated for analysisall available viral sequences were downloaded from gisaid on 05032020 see appendix s3 elbe  bucklandmerrett 2017 filtering for complete sequences of human origin 187 genomes in total lowquality sequences defined as sequences with an n content greater than 1 were filtered out leaving 178 strains in total we also included one recently reported viral sequence from the european virus archive global refsku 026v03883 and the two australian sequences in the full data setthis data set of 181 sequences was aligned against each other using muscle v3831 madeira et al 2019 based on the alignments we could see significant variation at the ends of the sequences figure s1 likely due to sequencing artefacts and errors preventing the full viral genomes from being sequenced to reduce the impact of potential sequencing errors we wrote a custom perl script to trim the sequences such that only positions with 95 coverage were retained this trimming entailed removing the first 101 and last 72 bp from the alignmentsonce trimmed and converting all u to t we identified 54 sequences that were identical to limit the effect of duplicate sequences on subsequent analysis we collapsed these into a single entry these collapsed sequences are summarized in table s1to validate the methodology we have included sequences from other coronaviruses we chose a mixture of controls as follows 7 sars sequences of human origin genbank accession numbers ay2741193 ay2914511 ay5029231 ay5029321 ay5590831 ay5590841 and ay5590871 10 sars sequences of bat origin accession numbers ky4171421 to ky4171521 4 mers sequences of human origin accession numbers kj4771021 kt0061492 kt0264531 and kt0291391 and 2 mers sequences of bat origin accession numbers mg5968021 and mg5968031the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was generated from the above alignments using raxmlng kozlov darriba flouri morel  stamatakis 2019 the evolutionary model used was a general time reversable model with gammadistributed rate heterogeneity and invariant sites gtr  g  i we use this mode since it is the most general model and has been proposed to produce equal trees to optimally selected models abadi azouri pupko  mayrose 2019 the tree was visualized using itol letunic  bork 2019 as a midpoint rooted tree and shows the likely evolutionary relationships between the sampled strainsevery organism and potentially isolate can have a unique genomic signature based on the composition of their genomic sequence to quantify this signature we determined the kmer frequency counting of all possible strings of length k in the sequence of the virus has emerged as an alternative to phylogenetic trees in other disciplines sims jun wu  kim 2009 the conceptual distance between all isolates can then be visualized by running a principal component analysis pca over all genomic signatures to reduce this highdimensional kmer frequency vector into a twodimensional space jolliffe  cadima 2016 please see appendix s1 for more details of this methodcustom scripts were used to calculate the kmer frequency for each sequence using a k of 10 sims et al 2009 kmers containing ambiguous bases ie ns were removed we then calculated the relative proportion of each kmer resulting in a frequency vector we used the pca implementation of python scikitlearn to reduce the genomic signatures containing 1048576 10mer proportions into a vector containing two principal components finally custom scripts were used to compare the genomic signatures for all aforementioned coronavirus sequencesthe evolutionary structure of the 181 isolates as determined by the phylogenetic tree reveals three major clusters c1c3 figure 2 the c1 cluster mainly represents wuhan and isolates captured early on c2 and c3 contain later isolates such as sydney3 australiavic01 and franceidf0372 in c2 and australiansw01 australiaqld013 australiavic02 and usawa1 in c3 the three clusters are separated by distinct mutations table 1 but contain a substantial number of other unique mutations which we define as diversity within the cluster these individual mutations are outside of the established hotspots of diversity wang et al 2020 as shown in figure s4 which are predominantly of concern for pcr primer design rather than aetiology there may also be three additional clusters emerging c46 with c4 capturing the suspected community spread from lombardy narrative genomic analysis of covid19 spread nd c5 regionally mixed asia and north amerika and c6 from australia and asia notably australiansw057 see fully annotated tree in figure s5this finding is different to tang et al 2020 who postulate two clusters s and l their analysis was only on 103 gisaid isolates and includes betacoronaviruses from bats which roots the tree differently and merges c1 and c2 however as the aetiology is not fully demonstrated especially with the intermediate vector yet unknown artificially rooting the tree by introducing a distant relative may bias the resultsirrespective of the root placement both trees allow the assessment of individual isolates that are not part of major branches by being genetically divergent offshoots for example sydney2 appears to be an offshoot from wuhanhu1 upon further inspection of the sydney2 strand we discovered a 41bp deletion which overlaps the infectious bronchitis virus ibv motif at the 3 end goebel taylor  masters 2004 inspecting other isolates australiavic01 has also a 10bp deletion within the genomic location of the 41bp deletion figure s3 despite this similarity australiavic01 was placed into c2 and sydney2 in c1 since australiavic01 contains the g26144t mutation indicative of c2 which sydney2 lacks see table 2 for a list of referenced isolatesa more systematic sequence analysis revealed that many isolates have deletions in their core genome table s2 while these deletions appear to be specific to each isolate figure s4 their effect on virus structure or function might be pronounced for example australiavic01 and sydney2 may have the ibv motif disrupted with implications for replication while usaca6 and japanai004 may have disruption in the nonstructural protein 1 nsp1 with implications for host gene expression figure s3while the full impact of these genomic variations can only be confirmed through functional genomics experiments coronaviruses proofreading ability likely lifts them above random accumulation of errors as such having a methodology able to take deletions into consideration when calculating genomic distance is desirableaiming to overcome the limitations of phylogenetic tree approaches we also investigated whether an alignmentfree approach can be used to understand how the genomic content of different sarscov2 isolates changes over time and with respect to each other by also taking deletions into account we therefore calculated the frequency of all possible 10mers across each viral genome followed by principal component analysis pca to reduce the highdimensional kmer vector space into a twodimensional image for visual comparisonwe first demonstrate the methods ability to faithfully separate distant coronavirus strains by comparing all sarscov2 against 17 sars and 6 mers isolates as shown in figure 3 inset this alignmentfree approach separates the isolates into their three respective clusters of sarscov2 sars and mers this indicates that the genetic distance between the different isolates of the same coronavirus strain is relatively small while there are substantial differences between the different coronavirus virus strains predictably we separated mers isolates into two subclusters reflecting their different host origins human and batto further investigate how the genomic content of different sarscov2 viruses relates to each other we reran the pca analysis on just the sarscov2 sequences here the genomic signatures of isolates that are likely to be closely related cluster together eg australiaqld01 australiaqld03 samples from close family relations while strains separated by time are far apart eg wuhanhu1 collection date 31122019 and australiansw05 collection date 2822020of the australian isolates sydney3 and australiansw01 were the closest to wuhanhu1 which is consistent with the phylogenetic results and reflects the fact that these sequences have only mutational changes in their core sequences compared to wuhanhu1 table s2 however this alignmentfree method positions isolates with deletions viz australiavic01 and canadaonvido01 further away from wuhanhu1 than in the phylogenetic tree demonstrating the ability of the kmer method to represent deletions accurately see supplemental table 7of the 181 isolates we found that singapore4 taiwanntu01 finland1 usail1 and shenzhenszth001 were among the furthest from wuhanhu1 data not shown for both singapore4 and taiwanntu01 this is due to these being shorter than the core sequences so the kmer fingerprint accurately reflects the missing sequences meanwhile usail1 and finland1 contained several ambiguous bases effectively shortening the length of similar sequence so the method correctly places them further from the other isolateswhile the kmer approach is not as suggestive as phylogenetic trees with respect to visualizing the potential transmission route eg lombardy it may more accurately reflect the fluidity of changes cloud of variants and capture recombination events graham  baric 2010 an example is italyinmi1 which has mutations in common with both sydney3 c1 cluster g26144t and chongqingivdccq001 c3 cluster g11083t making it impossible to definitively place it in the discrete phylogenetic tree it was placed in the c2 cluster figure 2 while the pca plot shows the fluid evolution placing it between the italian and australian isolate figure 3more generally phylogenetic analysis is based on the presence of shared mutations for example two strains which share most snps are likely to be closely related and therefore exist on neighbouring branches in the phylogenetic tree in comparison an alignmentfree method such as kmer signatures is more concerned with global similarities and difference for example changes averaged across the whole genome rather than at specific locations this can be informative about highlevel similarities between genomes for example evolution of distinct genomic islands with common functions or recombination events while this does not create visually clear clades it offers a more holistic representation of pairwise distances between all isolates together with clinical information this could hence help determine the most virulent strains figure 1currently the process of determining which isolate to use for animal models is less informed than it could be due to the lack of shared genomic information and readily available bioinformatic methodologies especially towards the beginning of an outbreak for example while china published the genomic sequence of sarscov2 zhou et al 2020 patient samples or virus isolates were not made available and with reverse genetics of a large rna virus taking time thao et al 2020 countries had to wait for imported cases australias doherty institute was the first in the world to isolate the virus australiavic01 and made it available for preclinical animal models to the authors csiro 2020 public health england etc this practical consideration dictated the initial choice however with more isolates to choose from subsequently a more informed approach can be taken figure 1 two questions are pertinent is vic01 an appropriate strain to continue with further development and characterization of the animal model if not what options are more representative and appropriatewhile nextstrain narrative genomic analysis of covid19 spread nd is a powerful aid in visualizing the available strains in real time it currently relies on phylogeny only and thus may be hampered in its conclusions in this section we offer a static view of the alignmentfree approach for the currently used strains for animal model research that we know of and interpret their likely representativeness with respect to future evolution of the virusaccording to the phylogenetic tree shown in figure 4a the main clusters are represented by the current animal models that is c1 is represented by germanybavpat1 and human 2019ncov whose core sequence is identical though they seem to be halfway to the c4 cluster suspected lombardy cluster c2 is represented by australiavic01 and franceidf0372 and c3 is represented by usawa1 note that scotlandcvr01 was removed due to its high n content 23 however with phylogenetic methods focusing on the presence of shared mutations rather than the overall genomic similarity eg shared evolved functionality the assumption that current animal models adequately cover the evolutionary space of the actively circulating virus might be misleading as the pca plot indicates figure 4b here the topleft and bottomright areas seem to be underrepresentedto join the strainetiology of phylogenetic approaches with the more fluid distance measure of alignmentfree methods we created the consensus sequences of the major and emerging clusters appendix s2 and reran the pca analysis to find more robust and future relevant isolates figure 4b of the existing animal models only usawa1 is close to a consensus c3 all other clusters have different representative isolates viz c1 directly overlaps wuhanhu1 c2 is nearest to zhejiangwz01 c3 directly overlaps australiansw01 c4 directly overlaps switzerland1000477796 c5 directly overlaps vietnamvr0338142 and c6 is nearest to australiansw07the central location of germanybavpat1 and franceidf0372 may reflect a broad representation across multiple clusters in contrast to canadaonvido01 and australiavic01 which are located further away from the sarscov2 centre marked by the rectangle in figure 4b inset in this outer view the dominant driver for placing isolates away from the centre is missing bases either due to deletions missing sequences at the tails or ambiguous bases the vertical lines hence cluster isolates with a similar number of missing bases for example australiavic01 and canadaonvido01 have 10bp deletions while koreakcdc05 and australiasydney02 have a 40bp shorter sequence and 42bp deletion respectivelyamong the australian strains the genomic distance analysis marks australiasydney2 as a less optimal target for animal models compared to say australiavic01 australiavic02 and australiasa01 in no particular order in this context usawa1 available through bei could also be a good choice due to its central location likely ability to represent especially the newly emerging clusters and comparability of animal models with nonhuman primate studies in the united states which have chosen this on the basis of being readily available clinical observations eg severity of symptoms and mortality if applicable and experimental observations eg growth and titre can refine the choice of isolate for animal model development with further refinement based on observations from animal challenge studies such as shedding of the virus associated histopathology and clinical signs if applicableit is clear that at this early stage of the pandemic our initial questions around the number of circulating strains and their virulence cannot be answered with the currently available epidemiological and clinical data even when applying sophisticated computational analysis tools however we have demonstrated that creating synthetic consensus sequences can be used to demarcate the evolutionary space already claimed by the virus while sarscov2 does have a proofreading exoribonuclease domain in nsp14 its genetic drift remains a point of uncertainty with respect to the longlasting efficacy of a vaccine candidates currently being developedin conclusion joining bioinformatics epidemiological and experimental results can help inform animal model choice for efficient preclinical responses callaway 2020 moving away from purely practical considerations towards a more deliberate approach that assesses current and future characteristics of isolate choices will lead to a better coverage of actively circulating strains figure 1 with more sharing of isolates internationally and information collected about patientdeidentified details of case severity and outcome more sophisticated machine learning approaches can be generated to assist in triaging and treatment choices additional information such as comorbidities socioeconomic and smoking status may also help in anticipating public health demand furthermore releasing the full highthroughput sequencing data sets rather than the consensus sequences would allow a more detailed exploration of the existing quasispecies to further improve isolate selectionthe authors declare no conflict of interestethical statement is not

the polyprotein 1ab pp1ab is the largest protein of coronaviruses that through proteolytic cleavage is divided into 16 mature nonstructural proteins nsps the nsps are involved in replication and transcription of the viral genome and are responsible for the cleavage of the polyprotein thus making them attractive antiviral drug targets

 pp1ab of sarscov2 has not been thoroughly analyzed despite the high similarity between pp1ab proteins it could be possible to identify distinguishable regions representing molecular signatures for the specific detection of virus strains or to track its evolutive history in this short communication we expound a comparative sequence analysis of pp1ab protein of sarscov2the analysis was performed using the phylogeneticstructural sequence analysis sequence comparisons were made in a phylogenetic order

 prediction of transmembrane helices tmhs segments in nsp6 protein showed that l37f does not alter the secondary structure of the adjacent transmembrane domains figure s1 in fact the mutation l37f is predicted to be outside of the membrane as part of an unstructured coil segment 32slffflfyen that connects the first 1231 residues and the second 4160 residues tmhs figure s1 strikingly the position 37 of nsp6 protein is a val residue that is conserved in all analyzed sarbecoviruses data s1 except in sarscov2 leu so the mutation of the aliphatic leu residue for the aromatic phe residue in this conserved position probably has functional implications although leu and phe are both hydrophobic residues the phe residue could also perform cation interactions that could affect the proteinprotein interactions in the l37f mutant the structural impact of this mutation can not be determined since experimental data in the protein data bank are not available for homology modeling of nsp6 using a single or multiple templates eg swissmodel server phyre2 etcinterestingly a virus isolated from a japanese male gisaid epiisl407084 with no critical pneumonia patient status described in gisaid database has eight deleted amino acids at position 32 to 39 aa of pp1ab nsp1 table s2 since nsp1 is a virulence factor that inhibits host gene expression
10
 the implications of this deletion are worth to be addressed however since the deletion is present in just one isolated virus this finding needs to be confirmed by other genome sequencesfor the second part of the analysis we compared pp1ab of sarscov2 to those of the clade 2 of sarbecoviruses batslcovzc45 mg772933 batslcovzxc21s mg772934 batslcovratg13 mn996532 the pairwise comparison performed with sdt indicated that the most related protein was the one belonging to batslcovratg13 986 also proteins from batslcovzc45 and batslcovzxc21s showed a pairwise identity above 95 to determine if the identity is preserved throughout its length we compared the pp1ab sequences from these viruses via similarity plot analysis the analysis showed that pp1ab of batslcovzc45 and batslcovzxc21s displayed three dissimilarity regions that surround residues 1000 877 4670 914 and 6590 916 figure s2 the pairwise identity between sarscov2 and batslcovratg13 is conserved throughout its lengthscrutiny on the alignment allowed us to note that regions of residues 4631 and 6565 of batslcovzc45 and batslcovzxc21s were more similar to those from viruses of clade 3 rather than sarscov2 or batslcovratg13 these findings explain why the orf1b of batslcovzc45 and batslcovzxc21s are clustered with those of sarbecoviruses from clade 3

 suggesting a recombination history between these viruses with clade 3 memberswhen we analyzed the position 1000 of the pp1ab alignment we identified rich glutamine 22 amino acid signature in pp1ab of sarscov2 asscov2 this signature is 42 aa in length dsqqtvgqqdgsednqtttiqtivevqpqlemeltpvvqtie placed between the amino acids 983 and 1024 of pp1ab which correspond to the nterminal of papainlike protease 165 aa to 206 aa specifically asscov2 is located in the flexible acidicdomain ac domain rich in glutamic acid figure 1
11
 ac domain is flanked by the ubiquitinlike and the adpribose1phosphatase domains
10
 the functional implication of the ac domain extension conferred by asscov2 needs to be studiedthe asscov2 is partially conserved in the pp1a protein of batslcovzc45 identity 405 indels 6 and virtually missing in batslcovzxc21s identity 16 indels 27 while asscov2 is very conserved in pp1ab of batslcovratg13 identity 76 indels 0 figure 1 these results suggest that sarscov2 is closely related to batslcovratg13 rather than batslcovzc45 or batslcovzxc21s the alignment of the pp1ab from members of the subgenus sarbecovirus showed that the asscov2 is exclusive of the novel coronavirus and slightly preserved in batslcov from clade 2 figure 1 we found the same results when we compared the pp1ab of members of the genus betacoronavirus table s3 data s1 a search in the nucleotide and protein genbank databases displayed that asscov2 is codified only in genomes of sarscov2 also no proteins other than pp1ab of sarscov2 and batslcovratg13 partially have the signature because we determined that the presence of asscov2 in human coronaviruses is restricted only to sarscov2 we suggest that their respective 126 nucleotide sequence can be used to design alternative specific pcr diagnosis for sarscov2the genome sequences of two sarbecoviruses isolated from the pangolin manis javanica were recently released in gisaid database one of them was collected in guangzhou china in 2019 pangolinbetacovguandong2019 epiisl410721 and the other one was collected in guangxi china in 2017 pangolinbetacovguangxi2017 epiisl410538 phylogenetic analysis based on genome sequence showed that both viruses collected from pangolins are clustered in the clade 2 figure 2 the pairwise comparison of pp1ab protein showed that the protein of pangolinbetacovguandong2019 is 94 identical to those of sarscov2 while the pp1ab of pangolinbetacovguangxi2017 has an identity of 92 since both pangolin viruses are grouped in clade 2 and their pp1ab proteins are identical to those of sarscov2 we analyzed the alignment of its pp1ab protein to determine if the asscov2 is present figure 1 the homologous region of asscov2 pp1ab of pangolinbetacovguandong2019 has 34 aa that showed an identity of 35 whereas the homologous region of asscov2 in pangolinbetacovguangxi2017 have 36 aa which are completely different from those of sarbecoviruses figure 1 these findings suggest that the pp1ab of sarscov2 is more closely related to pp1ab of batslcovratg13 than to pp1ab of coronaviruses isolated from chinese pangolins since the region that encodes the pp1ab protein represents about 71 of sarscov2 genome we suggest that it is less likely that the novel human coronavirus has been arising directly from the viruses isolated from pangolinsfirst reports focused on the genetic characterization of sarscov2 suggested that this virus has a recombinant origin
2
 our results indicate that most probably a recombination event did not happen in the first half of the viral genome orf1ab under this idea an alternative explanation for sarscov2 origin is that batslcovratg13 collected 6 years ago is the progenitor of sarscov2 which has evolved since the collection date by genetic drift before infecting humans three observations support the hypothesis 1 the high pairwise identity of pp1ab from sarscov2 and batslcovratg13 is preserved throughout its length figure s2 2 the exclusive asscov2 of the novel coronavirus is conserved in batslcovratg13 figure 1 3 the high pairwise identity 963 shared by sarscov2 and batslcovratg13 is preserved in its whole genome only a slight dissimilarity region is displayed in the orf of spike protein

although the origin of sarscov2 does not appear to be caused by recent genetic recombination at least acquisition of genetic material must have given place to asscov2 since members of subgenus sarbecovirus from clade 1 and clade 3 have at the minimum 25 missing aa in its homologous region of asscov2 and members of clade 2 have sequence traces of asscov2 except by betacovpangolinguangxi2017 figures 1 we suggest the viral ancestor of clade 2 members probably gained the genetic material figure 2 in this scenario the ancestral asscov2 have been changed over the time by genetic drift evolving to the actual asscov2 this probably explains why we could not infer the origin of these signature based on the available sequences from databases although there is a possibility that the organism that donated this segment has not been discovered yet regarding the pp1ab of pangolinbetacovguangxi2017 we suggest that a recombination event in the genomic region of the that encodes the first 3500 amino acids of pp1ab probably happened since the asscov2 is no present in this virus and the simplot analysis showed several dissimilarity peaks in this region when the pp1ab of pangolinbetacovguangxi2017 is compared with either of clade 2 members of sarbecoviruses figure s3the asscov2 located in the acidicdomain of papainlike protein from sarscov2 and batslcovratg13 guided us to suggest that the novel humanpathogenic coronavirus probably emerged by genetic drift from batslcovratg13 the implication of asscov2 in papainlike protein structure arrangement and function is something worth to be exploredthe authors declare that there are no conflict of interestspathogens mostly emerge in densely human populated areas as did the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov which had the potential to cause the first viral pandemic of the xxist century who 2003 jones et al 2008 sars-cov most likely originated from bats through an intermediate species that could be the masked palm civet paguma larvata viverridae or another bridge-host itself very probably contaminated by a sars-like cov from horseshoe bats song et al 2005 li et al 2006 cui et al 2007 several elements indicate that this bridge-host could presumably be a carnivora as suggested by both detections in wild animals from markets or experimental infections guan et al 2003 van den brand et al 2008 several other mammalian or avian species are susceptible to coronaviruses infection displaying enteric hepatic neurological or respiratory tropism but little is known about their viral ecology and host interactions coronaviruses are members of the order nidovirales which contains three families of single stranded positive rna viruses arteriviridae coronaviridae and roniviridae coronaviridae are divided in two subfamilies coronavirinae and torovirinae because of serological and genotypic differences coronaviruses were traditionally divided into three groups labeled group i ii and iii gonzlez et al 2003 gorbalenya et al 2004 these three groups have recently been elevated at the genus level and named respectively alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus by the coronavirus study group of the international committee for taxonomy of viruses thus invalidating the coronavirus genus name httptalkictvonlineorgmediap1230aspx as other nidovirales coronaviridae such as sars-cov possess a mutation prone rna-dependent rna-polymerase rdrp associated with high genome mutability castro et al 2005 furthermore they frequently recombine in vivo lai et al 1985 makino et al 1986 keck et al 1987 jia et al 1995 herrewegh et al 1998 lee and jackwood 2000 stadler et al 2003 this genetic variability confers to coronaviruses a high potential of evolution that allows them to sometimes overcome species barriers and host specificity baric et al 1995 baric et al 1997 thackray and holmes 2004 from a more general viewpoint these characteristics are known to account for the frequent involvement of rna viruses in disease emergence domingo and holland 1997 chomel 1998 daszak et al 2000 cleavel et al 2001 woolhouse and gowtage-sequeria 2005until now asian sars-related coronavirus sarsr-cov from betacoronavirus-b group  fig 1
a rna has been detected in only one bat family the rhinolophidae gray 1825 table 2 therefore this monogeneric bat family is considered as the host at the origin of the deadly sars-cov outbreak lau et al 2005 however other bat families are involved in the maintenance and the diversification of a wide range of coronavirus species belonging to both alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus genera ie vespertillionidae phyllostomidae pteropodidae molossidae and hipposideridae families have been positively tested for coronavirus nucleic acid chu et al 2006 tang et al 2006 dominguez et al 2007 carrington 2008 brandao et al 2008 tong et al 2009 pfefferle et al 2009 whether or not another bat family could be involved in addition to rhinolophidae in the natural history of betacornaviruses would have been an interesting question but since the discovery of sarsr-cov in wildlife most of the attention and sampling efforts have been focusing on rhinolophidae table 2 several species from this family were shown to carry different sarsr-cov such as sarsr rhinolophidae bat coronavirus strain rp3 in rhinolophus pearsoni and sarsr rhinolophidae bat coronavirus strain rf1 in rhinolophus ferrumequinum in the chinese provinces of guangxi and hubei respectively lau et al 2005 li et al 2005 tang et al 2006 the sampling pressure on both rhinolophidae 1148 samples in 12 species  table 2 and vespertilionidae 900 samples in 17 species  table 2 has induced an over representation of these families compared to others lau et al 2005 li et al 2005 tang et al 2006 by contrast hipposideridae 206 samples in 6 species were under-represented in previous studies poon et al 2005 woo et al 2006 the higher northern distribution limit of rhinolophidae versus hipposideridae may partially explain the sampling bias in non-southern chinese provinces fig 1b this bias illustrates the need for testing other sympatric species for betacoronaviruses to study their natural history and emergence processthe biogeography and the natural history of the betacoronavirus-b species among which are sarsr-covs remain poorly described however betacoronavirus have been detected in china africa europe and even australia guan et al 2003 lau et al 2005 li et al 2005 mller et al 2007 tong et al 2009 quan et al 2010 drexler et al 2010 fig 1b the biogeographical origin of the ancestors of sarsr-covs from betacoronavirus-b sub-group is therefore far more extended than the epicentre of the human epidemic southern china understanding the biogeography of this group would be essential for assessing the risk for emergence of another sars-cov like agent south-china and its pearl river delta combined various ecological and anthropic factors that have led the sars-cov to emerge but the distribution of the viral clade at the origin of sars-cov is much wider than this region and many locations still remain to be investigatedemergence results from a combination of numerous factors environmental changes ecological climatic and agricultural whether they are man-driven or not schrag and wiener 1995 kuiken et al 2003 globalization trade or travel and societal changes land-use demography are among the most reported ones reperant 2010 but others have been highlighted recently like the hosts phylogenetic relationships daszak 2010 streicker et al 2010 the variation of biodiversity keesing et al 2010 and species interactions in ecological communities whether between hosts or between hosts and pathogens cleavel et al 2001 woolhouse and gowtage-sequeria 2005 reperant 2010 consequently the biogeography and host-pathogen relationships of betacoronavirus-b are pivotal to understanding their radiation the diversity of the sarsr-cov has been described by an increasing number of published studies and the number of discovered and sequenced viral taxa has improved the accuracy of the phylogenetic reconstruction of this groupin this study we explored the biodiversity and the ecology of coronavirinae enriched the current phylogeny and challenged the biogeography of this clade more particularly we focused on the ecology of the betacoronavirus-b sub-group fig 1a by testing hypotheses on the origination of these viruses not only in rhinolophidae but also in their sister taxa hipposideridae considering that hipposideridae might host a diverse community of coronaviruses comparable to that of rhinolophidae because of their phylogenetic proximity and comparable diversity nunn et al 2004 simmons 2007 it is very probable that the prevalence and diversity of coronaviruses hosted by this family has been underestimated because of biased sampling table 2  lau et al 2005 li et al 2005 tang et al 2006 we hypothesize also that some bat taxa could play a refuge role for betacoronaviruses and therefore constitute a source of infection for other species consistently with the recent application of the theory of island biogeography macarthur and wilson 1967 to emerging pathogens reperant 2010 this study is particularly focused on but not restricted to betacoronavirus in hipposideridae in south-east asia table 1
from 20062008 samples feces urine and oral swabs were collected from bats at 26 sites in thailand fig 1b and table 1 sampling locations were selected considering land cover and geological data as forests are known to enhance biodiversity harvey et al 2006 trisurat et al 2010 and limestone hills harbour numerous caves the rocky forest-covered hills surrounded by cultivated lowlands considered as potential refuge areas were particularly sought sampling sessions covered an area of approximately 800 km from north to south thailand by 300 km from west to east dates and locations are described in table 1 and fig 1b sites were sometimes sampled several times to confirm the results to screen another population or species of bats or to assess a putative long-lasting infection of a given colony table 1 samples were collected from 25 species of bats and were divided and preserved in two different media i modified minimum essential medium antibiotic supplemented viral transportation medium to preserve entire virus particles integrity and ii rnalater rna preservation medium to limit rna degradation both kept on ice before and immediately after collection prior to liquid nitrogen conservation in the field each sample was immediately aliquoted into four tubes including absolute backup and kept at 80 c before rna extraction traceability was assured by assigning a unique number to each sample handling of animals was conducted in accordance with the american society of mammalogists guidelines for the capture handling and care of mammals gannon and sikes 2007 trapping sessions were performed using harp-traps flip-nets and hand-nets bats were transferred to individual clean cotton bags immediately after being captured and kept in a dark cool and quiet place for one to a few hours immediately after sample collection bats were released where they were trapped particular attention was paid i to avoid disturbance inside the cave and near the colony ii to disinfect material and shoes between sampling sessions and study sites and iii to preserve the surroundings as first encounteredqiamp viral rna mini kit qiagen was used for rna extraction following the manufacturers instructions rna was eluted in 60 l rnase-free saline buffer 7 l were immediately used for the reverse transcription reaction and the remaining 53 l were aliquoted and kept at 80 c for subsequent detection assays the amount and quality of the extracted rna was measured using nanodrop and agilent techniques prior to reverse transcription mueller et al 2004 gallagher and desjardins 2006complement dna synthesis was performed with m-mlv reverse transcriptase bio-active and random hexamer primers random hexamer primers were used at a final ratio of 015 g for 1 g of rna then 5 l of rt products were used in 25 l final volume pcr reaction targeting a 438 nucleotide fragment of the rdrp coding region pcr primers were designed from the rdrp coding region by selecting a highly conserved region nsp12 among all coronavirinae sequences available from online public databases in august 2007 assuming a higher mutation rate for the third codon position and according to the published sequence variations degenerate primers were designed batcov pol 15197 forward primer 5-ggttgggaytayccwaartgtga-3 and batcov pol 15635 reverse primer 5-ccatcrtcmgaharaatcatcata-3 respectively at position 15197 to 15219 and 15635 to 15614 on bat sars-cov rf1 reference sequence dq412042 in order to increase both the sensitivity and the specificity of the detection a third primer were designed and combined with the previous ones in a semi-nested pcr batcov pol nested 15419 forward nested primer 5-gcnaatwstgtntttaacat-3 at the position 15419 to 15438 on the same reference sequence the first pcr produced a fragment of 438 nucleotides and the semi-nested pcr confirmed the detection and enhanced significantly the detection limit of the semi-nested pcr by amplifying a 216 base pairs fragment from the first amplicon contaminations were avoided by observing strict lab procedures carrying out at each step mix pcri pcrii in a uv cabinet and using bleached plastic-ware manipulations included extraction negative controls at the beginning and at the end of each sample series as well as several pcr negative controls per run the sequencing of the 438 nucleotides pcr products was performed in both directions using the external primersfifty microliters of sample preserved in modified minimum essential medium antibiotic supplemented viral transportation medium were inoculated into 12 wells plates where subconfluent cell monolayers were grown madindarby canine kidney mdck vero and vero clone e6 cells were used in these assays mdck were chosen because carnivora are highly suspected to have efficiently contributed to the transmission from bats to humans paguma larvata nyctereutes procyonides melogale moschata guan et al 2003 and several species are susceptible to sars-cov infection martina et al 2003 the vero cell line is known to efficiently replicate sars-cov qinfen et al 2004 cells were cultivated in minimum essential medium supplemented with 120 gml of streptomycin 120 unitsml of penicillin and 10 of ftal calf serum fcs once confluence was nearly reached the supernatant was removed and samples were added on the cell monolayer and left at 20 c on a rocking agitator for 60 min then 2 ml of the same medium 2 fcs were added to each well plates were then incubated at 37 c and daily checked on a phase contrast inverted microscope for cpe occurrencea 304 or 333 nucleotide region was selected within the sequences from both amplicons ha acov r for 304 or hl bcov t respectively the corresponding region from 60 taxa available in databases were added to the matrix used in the phylogenetic reconstructions1 firstly a dynamic homology approach implemented in poy v412 was used wheeler 1996 janies and wheeler 2002 varn et al 2010 this method did not need any prior alignment because this step was performed during the cladogram diagnosis and therefore established the putative homology statements during the tree reconstruction poy was used under parsimony as the optimality criterion wagner algorithm complemented with the tree bisection reconnection swapping algorithm tbr perturbation injection ratcheting and fuse iterations steps nixon 1999 these combined steps provided a reasonably fast and accurate way to better explore the tree space by escaping from local optima although rdrp is a conserved gene and the matrix included a great number of taxa resampling taxa tests were used to evaluate whether this matrix was subjected to the long branch attraction phenomenon which could constitute a limitation of some phylogenetic reconstructions this limitation could be particularly true in the case of high evolution rate and very limited number of taxa when combined with static homology approach of molecular characters the over-representation of sub-groups by several similar sequences was avoided as it could artificially report changes on branches located between internal nodes leading to the long branch attraction issue2 secondly a probabilistic approach bayesian implemented in beast drummond and rambaut 2007 was applied to the same data set sequences were previously aligned using sea-view gouy et al 2010 under the muscle algorithm edgar 2004 and resulted in a frank border matrix showing a unique gap of three codons for four sequences bulbul trush munia and asian leopard covs position 33 to 36 then the adequacy of the matrix to 88 substitution models was evaluated using jmodeltest posada 2008 the three codons partition model of evolution was specified under hyu substitution model with a gamma site heterogeneity distribution so that each of the three codon position could follow its own evolution rate yule speciation model showed similar estimates as the constant population size coalescent model thus the yule speciation model was chosen as tree prior the mcmc chain was set to 10000000 states to get an adequate posterior ess value superior to 300the support of the nodes was evaluated via a bootstrap analysis felsenstein 1985 for the direct optimization method and posterior probabilities we assessed for the bayesian method fig 1 and s1 except for the sequences of hipposideros larvatus betacoronavirus tata hl bcov t and hipposideros armiger alphacoronavirus ratcha ha acov r which were newly identified in this study all other sequences used in phylogenetic reconstructions were downloaded from the national center for biotechnology information database httpwwwncbinlmnihgovnucleotide each genbank sequence identification number is indicated directly on trees fig 1 and s1in the case of coronavirus phylogeny rooting with one member of the sister group bafinivirus or torovirus the two genus of torovirinae sub-family would have been a good choice to study the relation within the in-group coronavirinae unfortunately the region that we used here was too divergent and hardly comparable to torovirinae sequence however as torovirinae sequence can not be used to root the trees in this case we used the results provided by a published study snijder et al 2003 that used torovirinae as root this study based on an amino acid matrix inferred a coronaviridae phylogeny and verified the monophyly of coronavirus and the basal branching of gammacoronavirus clade according to these conclusions we chose an avian coronavirus taxa to root our trees and therefore study the alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus genera phylogeny an additional taxon from the same clade of the taxa used as root gammacoronavirus  avian coronavirus beaudette was included in the analysis to allow the polarization of the characters ancestral versus apomorphic along the treea genome comprises ribonucleic acid fragments that can independently be submitted to various selection pressures of different intensity the history of these fragments can be deeply shaped by the function they encode eventually resulting in incongruent phylogenetic signals the only way to fully recover and clearly exploit the phylogenetic signal of a given fragment by comparison to the putative homolog fragment of other taxa is to analyze it independently therefore the combination of several fragments in a same analysis should be carefully thought and documented as mixing the information they provide can produce a blurred signal and therefore can lead to an inaccurate phylogeny here we focused on a fragment of the polymerase sequence only for phylogenetic reconstruction of coronaviruses because i the key function of this protein involved in vertical transmission and consequently in viruses filiation is likely to regulate variation and provide a phylogenetic signal that reflects the filiation and ii its relatively short length genome position and associated transcription characteristics make it unlikely to be a putative recombination site moreover the analysis of this region by the rdp3 package martin et al 2010 did not detect any putative recombination sitesduring the inference of a species tree the identification of the appropriate vertical transmission of information is one of the classical pitfalls of phylogenetic reconstruction therefore careful attention must be paid in the choice of a genetic fragment that reflects the species phylogeny and not only the gene history a given genetic fragment coding for a positively selected function which appeared in one species may benefit another one by horizontal transfer recombination increasing the fitness of the recombinant virus and its progeny this phenomenon have happened also between viruses that are actually recognized as members of separated families as described for the two independent recombination events that occurred between a torovirus coronaviridae torovirinae a coronavirus and an orthomyxoviridae influenzavirus c snijder et al 1991 these particular events did not involve the rdrp sequence all these reasons lead us to rely on the analysis of this rdrp fragment for the phylogenetic reconstruction of coronavirus
according to the distribution of both the known mammalian host families the rhinolophidae gray 1825 and its sister family the hipposideridae lydekker 1891 betacoronavirus-b might be widespread over asia and most of the old world moreover the biodiversity of these two mammalian families is surely higher than what has been currently described sj puechmaille unpublished data which in turn induces a potential greater coronavirus diversity than is currently described in discordance to what has been reported to date and based on the phylogenetic proximity of these sister families hipposideridae might harbour an equal or richer diversity of coronaviruses at least of the betacoronavirus genus compared to the rhinolophidae furthermore the fragmentation of the forested habitat produced by human activities such as land use practices and agriculture leads to the isolation of preserved biodiversity spots surrounded by cultivated fields that have the potential to maintain both host and viral populations preserving by this way the footprints of the natural history of coronaviruses in wildlifethe ha acov r was detected in bat feces from a unique colony hipposideros
armiger hodgson 1835 among 10 bats tested four were positive 36  study site 4  table 1 the blast 78 identity value indicated that the sequence was related to a bat alphacoronavirus reported to infect rhinolophus

pearsoni in the chinese shandong region in 2005 table 2 and tang et al 2006 for this sequence 30 bases from the 5 side of the pcr products were ambiguous and therefore removed from the analysis because the sequencing with one degenerated primer gave low quality resultsconcerning hl bcov t the sequences were free of ambiguous sites and identical among the molecular isolates amplified from feces collected from 22 specimens of bats from the same colony table 1 the 391 nucleotides long sequences obtained showed that this new virus was related to the sars-cov clade and shared 75 nucleotide identity online blast analysis with the bat sarsr coronavirus rf1 from rhinolophus

larvatus individuals which were negative for the detection of ha acov-r similarly besides hl bcov-t detected in one site no other betacoronavirus-b was detected from the other study sites even if they were populated by the same species as the positive site and in two instances cave 3 and 14  table 1 with comparable sample sizes the other species sampled taphozous

magnater colony chu et al 2006 these results suggested that alphacoronaviruses were able to persist through time in bat colonies another study on alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus  sarsr-rh-batcov  infected rhinolophus sinicus bats modulated this conclusion no significant persistence was observed in rhinolophus sinicus bat colonies and the viral clearance was estimated between 2 weeks and 4 months lau et al 2010 moreover the authors reported a significant loss of body weight in bats infected by betacoronavirus sarsr-covs that was not observed in alphacoronavirus infected bats this loss of weight could be the sign of a loss of fitness associated with betacoronavirus infection in rhinolophus sinicus without presuming that it would be a promoting factor or a consequence of betacoronavirus infection even though i betacoronavirus persistence was not observed in rhinolophus
sinicus colonies and ii the loss of body mass correlated with betacoronavirus infection might reduce the fitness of rhinolophus we report here that a betacoronavirus was persisting for 18 months in a hipposideridae bat colony this suggests that a hipposideridae colony might be more tolerant to betacoronavirus than rhinolophidae over a long period of time or that betacoronavirus of rhinolophidae might have acquired virulence factor limiting long-lasting infection in this host further investigations are needed to confirm and describe this suspected difference this betacoronavirus detected so far in hipposideros
larvatus in thaland is restricted to a single cave thus betacoronavirus long-lasting infection in a bat colony might be a rare event although rare long-lasting infection can promote cross-species transmission by the emergence of new properties in viral populations baric et al 1999 despite the coincidence of several promoting factors in study site 17 the long-lasting infection  table 1  the sharing of the same small-sized cave by three bat species and the phylogenetic proximity of the two hipposideros species none of the other species were detected positive for betacoronavirus
hipposideros
armiger and taphozous
longimanus were negative  table 1 interestingly we noted that the taphozous
longimanus negative colony was roosting separately from the hipposideros
larvatus positive cluster whereas the hipposideros
armiger negative colony occupied also another specific area of the cave similarly in site 4 table 1 the hipposideros
armiger colony infected by acov-ha was roosting separately from the other negative species again this typical spatial segregation within a roosting site eg cave limits direct contacts between species and is suspected to account for a behavioral barrier to cross-species transmission in the wild as previously described for lentivirus and felidae troyer et al 2008 vandewoude et al 2010 nevertheless we mentioned these observations here but these mechanisms still remain to be precisely described in the complex relationship between rhinolophoidea and betacoronavirusesby contrast previous studies of asian coronaviruses that focused on the species level suggested that there was no strict association between bat species and alphacoronavirus species chu et al 2006 tang et al 2006 and other studies on betacoronavirus in africa reached similar conclusions quan et al 2010 species-barrier crossing has been reported occasionally for betacoronavirus in asian european and african rhinolophidae or hipposideridae but more frequently in miniopteridae chu et al 2006 tang et al 2006 tong et al 2009 drexler et al 2010 moreover miniopterus species exhibit an aggregative behaviour and mixed species colonies are commonly observed as described in literature benda et al 2003 mixed species roosting inducing direct contact between species and therefore promoting transmission in synergy with viral persistence in a colony and the phylogenetic proximity of the hosts is likely to promote cross species transmission of alphacoronaviruses as a result a non-specific host-virus association for alphacoronavirus in miniopterus follows the same model as what has been described for these bats and their ectoparasites bruyndonckx et al 2009 the apparent higher frequency of cross-species transmission or the absence of strict virus-host association in miniopteridae compared to hipposideridae and rhinolphidae might partially be explained by their different roosting behaviourthe two methods of phylogenetic reconstructions employed here supported comparable relationships within coronavirinae fig 1 and s1 the uncertainty associated with some relationships was often similarly reported by each method these phylogenetic issues might be reduced by increasing the size of the analysed fragment that would increase the number of informative characters and therefore provide more information to support nodes adding new taxa would also improve the phylogeny by providing probable currently lacking information within or around groups that are not yet well supported i betacoronavirus sub-groups relationships might be improved by looking for new taxa related to the group hku9bat cov philippine dilim weak posterior probability 059 and bootstrap value 024 are reported for this node ii other sequences from new betacoronavirus or taxa from a new group might help to clarify the relationship between betacoronavirus
alphacoronavirus and putative new groups as discordance is observed between phylogenies and none of the method provide significant support to the nodes that link betacoronavirus and alphacoronavirus posterior probability 069 and bootstrap values 021 006 024interestingly our study revealed that the betacoronavirus detected in hipposideridae in south-east asia was related to those that currently circulate in africa according to the analysis of a rdrp fragment our analyses strengthen the diversity of betacoronavirus-b clade and extend their broad distribution indeed sars-cov emerged from this betacoronavirus-b clade fig 1a which is present in africa europe asia and even australiaquan and collaborators pushed forward the possible occurrence of migration events from africa to asia to explain the basal phylogenetic position of an african betacoronavirus compared to asian rhinolophidae sarsr-cov together with the apparent absence of sarsr-cov in asian hipposideridae quan 2010 with the detection of betacoronavirus in hipposiderids in asia this hypothesis while still possible becomes less necessary to explain phylogenetic and geographic patterns of hipposideridae and rhinolophidae betacoronaviruses the clustering of betacoronavirus-b that correlates with the host phylogeny rather than with virus geolocalization suggests that the phylogenetic relationships between betacoronaviruses-b is mainly driven by the host phylogeny fig 1 and s1 accordingly the phylogenetic relationships of the hl bcov detected here from south-east asia with the sarsr-cov from africa and other betacoronaviruses support the following hypothesis betacoronaviruses-b ancestors meaning sarsr-covs ancestors could have been historically hosted by the common ancestor of the rhinolophidae and hipposideridae and could have later evolved independently in the lineages leading towards rhinolophidae and hipposideridae betacoronaviruses this point of view is supported by the topology of betacoronavirus clade that exhibits the monophyly of rhinolophidae betacoronaviruses despite their broad geographic distribution from africa and central europe to south-east asia and northern australia  fig 1 and shows the close relationship of hipposideridae betacoronaviruses nevertheless it is unlikely that putative host switching between rhinolophidae and hipposideridae betacoronaviruses ancestors eventually associated with ancient migration events would still be detectable more investigations are necessary to address these points and test corresponding hypotheses as well new investigations would be necessary to confirm this suggested predominant influence of the host phylogeny on betacoronavirus-b clustering and whether other lineage would exist in hipposideridae as suggested by the report of a betacoronavirus from australia c smith pers com  fig 1the position of the hipposideridae betacoronavirus from australia basal to the rhinolophidae betacoronaviruses suggests the existence of an intermediary subgroup fig 1 and s1 between hipposideridae and rhinolophidae betacoronaviruses that survived within a rare endemic australian bat species the phylogenetic status of this host rhinonicteris
aurantia is not well defined but this species is described as intermediary between hipposideridae and rhinolophidae while considered an hipposideridae hand and kirsch 1998 simmons 2007 armstrong 2006 armstrong com pers albeit this putative intermediary betacoronavirus group count a unique member to date and its associated posterior probability is weak its phylogenetic position correlates with that of its host therefore we are looking forward new investigations that would address these elements and screen betacoronaviruses in other hipposideridae and rhinolophidaethe ecological niche of these bats and their behaviour provide them with frequent opportunities to spread viral variants among other nocturnal mammals such as other chiroptera or carnivora viverridae civet family song et al 2005 guan et al 2003 gonzalez et al 2008 many factors have been suggested to explain the occurrence of emerging viruses in bats such as diversity in term of species and ecology ability to fly immunology physiology seasonal migration and roosting behaviour dobson 2005 kunz and fenton 2005 calisher et al 2006 another stated that population genetic structure correlates with viral richness turmelle and olival 2009 in the case of betacoronavirus the role of i the fragmented biotope observed today the thai forest biotope has drastically reduced over the past decades leading to the formation of species refuge areas promoting species interactions harvey et al 2006 trisurat et al 2010 and ii the segregation behaviour and the mobility patterns of bats metapopulations migrations should be investigated for their impact on the mosaic pattern of betacoronavirusthis study suggests that hipposideridae have been underestimated in the study of coronaviruses in the wild both an alphacoronavirus and a betacoronavirus more precisely the sub-group b that includes sars-cov were detected in hipposideridae in south-east asia thailand in contrast to what is reported for rhinolophidae hipposideridae are able to host betacoronavirus close to sars-cov over long periods of time suggesting that they could be a source of virus for other species under specific circumstances moreover the phylogeny of the rdrp when compared to the biogeography suggests that these two bat families may share an ancient relationship with independent lineage of betacoronavirus consequently and by contrast to what have been generally reported for coronaviruses we suggest that the host phylogeny globally drive the pathogen clustering in the particular relationship between betacoronavirus and rhinolophoidea as for other emerging viruses interactions between wildlife refuges whether considered in spatial or organic dimensions and human populations likely enhanced by fragmentation changes cultural behaviour and secular traditions contribute to drive the species barrier crossing of coronaviruses to humansthe funders had no role in study design data collection and analysis decision to publish or preparation of the manuscript this work benefited from the financial support of carrefour international fondation episars 511063 eu funded project ird intramural research funds and science foundation irelands research frontiers programme gen 0056since the isolation of hendra virus from pteropid bats in 2000 halpin et al 2000 bats have been implicated in the emergence of a number of other human infectious diseases most notably nipah severe acute respiratory syndrome sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers and ebola calisher et al 2006 moratelli and calisher 2015 in turn the notion that these viral diseases likely have their ultimate ancestry in bats triggered a major increase in the sampling of bat viruses leading to the progressive uncovering of a diverse bat virome and further fueling the idea that these animals are major reservoirs of emerging pathogens moratelli and calisher 2015 young and olival 2016successful cross-species transmission and emergence depends on a variety of biological ecological and epidemiological factors although rna viruses commonly jump species boundaries in part reflecting their ability to rapidly generate important adaptive variation geoghegan et al 2017 holmes 2009 woolhouse and gowtage-sequeria 2005 coronaviruses covs seem to exhibit a strong zoonotic potential and demonstrated by the emergence sars-cov and mers-cov in humans in 2002 and 2012 respectively graham et al 2013 coronaviruses are single-strand rna viruses of the order nidovirales that are classified in four genera alpha- beta- gamma and deltacoronavirus among these gamma and delta covs are largely associated with avian hosts while alpha and beta covs include several pathogens of humans and domestic animals and whose emergence is likely associated with cross-species transmission events drexler et al 2014both sars-cov and mers-cov belong to the genus betacoronavirus and are associated with severe lower respiratory tract infection characterized by mortality rates of 10 and 35 respectively hu et al 2015 the sars pandemic was promptly controlled through an unprecedented global containment effort and the virus has not been reported in humans since may 2004 graham et al 2013 despite this rapid eradication sars-cov caused almost 800 deaths in 27 countries with sustained outbreaks in 18 countries on three continents who there is increasing evidence that rhinolophid bats act as natural reservoirs for sars-related covs with direct spill-over to non-flying mammals for example like the sars coronavirus some bat covs are able to utilize the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a cell receptor ge et al 2014 menachery et al 2016 yang et al 2016 zeng et al 2016 conversely the role of bats in the epidemiology of mers-cov is less well understood as the human viruses are clearly mostly related to those viruses found in dromedary camels sabir et al 2016 indeed although related viruses have been found in bats these are divergent in their spike sequences and seem to be inefficient in the use of human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 as cell a receptor anthony et al 2017a reusken et al 2016 yang et al 2014 the mers epidemic is ongoing in the middle east and travel-associated cases have been reported in 27 countries worldwide who 2017 finally alphacoronavirus 229e and nl63 which cause a mild influenza-like syndrome in humans share a common ancestor with viruses sampled from the bat genus hipposideros and triaenops respectively corman et al 2015 corman et al 2016 tao et al 2017bats are known to harbor high levels of cov diversity with impressive geographical range and prevalence in almost every species investigated again supporting the idea that they have played a major role in cov evolution anthony et al 2017b drexler et al 2014 in addition bat covs are phylogenetically interspersed with those associated with other mammals including humans and domestic species compatible with the idea that bats are an important genetic reservoir tao et al 2017 woo et al 2012 the long-term evolutionary interactions between bats and coronaviruses is also supported by phylogenetic evidence that covs exhibit some species- and genus-specific tropism cui et al 2007 vijaykrishna et al 2007 and that phylogenetically related viruses are found in related bat species independent of sampling location in contrast that covs are not always shared among bat species that co-roost suggests that there are some barriers to cross-species transmission anthony et al 2013 corman et al 2013 cui et al 2007 drexler et al 2010 smith et al 2016 tang et al 2006because of the topological similarity between the phylogenetic trees of covs and their mammalian hosts it has been suggested that the diversity of covs largely reflects the long-term co-divergence between bats and covs cui et al 2007 however recent studies on specific bat taxa from particular locations suggests that the role of virus-host co-divergence in the evolutionary history of covs may have been overestimated relative to other events including host-jumping anthony et al 2017b lin et al 2017 tao et al 2017 indeed as well as strict virus-host co-divergence topological congruence could also arise from preferential host switching in which viruses most often successfully jump from closely related hosts de vienne et al 2013 the analysis of the long-term evolutionary history of bat covs is also complicated by frequent multiple substitution at deep evolutionary distances that prevents the accurate estimation of divergence times wertheim et al 2013to obtain a more complete picture of the evolutionary history of alpha and beta coronaviruses in their natural hosts which is essential for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of virus emergence we performed a statistical analysis of co-phylogenetic relationships on a large data set of mammalian covs not only did this suggest that cross-species transmission has played a major role in the evolution of alpha and beta covs in bats but also that differences in bat host ecology biology and geographical range have a strong impact on coronavirus evolutionwe retrieved all bat cov sequences representing the partial orf1b that encodes the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp available on genbank as of march 2017 these were combined with 109 cov sequences from other mammals two gamma covs were used to root the phylogeny only sequences 350 bp in length and associated with a bat genus for which at least two sequences were available were retained unique sequences associated with a particular species were included but solely used for analyses based on the host genus similarly we retrieved cov sequences encoding the spike s protein including those from bats and 46 cov sequences sampled from other mammals for each cov sequence we recorded the collection date location and host genus and species based on information available in genbank andor in the associated literature cov sequences for which the sampling location andor host genus were unavailable were discarded sampling locations were retrieved at the country level and were categorized according to their large-scale geographic area of sampling europe africa north america latin america central and south america asia south east asia and australiathe most comprehensive cov data set encoding the rdrp denoted rdrpcov1 comprised 541 cov sequences from bats plus 111 sequences from other mammalian genera including three randomly chosen representatives of known monophyletic groups of covs as well as all unclassified mammalian sequences this data set was used for the phylogenetic and host clustering analyses see below cov sequences encoding the spike protein comprised a data set denoted spikecov which included 199 sequences from bats plus 46 cov sequences from other mammalswe also constructed sub-sampled data sets from the comprehensive rdrpcov1 data set based on results from the genus-specific clustering see below to minimize errors associated with the non-independence of data specifically reduced data sets cov n  58 cov n  34 and cov n  24 included the longest sequence for each genus-specific cluster these reduced data sets were used in the co-phylogenetic analysis see belowto help assess the validity of our results we constructed a second group of data sets data sets2 which only included sequences from bat hosts whose species was confirmed genetically and hence more confidently thereby removing any error due to host misclassification these data sets were termed rdrpcov2 n  42 sequences which was used for phylogenetic and host clustering analyses and cov2 n  11 cov2 n  8 cov2 n  3 and host2 used in the co-phylogenetic analysis see belowhost sequences targeting the full mitochondrial cytochrome b cytb gene were also retrieved from genbank and visually inspected to ensure that they agreed with previously published bat phylogenies the host data set denoted host included one cytb gene sequence for each genus associated with the cov data setall sequences were aligned with mafft utilizing the l-ins-i routine katoh et al 2002 manually adjusted longer sequences were then trimmed to 935 bp rdrp and 1440 bp spike protein using mega6 tamura et al 2013 sequence alignments utilized nucleotide sequences for the host cov cov and cov data sets and all the data sets2 amino acid sequences for the spikecov data set and both nucleotide and amino acid sequences for the comprehensive data set rdrpcov1 best-fit models of nucleotide and amino acid substitution for each data set were determined using mega6 tamura et al 2013 pairwise genetic distances among nucleotide and amino acid sequences were computed using the maximum composite likelihood method in mega6maximum likelihood nucleotide phylogenetic trees were inferred using phyml version 30 employing the gtr  4 substitution model a heuristic spr branch-swapping algorithm and 1000 bootstrap replicates dereeper et al 2008 similarly amino acid ml trees were estimated for data sets rdrpcov1 and spikecov using raxml version 8117 assuming the lg  4 and the lg  4  i models of amino acid substitution respectively and 1000 bootstrap replicatestopological congruence between the rdrp and spike-based amino acid trees was determined based on the phylogenies of rdrp and spike sequences derived from the same host taxa to implement the phylogeny trait methods which require a posterior distribution of phylogenetic trees see below we inferred non-clock bayesian trees for data set rdrpcov1 using mrbayes v324 ronquist and huelsenbeck 2003 and assuming the gtr  4 nucleotide substitution model this analysis was run for 70 million generations 25 discarded as burn-in and sampled every 500 generations the resultant tree was then edited using itol letunic and bork 2016finally the degree of temporal signal ie clock-like structure in these cov data was explored by plotting root-to-tip genetic distances on the ml trees against year of sampling using the method implemented in tempest rambaut et al 2016we first investigated whether coronaviruses showed significant clustering by bat host genusspecies or sampling location using the association index ai parsimony score ps and maximum monophyletic clade mc phylogeny-trait statistics available in the bats package parker et al 2008 this analysis compared the posterior distribution of trees for data set rdrpcov1 described above to a null distribution of 100 trait-randomized trees with bat large-scale geographic area and country of sampling bat genus and bat species assigned as the character states of interest the extent of clustering associated with the characters host genus and host species was investigated also in the reduced data set rdrpcov2 in addition we used the phylogenetic tree to identify bat rdrp genus-specific clusters of covs defined as a minimum of two monophyletic rdrp sequences associated with the same bat genus supported by bayesian posterior probabilities 090 and differing no 48 and 51 at the amino acid level for the genera alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus respectively see belowthe taxonomy of cov clusters was determined based on pairwise amino acid distances calculated using 816 bp of the rdrp when available and reflecting the rdrp group units rgu defined previously for covs drexler et al 2014 following these criteria we assigned distinctive rgus to sequences differing by at least 48 and 51 at the amino acid level for the genera alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus respectively drexler et al 2014to assess the extent of virus-host co-divergence in the data we reconciled the cov and host phylogenies using jane 40 conow et al 2010 which infers the nature and frequency of different evolutionary scenarios by finding the reconciliation with the lowest total cost accordingly we assigned event costs  1 for virus lineage duplication host shift and virus loss or failure to diverge following host speciation and costs of both 0 and 1 for co-divergence jane was run for 45 generations g with a set size of 23 s this analysis used the tree topologies based on rdrp and cytb for coronaviruses and their hosts respectively in addition the congruence between the phylogeny of bat genera and their cov clusters was depicted graphically using the tanglegram function of the decipher package wright 2016 from the r environment to exclude the impact of possible host misclassification this analysis was also run for datasets2 in which hosts are assigned geneticallysequences included within bat rdrp genus-specific clusters of covs but associated with different host genera were considered as likely cross-species transmission events for each such event we determined whether cross-species transmission was associated with the following variables host taxonomy genus family and superfamily of the donor and recipient hosts cov lineage sampling location sampling year sampling location and sampling year and location of the most closely related sequenceto tentatively determine whether there may have been a sustained chain of cov transmission in the new host species as opposed to transient spill-overs we assessed whether sequences associated with cross-species transmission events were significantly divergent from the donor cluster accordingly for each putative cross-species transmission event we compared the median nucleotide distance among sequences from the donor host with the median nucleotide distances between the donor sequences and those from the novel ie recipient host using a one-tailed wilcoxon rank sum test genetic distances were again calculated using mega6 tamura et al 2013 as described above although this analysis was based on the rdrp spike protein sequences were also used when availablethe spearman coefficient rs was used to determine the strength of the correlation between cov diversity expressed as number of detected cov clusters and the species richness or geographical range of cov samples for each host genus to test the influence of sampling effort on cov diversity the same correlation coefficient was determined between cov diversity and the number of genbank submissions and the total number of sequences per genus absolute values were arbitrarily interpreted as follows 000039 weak correlation 040059 moderate correlation 060079 strong correlation and 08010 very strong correlation coefficients were considered significant for p-value  005a total of 650 cov rdrp sequences were analyzed in this study among these 541 were from bats 307 alphacoronavirus and 234 betacoronavirus representing most of the cov diversity currently described in bats and 111 from other mammalian species 57 alphacoronavirus 50 betacoronavirus and two gammacoronavirus with the latter used as outgroups data set rdrpcov1 sequence lengths generally ranged from 350 bp to 816 bp n  352 although a number n  298 were longer and trimmed to 935 bp prior to analysis table 1
 similarly we analyzed 245 spike protein sequences including 199 sequences from bats and 46 from other mammals sequence lengths ranged from 678 bp including the receptor-binding domain rbd and 4000 bp corresponding to the full length sequence for 94 bat covs both the rdrp and the spike protein sequences were available table 1 although bat sequences obtained were identified worldwide most came from asia n  252 in five countries africa n  170 in six countries and europe n  116 in nine countries fig 1
bat-derived cov sequences either rdrp or spike were sampled from 82 different species belonging to 25 genera table 1 importantly information on the criteria used for the classification of bat species in the data set was often lacking 695 in some cases classification was based on morphology 554 and to a lesser extent on genetic identification 171 of note 36 of the bats under study representing 12 genera are considered cryptic species as they are morphologically indistinguishable from other sympatric species table s1 in 18 cases the host classification provided with the cov sequence identified the host genus only while in one case h cafferruber the exact species was not defined pfefferle et al 2009 therefore to help assess the robustness of our results we performed a second analysis on 42 sequences for which the bat host species was confirmed genetically data set rdrpcov2 among which 26 were alphacoronavirus and 16 were betacoronavirusphylogenetic analyses revealed a structuring of bat coronavirus diversity dependent on both their host taxa and the large-scale geographic area of sampling fig 2 with the exception of cov sequences associated with alphacoronavirus 1 mink coronavirus 1 human coronavirus hku1 and betacoronavirus 1 all other covs from non-flying mammals formed clades that either exhibited sister relationships with bat-associated viruses or were nested within them fig 2 regression analyses revealed no correlation between sampling times and root-to-tip genetic distances for both the rdrp and spike proteins r2  00078 and 00075 for the rdrpcov1 and spikecov data sets respectively thereby precluding any molecular clock dating fig s1a b
phylogeny-trait analyses based on rdrp sequences using the bats program provided statistical support p  001 for the clustering of covs in all the traits investigated the percentage of individual traits significantly ie 005 supporting cov clustering was 100 for large-scale geographic area of sampling 8846 for bat genus 774 for country of sampling and 754 for bat species table s2 individual traits represented by unique sequences eg single countries always gave non-significant results and were excluded from the overall percentages given above a similar trend was confirmed for sequences associated with genetically defined host species data set rdrpcov2 for which clustering was significant in 80 of host genera and 50 of host species table s3our phylogenetic analyses identified 44 rdrp bat genus-specific clusters 28 in the alpha covs denoted c1-c28 and 16 in the beta covs denoted c29-c44 fig 2 as expected sequences from nl63 cov 229e and sars cov from other mammalian hosts fell within bat-associated clusters between c26 and c27 within c26 and within c36 and associated with bats belonging to the genera trianops hipposideros and rhinolophus respectively fig 2 conversely it was not possible to identify species-specific or geographically structured clusters across all bat genera this was particularly evident for clusters of covs found in the bat genera miniopterus rhinolophus and hipposideros associated with different host species sampled from different geographical macro-areas fig 2 that these results were not due to errors in host classification was confirmed by phylogenetic analyses of data set rdrpcov2 which also revealed a clustering by host genus rather than host species fig s2a single cov phylogenetic cluster was associated with most bat genera however two or three clusters were observed in artibeus rousettus hipposideros triaenops rhinolophus eptesicus and miniopterus and more than three clusters were present in myotis and pipistrellus the bat genera pipistrellus eptesicus rhinolophus and hipposideros were associated with both alpha and beta covs while all genera of fruit bats the pteropodidae were found to only harbor beta-covs assigned to lineage d table 1 fig 2 the number of host species included within genus-specific clusters varied between one and 10 with the most observed in rhinolphus n  10 miniopterus n  7 and hipposideros n  4 table 2
a strong correlation was observed between the number of rdrp specific clusters described for each bat genus and either its species richness rs  069 p  00001 or geographic distribution rs  067 p  00002 however the correlations between cov diversity and the number of genbank submissions and the total number of cov sequences within each bat genus were also very strong rs  064 p  00006 rs  073 p  00001 hence it is possible that these sampling biases have had a strong impact on the resultsthe majority of genus-specific clusters 3244 originated from a single large-scale geographic area of the remaining 1244 clusters showing a broader geographical spread 11 were identified in two or three geographic areas and one in more than three geographic areas table 2 fig 2 of note is the frequent clustering of coronaviruses from asia and south-east asia china and thailand associated with miniopterus c10-11 hipposideros c9 c27 and schotophilus c16 table 2the availability of rdrp sequences 816 bp enabled the classification of 2744 genus-specific clusters using the rdrp group units rgu previously defined for covs drexler et al 2010 c2-c5 c7-c11 c15-c16 c18 c20 c25-c28 c30 c33 c35-c40 c43-c44 table 3
 the taxonomy of all other clusters was not resolved due to short fragment lengths in all but two cases the pairwise amino acid distance between sequences 816 bp was consistent with the association between rdrp genus-specific clusters identified in this study and distinct rgus the exceptions c18 and c20 both associated with myotis bats and c43 and c44 associated with pipistrellus and eptesicus respectively shared 96 similarity at the amino acid level in 816 bp of rdrp and hence should be classified as a single rgu table 3 mean nucleotide divergence between sequences from eptesicus and pipistrellus was 393 se  011 compared to only 16 se  0005 mean divergence within sequences from pipistrellus bats only interestingly our analyses identified these rdrp genus-specific clusters as belonging to the same putative species of mers-cov with amino acid identities of 982 and 963 respectively table 3spike protein sequences were available for 1744 rdrp genus-specific clusters c2 c7 c9-c11 c16 c18 c25 c28 c30 c33 c35-c40 all of which were taxonomically resolved based on rgu classification table 3 mean amino acid divergence in spike sequences from covs included within the same rgu ranged from 046 c39 to 4829 c37 table 3 tree topologies based on the spike protein sequences were largely consistent with rdrp clustering detected in this study fig s3 however there were discordant tree topologies between the rdrp and spike proteins for the two clusters associated with miniopterus bats which did not cluster together in the latter with mean amino acid divergence of 424 se  001 in the spike protein compared to only 68 0013 for the rdrp fig s3 fig 2 table 3 furthermore three sequences from miniopterus fuliginosus accession numbers kj473800 kj473799 kj473797 belonging to rdrp genus-specific cluster c10 fell into spike protein cluster c11 fig s3 a similar pattern was observed for c30 associated with rousettus bats these fell within cluster 33 on the rdrp tree but were distinct from it in the spike protein tree fig s3 fig 2 finally our analyses confirmed a different evolutionary history for the spike protein of human coronavirus nl63 this grouped with covs from hipposideros bats c28 and human coronavirus 229e rather than being nested within sequences from bats of the genus trienops rdrp genus-specific cluster c26 and c27 as seen in the rdrp phylogenies fig s3 fig 2despite the likely antiquity of covs in bats genus-specific clusters showed a low level of phylogenetic congruence in respect to their hosts fig s4 indeed a full reconciliation analysis using jane suggested that the evolutionary history of covs was best explained by more frequent cross-species transmission than co-divergence with the latter accounting for 0183 of all the events observed table 4 for example across the covs as a whole there were 011 co-divergence events compared to 3847 host-shift events importantly this result was independent of the cost associated with co-divergence assigned as either equal or lower than that associated with cross-species transmission and was the same when the alpha and beta covs were analyzed independently such that there was no difference in the frequency of cross-species transmission between these viral groups equivalent results were obtained using the genetically confirmed hosts in data sets2 table s4
a total of 27 cov sequences were identified as likely cross-species transmission events based on rdrp topology as they were nested within clusters associated with a different host genus with strong bootstrap support fig 2 these cross-species transmission events involved 20 different combinations of recipient and donor hosts 13 recipient and eight donor genera respectively among which the association between cynopterus and hipposideros was bi-directional in five cases cross-species transmission events involved more than one highly similar cov from the same recipient bat species up to six cross-species transmissions were recorded for a single donor host with the highest frequency in clusters associated with the genera miniopterus hipposideros and rhinolophus table 5
 in 1727 cases recipient and donor hosts belonged to different bat superfamilies notably the bats involved in cross-species transmission were largely sampled from the same geographic location with a sharing of roosts between host species documented in only 627 cases and possible in 1327 table 5 in only two cases did cross-species transmission involve related hosts from different geographical areas namely phyllostomidae bats of the genera carollia and artibeus sampled in costa rica and panama respectively and bats of the genera miniopterus and eptesicus from china and usa both belonging to the superfamily vespertilionoidea unfortunately the host classification was not confirmed genetically for any of these events so that more accurate analyses could not be performedsequences identified as likely cross-species transmissions were generally located at tree tips and were not significantly divergent from those of their putative donor cluster suggesting that they most likely represent recent host jumps p 005 in 2127 cases table 5 among sequences exhibiting divergence from the donor cluster 46 were sampled from related hosts belonging at least to the same superfamilyspike sequences were available for 327 covs identified as cross-species transmission events involving jumps from the bat genera hipposideros to rousettus and from rhinolophus to chaerepon interestingly spike protein sequences from rousettus bats were significantly divergent from hipposideros covs and constituted a sister group to those from this genus table 5 although this is compatible with host adaptation this clearly needs to be investigated in greater detailalpha and beta coronaviruses exhibit both substantial genetic diversity and a wide geographical range in bats such that these mammals are important virus hosts anthony et al 2017b drexler et al 2014 our data indicate that bats are indeed associated with several distinct clusters of alpha and beta covs and that most covs from non-flying mammals also fell within these clusters on phylogenetic trees however we also noted the existence of monophyletic groups of covs associated with mammalian species other than bats such as alphacoronavirus 1 and betacoronavirus 1 interestingly we revealed a positive association between cov diversity and the species richness and geographical distribution of samples from each bat genus with more virus clusters in genera for which more species have been sampled across a wide geographic area such as myotis pipistrellus rhinolophus and hipposideros this suggests that the high phylogenetic diversity of covs likely reflects the large number of different bat species and their global distribution fenton and simmons 2015 woo et al 2012 and supports the central role for these animals in cov evolution furthermore we detected a strong impact of sampling effort on cov diversity suggesting that this still likely underestimated in bats as a whole anthony et al 2017bour data also provide evidence for the close phylogenetic relationship of coronaviruses from hosts of the same genus with distinct putative cov species tending to be associated with different bat genera indeed single rgus which are considered indicative of distinctive cov species were associated with more than one bat species particularly in those bats that live sympatrically or that belong to the same genus similarly despite the evidence for geographical structuring covs belonging to the same rgus were also described in different locations as previously described leopardi et al 2016 hence as a general rule covs exhibit genus-specificity rather than species-specificity conversely cov clusters associated with bat genera pipistrellus and eptesicus showed low divergence at the amino acid level based on the 816 bp fragment suggesting their classification within the same cov putative species interestingly these clusters were also highly similar to mers-cov such that they may be included within a single cov species although more data are needed to confirm this hypothesisit was notable that co-specific miniopterus rousettus pipistrellus rhinolophus and hipposideros bats sampled from the same location harbor more than one cov cluster which will increase the likelihood of virus recombination parrish et al 2008 this hypothesis is supported by our finding of discordant topologies between trees estimated using the rdrp and the spike protein for covs detected in rousettus and miniopterus bats and thereby supporting previous results huang et al 2016 wu et al 2015 in this context it is noteworthy that bats from the genera pipistrellus rhinolophus and hipposideros are also those that show the highest identity with three human coronaviruses namely mers cov sars cov and hcov 229e respectivelya key observation of our study was the frequency with which cross-species transmission has occurred in the evolution history of coronaviruses reflected in the general incongruence between the virus and host phylogenies the lack of species-specificity and the presence of phylogenetically divergent viruses in some bat genera suggesting multiple introductions of covs cui et al 2007 this hypothesis is consistent with the finding of highly related covs in different species non-flying mammals for example feline coronavirus fcov and canine coronavirus ccov define two sister clades within the alphacoronavirus 1 species and are likely a result of recent interspecies jumping woo et al 2009despite the frequency of cross-species transmission it was striking that only one recent host-jump between different bat genera was confirmed in our data set this involved two distinct clusters of covs from closely related vespertilionid bats from the genera pipistrellus and eptesicus likely associated with the same cov species the availability of spike sequences also allowed us to identify a clear diversification of covs in bats of the genus rousettus following their jump from a donor cluster associated with the co-roosting bat genus hipposideros conversely however our data suggest that cross-species transmissions between distantly related hosts often result in transient spill-over infections reflected as an absence of daughter lineages in phylogenetic trees although this may also reflect a lack of appropriate samplingthe multiple introductions of covs in rhinopomatidae bats suggests that cross-species transmission events may be favored by their ecology of sharing roosts with different species including myotis miniopterus and rousettus bats however it is important to note that we also detected cross-species transmission events between species for which no interaction is suspected based on their ecologies such as the fruit bats eidolon helvum that mainly roost in big colonies in trees and the cave dwelling insectivorous bat miniopterus natalensis fenton and simmons 2015 although this suggests that we have not sampled the key intermediate species we necessarily cannot exclude cross-contamination or incorrect classification of hosts as confounding factor in these casesoverall our results confirm the long-term evolution of mammalian coronaviruses within bats seemingly representing a complex interplay between co-divergence and cross-species transmission a pattern that is seeming common among rna viruses geoghegan et al 2017 in addition we found evidence that likelihood cross-species transmission increased with sympatrydespite its large-scale this study has several limitations mostly related to the quality of the available data of particular note is the short length of most fragments of coronaviruses used for analyses with less than half compressing the 816 bp necessary for rgu classification drexler et al 2010 and which obviously limit phylogenetic resolution similarly the uncertain classification of certain host species should not be underestimated due to variable species assignments as well as the cryptic nature of several bat species that cannot be readily identified based on obvious morphological features but whose correct assignation often require the use of genetic or echolocation studies kingston et al 2001 table s1 indeed the hosts included in our database represent only about 20 of the bat species 6 of the bat genera described worldwide studies of cov diversity have mainly been performed in china and europe while important hot spots for bat biodiversity richardson 2002 such as south east asia and latin america are under-represented furthermore sequences collected from different areas are generally weakly representative for their specific continent with for example most african samples being collected from ghana and kenya fig 1 while the reliability of our conclusions was confirmed by analyses performed on a much smaller data set with more accurate host assignments we encourage a more comprehensive sampling the collection of longer cov sequences and the accurate genetic attribution of the host species all of which provide the information needed to better reveal the evolution and ecology of coronaviruses in batsthe following are the supplementary data related to this article




the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 is associated with the current pandemic outbreak of covid19 the virus emerged in wuhan china and it can be transmitted from person to person
1
 the patients visited a local seafood market selling various live animals from where this zoonotic disease was suspected to have spread
2
 till date there have been 1 812 734 confirmed cases and 113 675 deaths across 202 countries according to who httpswwwwhointsuccessful drug and vaccine development require a deep understanding of the virus phylogeny evolutionary origin and the source of zoonotic transmission also it should be a toppriority task for researchers to prevent outbreaks of this type in the future substantial efforts have been made to identify the animal source of sarscov2 several recent studies have revealed the origin of sarscov2 from bats
3
 however some other intermediate hosts were also suggested such as snake
4
 pangolin
5
 or some mammals and birds
6

the genome of sarscov2 contains two open reading frames orfs orf1 and orf2 encoding two polyproteins which are responsible for viral genome maintenance after cleavage there is also a set of socalled structural proteins such as spike glycoproteins an envelope protein membrane proteins and the nucleocapsid one of the structural proteins the spike surface glycoprotein spike glycoprotein is one of the primary therapeutic targets this protein plays an important role in binding to receptors on the host cell fusion of the host and viral membranes and as a target for antibodies reviewed in fung and liu
7
in this study we examined 137 genomes to establish the relationship between spike glycoproteins from different coronaviruses this was done with a combination of the phylogenetic tree analysis reconstructed from the translated sequences and a comparison of the structural models the phylogenetic study has confirmed close relatedness of sarscov2 to bats coronaviruses in contrast a comparison of the structural models has found yak bos grunniens betacoronavirus as the closest matchrecently released complete genome sequences were downloaded for the analysis from ncbi listed in table s1 furthermore spike glycoprotein orfs nucleotide and protein sequences were retrieved from ncbi orffinder httpswwwncbinlmnihgovorffinder and conserved domains were checked with cdsearch ncbi respectively complete translated orfs were used for multiple sequence alignments performed using muscle the tests of substitution models and phylogenetic analysis were carried out using the mega x software
8
 the neighborjoining method and jtt substitution models were selected assuming an estimated proportion of invariant sites and 4gammadistributed rate categories to account for rate heterogeneity across sites the gamma shape parameter was estimated directly from the data reliability for the internal branch was assessed using the bootstrapping method 1000 bootstrap replicates two spike glycoproteins from the gammacoronaviruses were used as an outgroupstructural models of the spike glycoproteins table s1 marked with  were built using swissmodel

 predicted structures were refined with an online tool 3drefine httpsysbiornetmissouriedu3drefine and verified using qmean httpsswissmodelexpasyorgqmean ipba web server was used for pdb structure alignment httpswwwdsimbinsermfrdsimbtoolsipbaindexphp the quality of the structure alignments was evaluated using root mean square deviation and normalized score chimera software
10
 was used for structure visualizationaltogether 137 genomes were analyzed our primary focus was on the severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus 92 genomes released from 2019 till 25 march 2020 ncbi the middle east respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus genomes n  18 further shortened to mers were used to check the reliability of our in silico approaches a set of different coronaviruses taxonomical origin hosts and release date was used in our analyses table s1four conserved domains were identified spike glycoprotein nterminal domain pfam16451 spike receptorbinding domain pfam09408 coronavirus s1 glycoprotein pfam01600 and coronavirus s2 glycoprotein pfam01601 listed from nterminal to cterminal direction figure s1 surprisingly none of the analyzed genomes exhibited such domain architecture as is known for example for the viruses studied earlier top line in figures s1 and s2 as a common feature we noticed that alphacoronaviruses and gammacoronaviruses share domain architecture represented by two domains coronavirus s1 glycoprotein along with coronavirus s2 glycoprotein in contrast all analyzed betacoronaviruses have a full or partial spike receptorbinding domain interestingly only betacoronaviruses with humans and yaks as hosts have spike glycoprotein nterminal domain which is absent in all other analyzed hoststo gain insight into the phylogenetic relationships between spike glycoproteins from alphacoronaviruses betacoronaviruses and gammacoronaviruses of different hosts a robust phylogenetic tree after multiple alignments of the 137 extracted sequences figure s3 was generated the tree was rooted in the outgroup gammacoronaviruses as expected all sarscov2 spike glycoproteins with humans as a host were almost identical and formed separate clusters similarly all the mers with humans as a host were nearly identical and clustered together with camels mers isolates from kenya with closely related mers isolates from the egyptian camel two betacoronavirus isolates from bats hku5 and hku4related mn6115201 pipistrellus abramus and mn6115191 tylonycteris pachypus respectively were located between sarscov2 and mers clusterstwo other branches formed two welldistinguished clusters for alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses isolates alphacoronaviruses have hostdependent subclusters humans and bats in contrast other betacoronaviruses hku1 and oc43 are closely related to the yak isolatefurthermore to better understand the relationships between spike glycoproteins on the structural level we built protein models with homologybased server swissmodel
9
 table s1 marked with  obtained models were evaluated and verified table s2 in the next step ipba web server with a local backbone conformation comparison similarity algorithm was used to match human hostdelivered sarscov2 and mers spike glycoproteins to models delivered from other coronaviruses and hosts table 1 mers betacoronavirus was used as a control data set as it is wellstudied in both hosts human and camel and as their close genetic relationship is wellcharacterized
11
 as expected human hostdeliveredmers showed the highest similarity to that from camels sarscov2s spike glycoprotein on the contrary has shown the highest similarity to the yakdelivered betacoronavirus table 1 and figure 1bproper domain classification and identification remain to be a matter of discussion earlier papers refer to the spike glycoprotein as cleaved in the middle and forming s1 and s2 domains further subdividing them into nterminal and cterminal domains in each
12
 based on the current conserved domain database cdd output we concluded that nterminal s1 corresponds to the spike glycoprotein nterminal domain pfam16451 cterminal s1 corresponds to the spike receptorbinding domain pfam09408 and s2 domain contains coronavirus s1 glycoprotein pfam01600 and coronavirus s2 glycoprotein pfam01601 as subdomains figure s1canonical spike glycoprotein contains four domains each of which plays a specific function it is known that both spike glycoprotein nterminal domain pfam16451 and spike receptorbinding domain pfam09408 participate in specific receptor binding the nterminal domain binds to carcinoembryonic antigenrelated cell adhesion molecule 1 ceacam1 in mouse hepatitis coronavirus and binds sugar in porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus
13
 spike receptorbinding domain binds to the aminopeptidase n or angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 in coronaviruses
14
 an interplay between coronavirus s1 glycoprotein pfam01600 and coronavirus s2 glycoprotein pfam01601 is required for the attachment of spike to susceptible tissues and subsequent fusion
15

the phylogenetic data reported above show that the new humandelivered sarscov2 spike glycoproteins cluster with two betacoronaviruses hku4 and hku5related delivered from the hosts t pachypus and p abramus respectively also as seen from the phylogenetic tree figure s1 these two sequences deviate from the other bat coronavirus sequences suggesting that these bat coronaviruses are homologous and genetically more similar to humandelivered sarscov2 than to the other bats coronaviruses in general these data support phylogenetic results obtained by previous researches based on a wholegenome b nonstructural proteins ns7b and ns8 c spike glycoprotein and d nucleocapsid protein
16

for the next experiment based on the alignment and comparison of the structures mers has been set as a control data set due to the wellcharacterized close relationship between human and cameldelivered strains
11
 
17
 in contrast alignment and comparison of the sarscov2 structural models have revealed close relationship to the yak betacoronavirus b grunniens table 1 while batdelivered hku4 and hku5related betacoronaviruses had a lower matching score bovine coronavirus is a worldwide spread zoonotically transmissible infection in domestic and wild ruminants that is known to cause severe diarrhoea in neonatal dysentery in adult and respiratory diseases in animals of all ages and could also infect humans
18
 our conclusion is also wellsupported by a recent report
19
 on the ace2spike glycoprotein complexes which suggests bovidae as one of the potential intermediate hosts interestingly the identified bovine coronavirus strain strain yakhy24ch2017 has unique amino acid variation in the s gene that represents an uncommon adaptive evolution pathway with unknown biological meaning
20

it should be noted that many bat species have been identified in europe that are natural hosts for many viruses including coronaviruses in particular sarslike
21
 unexplored natural reservoirs of viruses could pose potential threats for public health
22
 this possibility also raises the question of unique transmission channels specific for each region
23

in conclusion the results of our phylogenetic study support the fact that the infection originated from bats additionally results from the comparison structural models propose an additional intermediate host yak b grunniens that could transmit bat coronavirus to human hosts we also wish to emphasize the importance of further investigations into the evolution of the spike glycoprotein such work could render a positive impact on the current sarscov2 transmission and prevent zoonotic disease outbreaks of this type in the futurethe authors declare that there are no conflict of interestsrecent work although reporting impressive insights into the mechanisms of pathogenesis of sars-cov has assessed the phylogeny of proteins of this virus using overly simple algorithms 2 3 the distance methods used to assess sars-cov phylogeny present several disadvantages first by converting a sequence alignment to pairwise distances we necessarily lose some of the evolutionary information contained within the analysed sequences 1 second distance methods are known to compromise the accuracy of estimates of evolutionary divergence which are fundamental to understanding the rate and mode of viral evolution third there are no known methods to test evolutionary models and estimated trees produced using the pairwise distance methodology 1here we use state-of-the-art phylogenetic methods to analyse all the available coronaviridae and sars-cov sequence datasets to gain an insight into the origin and evolution of sars-cov and to narrow down the list of potential regions of its genome that might be interesting targets for drug designthe statistically most robust method that can be used to achieve these aims is to consider the phylogenetic inference problem in a likelihood framework using a valid model of evolution for viral genomes 1 the choice of such a model for single-stranded rna virus genomes is difficult a parametric model based on chemical or biological properties of rna might underestimate or completely miss important unknown constraints for example packaging of single-stranded rna genomes that requires interaction with coat proteins 4 an alternative approach is to use empirical models that are generated through comparisons of observed sequences for example simply counting apparent replacements between closely related sequences given that sequence databases are biased towards mammalian and bacterial dna sequences there are relatively few coding single-stranded rna sequences to be aligned and non-coding rna sequences such as rrna or trna might be subjected to different selective eg structural constraints because the proteins encoded by rna genes might be subjected to functional constraints in a similar manner to non-viral proteins it might be better to use empirical amino acid substitution models that describe the probability of fixation of amino acid changes rather than rna models furthermore relative to primary structure the secondary structure of homologous proteins persists long after any statistically significant sequence similarity has vanished sequences with 25 amino acid identity probably have the same secondary structure 5 amino acid models of evolution that incorporate protein structural information perform better than simple amino acid models 6 moreover selection pressures act on protein function which in turn is closely related to structure therefore incorporating structure information into evolutionary analysis can assist in incorporating selective constraints here the programme passml-tm which implements protein secondary structure-based models of evolution has been used for analyses 7 8 the first undertaking is the determination and rooting of the coronavirus phylogeny that is the putative origin of the sequences of interesta large fraction 70 of the sars-cov genome encodes a replicase polyprotein which has significant sequence homology to all of the replicase polyproteins that have been sequenced to date from the order nidovirales comprising the coronavirus torovirus okavirus and arterivirus genera therefore this protein is a good choice for investigating the phylogenetic relationships among the family coronaviridae viral sequences have high mutation rates and consequently alignments are usually difficult to prepare here clustalw is applied using standard parameters 9 followed by careful refinement of the alignments both by eye and by using the protein secondary structural information for each nidovirus sequence as predicted by phd httpcubicbioccolumbiaedupredictprotein 10 and psi-pred httpbioinfcsuclacukpsipred 11 figure 1
shows the maximum likelihood tree produced using a set of homologous replicases from five sars-cov strains 12 other coronaviruses representing both groups 1 and 2 of the genus 2 3 one torovirus breda virus and one okavirus yellow head yh virus which were determined to most closely represent the consensus coronavirus sequence by a psi-blast search 12 the coronavirus sequences allow the determination of the root of the sars-cov strains whereas the torovirus and okavirus sequences provide insights into the rooting of the family coronaviridae phylogeny which is closer to group 1 than group 2 of the coronavirus genusas found previously by marra et al
2 and rota et al
3 the root of sars-cov is closer to coronavirus group 2 all sars-cov strains are almost completely identical in sequence 99 dna sequence homology and therefore it is not possible to get any meaningful phylogeny within the sars-cov group the avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv which causes respiratory disease in chickens and the turkey virus tcv which causes enteric disease are clustered together their ancestor divides groups 1 and 2 of the mammal-infecting coronaviruses the close clustering of the chicken and turkey viruses suggests that the difference between enteric and respiratory tropisms might require only a few amino acid changes experiments have shown that just two point mutations in the spike s glycoprotein can change porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus tgev a mostly enteric virus that can kill piglets into a non-deadly virus that excels at the respiratory route but replicates poorly in the gut 13 14 15 to infect enteric tract cells with tgev two different domains of the s protein of tgev mapping to between amino acids 522 and 744 and close to amino acid 219 are involved 13 the first domain binds to aminopeptidase n papn many viruses use co-receptors and it is probable that the second domain maps a co-receptor essential for the enteric tropism of tgev 14 15the clustering of murine hepatitis virus mhv and rat coronavirus rtcov might reflect the relatively close proximity in which the hosts reside and perhaps the similarity of murine and rat target receptors note that mhv receptors including ceacam1 have recently been identified 16 17 the clustering of the human oc43 hcov-oc43 bovine bcov and porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis hev coronaviruses might reflect conditions contributing to cross-infection in farming the breda torovirus is enteric whereas the yh okavirus infects gill tissue in prawns this indicates that the switch between enteric and respiratory tropism is a general characteristic of the order nidoviralescoronaviruses attach to host cells through the s glycoprotein 15 18 this protein is translated as a large polypeptide that is subsequently cleaved into a receptor-binding peripheral subunit s1 that remains non-covalently associated with a fusion-inducing membrane-spanning s2 fragment 18studies have shown that the entry of the porcine coronavirus tgev into cells is mediated by the interactions of s1 with papn an ectoenzyme abundantly expressed at the apical membrane of enterocytes covering the villi of the small intestine 19 the fact that the s protein mediates the first interaction of the virus with human cells suggests that it might represent an excellent target for effective anti-sars-cov drugs unfortunately structural information is only available for the 3clpro proteinase which is part of the coronavirus replication complex pdb accessions 1q2w 1p9u 1p9s and 1lvo 20 the s protein shows relatively high sequence homology within two of the major coronavirus groups 60 within group 1 38 within group 2 whereas the homology between groups is lower 1521 between groups 1 and 2 1521 between sars-cov and group 1 or 2 comparative sequence analysis between the sars-cov sequences and sequences from groups 1 and 2 of the coronavirus genus reveals three regions of varying sequence conservation from amino acid positions 1 to 400 401680 and 6811255 interestingly the first two regions correspond to the s1 fragment we subsequently refer to these regions as s1a and s2a and the third to the s2 fragment figure 2a
shows a cartoon of the gene for the s protein the region s1a is poorly conserved between groups 1 and 2 and sars-cov whereas s1b is flanked by two very well conserved motifs making it easier to align the internal sequences notably this region is homologous to a tgev spike region that is reported to contain determinants for tissue tropism 13 14 15 the region s2 is more conserved than s1a and s1b and consequently the alignment is easily determined passml-tm which uses the evolutionary relationships of the sequences analysed to improve its predictions of secondary structure and accessibility predicts a transmembrane helix at location 11961218 of the s protein the maximum likelihood trees of s1b and s2 are shown in figures 2b and 2c respectively the length of the trees and the distances between sequences reflect the sequence homologies according to the model of evolution explaining why the s2 tree is much shorter than s1b treethe phylogenetic tree produced from the analysis of the spike s2 fragment from several coronaviruses indicates that sars-cov is closer to group 2 of the coronavirus genus than to group 1 phylogenetic analysis of the s1 fragment from several coronaviruses indicates that sars-cov has an even closer relationship to group 2 viruses than the previous analysis suggests phylogenetic analysis of a 300 amino acid region at the terminus of s1 which we denote s1b indicates that sars-cov belongs to group 2 and is closely related to mhv and rtcov the differences between these results might be a result of recombination events involving sars-cov or convergent evolution or they might also be caused simply by chance however it is apparent that sars-cov is most closely related to group 2 of the coronavirus genus because the s1 fragment of mhv binds to ceacam1 we suggest that the s1b region of the sars-cov spike might bind to a human ceacam1 receptor instead of papn holmes and collaborators who have identified receptors for mhv murine ceacam1a hcov-229e human papn and feline coronaviruses feline papn 16 17 are currently investigating this hypothesis k holmes pers commun in support of the proposal that s1b is involved in receptor-binding is the fact that this region is homologous to a domain of the tgev s protein which is located between amino acids 522 and 744 and is also involved in receptor-binding 13 16notably tgev mutants that lack sialic acid-binding activity contain single point mutations in the s protein cys155phe met195val arg196ser asp208asn or leu209pro 21 22 sialic acid-binding activity might help tgev to resist detergent-like substances encountered during gastrointestinal passage and therefore facilitate infection of the intestinal epithelium 23 we found that only cys155 is conserved in sars-cov this is in agreement with clinical findings that show that 2050 of sars patients present gastrointestinal symptoms 24 the low conservation of the s1a region among coronavirus sequences suggests that once more strains of sars-cov or other closely related species are available it will become possible to use innovative comparative sequence analyses to examine positive selection that acts in this region 1several important functional determinants have been discovered in fragment s2 it contains a cytoplasmic tail enriched in cysteine residues 12171236 figure 2a this is a common feature among coronaviruses and appears to be related to membrane fusion 25 several authors have discovered that sars-cov s2 contains two conserved regions of heptad repeats 9131000 and 11511185 figure 2a 26 27 see also a press release by wr gallaher and rf garry httpwwwvirologynetsarss2modelhtml these heptads suggest that sars-cov uses mechanisms to gain entry to a cell that are similar to those used by human immunodeficiency virus hiv the virus that causes aids acquired immunodeficiency syndrome orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses and also ebola it is known that peptides derived from these repeat regions in hiv and the paramyxoviruses can specifically inhibit virus entry and subsequently viral replication 26 currently sars treatment is modeled after the drug known as t20 httpwwwhivmedicinecomtextbookdrugst20htm this drug is a complex peptide that is difficult to manufacture has a short half-life in the human body and must be injected this suggests that other regions of the genome such as s1b which might be of some interest for drug design should be described we report in figure 2d the consensus protein structure estimate of s1b obtained using passml-tm phd 10 and psi-pred 11 passml-tm also estimates the distribution of mutation rates along the protein and the sitewise mutation rate figure 2dthe sars-cov genome is at rich 59 asymmetries in strand composition can reveal mutation bias for example cytosine deamination or selection 28 we found that the gc gcgc002 and at skew atat0037 in the sars-cov genome are smaller than those of the hiv genome gc skew is 015 and at skew is 023 which has a double-stranded rna genome with a similar at content this suggests the existence of some selection on g and c distribution along the sequence to control the types of rna secondary structure that form 29 cg is the only dinucleotide statistically under-represented fcgfcfg046 where fcg is the frequency of cg dinucleotides and significance is assessed according to refs 30 31 because this depletion is also found in the hiv genome but not in that of tobacco mosaic virus it might occur as a result of mutational bias in vertebrate cellscomparison of the mutation patterns in the sars-cov genome sequences from 16 patients shows that a large number 3884 of the base substitutions detected at 84 sites occur within or near to single base and dinucleotide repeat stretches despite the absence of a pairing rule the ratio of rates of transition and transversion mutations is 2 as is often found in double-stranded dna the low gc and at skews and the low number of mutations suggest that evolvability of sars-cov might be restricted by selective constraints acting on the rna structure and packaging of the genome and therefore it might also be restricted by the low fitness of its mutational neighbours sequence features that form stems and loops that are potentially involved in coronavirus genome packaging have been described 32 33 mutational neighbours with different fitness might explain why although some rna viruses evolve at high rates some rna viruses are highly stable 34 35interestingly the ease of tropism switching as exemplified by the closeness between turkey and chicken coronaviruses figure 1 is favoured by the large number of viral particles in each host by their mutation rates by the large populations of hosts birds and other species and by the aerial mode of viral spread for instance through sneezing and faeces these factors suggest that birds might act as powerful engines for virus evolutionin this review we have highlighted that the s1 and s2 fragments of the sars-cov s protein have different mutational patterns on the basis of phylogenetic evidence figure 2b and the homology with the tgev 522744 region it is suggested that a short region of the s1 fragment which we denote s1b located at positions 400680 might be of particular interest to virologists structural biologists and biotechnologists the sitewise secondary structure solvent accessibility and mutation rate of this region have been estimated our work in progress includes further structural characterization and fold family determination at the moment sars appears to be under control despite doctors having neither drugs nor a vaccine to protect against it because it could reappear in the future research should proceed and hopefully our findings might assist in maintaining a feed-forward loop on sars-cov research between bioinformatics analysis and experimental work from microbiologists and virologists as a final comment it is notable that in all the phylogenies human coronaviruses hcov-229 and hcov-oc43 always cluster with porcine coronaviruses because ericsson and collaborators 36 reported the identification of two homologous human proteins that act as receptors for porcine endogenous retrovirus the benefits and risks of porcinehuman xenotransplantation should be carefully balancedthe sudden appearance and potential lethality of severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus sars-cov in humans has focused attention on understanding its origins the host reservoir from which humans were infected remains to be determined however molecular phylogenetics can be used to assess sars-covs evolutionary origin and history of change by analyzing genes from sars-cov with homologous genes from other coronaviruses though surveys and sampling of coronaviruses from both wild and domestic host-species are limiting comparative phylogenetic analyses for viruses and hosts is important in elucidating the history of host associations as wellcoronaviruses have been divided into three groups based on serological and genetic criteria siddell 1995 to date group 3 coronaviruses have been found only in birds group 1 coronaviruses have been found in carnivores cetartiodactyls and primates and group 2 coronaviruses have been found in cetartiodactyls perissodactyls rodents and birds previous phylogenetic analyses all of which were unrooted suggested that sars-cov represents a relatively early diverging coronavirus lineage equally distantly related to the three groups of coronaviruses noted above on this basis sars-cov was proposed as representing a fourth distinct group within the genus coronavirus marra et al 2003 rota et al 2003 these previous studies which focused on characterizing and sequencing sars-cov did not yield evidence for recombination within the sars-cov genome although marra et al 2003 commented that the s2m motif within the sars-cov utr may be the product of horizontal transfer given the disjunct presence of s2m in many if not all astroviruses a picornavirus erbv and only one group 3 coronavirus avian infectious bronchitis viruses ibvhere we use phylogenetic analyses of sars-cov and other coronaviruses rooted with diverse viruses from the family artiviridae to show that the rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp of sars-cov is a recombinant we also compare phylogenetic trees for known coronaviruses and their hosts to assess the history of host associations for sars-cov and other coronavirusesto identify and align three sars-cov proteins with homologs in the non-redundant genbank cds translations also includes pdb swissprot and pir 20 april 2003 we used pfam hidden markov models hmm bateman et al 2002 with the software hmmer eddy 1998 the hmms we used are pf05183 for rna dependent rna polymerase pf00937 for nucleocapsid n and pf01601 for spike s for identical rdrp sequences we only retained a single representative for n and s we used blastclust to retain a single representative from 95 identity groups to reduce the abundance of these sequences for computational efficiency envelope and membrane proteins were not analyzed because of their short size and lack of conservation across coronavirusesto detect recombination within rdrp s and n genes we used sliding window phylogenetic analyses where windows of 100 amino acids in 25 amino acid intervals were analyzed using bayesian inference bi mau et al 1999 yang and rannala 1997 this approach is analogous to bootscanning eg salminen et al 1995 however we use bayesian inference rather than neighbor joining nj and amino acid sequences rather than nucleotides for bi four chains were run for 200 k generations with a 100 k generation burn-in using a  distribution of rates and the transition matrices wag for s and n and rtrev for rdrp dimmic et al 2002 in mrbayes v3b4 huelsenbeck and ronquist 2001 and summarized as a 50 majority rule consensus tree we used the differential phylogenetic position of different sars-cov gene fragments windows with respect to other coronavirus groups to identify potential recombination breakpoints and to divide the alignment into segments for additional phylogenetic analyses fig 2a for rdrp with bi and nj bootstrap for the analysis of these segments bi parameters were as above except each chain was run for 1 million generations for nj bootstrap we used 1000 bootstrap replicates and nj searches under default parameters in paup summarized as a 50 majority rule consensus tree we used the approximately unbiased au test shimodaira 2002 to assess the validity of these breakpoints by determining whether alternative phylogenetic placements for different sars-cov gene regions can be statistically rejected using the program consel shimodaira and hasegawa 2001 with branch lengths and model parameters estimated in paml yang 1997in order to evaluate the types of evolutionary events codivergence duplication sorting host switching that explain the fit between coronavirus evolution and host evolution we considered the nucleocapsid coronavirus phylogeny and its host phylogeny where mammalian relationships in the host tree follow murphy et al 2001 we used treefitter v1 ronquist 2000 which incorporates differential costs to the four types of potential events of a hostparasite association codivergence c duplication d sorting s and host switching h we used various event costs to test a variety of situations see desdevises et al 2002 ronquist and liljeblad 2001 significance of fit was determined by comparing the cost of the observed tree with 10000 random permutations of the coronavirus tree terminalsthe rdrp hmm detected 27 unique sequences in genbank related to sars-cov from arteriviridae and coronaviridae the relationship between sars-cov and these other coronaviruses for each 100 amino acid window in rdrp as indicated by bi phylogeny is shown in fig 1a
 three contiguous overlapping windows spanning 150 amino acids in the 5 region of the sars-cov rdrp are sister to a clade including groups 13 all other known coronaviruses alternatively seven contiguous windows spanning 259 amino acids in the 3 region are sister to group 3 coronaviruses using this diagram fig 1a we split rdrp into two fragments 5 and 3to assess the significance of this inference we performed extensive phylogenetic analyses on each fragment the optimal tree for the 5 region fig 1b and the 3 region fig 1c mirrored the results of the sliding window analysis fig 1a to assess the potential impact of the outgroups on these results we also analyzed both regions for the 12 coronavirus taxa alone these unrooted topologies not shown are compatible with the rooted topologies indicating that the results for sars-cov in fig 1 are not due to long branch attraction involving the outgroup we then used the approximately unbiased au tree selection test shimodaira 2002 to see if the alternative competing trees for each gene fragment can be statistically rejected in favor of the optimal tree or if the conflicting results between the 5 and 3 regions are not statistically significant as shown in fig 2
 the optimal sister relationship for the 5 region with sars-cov as sister to a clade including groups 13 combined is rejectable for the 3 region and the optimal sister relationship for the 3 region with sars-cov sister to group 3 is rejectable for the 5 region additionally sars-cov rdrp as sister to group 1 rdrp is rejectable in both regions and sars-cov as sister to group 2 is rejectable in the 3 region to assess the impact of the outgroups on these results we repeated the au tests with only the 12 coronavirus taxa all alternative topologies for both regions were rejectable in favor of the optimal topology according to the au testfor s the hmm detected 120 unique relatives of sars-cov which we reduced to 24 by 95 identity clustering for n the hmm detected 93 unique relatives of sars-cov which we reduced to 32 by identity clustering for s and n we were not able to reject alternative topologies for segments when following the above procedure results not shown and thus considered each gene as a historical unit for further analysis according to their hmms both s and n are too variable to allow inclusion of an outgroup in alignment and phylogenetic analyses therefore their phylogenies are unrooted for n fig 3
 and s not shown coronavirus groups 13 are each monophyletic with respect to sars-cov however we cannot say with statistical confidence according to the au test which group 1 2 or 3 is most closely related to sars-covexamination of the fit of the n virus tree to the host tree was performed in treefitter v1 ronquist 2000 under default settings h2 s1 d0 c0 nine host switches p0001 describe a significant fit p0001 of the virus and host trees while codivergences duplications and sorting events are rare p005 as further evidence of this when the program settings are changed to maximize codivergence events h0 or h0 and c1 the global fit between the two trees is no longer significant p005 together these results indicate that given current sampling host switches have been extremely important in the evolution of coronaviruses and their hoststhe difference in the phylogenies inferred from the 5 fig 1b and 3 fig 1c rdrp regions and the significant differences in support and rejectability of alternative trees for each gene region all strongly support the hypothesis of an ancient recombination event between two co-infecting viruses we say ancient to denote that both regions are sister to clades of other sequences rather than to any single recently diverged sequence these results indicate that the two sars-cov rdrp regions do indeed represent two unique histories thus it is preferable not to analyze them together as has been done in previous analyses marra et al 2003 rota et al 2003 because their history cannot be represented by a single tree these previous analyses used distance methods nj less able to accommodate heterogeneity in rates of sequence character change and found rdrp as a whole to be closest to group 2 coronaviruses this may result from conflicts within the data stemming from recombination andor from effects of rate heterogeneity the authors do not report whether alternative trees could be rejected based on their analyses of multiple genes though it seems unlikely as when we performed similar analyses for the s and n proteins we were not able to differentiate between alternative sars-cov sister relationships using the au test we note that the approach for detecting recombination implemented here is rigorous in comparison to traditional bootscanning in that it analyzes more conserved amino acids using bayesian inference rather than nj and explicitly tests the significance of alternative topologies using the au test it is possible and likely that more recombination events have happened within rdrp n s or other sars-cov genes than we have detected here although the evidence for recombination generally becomes more difficult to discern over timeinclusion of an outgroup as we have done with rdrp from 15 arteriviridae taxa fig 1 allows inference of the sister relationships and the relative age and timing of coronaviridae coronavirus and torovirus divergence events missing from the previous unrooted analyses which only could assess distance between clades our rooted analyses indicate that the 5 rdrp fragment diverged from other coronavirus taxa prior to divergences between and within groups 13 fig 1c indicates that the 3 rdrp fragment diverged from other coronavirus homologs more recently after divergences between and within groups 13 interestingly fig 1c also shows non-monophyly for group 1 coronaviruses this is not surprising given that groups 13 were initially distinguished based on serological tests rather than phylogenetic analyses and given the capacity for recombinationthe sister relationship between the more recently diverged sars-cov 3 rdrp fragment and group 3 avian infectious bronchitis viruses fig 1c suggests that potential horizontal transmissions of s2m to sars-cov marra et al 2003 and the 3 region of rdrp are correlated they may have even been incorporated concomitantly perhaps on transmission from an ancestor of ibv the only coronavirus with s2m jonassen et al 1998 as the 5 region of rdrp and the s2m motif are disjunct in the sars-cov genome putative replication-dependent recombination would have involved several consecutive template switches as was inferred for the transfer of s2m to ibv jonassen et al 1998 alternatively horizontal transfer from astroviruses or a picornavirus cannot be ruled out as horizontal transfer of s2m accounts for its presence in three different virus families jonassen et al 1998phylogenetic indication of recombination for sars-cov makes sense as coronaviruses are unique among single-stranded non-segmented rna viruses in their propensity for recombination a mechanism purportedly useful in eliminating frequent deleterious mutations in large rna viruses lai 1996 coronavirus genomes generally appear resilient and able to tolerate deletions insertions and rearrangements de haan et al 2002 similar to our findings decimo et al 1993 suggested that n genes from murine hepatitis viruses were the result of double recombination and several authors have reported evidence for recombination among natural isolates of ibv eg jia et al 1995 wang et al 1993 recombination can be important in gain of novel functions for example in hiv recombination is considered to be a powerful adaptive mechanism for antiviral agent resistance and cytotoxic t-cell escape eg morris et al 1999 the combination of horizontal transfer and recombination results in complex phylogenies that may blur the evolutionary history of genes eg keeling and palmer 2001 rest and mindell 2003 especially since horizontal transfer and recombination are often associated processesdespite the limitations imposed on inference of historical host association by the restricted sampling of hosts and coronaviruses to date some preliminary observations can be made coronaviruses have been shown to be particularly host specific lai 1990 sturman and holmes 1983 and it had been assumed by some that they coevolved diversified in tandem with their hosts decimo et al 1993 however based on current sampling and analyses summarized in fig 3 some host switching events are implicated in accounting for incongruence between the host and coronavirus phylogenies for example chicken and turkey are sister taxa within the host phylogeny yet isolates from each do not form host-specific monophyletic groups rather some isolates from chicken are most closely related to turkey isolates suggesting host-shifts for coronaviruses between these two bird species fig 3 a third avian species the manx shearwater puffinus puffinus is the host to a group 2 coronavirus kirkwood et al 1995 which are otherwise known only from mammals the phylogenetically nested position of this avian coronavirus within mammalian-host isolates suggests a possible birdmammal host-shift coronavirus host-shifts between mouse and rat are implicated in the same manner as for chicken and turkey isolates from the two rodent species are not reciprocally monophyletic similarly isolates from pig are not monophyletic including two group 1 and one group 2 coronavirus in fig 3 with the outbreak of sars coronavirus isolates from humans are also non-monophyleticusing an earlier and more limited sampling of host species n6 and coronaviruses n9 decimo et al 1993 suggested a host-shift between cats and pigs inclusion of additional host and virus sampling in fig 3 including two isolates from dogs implicates potential host-shift between dogs and pigs rather than cats and pigs this demonstrates sensitivity to sampling although the implication of host-shifting as a phenomenon remains the emerging picture of coronavirus host associations is increasingly indicative of host-shifts this is supported in fig 3 by the observations mentioned above as well as 1 the sister relationship between human coronavirus 229e and porcine pig epidemic diarrhea virus and 2 non-monophyly for human coronavirus 229e and sars-cov further according to statistical tests in treefitter allowing host-shifts to occur results in significant fit while duplication codivergence and sorting play no detectable role depending on the assigned costs treefitter estimates between 9 and 15 host-shifts in reconciling the host and coronavirus phylogenies shown in fig 3 though the actual number is unknown in light of the genomic disparity among diverse coronaviruses from some individual host-species eg humans pigs it seems unlikely that increased sampling of coronaviruses will yield monophyly for all isolates from each of the individual host-species in fig 3the finding of recombination for sars-cov rdrp the relatively early phylogenetic divergence for rdrp fragments prior to the most recent divergences within coronavirus groups 13 as well as the inference of multiple coronavirus hosts switches suggests that sars-cov belongs to an old potentially diverse and changeable coronavirus lineage that remains to be discovered in its natural hosts demonstration of recombination in the sars associated coronavirus lineage indicates its potential for rapid unpredictable change a potentially important challenge for public health management and for drug and vaccine development the known non-human coronaviruses come from only nine mostly domestic mammal or bird species and searches for the zoonotic reservoir might reasonably focus on other species including non-domesticated animals that are used as food for humans in the geographic region of the sars outbreakin 2002 a new infectious disease was found in the southern part of china which had high mortality and morbidity and was termed severe acute respiratory syndrome sars it affected 8096 people and led 774 patients to death around the world within a very short span of time 1 several studies have shown that sars is caused by a new member of the coronavirus family the sars coronavirus sars-cov was supposed to be transmitted from wild animals 2 3 4 this hypothesis was then supported by the identification of a sars-cov-like virus in civet cats sold in markets in south china this isolate had more than 99 sequence identity with sars-cov indicating that the virus was recently transferred from animals to human beings 5 however according to a recent report there is no direct evidence that the civet cat virus is the origin of the sars-cov 6 although unlikely the possibility that sars-cov positive animals were infected from humans cannot be formally excluded and it was indeed reported that sars-cov was transmitted from man to pig 7 the mechanism how the pathogen broke the barrier between its natural reservoir and man is still unclear 8after the first sars epidemic there were three incidences of laboratory infections in singapore taiwan and beijing 9 10 11 furthermore in guangdong china sars patients were observed to suffer from mild clinical symptoms 12 it is therefore important to further explore the characteristics of the sars-cov genome and trace the source of the epidemicthere were several studies on sars-cov phylogeny and genotyping published immediately after sars was identified according to 4 polymorphism sites ruan et al 13 first genotyped 14 previously published sars-cov genomes at the beginning of may 2003 subsequently li et al 14 proposed genotypes of c and t in 17 sars-cov genomes based on 5 polymorphism sites regional and international transmission types were also proposed 15 16 sars-cov su-10 and cuhk-w1 were genotyped into two different groups even though they were all isolated in hongkong 17 based on the 7 loci of 44 sars-cov genomes c and t genotypes were further modified and named as the yexin and xiaohong genotypes 18 according to 5 polymorphism sites 63 sars-cov genomes were divided into early middle and late phase genotype groups 19 the polymorphism sites analyzed in these papers were almost the samethree successful examples have been reported where infection chains have been traced by comparing variations in sars-cov genomes the first sars-cov laboratory infection incidence was confirmed by identifying 13 variant loci in the sars-cov genomes 9 secondly it was found that the sars-cov isolated from the patient with mild clinical symptoms and the sars-cov or sars-cov-like virus isolated from animals resembled each other in the sequence encoding the spike protein 19 this study indicates that virus-carrying animals may be a risk for the investigator thirdly sequence analysis confirmed the laboratory infection of a technician who was working with sars-cov 20up to date there are already 295 complete or partial sars-cov genome sequences available in genbank a new method of genotyping is proposed in this study the results show that all sars-cov genomes are clustered into three groups and that sars-cov genomes in the second group belong to genotypes c and t these two genotypes can be further divided into 8 sub-genotypes in this study we also analyzed the sars death rate sars-cov origin and population geneticssars-cov zj01 accession no ay297028 was isolated in zhejiang province china 14 other sars-cov genome sequences were downloaded from ncbi genbank database two hundred and ninety-five complete or partial sars-cov

 as can be seen in fig 2a most sars-cov were clustered in accordance with their genotypes some partial genome sequences were situated in this tree such as cuhk-l2 sz1 gz43 hsz-a gd03t0013 bj302-1 hku-65806 and ly could not be properly located in the phylogenetic tree based on 174 loci the genomes of gz-c and qxc1 showed intercrossing features between genotype c and t some sub-genotypes such as c1 c2 t2 and t3 were easily recognized in the spike protein gene tree but some sub-genotypes were intercrossed in the phylogenetic tree of complete genomes the clusters of genotype c and t and 8 sub-types are obvious fig 2b one of the reasons for this might be that the spike protein genes were less informative than the complete genomes

groups according to the time of the sars epidemic in a certain region guangdong of china based on genome characteristics of 145 sars-covs a new concept of three groups two genotypes and eight sub-types was established the genotype c of group 2 in this work was almost compatible with the regional transmission type and the early middle phase groups while genotype t of group 2 was compatible with the international transmission type and the late phase group as well 16 19 one of the advantages of the new classification is that it fits global and regional epidemic feature analysis such as for sars-covs in taiwan and singapore up to date all the genomes from clinical samples in the early middle and late phase of the sars epidemic in these regions belonged to genotype t the concept of dividing all sars-covs into three groups was mainly based on the phylogenetic analysis and the positive darwinian selection because of the limited virus number in group 1 and 3 this grouping has to be further confirmedthe source of sars-covs was traced it was clear that genotype t was derived from genotype c 14 18 19 the origins of each sub-genotype were also elucidated 22 23 24 and are consistent with our results but the origin of the sars-cov remains a question and needs further investigation zhao et al 25 analyzed 16 sars-cov genomes and proposed that the closest common ancestor might have existed during the spring of 2002 which is consistent with the date may 2002 estimated by the spike gene synonymous mutation rate of the three groups in this work it is very probable that the three groups originated from an unknown common ancestorthe genotype classification of sars-cov plays an important role in tracing and controlling sars prevalence according to genome sequence variation analysis genotype shifts of sars-covs in the main epidemic regions during the first epidemic were obvious the sub-genotypes c1 and c2 that have a closer relationship to the virus of animal origin first appeared in guangdong and then appeared the sub-genotype c3 the dominant viruses in hongkong were of genotype t but genotype c also appeared there similarly although sub-genotype c4 dominated in beijing genotype t also existed there in singapore they had all the genomes of genotypes t mostly of sub-genotypes t1 and t2 the viruses in taiwan were all of genotype t mostly of sub-genotype t4 with more sars-cov genome sequences and more complete epidemiological data released the characteristics of the sars-covs variations in the genotypes as well as the features about the epidemic phases the epidemic regions the clinical symptoms and the viruses adaptation to the human host will become clearer and clearerthe genotype was apparently correlated with virulence of the sars-cov sars-cov gd03t0013 was from the patient with mild clinical symptoms and its genome sequence was similar to that of the sub-genotype c1 experiments have also demonstrated that sars-covs of the genotype t had a stronger ability to cause cyto-pathogenic effects cpe than those of the genotype c the cpe of the genotype t remained stable during passages in cell cultures 26 in the first epidemic sars patients in guangzhou seldom suffered from diarrhea and the sars-cov genomes were mainly of the genotype c 27 the majority of sars patients in hongkong however suffered from diarrhea and it turned out that sars-covs of the genotype t dominated 28 sars-covs of different genotypes might have different virulence moreover the serum from mice immunized with inactivated sars-cov bj01 of genotype c is able to neutralize the invasiveness of sars-cov bj01 itself into vero cells 29 further investigations are required to demonstrate whether this serum could prevent the cells from the invasiveness of the sars-cov pumc01 or others of the genotype tif in the future a sars-cov epidemic appears again after rounds of random mutations it might cause slight clinical symptoms at the initial stage of the infection through positive darwinian selection a virus with greater virulence might cause more severe clinical symptoms a period of neutrality selection and negative selection might follow and different symptoms and case fatality rates might appear on the other hand different epidemic features might occur if there are stable intermediate hosts for sars-covs of the group 2 such as sars-cov of genotype t after the first epidemic and these viruses might cause epidemics in man againcoronaviruses order nidovirales family coronaviridae subfamily coronavirinae infect a wide range of vertebrates and cause respiratory enteric or less frequently neurological diseases 1 2 coronaviruses were originally divided into three groups based on their antigenic cross-reactivities and nucleotide sequences 3 they have been recently reclassified by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses into 3 genera designated alphacoronavirus former group 1 betacoronavirus former group 2 and gammacoronavirus former group 3 4 whereas the alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses are associated with diseases of mammals including humans the gammacoronaviruses are implicated chiefly in diseases of birds interest in coronaviruses was largely focused on their impact on domestic porcine and avian husbandry and their utility in animal models of virus-induced demyelination 5 until the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 6 thereafter with recognition of the causative agent sars coronavirus sars-cov 710 and of the presence of sars-cov-like viruses in chinese horseshoe bats rhinolophus spp 11 efforts to explore the genetic diversity of coronaviruses and their host range intensified 12bats are suggested to be important reservoir hosts of many zoonotic viruses with significant impact on human and animal health including lyssaviruses henipaviruses filoviruses and coronaviruses 1317 viruses of bats may be transmitted to humans directly through bites or via exposure to saliva fecal aerosols or infected tissues as well as indirectly through contact with infected intermediate hosts such as swine 18 in the course of a project focused on pathogen discovery in situations where human-bat contact might facilitate more efficient interspecies transmission of emerging viruses we surveyed bats in nigeria through consensus pcr cpcr and unbiased high-throughput pyrosequencing uhts of bat tissue samples we identified a coronavirus that is most closely related to the genus betacoronavirus subgroup 2b which includes sars-cov and sars-cov-like viruses however the genomic organization of this coronavirus obtained from a commersons leaf-nosed bat hipposideros commersoni is unique in that it is comprised of three overlapping open reading frames orfs between the m and n genes and two conserved stem-loop ii motifs s2m based on these observations and phylogenetic analyses we propose that this new member of the family coronaviridae tentatively named zaria bat coronavirus zbcov after the city near to where the bat was captured represents a new subgroup of group 2 covstotal rna extracts from gastrointestinal tract git specimens

the s protein of zbcov 2325 see fig s1a in the supplemental material motifs at the carboxyl terminus of the s protein that are conserved among coronaviruses are also found in the zbcov s protein including the conserved motif yxkwpwywviwl present as y1237ekwpwyiwl and the cysteine-rich cytoplasmic tail 10 see fig s1b in the supplemental materialin addition to the five genes present in all

2b covs see table s8 in the supplemental material alignment of the region between the m and n genes of zbcov with those of subgroup 2b covs indicated large deletions in zbcov see fig s2 in the supplemental materialanother distinctive genomic feature of zbcov is the presence downstream from the n gene of two conserved motifs corresponding to the conserved stem-loop ii motif s2m 31 a unique s2m is observed in coronaviruses from subgroups 2b 3a and 3c and in astroviruses and in the picornavirus equine rhinitis b virus erbv 3133 see fig s3a in the supplemental material alignment of the 3 end of zbcov with subgroup 2b covs showed deletions in the genome of subgroup 2b covs where the second s2m of zbcov is identified see fig s3b the s2m of zbcov are almost identical in sequence and are separated by 19 nt see fig s3b mfold prediction 34 of rna secondary structure indicated that both s2m fold into rna stem-loop motifs see fig s3cphylogenetic trees constructed from 3clpro rdrp hel s m and n amino acid sequences of zbcov and representative coronaviruses show that zbcov is most closely related to but distinct from the subgroup 2b covs which include sars-cov and sars-cov-like viruses fig 3 this finding is in accord with results obtained from pairwise amino acid comparisons of zbcov and other coronaviruses httpcaitcumccolumbiaedu88deptgreeneidlabidentificationofasars-coronavirus-likevirusinaleaf-nosedbatinnigeriahtml to further define the phylogenetic position of zbcov an additional phylogeny was constructed using a conserved 659-nt sequence of rdrp and the time to the most recent common ancestor tmrca between zbcov and related coronaviruses was estimated based on the best-fit model srd06 with informative rate prior the results of this analysis indicated that zbcov is most closely related to ghanabt-cov a recently identified coronavirus found in bats in ghana 35 fig 4 furthermore zbcov and ghanabt-cov together form a well-supported clade distinct from that of the subgroup 2b covs the tmrca between zbcov and ghanabt-cov was estimated at 1417 years before present ybp 95 highest population density hpd  267 to 3061 ybp the tmrca between the zbcovghanabt-cov clade and subgroup 2b covs was estimated at 3047 ybp 95 hpd  714 to 6205 ybp whereas the tmrca between sars-covs and sars-cov-like viruses was only 515 ybp 95 hpd  132 to 1067 ybp estimates of the tmrcas between subgroup 2b covs and the rest of the coronavirus groups are not provided due to the potential for nucleotide site saturation at deeper phylogenetic levels to artificially create too recent tmrca estimateswhereas the mean pairwise nucleotide similarity of the partial rdrp gene region was 85 standard deviation sd  975 within coronavirus subgroups excluding zbcovghanabt-cov the mean pairwise similarity between coronavirus subgroups was 66 sd  514 see fig s4 in the supplemental material based on the results of the mann-whitney u test these distributions are statistically different p  00001 additionally whereas the mean pairwise similarity within the clade zbcovghanabt-cov was 85 sd  901 the pairwise similarity between the clade zbcovghanabt-cov and subgroup 2b covs was only 73 sd  084 based on the results of the mann-whitney u test these distributions are statistically different p  00092 together these findings indicate that the clade containing zbcov and ghanabt-cov should be considered a separate subgroup within group 2 covs distinct from subgroup 2b covs see fig s4 in the supplemental materialdifferences in phylogenetic relationships and genomic organization and the low amino acid similarities of orf 3 and the s protein of zbcov compared to the orf 3a and s proteins of subgroup 2b covs suggest that zbcov represents a new subgroup of coronaviruses within the group 2 covs although zbcov has features found in subgroup 2b covs including the trs a unique plpro orfs between the m and n genes and the presence of the s2m zbcov forms a unique branch distinct from subgroup 2b covs in all phylogenetic trees analyzed furthermore it differs from subgroup 2b covs in that zbcov contains three versus four to five orfs between the m and n genes and has two versus one s2mwhereas the s proteins of subgroup 2b covs share 78 to 98 aa sequence identity the s protein of zbcov has only 36 to 38 identity in the deduced amino acid sequence with those of subgroup 2b covs despite limited primary sequence conservation of the spike protein among zbcov and subgroup 2b covs particularly in the s1 domain pfam analyses indicated the presence of a receptor domain that binds to the receptor ace2 the cellular receptor for sars-cov 36 however the residues in sars-cov that interact with the human ace2 molecule are not conserved in zbcov suggesting that human ace2 is not a bona fide receptor for zbcov 37orf 3 located between the s and e proteins of zbcov is slightly shorter than the 3a proteins of subgroup 2b covs and has at most only 22 aa identity to the 3a proteins of subgroup 2b covs in contrast the 3a proteins of subgroup 2b covs share 81 to 98 aa identity orf 3 is predicted to contain four transmembrane domains with extracellular n and c termini in contrast orf 3a of sars-cov is predicted to contain three transmembrane domains with extracellular n termini and intracellular c termini 28 29 whereas four o glycosylation sites are predicted in the orf 3a protein of sars-cov 38 only two putative o glycosylation sites were identified in the orf 3 of zbcov the 3a protein of sars-cov has a cysteine-rich region important for polymerization and ion channel activity 28 as well as yxx and diacidic motifs suggested to be involved in the intracellular trafficking 29 these domains were recently suggested to be important for the proapoptotic function of orf 3a of sars-cov 39 however orf 3 of zbcov contains only a portion of the cysteine-rich domain and has no yxx diacidic motifs in contrast to human and civet sars-cov and bat rf12004 there is no orf 3b in zbcov the 3b protein may function as an interferon antagonist 40zbcov contains a unique set of orfs located between the m and n genes in subgroup 2b covs orf 6 orf 7 and orf 8 between the m and n genes do not overlap in contrast the three orfs between the m and n genes overlap in zbcov alignment with subgroup 2b covs indicated deletions in zbcov and as a result one continuous orf orf 8 is present in zbcov in place of orfs 7a 7b 8 8a and 8b of subgroup 2b covssimilar to sars-cov the putative products of orf 6 orf 7 and orf 8 of zbcov show no sequence homology to other viral proteins no trs upstream of orf 6 is found suggesting that if orf 6 encodes a bona fide protein that protein is likely expressed by the subgenomic rna m there is precedent in sars-cov for functional bicistronic rnas in the expression of orf 3b orf 7b orf 8b and orf 9b 26 41 coronaviruses possess accessory genes the size and location of which are group specific 2 by analogy to sars-cov orf 6 orf 7 and orf 8 of zbcov may encode accessory proteins important for virus-host interactions that may contribute to virulence and pathogenesis 26 recent studies suggest that the sars-cov accessory proteins 6 and 7b are incorporated into virus particles and that 3a 7a and 9b are structural components of the virion 26 41 42 the sars-cov accessory proteins are suggested to have biological functions that include virus release interferon antagonism apoptosis induction and inhibition of cellular protein synthesis 26 41another unique feature of zbcov is the presence of two highly conserved rna sequences s2m downstream of the n gene a single s2m is identified at the 3 end of the genomes of members of several rna virus families including the coronaviridae and astroviridae as well as the picornavirus erbv 3133 recent data suggest that the sars-cov s2m rna is a functional molecular mimic of the 530 stem-loop region in small-subunit ribosomal rna which could facilitate viral hijacking of the hosts protein synthesis machinery 43 the presence of a second s2m in zbcov may further increase the efficiency of this process interestingly secondary structures downstream of the n gene including bulged stem-loop and pseudoknot structures are also identified in the genomes of subgroup 2a and 2c covs 44 45lagos bat virus family rhabdoviridae genus lyssavirus was initially identified in nigeria in the 1950s the discovery of zbcov in a bat of the genus hipposideros family hipposideridae is the first identification of a coronavirus in wildlife from nigeria recently bat coronaviruses closely related to zbcov were isolated from roundleaf bats hipposideros caffer and hipposideros ruber in ghana a country that is close to nigeria 35 phylogenetic analysis indicates that zbcov and ghanabt-cov form a unique clade that is distinct from those in subgroup 2b covs however as the only sequence available for ghanabt-cov is a fragment of the rdrp gene a comparison of the genome organization between zbcov and ghanabt-cov is not possible our findings and recent published data wherein a sars-cov-like virus was found to lack orf 8 suggest that there is considerable diversity in the genome organization of sars-cov-like viruses 46sars-cov-like viruses have been isolated from various rhinolophid bats family rhinolophidae genus rhinolophus common insectivorous bats found in africa and eurasia however despite extensive studies no sars-cov-like viruses have been reported in hipposideros sp bats in china 32 the rhinolophus species suggested as reservoirs of sars-cov-like viruses are not present in africa a sequence fragment of a sars-cov-like virus was identified in kenya in bats of the chaerephon genus family molossidae 47 and antibodies reactive with sars-cov antigen have also been detected in the sera of seven different genera of insectivorous and fruit bats sampled in central and southern africa 48 in concert these findings suggest that there may be no strict species-specific host restriction of sars-cov-like viruses in african batsour phylogenetic analysis indicates that the clade containing zbcov and ghanabt-cov occupies an ancestral position to the group 2b covs which include sars-cov and sars-cov-like viruses similar to previous estimates the tmrca of these two clades was estimated at 3047 ybp although with large 95 hpds although sars-cov-like viruses have been identified exclusively in bats in china a recent sequence fragment 120 bp recovered from a kenyan bat was found to occupy a position just outside subgroup 2b and may represent the ancestral african lineage of all subgroup 2b covs 47 together with the position of the african clade of zbcovghanabt-cov relative to subgroup 2b covs this finding suggests that a migration event from africa to china within the last 100 to 1000 years may have resulted in the subgroup 2b lineage of covs indeed the geographic distribution and the phylogenetic relationships of bat coronaviruses seen both here fig 4 and in previous work 35 suggest the presence of multiple independent migration events between africa and asia throughout the history of bat coronaviruses additional sequence data for the bat coronaviruses identified in kenya along with increased sampling for coronaviruses in africa as well as central and eastern asia will likely be necessary to unveil the timing and origin of this diverse group of coronavirusesbats are important reservoir hosts of zoonotic viruses with significant impact on human health including rabies nipah virus hendra virus zaire ebola virus marburg virus and sars-cov the wide genetic diversity that exists among zoonotic viruses in bats may allow an increased emergent potential of interspecies variants that may cause outbreaks of disease in humans and domestic animals the giant leaf-nosed bat hipposideros commersoni is widespread in sub-saharan africa from gambia to ethiopia mozambique and madagascar but little is known concerning its ecology population biology or vector competence clearly in order to enhance our knowledge of the diversity and cooccurrence of potential reservoir hosts it is essential to better understand emerging pathogen dynamics and public health relevance as a means to prevent and control future disease outbreaksduring june 2008 bats were collected with mist netting in caves and around human dwellings or manually from roost locations near idanre and zaria nigeria all bats appeared clinically normal captured bats were anesthetized by intramuscular inoculation with ketamine hydrochloride 005 to 01 mgg of body weight and euthanized under sedation by intracardiac exsanguination and cervical dislocation the species of each captured bat was recorded as well as the sex forearm and body lengths in cm and weight all samples were initially stored transported on ice packs and stored thereafter at 20c until shipment on dry ice and final storage at 80c no lyssavirus-specific antigens were identified in bat brains by use of direct fluorescent antibody testingcoronavirus screening was performed

of the spike s open reading frame orf 3a and non-structural protein nsp genes in civet sarsr-covs collected in both the 2003 and the minor 2004 outbreaks suggested that the virus was undergoing rapid evolutionary gene adaptation in civets song et al 2005 thirdly compared with sars-cov collected from human during the 2003 epidemic functional changes have been observed in the s protein of civet sarsr-cov and the sars-cov isolated from the 2004 minor outbreak the latter showed less efficient use of the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor li et al 2005b and demonstrated resistance to antibody inhibition yang et al 2005 finally while significant levels of antibody to sars-cov were detected in 80 of the civets from one animal market in guangzhou low seroprevalence rates in civets from various civet farms in china suggested that civets were largely brought to the animal market infection-free guan et al 2003 tu et al 2004 the sarsr-cov was likely contracted during later mixing and tradingin view of these observations we carried out a molecular surveillance study in various mammals in hong kong to hunt for the ultimate source of the virus lau et al 2005 among the 127 bats including 8 bat species 20 monkeys and 60 rodents surveyed sarsr-cov was only detected in 39 of the fecal samples of 59 chinese horseshoe bats rhinolophus sinicus rs lau et al 2005 western blot analysis showed that antibodies against the nucleocapsid n protein of bat sarsr-cov was present in 67 of the serum samples of chinese horseshoe bats while 8 of the serum of chinese horseshoe bats were tested positive for human sars-cov-neutralizing antibody with titer 120 lau et al 2005 shortly afterward another independent group also reported the detection of sarsr-cov in chinese horseshoe bats greater horseshoe bats rhinolophus ferrumequinum rf and big-eared horseshoe bats rhinolophus macrotis rm in hubei and guangxi provinces of china li et al 2005a in the past few years sarsr-covs have been isolated from a variety of horseshoe bats in yunnan province of china by several groups ge et al 2013 he et al 2014 hu et al 2017 lau et al 2015three hundred and thirty nine sarsr-cov genomes have been sequenced from 2003 to 2018 these include 274 genomes from human 18 from civets and 47 from bats the human sars-cov and civet sarsr-cov were collected in 20032004 while bat sarsr-covs were continuously detected even after the cessation of the sars epidemic in this article we review our current understanding of the molecular epidemiology evolution and phylogeny of sarsr-covs based on analysis of these 339 genomesthe genome size of the sars-cov varies from 290 kb to 302 kb its genome structure follows the characteristic gene order of other known covs the 5 two thirds of the genome comprises orf1ab encoding replicase polyproteins while the 3 one third consists of genes encoding structural proteins including s envelope e membrane m and n proteins fig 1
 both the 5 and 3 ends of the sars-cov genome contain short untranslated regions the translational product of orf1ab is cleaved by proteases encoded by sars-cov itself into 16 nsps which include major enzymes such as papain-like proteases plpro chymotrypsin-like protease 3clpro rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp and helicase hel fig 1 in contrast to the genome of viruses belonging to lineage a betacoronavirus recently renamed as subgenera embecovirus haemagglutinin-esterase gene is absent from the genome of sars-cov in addition sars-cov contains 67 accessory proteins encoded by orf3a orf3b orf6 orf7a orf7b and orf8 or orf8a and orf8b as a result of a 29-nucleotide nt deletion this is unique to lineage b betacoronavirus a subgenus recently renamed sarbecovirus and contains all sarsr-covs fig 2
studies in the past 15 years have partly revealed the biochemical functions of these accessory proteins liu et al 2014 protein 3a triggers apoptosis and induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as rantes regulated on activation normal t cell expressed and secreted also known as c-c motif chemokine ligand 5 ccl5 and cxcl8 c-x-c motif chemokine ligand 8 protein 3b inhibits type i interferon and also induces apoptosis protein 6 inhibits interferon signaling and stimulates dna synthesis protein 7a activates nf-b nuclear factor kappa b and mapk8 mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 for cxcl8 and rantes production the function of protein 7b is not well characterized yet orf8 is present in all sarsr-cov genomes in bats and civets as well as in sars-covs isolated from human during the early phase of the epidemic protein 8 activates the atf6 activating transcription factor 6 branch of unfolded protein response in the genomes of sars-covs isolated from human during the late phase of the epidemic there was a signature 29-nt deletion in orf8 splitting it into two separate orfs 8a and 8b protein 8a includes caspase-dependent apoptosis whereas protein 8b modulates cellular dna synthesisbefore the sars epidemic there were just around 10 covs with complete genome sequences available these covs were classified into three groups group 1 group 2 and group 3 in 2011 the coronavirus study group of the international committee for taxonomy of viruses renamed these three groups into three genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus de groot et al 2011 when sars-cov was first discovered in 2003 phylogenetic analysis of the sars-cov genome showed that it occupied a unique position in betacoronavirus which was subsequently placed into the subgenus sarbecovirus the traditional betacovs eg mouse hepatitis virus human cov oc43 bovine cov were classified as embecovirus fig 2 after the sars epidemic an unprecedented number of novel covs were discovered lau et al 2016 lau et al 2007 lau et al 2012a lau et al 2012b lau et al 2014 woo et al 2005 woo et al 2014a woo et al 2014b this led to the description of lineage c betacoronavirus which comprises important members such as tylonycteris bat coronavirus hku4 pipistrellus bat coronavirus hku5 hypsugo bat coronavirus hku25 and middle east respiratory syndrome cov lau et al 2013 lau et al 2018b woo et al 2007 woo et al 2006a and lineage d betacoronavirus lau et al 2010b as well as a novel genus deltacoronavirus lau et al 2018a woo et al 2012 woo et al 2017 fig 2 lineage c and lineage d betacoronavirus were now renamed as subgenera merbecovirus and nobecovirussince its first discovery in chinese horseshoe bats in 2004 lau et al 2005 sarsr-covs have been continuously found in various horseshoe bat species in the last 13 years drexler et al 2010 ge et al 2013 he et al 2014 hu et al 2017 lau et al 2005 lau et al 2010a li et al 2005a tang et al 2006 wu et al 2016 yang et al 2013 yang et al 2015 zeng et al 2016 this is in contrast to the case for civets and human where sarsr-covs were only found in 20032004 and never reported afterward for the 47 bat sarsr-cov genomes 30 are from chinese horseshoe bats 9 from greater horseshoe bats 2 from big-eared horseshoe bat 2 from least horseshoe bat rhinolophus pusillus rp and 1 each from intermediate horseshoe bat rhinolophus affinis ra blasiuss horseshoe bat rhinolophus blasii rb stoliczkas asian trident bat aselliscus stoliczkanus as in the neighboring family hipposideridae and wrinkled-lipped free-tailed bat chaerephon plicata cp in the genetically more distant family molossidae sarsr-covs have also been detected in countries other than china including thailand italy luxembourg bulgaria slovenia hungary japan kenya etc however only partial sequences were available for these isolates nevertheless the immediate progenitor of sars-cov has not been pinpointedamong the 45 sarsr-cov genomes from bats in china 11 of them were from hong kong 2 were from guangdong 2 from guangxi 5 from hubei 20 from yunnan and one each from shaanxi shanxi jilin guizhou hebei respectively overall it is observed that the sarsr-cov genomes from bats in yunnan possess relatively higher whereas those from guangdong jilin shanxi and hebei possess relatively lower nt identity to those from civets fig 3a this is an interesting phenomenon since the sars epidemic that emerged in late 2002 was first noticed in guangdong province as an outbreak of acute community-acquired atypical pneumonia syndrome severe cases were later retrospectively traced back to five cities around guangzhou with the index case reported in foshan a city 24 km away from guangzhou the second case was a chef from heyuan who worked in a restaurant in shenzhen who contacted with wild game-food animals regularly this mismatch between clinical events and apparent gradient of nt identity could either be due to a missing link during evolutionary adaptation among the sarsr-covs in different provinces or simply as a result of sampling errorthe high frequency of homologous rna recombination is one of the major factors contributing to a plastic genome underpinning the evolutionary force in covs this has resulted in different genotypes or even different covs adapted to new hosts herrewegh et al 1998 lau et al 2011 terada et al 2014 woo et al 2006b as for sarsr-covs it is evident from both multiple alignments and phylogenetic analyses that some genes of a particular sarsr-cov from bats may possess higher while other genes possess much lower nt identity to the corresponding genes of sarsr-cov genomes from humancivets resulting in shifting of phylogenetic position in different phylogenetic trees this phenomenon is frequently observed in sarsr-covs and likely explains the generation of novel sarsr-covs that could jump from bat to civet and subsequently to humantrimers of s protein form spikes on the surface of covs particles it comprises two functionally distinct subunits  s1 and s2 domains which are involved in receptor binding and fusion respectively like other class i viral fusion proteins the s protein undergoes a series of events including receptor recognition proteolytic cleavage to shed the s1 subunit and conformational changes in s2 that ultimately lead to fusion of the viral and host membranes it has been well established that human sars-cov utilizes ace2 as a functional receptor the receptor-binding motifs in the c-terminal domain of s1 are implicated in receptor recognition substitutions within the s1 receptor-binding domain rbd confers adaptability to new or orthologous entry receptors thus altering the viral tropism hulswit et al 2016 undoubtedly the ability to bind human ace2 is an indispensable step in establishing cross-species transmissionas we have previously hypothesized the five amino acid aa deletion twelve aa deletion as well as aa substitutions at 5 critical residues for binding serve as determining factors for the s protein-ace2 interaction table 1
 a critical pre-requisite for reliable ace2 utilization is the absence of 5 aa and 12 aa deletions and preferably the presence of at least two out of five human-adapted residues based on these analyses sarsr-rs-batcov wiv1 is one of the strains most advantageously conformed genotypically for ace2 utilization it has been shown to be able to directly infect well-differentiated primary human airway epithelial cell cultures menachery et al 2016 in addition neutralization assays using convalescent sera from sars-cov infected patients showed robust neutralization against tissue culture infectious dose 50 of wiv1 ge et al 2013sarsr-rs-batcov rsshc014 a strain discovered in chinese horseshoe bats in 2012 contains two of the five aa residues in civet strain civet007 but none of the five human-adapted residues it retains both the 5 aa and 12 aa deletion sites this genotype is shared by sarsr-rs-batcov rs4231 and rs4084 recombinant mouse-adapted sars-cov expressing the s protein of rsshc014 was still able to utilize ace2 for viral entry causing cytopathic changes in vero cells and weight loss in mice model despite the apparent failure in pseudovirus infectivity assay menachery et al 2015 however significantly slower viral replication rate was observed suggesting that deletions in rbds were more critical in receptor recognition while the presence of ace2-adapted critical residues modulated entry efficiency in contrary to the wiv1 strain neither neutralizing human monoclonal antibody nor existing double-inactivated whole sars-cov vaccine provided protective effect against infection caused by shc014-harboring recombinant virus strain indicating key difference in aa sequences determining antigenicity menachery et al 2015a phylogenetic tree was constructed from the rbds of sarsr-covs fig 4
 surprisingly sarsr-ra-batcov lyra11 a strain discovered in intermediate horseshoe bat in baoshan yunnan he et al 2014 around 375 km from kunming sits closest to the civethuman sarsr-covs despite its lower overall nt identity this is likely due to the presence of 7 nt in civethuman sars-cov that is found exclusively in sarsr-ra-batcov lyra11 such a unique s gene in relation to civethuman sars-cov would therefore challenge the previous hypothesis that the origin of rbd was solely from chinese horseshoe bats in kunming nevertheless the s proteins of the majority of bat sarsr-covs found in chinese horseshoe bats in various part of china including yunnan resemble the genotype of sarsr-rs-batcov hku3 but not the human ace2-utilizing genotype of sarsr-rs-batcov wiv1 this raises question on how sarsr-batcovs manage to have two distinct genotypes of s infecting the same host rs there is a possibility that two cellular receptors for sarsr-covs are present in chinese horseshoe batsinterestingly two novel sarsr-rp-batcov strains zxc21 and zc45 isolated from least horseshoe bat in zhoushan zhejiang province in eastern china were shown to be able to infect suckling rats causing inflammation in the brain tissue and histological changes in the lung and intestine despite failed viral isolation in veroe6 cells phylogenetically these two strains represented a separate clade lying between the susceptible clade of sarsr-ra-batcov lyra11 and the non-susceptible clade of sarsr-rf-batcov rf1 however the mechanism of such infectivity in suckling rats was not investigated further especially in light of the two retained deletion sites in the s genes of zxc21 and zc45 which should have imposed inter-species barrier in terms of receptor specificity based on previous discussion hu et al 2018among all the horseshoe bats sarsr-covs are most commonly found in chinese horseshoe bats and greater horseshoe bats detailed analysis of their genomes revealed several intriguing phenomena firstly orf1a and orf1b in sarsr-rf-batcov ynlf31c isolated from greater horseshoe bats in lufeng yunnan by our group has the highest nt identity to civet sarsr-cov especially at the regions nsp5 nsp10 nsp12 and nsp13 fig 3a this raised the possibility that lufeng yunnan could be a potential gene pool for the progenitor of orf1 of sars-cov secondly as previously illustrated for most regions along the genome of sarsr-cov except orf8 sarsr-rs-batcovs from chinese horseshoe bats are predominantly closer to civet sarsr-cov however the orf8 of sarsr-rf-batcov has higher aa identity to civet sarsr-cov orf8 in addition v90 and i113 are the two rf-specific residues present in the orf8 of sarsr-rf-batcov rf4092 which could evolutionarily bridge the orf8 of sarsr-rf-batcov to sarsr-rs-batcov that had very high identity to civethuman sars-cov fig 5
 sars-rf-batcov was thus hypothesized to be the origin of human sars-cov orf8 gene through recombination eventsin fact at least three genotypes of orf8 have been found to circulate in nature wu et al 2016 type i is genetically closest to orf8 of civet sarsr-cov 962981 nt identity there are eleven such strains isolated from bats so far with eight of them originating from chinese horseshoe bats and three from greater horseshoe bats type ii orf8 has lower 708828 nt identity to orf8 of civet sarsr-cov it is prevalent only in sarsr-rf-batcov and demonstrates genetic stability regardless of geographical distribution with similar orf8s detected in korea shanxi hubei and hebei sarsr-rs-batcov has not been found to process type ii orf8 yet another strain the sarsr-rp-batcov f46 isolated from least horseshoe bats processes an orf8 with a phylogenetic position right between type i and type ii orf8s with 932 nt identity to civet sarsr-cov further complicating the analysis fig 6
 the rest of the orf8 genes from sequenced sarsr-batcov strains belong to type iii these type iii orf8 genes possess 539577 nt identity to the orf8 of civet sarsr-cov and have the greatest genetic distance observed over the whole genome of sarsr-cov fig 3b they are detected across a wide range of bat species including r sinicus r macrotis r pusillus r affinis a stoliczkanus and c plicata except r ferrumequinum in which type iii orf8 has not been found in short the orf8 of sarsr-rf-batcov from greater horseshoe bats is phylogenetically closer to orf8 of humancivet sars-covas mentioned above orf8 in the late-phase human epidemic was split into 8a and 8b due to a unique 29 nt deletion a similar 5-nt deletion was observed in the type i orf8 isolated from the strain sarsr-rs-batcov rs4084 however since the majority of sarsr-rs-batcovs orf8 genes belong to the type iii orf8 genotype it raises the speculation that this minority of type i orf8 plays a non-essential role in the chinese horseshoe bats host environmentin a recent study recombinant sars-cov carrying three forms of orf8 were constructed including complete orf8 as seen in the early phase of the 2003 human epidemic and civets orf8 that contained the characteristic 29 nt deletion and a variant strain with orf8 replaced by a 5 nt spacer sequence replication assay in verofm cells demonstrated a phenotypic hierarchy that the infectious clone with full type i orf8 exhibited significantly more efficient growth than other variants the same hierarchy of viral replication was observed in human airway epithelial cell cultures and several non-host cell lines transduced to express human ace2 including r alcyone lung epithelial cell line cotton rat airway epithelial cell line and goat and sheep lung cell lines this study suggests that the 29 nt deletion actually conferred a loss of viral fitness during the initial phase of human-to-human transmission contradicting the previous belief that the truncated products orf8a and orf8b favored adaptation to human muth et al 2018complete genome analysis has been carried out for all sequenced sarsr-cov with respect to civet sarsr-cov the importance of civet sarsr-cov is underlined by its close genetic relationship to human sars-cov along the entire genome and especially at the rbd region where nt identity approaches 988998 moreover the genetic diversity within the group of civet sarsr-cov strains is minimal further supporting that civets are only recently infected adaptation of sarsr-batcov to civet as intermediate amplification host is likely needed which is further corroborated by the phylogenetic position of civet ace2 in-between bat and human ace2 recently direct bat-to-human transmission of sarsr-cov was proposed by some groups in view of the fact that some sarsr-batcovs could utilize human ace2 receptors in vitro and that seropositive sera against sarsr-batcovs were detected in yunnan residents menachery et al 2015 wang et al 2018 despite the fact that humancivet sars-cov has never been reported in yunnan our findings provide substantial evidence against this hypothesis from a phyloepidemiologic point of view and demonstrated the significance of an intermediate host during the transmission cascade fig 3referring to fig 3a sarsr-rs-batcov rs4084 was one of the two strains that possess the highest genome identity to civethuman sarsr-cov it is so far the only sarsr-batcov that possessed at least 70 nt identity in all parts of the genome including the four hypervariable regions the region sharing lowest similarity to civethuman sarsr-cov was the n-terminal domain ntd of the s protein which was likely non-critical as mentioned above sarsr-rs-batcov rs4084 was predicted to be able to utilize human ace2 as functional receptor since its rbd region is genetically similar to rsshc014 sarsr-rs-batcov rs4084 has not been studied either as whole virus or in the form of recombinant virus in terms of accessory protein function tissue infectivity assay and replication kinetics leaving a potential field for future investigations animal experiment using civet model would offer great promise in the studying of such virus along with other sarsr-batcovs that could utilize human ace2the 300 genome sequences of sars-cov in human civets and bats accumulated in the last 15 years allowed us to understand the cause of such a highly fatal epidemic that affected us in a global scale in 2003 after 15 years of work we are now much closer to fully understand the origin of sars-cov and its evolution as genomes with fragments that contain gene sequences with higher and higher nt identities to the sars-cov found in human were observed our current model on the origin of sars is that the human sars-cov that caused the epidemic in 2003 was probably a result of multiple recombination events from a number of sars-cov ancestors yunnan is the province in china with the largest diversity of horseshoe bat species it is also the area shown to have a high variety of sars-cov ancestors further in-depth molecular epidemiology studies in this and other provinces in its proximity including guangxi and guangdong will hopefully give us an even clearer picture on the origin and early evolution of sars-covthe human population is constantly being barraged by newly emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens as evidenced by sporadic outbreaks of a variety of different viruses that have occurred in recent years 1234 between late 2002 and 2004 the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov a member of the coronaviridae family in the nidovirales order emerged as a new human pathogen causing a worldwide epidemic with more than 8000 infections and 700 known deaths 56 while the primary host reservoir responsible for harboring the immediate ancestor of sars-cov has yet to be identified evidence of direct transmission of the virus between civets in close proximity to humans has been observed and reported in at least two distinct events 789 the world health organization who became involved in responding to this outbreak by using modern communications technologies to establish a worldwide collaborative multi-centre research project on severe acute respiratory syndrome sars diagnosis tasked with identifying the etiological agent of the outbreak multiple labs worked concurrently to determine the sequence of this new pathogen 10 investigate the structure of virions by electron microscopy 11 and generate other data that contributed to the correct identification of the causative agent 12 meanwhile public health specialists implemented control measures and mitigation procedures to prevent the spread of the disease 13in order to support research focused on these newly emerging pathogens the division of microbiology and infectious diseases dmid of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid at the us national institutes of health nih is supporting a variety of resources for researchers httpwwwniaidnihgovlabsandresourcesresourcesdmidpagesdefaultaspx including the genomic sequencing centers for infectious diseases structural genomics centers for infectious diseases systems biology for infectious diseases research 14 and bei resources repository programs to increase public availability of genome sequence data 3d protein structures systems biology models isolated organisms and experiment reagents the bioinformatics resource centers brc for infectious diseases 151617 were created to serve as database resources for the integration of research and surveillance data being generated by these dmid-sponsored resources and by other primary investigators working on infectious diseases caused by different groups of human pathogens and their insect vectors the objective of the brc program is to provide a one-stop-shop for data and analytical tools to support data mining and analysis workflows for both basic and applied research the virus pathogen database and analysis resource vipr brc wwwviprbrcorg supports virology researchers studying select agents and other significant public health pathogens belonging to 14 virus families including coronaviridae 16 cross-referencing data and integrating computational tools into the online vipr resource allows complex analyses to be easily performed by researchers regardless of their bioinformatics training or expertisethe layout of the vipr home page at wwwviprbrcorg highlights the three major functions of the resource figure 1 first vipr captures different types of data from both external and internal sources and makes them accessible through custom search pages vipr stores these data for virus families categorized as containing either human priority pathogens or possible public health threats including 6 families of single-stranded positive-sense rna virusescaliciviridae coronaviridae flaviviridae hepeviridae picornaviridae togaviridae 5 families of single-stranded negative-sense rna virusesarenaviridae bunyaviridae filoviridae paramyxoviridae rhabdoviridae 1 family of double-stranded rna virusesreoviridae and 2 families of double-stranded dna virusesherpesviridae poxviridae although vipr is focused on supporting human infectious disease research related viruses within these families isolated from other host species are also accessible to allow comparative genomics research second vipr has assembled a suite of data analysis and visualization tools so that users can perform custom correlative analyses third datasets and analysis results can be saved in private workspaces in the vipr workbench for subsequent retrieval and sharing vipr aims to provide a single resource to access multiple types of data from various public resources for the virus research community vipr stores sequence records manually-curated immune epitopes 3d protein structures and other types of public records together with the relevant metadata ie structured information associated with a given record from genbank 18 uniprot 19 protein databank pdb httpwwwrcsborgpdb 20 immune epitope database iedb wwwiedborg 21 pubmed and gene ontology consortium go wwwgeneontologyorg 22 all of these data are regularly updated and are easily retrievable by selecting search criteria within the intuitive web-based user query interfaces implemented throughout vipr for coronaviridae there are currently sequence and related data from 8635 different virus strains in vipr as of september 2012 table 1following import into vipr these public data are further processed to produce novel derived data through the use of various automated bioinformatics and comparative genomics algorithms implemented by vipr and run behind the scenes as well as information from manual curation such pre-calculated data includes molecular weight isoelectric point and pfam and other domainsmotifs determined using interproscan 23 for all proteins predicted cd8 t-cell epitopes using the netctl algorithm 24 nearest blastp hits predicted ortholog groups using orthomcl 25 and all linked pubmed references table 1vipr utilizes the national center for biotechnology and information ncbi refseq strains 26 to extend the manually-curated refseq annotations to the rest of the strains belonging to the same taxon strain records that lack protease cleavage site information for nonstructural proteins are analyzed using custom prediction pipelines that use multiple sequence alignment to map homologous sequence regions and cleavage sites from closely-related refseq sequences sequence-based methods are also used to construct virus ortholog groups and the associated annotations which are provided throughout the resource to easily identify proteins having similar function within the virus family even when the geneprotein names or symbols do not match in an effort to add information that is not included in the genbank records vipr has also manually-curated the scientific literature to glean information regarding the country year and host of isolation for many of the clinically-relevant sars-cov strainsrecently we have implemented a sequence feature variant type component within vipr that captures the location of characterized regions found in viral proteins while this functionality is based on previous work in human hla and influenza virus proteins 2728 it has been extended to the various taxa within vipr sequence feature sf definitions are obtained from the scientific literature genbank uniprot and iedb records and are categorized as structural eg alpha-helices functional eg active sites immune epitopes or sequence alteration sf types sf definitions are currently available in vipr for dengue serotypes 1-4 hepatitis c subtype 1a and pox vaccinia viruses however functionality exists that allows researchers to add new definitions for any other virus species in vipr through community annotation efforts such crowd-sourcing efforts are essential to provide the custom sequence feature definitions for each taxon which can then be useful in performing data mining comparative genomics andor evolutionary analyses by the community as a whole in order to maintain highly accurate definitions within vipr all community-proposed sfs are inspected and validated by domain experts prior to becoming publicly accessible through viprfor each sf all vipr amino acid sequence records for viruses in the same taxon are searched in order to identify all unique sequence variations observed all strains containing the same sequence variation pattern are then assigned to the same variant type vt category each defined sf has a dedicated sequence feature details page in vipr that displays information about the protein and strain from which the region was characterized and reported the reference citations all observed vts a list of all strains bearing each of the vts hyperlinks to any homologous 3d protein structures and a search interface for finding a particular vt based on the user-input sequence by performing comparative genomics analyses on unique sets of sequence variations in the short well-characterized regions found in the sfvt component of vipr researchers can easily identify candidate positions that correlate with a given phenotype at a finer level of granularity and with less noise than is possible using whole-protein sequence analysis approachesoutside institutions and programs including the niaid-funded genome sequencing centers gsc for infectious diseases submit coronaviridae sequence metadata that may not be available in the corresponding genbank sequence record directly to vipr sequence metadata can be used in various vipr search interfaces as query criteria to identify all strain records andor genome sequence data that match the specified constraints and in selected comparative genomics analysis toolsdata from experiments interrogating host genes and proteins that respond to viral infection are currently being generated and submitted by laboratories associated with the niaid-supported systems biology for infectious diseases research program and the brc driving biological projects program and have recently been included within the new host factor component in vipr the intent of these studies is to identify host factors that positively- andor negatively influence virus replication across a range of experimental variables using high-throughput -omics methods including gene expression microarrays proteomics and rna interference technologies for each set of experimental variables the lists of host factors called biosets that are identified as being significantly different when compared to controls are submitted to vipr the aim of this component is to provide easy access to the processed data establish an automated approach for users to perform a rapid comparison of their own genes of interest against those that have previously been identified through virus-host response experiments and to offer the analytical tools necessary to interpret such data currently vipr contains data from multiple host factor experiments involving sars-cov and influenza a virus infections in cell culture and in experimental animals and provides a boolean search function to identify shared unique or combined lists of factors found to be significant between such experiments additional datasets from experiments using other viruses will be imported in the futureaccess to data in vipr together with the integrated analysis and visualization tools begins by clicking on the coronaviridae family name on the vipr home page the system was designed to separate data by family to ideally manage the genome structure data requirements and other specific nuances that are unique to each virus family constructing a custom query for any data type including sequence records is both fast and easy using the custom interfaces designed to reflect the contents in the vipr system whole and partial genome sequence records can be searched with user-specified criteria including genera species virus host and geographical andor temporal point of isolation currently the coronaviridae component in vipr contains sequence data for viruses annotated as being isolated from 68 different host types across 59 countries between 1941 and 2011 keyword searches can be used to retrieve database entries based on any available metadata more advanced pattern-matching search capabilities also exist to retrieve sequence records that contain specified sequence strings search results are reported in tabular format on a genome search results page which provides hyperlinks to strain details pages for each respective strainthe strain details page figure 2 is specific to each virus strain and contains various annotations including strain name and taxonomy as well as a description of the host and geo-temporal point of specimen isolation genome-level information such as genbank record name and accession number sequence length and number of proteins encoded by the genome are also displayed on the strain details page together with genome image map graphics and protein information tables choosing a specific protein from either the graphic or the table will load a geneprotein details page figure 3 that displays additional information obtained from public archives including experimentally-determined immune epitopes and go annotations and data derived from vipr analysis procedures including predicted molecular weight isoelectric point domainsmotifs predicted immune epitopes blastp results and ortholog informationonce the desired sequence records are obtained from the search results page an integrated collection of tools is provided to perform various comparative genomics analyses and visualization tasks the suite of tools currently available in vipr includes multiple sequence alignment msa calculation using either muscle with uclust or mauve 293031 msa visualization and modification with jalview 32 msa format conversion with readseq 33 phylogenetic tree reconstruction using the fastme phyml or raxml algorithms 343536 evolutionary model selection using either modelcompare or prottest 37 phylogenetic tree visualization and manipulation with archaeopteryx 38 3d protein structure visualization and exploration using jmol 39 metadata-driven comparative genomics statistical analysis using meta-cats nucleotide and amino acid sequence search against custom databases using blast 40 sequence variation calculation using the weblogo algorithm 41 short peptide search with exact fuzzy or pattern match annotation mapping for new sequences using the genome annotation transfer utility 42 and custom pcr primer design using the primer3 algorithm 43 table 2 the use of a subset of these tools will be described in more detail as part of an exploratory scientific use case described belowthe vipr workbench is a relatively unique feature that allows users to save search criteria and results selected sequence records as working sets and analysis results for future access any user can register for their own free private workspace for each virus family in the vipr system simply by providing an email address and password to enable future log in working sets of nucleotide sequences can be converted into sets of amino acid sequences and vice versa using integrated sequence type conversion tools the workbench also facilitates the virtual sharing of user-selected content with collaborators around the world regardless of their physical location when saving search criteria in the workbench the system can automatically notify the user via email whenever new records that match the original query are added to the database selected sequence records from multiple searches can be merged using boolean logic and can be combined with user uploaded data to be analyzed with the integrated suite of tools in vipr while keeping the uploaded data private results from multiple sequence alignments sequence variation analysis and phylogenetic tree inferences can be saved for quick future retrievalwe begin by searching for all sars-cov sequences in vipr derived from isolates taken from either humans or civets as of september 2012 this query returned 79 complete genome records consisting of 62 human records from 9 annotated countries and 17 civet records from 2 annotated countries isolated between 2003 and 2004 including strains taken during the height of the main and recurrent sars-cov outbreaks query results are displayed on the genome search results page with contents sortable by clicking on the column headings desired records from the search results page can then be directly analyzed by selecting any of the integrated tools accessible as menu options under the run analysis pull-down tab or saved as a working set in the users personal workbench for the purposes of this use case the sequence set was additionally filtered to remove fifteen genome records that did not have metadata for the year of isolation two genome records that were derived from passaging of a virus strain already in the list and one duplicate record for the refseq strain already in the listall 61 genome sequence records matching the search and passing the filtering criteria were selected and saved to the workbench for more in-depth analysis by clicking the add to working set button on the search results page this filtered dataset consisted of 15 isolates taken from civets and 46 isolates taken from humanssequence data in fasta format can be used as input for performing a fast customized multiple sequence alignment msa in real-time data sources for this analysis can include search results working sets andor uploaded custom sequences sequences for rna viruses are aligned with the muscle algorithm on the vipr server with the ability to download the msa results in fasta format andor save the msa results to the workbench once the alignment is finished the integrated jalview tool allows the viewing and editing of the sequence and label information associated with the alignment to assist in interpreting the results for the current use case the nucleotide sequence alignment for the selected sars-cov strains confirms that these genomes are extremely well conserved across the entire length of the alignment even though they are derived from two very different host species figure 4anucleotide or amino acid sequence data can be used to construct phylogenetic trees in vipr sequence data can be obtained from search results working sets or custom data uploaded either to the workbench or directly to the phylogenetic tree input page alternatively phylogenetic trees can be constructed through the run analysis pull-down tab on the multiple sequence alignment results page directly once a phylogenetic tree is completed the results can be saved in the workbench or downloaded in the phyloxml or newick formats 44 vipr provides the fastme algorithm for constructing minimum evolution phylogenetic trees from the selected sequence data using the quick tree option the phyml and raxml maximum likelihood tree inferencing algorithms with bootstrapping have also been included in vipr together with the modelcompare software to determine the evolutionary model best suited for use with any individual datasetwhen the phylogenetic tree construction is finished the integrated archaeopteryx phylogenetic tree viewer can be used to easily visualize explore interpret and manipulate the tree using built-in functions such as re-rooting branch swapping selecting sub-trees etc 38 this visualization tool has been further customized to take advantage of the extensive metadata associated with the various sequence records stored in the vipr database to allow user-driven coloration of the labels at the terminal nodes ie leaves of the phylogenetic tree according to the host country or year of isolation a high-resolution image of the customized phylogenetic tree display can be exported in a variety of formats to enable more in-depth interpretation andor inclusion in presentations or publications for the current scientific use case raxml was used to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree for all sequence records that matched the original search and filtering criteria which was subsequently colored based on the host of isolation figure 4b the tree topology for this phylogenetic reconstruction shows two major clades that separate largely according to both the year and host of isolation the majority of strains from the first clade were taken in 2003 with all but two members of this clade being isolated from civets hereafter referred to as the civet-predominate clade for the second clade almost all of the strains were sampled in 2004 with all but two members isolated from humans hereafter referred to as the human-predominate clade this topology confirms that at least two species-jump events between civet and human have occurred 9 it also suggests that this species barrier does not appear to be a significant bottleneck for sars-covthe metadata-driven comparative analysis tool for sequences meta-cats is an automated analysis workflow developed and implemented by the vipr team to support the calculation of user-driven comparative genomics statistical analyses this tool allows users to not only take advantage of the numerous sequence records in vipr but also the wealth of accompanying metadata for these records stored in the vipr database such metadata may include date andor geospatial point of specimen collection host species severity of disease etc since this tool examines both the sequence and the associated metadata statistically significant genotype-phenotype correlations can be detected input for this tool can include sequence search results working sets or custom upload of both sequence data and the associated metadata once the desired sequences are selected the tool guides the user through the necessary steps of 1 assigning the sequences to up to five different groups based on metadata or other user criteria 2 aligning all assigned sequences 3 performing automated statistical analyses on the sequences and 4 viewing the resultsfor the current use case the original sequence search results were automatically divided into two groups by the vipr system based on the annotated host of isolation human vs civet the meta-cats results page displays the significant residues differing between the specified groups figure 4c identifying 117 nucleotide positions in the entire sars-cov genome that significantly differed between the civet and human isolates these positions were scattered throughout the genome and had calculated p-values ranging from 433x10-12 to 002492 supplementary table 1 when this list was compared against the 26 nucleotide positions that differed between civet and human isolates reported in a previous study 8 all 26 of the previously identified positions were also found to be significant in this meta-cats analysisvipr has integrated the jmol protein structure viewer application to facilitate the exploration and visualization of 3d protein structures either for custom uploaded data or for protein data bank pdb structures from any taxa present in vipr the application has been enhanced to allow users to highlight active sites immune epitopes and ligands customize the appearance of the protein structure and quickly save an image or animated video of the structure in addition residues from the 3d protein structures for each pdb file are mapped to the homologous positions in the stored uniprot records to facilitate quick and accurate comparison between structural data and amino acid sequence datafor the current use case we decided to explore the sars-cov spike protein structure pdb id 2ghv in more detail since multiple residues were found to significantly differ between the civet and human isolates in the spike coding region two of these significant nucleotide positions 22942 and 22965 located in codons for amino acids 479 and 487 respectively were particularly interesting since they were found to lie within the receptor-binding motif of the sars-cov receptor-binding domain of the spike protein and had been reported to influence species-specific binding affinity for the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 45 the selected 3d structure includes most of the sars-cov receptor-binding domain of the spike protein which is located between residues 318-510 4647 secondary structures were displayed as ribbons and spike amino acid positions 479 and 487 were highlighted in blue to confirm that they are exposed on the exterior surface of the protein in a position accessible for host receptor binding figure 4d the workflow that was followed throughout the scientific use case confirms and extends results obtained through previous comparative genomics analyses and demonstrates the power of the vipr system specifically our phylogenetic tree corroborates the theory that there were at least two separate human outbreaks from viruses closely related to two separate clades isolated from civets during the time of the sars-cov epidemic our tree also shows a strong correlation between host and year of isolation although this observation is not true for all strains included in the tree the meta-cats analysis identified significant p-values for 117 nucleotide residues that were identified as having significant variation between the civet and human isolates the positions that are located within the sars-cov spike protein receptor-binding motif which were identified by meta-cats appear to reflect virus sequence variations that affect binding to host-specific receptor proteins additional wet-lab experimentation will be required to elucidate the specific function of the remaining significant sequence variations and whether they alter the fitness of the virus mapping residues and regions of interest onto a 3d protein structure can yield additional insight into their functional role the scientific use case that was explored here serves as an example of the ability of vipr to support data exploration and the generation of biologically relevant hypotheses that can then be subjected to more in-depth laboratory testing through experimentationthe virus pathogen database and analysis resource vipr httpwwwviprbrcorg supported by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid bioinformatics resource centers brc program is a freely-available website that provides an intuitive search interface to access data about human pathogenic virus families including coronaviridae obtained from public repositories custom algorithms and direct-submission these data are integrated with a suite of unique analytical and visualization tools for exploratory analysis the vipr resource provides researchers with an easy mechanism to not only perform complex analytical workflows but to save the results and share them with collaborators to expedite discovery through the generation of experimentally-testable hypotheses such experimental discoveries can then be translated from the bench to the bedside in the form of diagnostics prophylactics vaccines and treatments for viruses belonging to the coronaviridae family coronavirus disease covid-19 is a pandemic manifesting respiratory illness and first reported in wuhan hubei province of china in december 2019 the death toll rose to more than 68000 among 1250000 confirmed cases around the globe until april 4 2020 who world health organization 2020 the virus causing covid-19 is named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 based on the phylogenetic studies the sars-cov-2 is categorized as a member of the genus betacoronavirus the same lineage that includes sars coronavirus sars-cov gorbalenya 2020 that caused sars severe acute respiratory syndrome in china during 2002 ksiazek et al 2003 recent studies showed that sars-cov-2 has a close relationship with bat sars-like covs li et al 2005 zhou et al 2020 though the intermediate hosts for zoonotic transmission of sars-cov-2 from bats to humans remain undiscoveredsars-cov-2 has been identified as an enveloped single-stranded positive-sense rna virus with a genome size of approximately 299 kb encoding 27 proteins from 14 orfs including 15 non-structural 8 accessory and 4 major structural proteins two-thirds of the viral rna harbours the first orf orf1ab dedicated for translating polyprotein 1a pp1a and polyprotein 1ab pp1ab which later undergo proteolytic cleavage to form 15 non-structural proteins spike glycoprotein s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n are the four major structural proteins of sars-cov-2 wu et al 2020a wu et al 2020b interestingly s glycoprotein is characterized as the critical determinant for viral entry into host cells which consists of two functional subunits namely s1 and s2 the s1 subunit recognizes and binds to the host receptor through the receptor-binding domain rbd whereas s2 is responsible for fusion with the host cell membrane wrapp et al 2020 walls et al 2020 chen et al 2020 mers-cov uses dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp4 as entry receptor raj et al 2013 whereas sars-cov and sars-cov-2 utilize ace-2 angiotensin converting enzyme-2 li et al 2003 abundantly available in lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes suggesting s glycoprotein as a potential drug target to halt the entry of sars-cov-2 letko et al 2020according to recent reports neutralizing antibodies are generated in response to the entry and fusion of surface-exposed s protein mainly rbd domain which is predicted to be an important target for vaccine candidates chen et al 2020 hoffmann et al 2020 tian et al nd however sars-cov-2 has emerged with remarkable properties like glutamine-rich 42 aa long exclusive

giorgi 2020 lu et al nd there is growing evidence that spike protein a 1273 amino acid long glycoprotein having multiple domains possibly plays a major role in sars-cov-2 pathogenesis viral entry to

between virus-host membranes bosch et al 2003 liu et al 2004 insights into the sequence variations of s glycoprotein among available genomes are key to understanding the biology of sars-cov-2

 only one variant was found out of only one available sequence in the repository from sweden australia south korea and peru interestingly all sequences are unique among countries from the sequence reported except d614g which was found in the us and peru fig 5 moreover we have also analyzed sequences from brazil italy nepal pakistan spain taiwan and vietnam but there is no variation in the s glycoprotein sequence was found when compared to refseq yp009724390covid 19 is one of the most contagious pandemics the world has ever had with 1250000 confirmed cases to date april 4 2020 and the cases have increased as high as 5 times in less than a month who world health organization 2020 phylogenetic analysis showed that the sars-cov-2 is a unique coronavirus presumably related to bat coronavirus bm4831 hp-betacoronavirus during this study we investigated the available genomes of sars-cov-2 and found variations in 483 positions resulting in 130 synonymous and 228 non-synonymous variants out of them 25 non-synonymous variants were observed in the spike protein of sars-cov-2 viral spike protein is thought to have a crucial role in drug and vaccine development as reported previously in managing the viruses like sars-cov and mers-cov tian et al nd kapadia et al 2005 elshabrawy et al 2012 du et al 2013 likewise a number of studies targeting sars-cov-2 spike protein have been undertaken for the therapeutic measures xia et al 2020 but the unique structural and functional details of sars-cov-2 spike protein are still under scrutiny we also found a variant r408i at receptor binding domain rbd that mutated from positively charged arginine residue to neutral and smaller sized isoleucine residue fig 4 i this change might alter the interaction of viral rbd with the host receptor because the r408 residue of sars-cov-2 is known to interact with the ace2 receptor for viral entry ortega et al 2020 similarly alterations of rbd g476s v483a h519q and a520s also could affect the interaction of sars-cov-2 spike protein with other molecules which require further investigations qia98583 and qis30615 variants were found to have an alteration of alanine to valine a930v and aspartic acid to tyrosine d936y respectively in the alpha helix of the hr1 domain previous reports have indicated that hr1 domain plays a significant role in viral fusion and entry by forming helical bundles with hr2 and mutations including alanine substitution by valine a1168v in hr1 region are predominantly responsible for conferring resistance to mouse hepatitis coronaviruses against hr2 derived peptide entry inhibitors bosch et al 2008 this study hypothesizes the mutation a930v found in that of sars-cov-2 might also have a role in the emergence of drug-resistance virus strains also the mutation d1168h found in the heptad repeat 2 hr sars-cov-2 could play a vital role in viral pathogenesis moreover we found that 20 variants including one deletion out of 26 were located within s1 especially within ntd and rbd region of glycoprotein s fig 4a which region is responsible for the preliminary interaction with the host cell receptor ace2 this indicates that the ntd and rbd are very prone to mutations however the ntd and rbd portions harbour potential epitopes that might serve as potential peptide vaccine candidates against sars-cov-2 as reported in different studies bhattacharya et al 2020 rasheed et al 2020 rahman et al 2020 the reason behind choosing the sequences from s protein domain ntd and rbd is they are situated in the outer surface of the virus that could be more accessible for the immune system fig 3c so the variations reported herein within the outer domains of s glycoprotein could help to design effective epitope-based vaccines or antiviralsthe sars-cov-2 s protein contains additional furin protease cleavage site prrars in s1s2 domain which is conserved among all 320 sequences as revealed during this study supplementary fig 3 this unique signature is thought to make the sars-cov-2 more virulent than sars-cov and regarded as novel features of the viral pathogenesis walls et al 2020 according to previous reports the more the host cell protease can process the coronavirus s can accelerate viral tropism accordingly in influenza virus walls et al 2020 klenk and garten 1994 steinhauer 1999 millet and whittaker 2015 apart from that this could also promote viruses to escape antiviral therapies targeting transmembrane protease tmprss2 clinicaltrialsgov nct04321096 which is well reported protease to cleave at s1s2 of s glycoprotein fehr and perlman 2015 comparative analyses between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein showed 77 similarity between them where the most diverse region was the n-terminal domain and receptor binding domain the insertion of 17 additional amino acid residues in the n-terminal domain of sars-cov-2 and its high sequence diversity suggests that it may have a role in binding with other cell receptors in humans this is because the n-terminal domain could function as the receptor-binding domain of various coronaviruses receptor recognition mechanisms of coronaviruses a decade of structural studies 2020 yuan et al 2017 a similar phenomenon has been observed in mouse hepatitis coronavirus mhv and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus tgev where the n-terminal domain is reported to be attached with the host entry receptor williams et al 1991 delmas et al 1992the spatial distribution of variations in amino acid sequences of s glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 showed that 17 variations out of 26 found among the sequences deposited from the us but there are 7 unique variations found among sequences from 5 countries from 4 continents namely australia europe latin america and asia out of 6 sequences available during the study period fig 5 although the number of sequences analyzed herein is too small to speculate the exact trend of s glycoprotein evolution these variants might play a vital role in adaptation to a new geospatial environmentthe variation analyses in amino acids indicated the structural features of different domains of the sars-cov-2 spike proteins the variations have multiple effects on the structure resulting in change in stability favoring various interactions and conformational diversity an augmented infection kinetics and viral spreading may have association with the structural changes and composition of residues in the viral spike protein however to identify the actual role of involvement of s glycoprotein a larger dataset regarding genomics and proteomics of sars-cov-2 is required as this protein is vital to understand the viral pathogenicity evolution and development of therapeutics further analyses of all the s glycoprotein and sars-cov-2 genomes with different epidemiological aspects is warranted to get the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2syed mohammad lokman draft writing visualization formal analysis data

first decade of the 21st century during december 2019 numerous pneumonia incidences of unidentified cause appeared in wuhan hubei china with clinical presentations greatly resembling flu and viral pneumonia after virus isolation and analysis of viral genome sequence from infected patients samples a novel coronavirus named as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 or sars-cov-2 initially designated as novel coronavirus or ncov-2019 was identified from an unknown source sars-cov-2 is the causative agent of respiratory disease which is recently named as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by the world health organisation who human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 is a major concern for the health care workers and a preliminary r0 reproductive number as the number of new infection one infected person generates on average throughout its infectious period measure of 1425 was reported by the who httpswwwwhointhealth-topicscoronavirus since its appearance within a months time enormous number of new cases are piling up and the actual r0 value may be quite higher than previously calculated wu et al 2020 epidemiological data suggest that approximately as of february 29 2020 79251 people infected with this virus in mainland china and multiple cases also reported from other parts of the world httpswhosprinklrcomhttpswwwmedpagetodaycominfectiousdiseasepublichealth84698 so far 60 other countries reported sars-cov-2 infection although most of the cases are migrants of china indicating a single introduction of this virus among the other countries south korea 3150 cases italy 889 cases japan 234 cases iran 388 cases singapore 96 cases hongkong 94 cases and usa 64 cases reported significant number of cases and the situation is getting complicated with time current findings indicate that various subtypes of coronaviruses are in circulation within the bat population including other species such as birds cats dogs pigs mice horses whales before they acquire the ability to cross the species barriers to cause human infection it is still unanswered that how sars-cov-2 has caused an outbreak in wuhan the initial wave of infection found associated with the seafood market of wuhan strengthening the hypothesis that close contact between the live or dead animal with an individual may be responsible for the initiation of the outbreak in the recent past there are examples of zoonotic transmission of bird flu which directly jumped from avian species to human but no transmission between the humans were established which kept the disease under control however the ability to spread among human to human upon close contact makes sars-cov-2 as a very important contagious agent to study and monitor whose devastation has already been established in wuhan hubei chinacovid-19 is one of the most alarming diseases in the globe at this moment the number of patients infected with sars-cov-2 is increasing in almost steady rate although in some days less number of cases was reported total number of cases reached to 20000 in first 12 days 40000 in next 7 days and more than 80000 in just 33 days infections are causing varied clinical manifestation from mild symptoms to severe respiratory attacks although there is possibility of asymptomatic infection it has spread in many other countries beyond china therefore proper handling and management of the disease is critically important to prevent a pandemichistory has taught several lessons regarding the endemic nature of emerging viral infections virus faces major challenges from pre-existing immunity to remain in the population other important factors such as case fatality rate cfr r0 and the reservoir hosts are crucial in influencing viral endemicity by analysing cfr of different rna viruses and their longevity in circulation throughout the globe it was found that viruses with higher cfr cfr 5 die out after few passages of infections sooner or later whereas viruses with low cfr remain endemic with a seasonal outbreak like common flu caused by influenza viruses figure 1 although it is very difficult to calculate actual cfr until the outbreak ends an initial estimate suggests that cfr for sars-cov-2 is 258 much closer to seasonal flu than the other coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov of the recent past ie 10 and 35 respectively httpswwwwhointemergenciesmers-coven indicating the ability of the sars-cov-2 to remain in circulation with low cfr throughout the world as per the recent data covid-19 has already claimed 2924 lives mainly in china although few deaths reported from other parts of the world however as of february 29 2020 39556 infected individuals already recovered from sars-cov2 infection who will eventually acquire immunity to the virus httpswwwmedpagetodaycominfectiousdiseasepublichealth84698 the covid-19 recovered population increases day by day with herd immunity of the population a virus may re-infect a person with pre-existing immunity either in its present form which is very unlikely or with acquired mutations to persist in the circulation sars-cov-2 recovered populations may enable the selection of mutant viruses and their spread in the communityin this review we will discuss the critical factors influencing the continued viral appearance and periodical infection we will also discuss the novelty of this virus and its potential threat to cause periodic infection we have collected data from different studies and also analysed the genome sequence to define the evolutionary relationship of this virus moreover we have predicted the reason for the severity of this disease with literature supportcoronaviruses are enveloped and belongs to the family coronaviridae which is further subdivided into four genera alpha beta gamma and delta coronaviruses woo et al 2007 lefkowitz et al 2018 they possess a long positive-sense single-stranded rna genome ranging between 264 kb to 317 kb which is largest for any rna virus big rna genome of coronavirus provides additional flexible power in host adaptation and genome modification the genome organisation is overall same in all coronaviruses figure 2 two short untranslated regions utr are present at the 5 and 3 end of the genome and the coding genes are present in between the utr the arrangement of the coding gene is 5-replicase orf1ab spike s envelope e membrane m nucleocapsid n3 however variable numbers of additional orfs are present in between spike and nucleocapsid genes in different strains of coronaviruses the transcription regulatory motif trs is present at the 3 end of the genome which plays an important role in rna replication and recombination lai et al 1985the complete genome size of the sars-cov-2 is approximately 29 kb 29825 nt-29903ntthe orf1ab gene is the largest gene segment of the coronavirus and it constitutes two orf ie orf1a and orf1b the position of the orf1ab gene in sars-cov-2 251-21541 nt slightly changes to starting codon position as compared to sars-cov 265-21486 nt and mers-cov 279-21514 generally a slippery sequence uuuaaac followed by a putative pseudoknot structure sequence is present in between the orfs the replicase orf1ab is cleaved by papain-like protease plpro and 3 c-like protease 3clpro the orf1ab gene of the coronavirus genome encodes1516 non-structural proteins nsp at the consensus cleavage site the nsp 12 and nsp 13 encode the rna-dependent rna polymerase and helicase protein respectively the newly emerging sars-cov-2 possesses a single point mutation at a slippery sequence a haemagglutinin esterase he gene is present downstream to orf1ab and upstream to the s gene which is absent in coronaviruses infecting humansthree surface glycoproteins are found in all classes of coronaviruses ie spike s envelope e and membrane m the s proteins are type i membrane glycoproteins responsible for the formation of spikes present on the surface of coronaviruses the s proteins are cleaved into the receptor binding s1 domain and cell membrane fusion s2 domains the sars-cov-2 s2 domain represents higher identity with bat derived coronavirus strains than the s1 domain therefore the receptor-binding domain of sars-cov-2 is more similar to that of sars-cov 2002-03 and it has found that it uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as cellular receptor lu et al 2020 however some key amino acid substitution at positions 439 501 493 485 and 486 were observed in the sars-cov-2 receptor-binding domain those were thought to be important in sars-cov lu et al 2020 the e and m genes are conserved among all the coronaviruses these two genes encode two small transmembrane proteins associated with the envelope of all coronavirusesthe coronavirus nucleocapsid n protein is a virion structural protein the n protein interacts with the viral genomic rna and helps in packaging of rna genome into virus particles by recognising a specific sequence the n protein-dependent assembly of the viral rna packaging signal is already established in sars-cov intracellular co-localization of n with replicase components is required for rna synthesis variable numbers of small orfs are present between the various conserved genes downstream to the n gene the 3a protein of sars-cov modulates virus release by forming a transmembrane homotetramer complex within channel protein other than the virus release the 3a protein helps in sars-cov-induced cell death golgi fragmentation and the accumulation of intracellular vesicles like the sars-cov and mers-cov the sars-cov-2 virus possesses several other small orfs orf9 orf13 orf14 orf10 at the downstream to n gene marra et al 2003 the function of the n gene and small orfs of sars-cov-2 is not yet knownbefore the emergence of sars-cov in 2002 construction of phylogenetic tree for coronaviruses based on the pol or n gene was a standard practice using this method initially sars-cov was proposed as a member of gammacoronavirus marra et al 2003 rota et al 2003 however further analysis of the amino-terminal domain of the spike protein of the sars-cov revealed that 19 out of the 20 cysteine residues was spatially conserved within the betacoronavirus group rota et al 2003 on the other hand only five residues were found conserved within the alphacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus group rota et al 2003 furthermore the subsequent whole genome-based phylogenetic analysis concluded that sars-cov is a member of the betacoronavirus lineage phylogenetic analysis based on rdrp gene of sars-cov-2 revealed that it belongs to the genus betacoronavirus eickmann 2003we have constructed a phylogenetic tree of the sars-cov-2 based on available sequences in genbank and gisaid data bank figure 3 phylogenetic analysis based on the spike gene of the sars-cov-2 represents that it belongs to the genus betacoronaviruses from the analysis of the sequences published since the emergence of sars-cov-2 it is evident that this virus is stably spreading without any noticeable mutation as they are clustered in a single group analysis from the phylogenetic tree represents that all the sars-cov-2 strains are distinctly separated from previously reported coronavirus endemic strains sars-cov and mers-cov hence the sars-cov-2 is termed as novel coronavirus analysis performed in our study also revealed that this virus is very similar to the bat derived coronavirus strain the sars-cov-2 and bat derived yunnanratg132013 coronavirus strain derived from common ancestor although they differs in in the size of the spike genes spike gene size in ratg133809 bp sars-cov-23822bp since sars-cov and mers-cov also derived from the bat bat originated human infecting coronavirus strain is not a novel event as shown in earlier studies that sars-cov and mers-cov used civets and camel respectively as an intermediate host to gain infection potentiality towards human guan et al 2003 alagaili et al 2014 it may be predicted that in case of sars-cov-2 transmission there may be one or more intermediate host present in between bats and humanprevious cases of human coronavirus infection commenced by sars-cov and mers-cov was accountable for severe pneumonia leading to high mortality the mechanistic explanation of their high morbidity and mortality is inadequately explained rapid virus replication reaching to high titres and associated enhanced inflammation is believed to be a cause of disease severity initial data from china shows that the sars-cov-2 produced observable symptoms primarily ards acute respiratory distress syndrome in elderly populations similar to human cases of h7n9 infection in china table 1 an earlier study with h7n9 infection also found the clinical exhibition of disease with high fever and rapidly progressive pneumonia that did not respond to antibiotics chen et al 2013 a recent study on sars-cov-2 infection showed that all the 41 patients had pneumonia and manifestations of a critical respiratory ailment similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus and was associated with icu admission and high mortality huang et al 2020it is known that coronaviruses such as human sars-cov and bat sars-like cov sl-covzxc21 utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as their receptor and recent reports suggest that sars-cov-2 also uses the identical receptor for entry into the host cell zhou et al 2020 ace2 is an essential enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system ras that plays a significant role in regulating blood pressure and maintaining electrolyte and fluid homeostasis ace2 also protects an individual against severe acute lung damage that can be triggered by sepsis acid aspiration severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and the lethal avian influenza a h5n1 and h7n9 virus infection kuba et al 2005 yang et al 2014 zou et al 2014 moreover recent studies have shown that ace2 negatively regulates inflammatory responses during bacterial or viral infections yang et al 2014 sodhi et al 2019 sars-cov-2 infection utilizes ace2 for viral attachment and subsequent entry into cytosol therefore rapid replication of sars-cov-2 may reduce the surface expression of ace2 in the lung tissue which may cause further intensification of the inflammation and severity of the disease pathology glowacka et al 2010 figure 4 a recent study have found that smoking is associated with higher expression of ace2 when compared with the non-smokers which may be one of the reasons of some population for the vulnerability towards novel sars-cov-2 infection liu et al 2017 cai 2020the pathophysiology of disease outcome depends on the extent of inflammatory responses within the host in absence of any specific antiviral drugs the primary therapeutic strategy to treat sars-cov-2 infection should be managing the inflammatory responses with anti-inflammatory drugs such as corticosteroids previous studies on sars patients have found a positive outcome when treated with corticosteroids chen et al 2006 who recommendations for managing this novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 infection discourage the application of corticosteroids the explanation for not using corticosteroids could be delayed viral clearance from the respiratory tract or blood with other corticosteroid-induced complications in the treated patients previously infected with sars and mers lee et al 2004 arabi et al 2018 russel et al 2020 during the pandemic in 2009 of influenza a infection a prospective cohort study showed reduced mortality in patients with h1n1 pdm09 viral pneumonia when treated with mild doses of corticosteroid li et al 2017 therefore these disparities in findings suggest that randomized controlled trials must be carried out to conclude the beneficial effect of corticosteroid medication in coronavirus-induced inflammation associated difficulties however doctors from the chinese thoracic society have recommended the application of corticosteroids to critically ill patients with sars-cov-2 pneumonia with a low to moderate dose 051 mgkg per day methylprednisolone or equivalent for short term 7 days zhao et al 2020viruses face potent challenges from the host pre-existing immunity before they establish periodical infection the role of pre-existing immunity broadly studied for influenza virus infection biswas et al 2020 host immunity also allows the selection of mutant viruses to cause a new round of infection within the host with pre-existing immunity towards the earlier strains if the sars-cov-2 can withstand the new mutations and remains flexible to infect its host towards disease progression it will persist in circulation the primary wave of sars-cov-2 infection is under progress at present the majority of the exposed population will acquire some immunity eventually and the real hurdles for the viruses to defeat or bypass existing immunity will reflect with the acquired mutations within the virus in future to defeat host immunity viruses must mutate without losing their infectivity so far there are no published data regarding infection ability of sars-cov-2 and their mutation potential under robust immunological selection pressure within the host previous data from sars-cov and mers-cov infected individuals indicated that antibody response tends to be short-lived but remain longer depending on the severity of the infection t cell responses often target highly conserved internal proteins and are long-lived channappanavar et al 2014 alshukairi et al 2016 sars-cov-specific memory t cells but not memory b cells or antibody could be detected six years after infection in sars survivors tang et al 2011 in conclusion these studies present some ideas regarding selection pressure from the host immunity ie milder coronavirus infection may produce a short-lived humoral immune response as of february 29 2020 sars-cov-2 infected 85406 people and the infection turns into fatality for more than 2924 cases however as per the available data 39561 individual got recovered after infection percent recovery from this population indicates that  93 of the population already recovered from sars-cov2 infection this percentage was calculated as below within infected population total no recoveredtotal no of recovered  total no of death it can be predicted that at least 93 of the total population which may likely to go higher with the end of this outbreak will develop immunity towards this novel virus so far there is no vaccine available although in future vaccinated individual will also acquire some immunity the possibility of the future outbreak by sars-cov-2 will depend on the longevity of host immunity and bypassing of existing or pre-existing immunity by the mutant virus figure 5the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases critically depend on reservoir hosts which can sustain the pathogen with a moderate or asymptomatic infection in the population even in the presence of resistance from primary hosts coronaviruses are found widely within bat pig cow and several other species previous reports also suggest that this virus is also presents in birds molecular phylogenetic analysis performed in this study showed that neighbouring virus to sars-cov-2 was from bats with 96 similarity suggesting novelty of sars-cov-2 we dont know how this virus mutated and its time frame however recent estimates with bedfords analysis predicted that sars-cov-2 and ratg13 derived from a common ancestor sometimes between 25 and 65 years ago httpswwwsciencemagorgnews202001mining-coronavirus-genomes-clues-outbreak-s-origins these observations are indicative of the existence of intermediate host or reservoir before the sars-cov-2 gained entry into the human population figure 4 it is utmost important to find out its intermediate host to control the ongoing and future outbreakbased on the gene bank data apart from the lung and oropharyngeal fluid this virus also isolated from faces and blood this observation represents that sars-cov-2 transmitted through droplet and human to human might be through the orofecal route but immune-pathogenesis of this novel virus is probably different from the previous endemic strain of coronaviruses the faecal oral route is very common in birds for transmission of avian viruses migratory birds play a very important role in the dissemination of avian influenza viruses from different parts of the globe during seasonal migrations bailey et al 2018 coronaviruses such as human sars-cov and bat sars-like cov sl-covzxc21 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as their receptor and recent reports suggest that sars-cov-2 also uses the same receptor for entry into the host cell we have compared the ace2 gene from avian species and the data suggest conservation of amino acids of ace2 protein within most of the birds data not shown we examined the interacting residues of the receptor-binding domain rbd of the spike protein of sars-cov-2 with critical residues of ace2 from different species from human poultry gallus gallus mallard anasplatyrhynchos swan goose ansercygnoidesdomesticus shelduck tadornacana and we found limited amino acids conservation in comparison to human counterpart table 2 moreover there is no experimental proof for betacoronavirus like sars-cov and sars-cov-2 infection in the birds although a recent study has shown the significant presence of alpha and gammacoronaviruses in ducks shorebirds and herons in australia chamings et al 2018 these observations allow us to believe that the birds are less prone to betacoronavirus infection or the least chance of bird infection from betacoronaviruses significantly the bird poses alpha and gammacoronaviruses that are incompetent to infect a human hence the risks of spread of the sars-cov-2 through bird to human are very unlikely at its present form qinghai lake in china is one of the biggest breeding sites for different migratory bird species there may be a possibility that this novel virus may acquire the ability to infect other animals including the migratory birds therefore it is extremely important to find out the reservoir of this novel coronavirus within the other animals including the migratory birds if there are any figure 6one of the most worrying things about any outbreak is the spreading of viruses from mild or asymptomatic individuals which is probably happening in case of sars-cov-2 infection if this trend continues then the virus may establish itself in the population and quarantine will be very difficult to stop the virus spread phylogenetic analysis based on the spike gene nucleotide sequence performed in this study has shown that all the sars-cov-2 sequences are forming a single cluster without any branching indicating sars-cov-2 conservation throughout this ongoing outbreak earlier studies have shown that spike protein was a target of a robust humoral immune response in case of sars or mers viral infection these findings advocate that virus that caused the initial outbreak of sars-cov-2 is still in circulation without any major changes very little or absence of pre-existing immunity in the community or selection pressure within the population probably allowed sars-cov-2 to remain in circulation in its original form moreover sars-cov-2 has very limited cfr as opposed to sars-cov and mers-cov without killing its host table 1 will able to produce new virus particles alongside some mutations till now most of the deaths have occurred in the elderly population due to novel coronavirus infection whereas children and young adults exhibit relatively milder disease therefore sars-cov-2 infection will enable the host to develop humoral and cell-mediated immunity and simultaneously the immune selected viruses may acquire mutations with higher infection potential or altered antigenicity this will likely empower them to evade pre-existing immunity towards their predecessor counterpart in the host during the subsequent waves of infection as depicted in figure 1 current estimates based on the available information suggest that more than 93 individual have recovered from this novel coronavirus infections the virus may adapt itself to produce infection within the recovered population in future to sustain its presence in the environment the ability of the virus to cause infection in the host with pre-existing immunity will be the most important criteria to establish itself in the circulation the recovered population may keep under monitor to find if any reinfection leads to the creation of any mutant strain due to the selection pressure therefore we must prepare ourselves for mutant strains of this novel virus to avoid future devastationsince there is no antiviral and vaccine to fight against sars cov-2 a vaccine or therapeutics is a primary need at this moment currently several companies have started preparing vaccines for this novel virus although efficacy will depend on the selection of antigen and the viruss ability to bypass the vaccine-induced immunity we must look at the conservation among different epitopes in immune selected strains while choosing the right vaccine candidates structurally spike protein carries rbd like haemagglutinin ha of the influenza virus with a similar function we must look at the amino acid conservation in different domain of the spike protein mutation in the immune dominance region of the vaccine candidate will make them ineffective for future outbreaks recently physicians from china are urging recovered patients to donate plasma which may be useful to protect covid-19 something like a 100 years old practice during 1918 flu in case of pandemic 1918 influenza infection three waves of infection killed more than 50 million worldwide in two years where the second wave was the most devastating the first wave of the 1918 flu pandemic flu had resembled common flu epidemics people most at risk were the weak and elderly while younger healthier people recovered easily apparently resembling covid-19 in its present form most of the studies have found an analogy between covid-19 and influenza disease pathophysiology time will tell us whether sars-cov-2 and associated covid-19 will be established as the new flu of 21st centuryonly covs from bats were included in this study we used gene sequences that tang et al obtained from 10 bat species

then stored at 4c the complete mitochondrial cyt b gene 1140 bp was amplified and sequenced these sequences have been submitted to genbank and accession numbers are shown in the tablefor virus phylogeny studies sequences from a 440-bp fragment of the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene which is highly conserved among different covs were obtained and analyzed 10 multiple alignments of the 440-bp rdrp partial sequence of bat covs were conducted in clustalx version 181 23 bayesian analyses were conducted with mrbayes version 312 24 neighbor-joining analyses with the jukes-cantor model were used to validate the bayesian result in mega3 25 a total of 67 unique cov sequences figure 1 were analyzed with mrbayes version 312 in the generalized time reversible model of evolution as determined by the akaike information criterion in modeltest version 37 26 four consecutive metropolis-coupled markov chain monte carlo computations were run for 2 million generations with trees sampled every 100 generations initial trees were random on the basis of stabilization of preliminary runs the first 3000 trees were discarded before generation of the consensus tree the bayesian consensus tree was rooted to breda virus ay427798 a related cov figure 1for bat phylogeny we used the complete mitochondrial cyt b gene to construct maximum likelihood ml and bayesian phylograms the

swapping followed by 100 bootstrap iterations for robustness of the ml tree bayesian analysis was also used to construct a tree with 4 simultaneous markov chains for 1 million generations trees were sampled every 20 generations and the first 5000 trees were discarded before the consensus tree was made on the basis of practical values of stabilizing likelihoodwe compared the genetic diversity of covs isolated from rhinolophids and vespertilionids and the corresponding diversity among bat taxa by using the index of nucleotide diversity  described by nei 28 in arlequin version 31 29 analyses were performed on uncorrected pairwise genetic distances between sequencesby combining information derived from the phylogram of bat covs together with data on the geographic origin of viruses we were able to describe the phylogeographic distributions for known covs from bats in china figures 1 2 table bat sars-like covs formed a monophyletic clade species-specific host restriction was found for covs in 4 of 7 bats species myotis ricketti m magnater p abramus and t pachypus sampled from 1 geographic location and these clustered with high bayesian posterior probability overall phylogenetic relationships between virus lineages were similar across our analyses and well-supported genetic structure was observed within some cov lineages for example covs isolated from m magnater were monophyletic but formed 3 well-supported clades with no evidence of geographic structure bayesian posterior probability pp  10 for each a similar pattern was apparent in covs from myotis ricketti which formed 2 geographically overlapping independent clades pp  099 and 10 respectively one t pachypus was infected by a virus that clustered with moderate statistical support pp  091 within the larger clade associated with p abramus which indicated a potential interspecies transmission event or recent evolutionary host shift defined as interspecies transmission followed by establishment and long-term persistence in the new host species 18 figure 1phylograms of host sequences were also constructed and were essentially of the same topology with high support whether derived by using mrbayes version 312 or mega3 data not shown when we mapped host phylogram to virus virus phylogeny did not always track host phylogeny figure 3 when separate host-virus phylograms were constructed for the 2 bat families verspertilionidae and rhinolophidae different corresponding relationships were evident verspertilionids and their covs showed phylogenetic congruence and rhinolophids and their covs showed incongruous phylogenies figure 4we found evidence for evolutionarily divergent relationships for some vespertilionid viruses and their hosts when analyzed at the family scale figure 4 panel a for example divergence between viruses harbored by p pipistrellus and p abramus is congruent with their hosts the divergence among other viruses was incongruent with divergence of host species eg those from s kuhlii and myotis rickettirhinolophid bats and their viruses were analyzed at a different taxonomic scale within genus in this co-phylogeny viral host shifts were the evident virus-host feature figure 4 panel b except for r macrotis all rhinolophidae bats had 2 distinct lineages of covs and host shifts were found among viruses carried by r ferrumequinum r pearsoni and r sinicusgenetic diversity of covs harbored by rhinolophids and vespertilionids was similar vespertilionids   027  013 rhinolophids   025  013 in contrast genetic diversity of cyt b sequences from bats was much higher among the vespertilonids   017  0007 than among the rhinolophids   009  0006covs sequenced from different bats of the same species clustered together even when bats were collected in locations 10002000 km apart this pattern was found for covs from p abramus t pachypus myotis ricketti and m magnater bats of the genus miniopterus are known to migrate long distances 30 which explains why the phylogeny of viruses isolated from m magnater sampled in distant places guangxi anhui fujian and hong kong lacks geographic structure in nonmigrating species such as bats of the genera pipistrellus and tylonycteris intimate physical contact of bats in same cave or the same bamboo roost site as well as periodic exchange of bats among neighboring colonies may facilitate virus transmission among populationsdespite the co-roosting of many bats species we found little evidence of host shifts for some viruses for example covs from m magnater and myotis ricketti sampled in the same cave in guangxi were divergent although sample size was limited although myotis ricketti has a closer phylogenetic relationship with t pachypus p pipistrellus and p abramus than with m magnater and s kuhlii its behavior and habits are closer to those of the last group for example myotis ricketti and s kuhlii bats roosts in caves although s kuhlii also roosts under palm leaves whereas t pachypus roosts inside bamboo and p abramus roosts almost entirely in old buildings thus it seems plausible that the close phylogenetic relationship between viruses harbored by myotis ricketti and s kuhlii reflects the similar behavior and ecology of their hoststhe phylogenetic and phylogeographic associations we found suggest that there may be a coevolutionary relationship between some bat covs and their hosts for example sister taxa within the genus pipistrellus independently maintained 2 distinct viruses that share a most recent common ancestor a similar relationship was apparent among the viruses of some closely related genera eg pipistrellus and tylonycteris whereby divergence of each genus was mirrored by divergence in viral phylogeny however viruses are usually thought to have evolved more recently than their hosts 31 thus apparent coevolutionary patterns may reflect either a high frequency of host shift among closely related bat species or simultaneous lineage splitting of hosts and viruses host shifts among related bats might be favored by a variety of mechanisms including preadaptation to overcome immune defenses or greater rates of interspecific contact relative to distantly related bat species phylograms with better resolution would enable statistical comparison of phylogenetic congruence and estimation of divergence timesin the vespertilionids close phylogenetic concordance between host and virus suggests a close possibly evolutionarily divergent relationship however there are different scales of comparison between the vespertillionidae in which all but 1 cov came from separate genera and the rhinolophidae in which we examined a co-phylogeny of multiple species within 1 genus genetic diversity in the vespertilionids sampled was nearly double that of the rhinolophids which was probably due to the greater number of species sampled and their broader taxonomic range despite this greater genetic diversity among vespertilionid bat hosts the genetic diversity of covs did not differ between vespertilionids and rhinopholids this diversity suggests that vespertilionids may maintain undiscovered covs or that rhinolophids might harbor disproportionate cov diversity relative to diversity of their genus we propose that future work may identify more vespertilionid bat covs which would enable an accurate comparison of propensity for host shifts within this groupin the rhinolophids the host phylogram demonstrated genetic divergence between r ferrumequinum and other species as shown by the division of rhinolophus bats into 2 groups each of these groups harbors covs from 2 clusters sars-like covs and other covs which suggests multiple introductions of covs into these specieslack of concordance between phylogenies of rhinolophid bats and their covs can be interpreted as evidence for host shifts between bats of the genus rhinolophus different species of rhinolophus are often observed roosting inside the same cave which facilitates virus transmission between species however the degree of host shifting of rhinolophid bat covs may not be particularly high relative to other genera of bats this observation will be clarified when a greater diversity of covs from other bat genera is reported and the sequences are analyzed these requirements support the need for further research on bat viruses 3233host-shifting within the genus rhinolophus would likely be promoted if these bats shed covs in a way that makes them more available to other rhinolophus spp had behavioral traits that lead to increased contact with other rhinolophus spp or if covs harbored by these bats have structural biologic or other traits that make them more readily transmitted to other rhinolophus spp two lines of evidence suggest that host traits are the most parsimonious explanation for host shifts within the genus rhinolophus first sars-like covs and other rhinolophid covs rfv1 and rpv1 show evidence of interspecies transmission second covs from other bat groups that are phylogenetically much closer to rfv1 and rpv1 than to the sars-like covs do not show evidence of successful host shifts thus the ability to jump hosts is unlikely to be a strictly viral traitthe phylogeography of bat covs suggests that the bat sars-like covs form a monophyletic clade that is both phylogenetically distinct from other bat covs and geographically isolated although we acknowledge that this interpretation may be limited by sample size it may also indicate that rhinolophid bats the hosts of a cluster of sars-like covs within which human and civet sars cov nestle phylogenetically 67 are more likely to foster the host shifts of covs than are other bat species the potential for close contact between bats civets and humans in the wildlife trade in southern china coupled with a possible propensity of these bats to foster cov host-shifts could explain sars-like covs as the source of sars-cov this potential supports molecular results on bat covs that suggest a recent host shift from bats to civets or other animals and humans 34 such host shifts may indicate a risk posed by other bat covs for novel disease emergence finally the ability of sars-like covs to be transmitted between and establish in new species ie to undergo host shifts is consistent with other covs this has been shown for several covs of livestock species 35 and has been used to support their inclusion as 1 of the groups of viruses most likely to be responsible for emerging zoonoses even before the emergence of sars 36the total diversity of covs including sars-like covs in bats has likely not been fully described the genus rhinolophus 8 contains 77 bat species distributed in asia europe and africa the recent discoveries of bat covs in the united states 37 and sars-covs in african bats 38 support the hypothesis that covs are diverse and widespread in bat species given the diversity of covs in this group and their propensity for host shifts further viral discovery in rhinolophids may assist in understanding and ultimately controlling the emergence of zoonotic viruses bats are increasingly recognized as reservoirs of many highly lethal zoonotic agents 32 understanding their diversity behavior and mechanisms of virus transmission may play a key role in preventing future outbreaks of both known and unknown zoonotic diseases of bat origincoronaviruses covs are enveloped positivesensed singlestranded rna viruses belonging to the coronaviridae family
1
 they have been categorized based on antigenic properties and phylogenetic analyses in three main groups
2
 a alphacovs mainly responsible for gastrointestinal disorders b betacovs that include i bat coronavirus ii the human severe acute respiratory syndrome sars virus iii the middle eastern respiratory syndrome mers virus c gammacovs that mainly infect avian species some variants of covs are associated with outbreaks some others are continuously circulating and cause mostly mild respiratory infections eg the common cold the most well known of these covs is the sarscov which between 2002 and 2003 was responsible to cause an outbreak that spread around the world and resulted in over 8000 cases and 774 deaths with a case fatality rate of around 9 to 11
3
 in 2012 a novel cov merscov causing severe respiratory symptoms was identified
4
 very recently in december 2019 a novel betacov was responsible of a new illness first detected in wuhan china
5
 we now know this to be another outbreak of cov in humans the 7th that was recently renamed as sarscov2 the origin of the virus is still unclear however genomic analysis suggests ncov is most closely related to viruses previously identified in bats
6

in the first week of march 2020 over 98192 confirmed cases and 3380 deaths have been reported globally
7
 the case counts are dramatically rising in part due to increased surveillance and testing while the outbreak seems to be centered in wuhan which is now under quarantine the virus has spread throughout china and abroad including western and southeastern pacific regions european regions eastern mediterranean regions as well as many states in the united states of america
8
 it comes amid signs of the viruss shift away from its origins in china with italy iran and south korea emerging as the other countries hit hardest by the deadly disease italy is the worst affected country in europe with more than 4636 cases a rise of 778 in a day and a death toll of 197 an increase of 49
9
 nevertheless there is still limited information about the genomic epidemiology of the sarscov2 circulating in italy from genomic surveillance studies that impairs our understanding of the virus introduction establishment and dissemination in the country thus to better understand the emergence of the recent sarscov2 epidemic in italy we analyzed a larger and updated dataset of recently released data of the covid2019 epidemic to improve more effective intervention strategiesthe dataset comprised n  141 complete genomes sequences from the current 20192020 sarscov2 epidemic retrieved from gisaid httpswwwgisaidorg database the alignment was performed using mafft online program
10
 the complete dataset was assessed for the presence of phylogenetic signal by applying the likelihood mapping analysis implemented in the iqtree 168 software httpwwwiqtreeorg
11
 a maximum likelihood ml phylogeny was reconstructed using iqtree 168 software under the general timereversible nucleotide substitution model with a proportion of invariant sites gtri which was inferred in jmodeltest httpsgithubcomddarribajmodeltest2 as the best fitting model
12

to better understand the establishment and transmission of the novel sarscov2 in italy the recent italian genomes available on the gisaid database were added to a dataset of 138 sarscov2 genomes from the global epidemic an ml phylogenetic tree figure 1 was built to explore the recent italian genomes relationship with previous worldwide isolates ml phylogenies suggested that the three italian strains grouped into two different wellsupported phylogenetic clades bootstrap score bs 080 099 respectively we found that two isolates from italy epiisl410546 a chinese tourist from hubei province and epiisl412974 the first italian case isolate in rome italy fall within a clade bs  94 figure 1a clade 1 including sequences from several countries as china japan singapore england australia and canada however it is important to note that sequences from china are positioned basally to this first clade reinforcing the idea that the first introduction event could be mediated as suspected by chinawe also identified that one italian strain epiisl412973 from the province of lombardy isolated in february 2020 grouped separately into a second clade figure 1b clade 2 including isolates from germany finland switzerland and mexico phylogenetic analyses further suggest that the cov epidemic might have been reintroduce to the country via germany since the basal sequence of this clade is a case that emerged in munich in germany in january 2020 highlighting a complex dynamic of transmission and a tight connection within european countriesin this study we investigate the transmission path of the novel sarscov2 in italy our results indicate that the sarscov2 circulation in italy likely started from different multiple introductions from china and germany figure 1 clades 1 and 2 suggesting a possible european linkage followed by autochthonous transmission within italy moreover more genomic data will be fundamental to shed light on the epidemiological dynamics of the virus in the country helping to understand how the virus is spreading both around the world and thought time more genomic surveillance efforts during epidemics should be undertaken to provide enough data to make reliable inferences on the molecular epidemiology of the rapidly evolving virus phylogenetic inference robustness will be improved if other genomic sequences will be available to build an even more informative dataset despite the low heterogeneity of the sequenced strains consequently this analysis has to be considered as the first preliminary report regarding the sarscov2 epidemic in italy that highlights two independent introductions probably mediated by china and germany respectively this could reinforce the tight connection within samples that have been isolated all over europe indicating that the virus is spreading quite widely in europe suggesting that it could be likely spreading in the general populationin conclusion our study shows that genomic data generated in realtime can be employed to assist public health in monitoring and understanding the outbreak of novel emerging viral

 pathogensa new virus-associated disease coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 was initially reported in china on 30th december 2019 wu et al 2020 the causative agent of covid-19 is the novel human coronavirus sars-cov-2 wu et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 and as of 24th march 2020 there have been 372757 confirmed infections and 16231 deaths reported worldwide world health organization 2020 in china the covid-19 epidemic grew exponentially during january 2020 peaking on 12th february 2020 with 15153 newly confirmed cases per day one month later reported covid-19 cases in china dropped to 20 per day indicating the epidemic there was contained however the number of cases reported outside of china has risen exponentially since the second half of february 2020 by 11th march 2020 the day that the world health organization who announced covid-19 to be a new pandemic 37371 cases had been reported outside of china world health organization 2020guangdong province and the pearl river delta metropolitan region contain some of the worlds largest and most densely populated urban areas guangdong is the most populous province of china 113 m people and contains many large cities including guangzhou 12 m shenzhen 10 m dongguan 8 m and foshan 7 m the province has strong transportation links to hubei province where the first cases of covid-19 were reported the wuhan-guangzhou high-speed railway has been estimated to transfer 0102 million passengers per day during the spring festival period which started on 10th january 2020 by 19th march 2020 guangdong had 1388 confirmed cases of covid-19 the highest in china outside of hubei provinceunderstanding the evolution and transmission patterns of a virus after it enters a new population is crucial for designing effective strategies for disease control and prevention faria et al 2018 grubaugh et al 2017 ladner et al 2019 in this study we combine genetic and epidemiological data to investigate the genetic diversity evolution and epidemiology of sars-cov-2 in guangdong province we generated virus genome sequences from 53 patients in guangdong using both metagenomic sequencing and multiplex pcr amplification followed by nanopore sequencing through phylogenetic analysis interpreted in the context of available epidemiological information we sought to investigate the timing and relative contributions of imported cases versus local transmission the nature of genetically distinct transmission chains within guangdong and how the emergency response in guangdong was reflected in the reduction and elimination of these transmission chains our results may provide valuable information for implementing and interpreting genomic surveillance of covid-19 in other regionsenhanced surveillance was launched in all clinics in guangdong province following the first reports of patients with undiagnosed pneumonia on 30th december 2019 initially screening and sampling for sars-cov-2 was targeted toward patients with fever and respiratory symptoms and those who had a history of travel in the 14 days before the date of symptom onset the first detected case in guangdong had symptom onset on 1st january and was reported on 19th january 2020 kang et al 2020 covid-19 cases in guangdong grew until early february 2020 peaking at 100 cases per day and declined thereafter figure 1
a after 22nd february 2020 the daily number of locally infected reported cases in guangdong did not exceed one however since the beginning of march 2020 covid-19 cases imported into guangdong from abroad have been detected with increasing frequency as of 26th march 2020 a total of 102 imported cases were reported from 19 different countries figure 1a highlighting the risk that local covid-19 transmission could reignite in chinadifferent surveillance strategies were applied during the epidemic in guangdong figure 1a star methods more intensive surveillance was initiated on 30th january 2020 in response to the spring festival period which results in greater mobility among regions and provinces in china kraemer et al 2020 tian et al 2020 and because asymptomatic covid-19 cases had been reported guan et al 2020 this included monitoring 1 all travelers returning from hubei or other regions with high epidemic activity 2 their close contacts and 3 all hospitalized patients in clinics including those without fever or respiratory symptoms regardless of their exposure history approximately 135 million samples were screened by six third-party institutions between 30th january and 15th march 2020 surveillance commenced at guangdong airports in early march following the growth of covid-19 outbreaks outside of china in total 16 million tests were performed by 19th march 2020 identifying 1388 sars-cov-2 positive cases in 20 of 21 prefectures in guangdong province figure 1b around a quarter of cases 336 were judged to be linked to local transmission and two-thirds 1014 had a likely exposure history in hubei see star methods for locally infected cases 181 53 were linked to transmission among household members more than half of the reported cases 60 were from the cities of shenzhen and guangzhou figure 1b we note that the number of detected cases will be less than the true number of infections although the degree of under-reporting is unknown surveillance was targeted toward travelers hence these data may overestimate the proportion of travel-associated casesto understand the genetic structure of the covid-19 outbreak in guangdong we generated near-complete and partial genomes from 53 covid-19 patients in guangdong province the genomes were generated by a combination of metagenomic sequencing and multiplex pcr amplification followed by nanopore sequencing on a minion device see star methods sequence sampling dates ranged from 30th january to 28th february 2020 figure s1
sequencing was performed on 79 clinical samples throat swabs n  32 anal swabs n  24 nasopharyngeal swabs n  10 sputum n  13 collected from 62 patients with varying disease symptoms ranging from asymptomatic to very severe see star methods real-time reverse transcription pcr ct cycle threshold values of these samples ranged from 19 to 4086 figure 2
a displays the ct values for the 53 samples with 50 genome coverage for which we report whole and partial genome sequences see figure s2
for details of all 79 samples when ct values are 30 sequence reads covered 90 or more of the reference genome genbank mn9089473 irrespective of the amplification and sequencing approach used see star methods however genome coverage declined for samples with ct 30 figure s2 using a kruskal-wallis rank-sum test we found an association between sample ct values and sample type figure 2b p  0001 and sample ct values and disease severity figure 2c p  003 see also liu et al 2020 however we note that sampling was not undertaken with these hypotheses in mindsequences generated with nanopore sequencing indicate common regions of low coverage figure 2d indicating that the version 1 primer set used here did not amplify some regions efficiently efficient primer binding may have been prevented due to genetic divergence from the reference genome mn9089473 an alternative explanation is the interaction between two particular primers resulting in primer dimer formation itokawa et al 2020 after completion of this study the primers have been redesigned to address these issues and improve coverage quick 2020 shared and unique single nucleotide polymorphisms snps were observed at 97 sites across the sars-cov-2 genome figures 2d and 2e with 77 snps present in only one genome three snps were present in 10 genomes c8782t c21711t and t28144c when compared to 49 previously released genomes from hubei and guangdong 118 snps are present in only one genome and these three snps are still the only variants shared among 10 genomes data s1to understand the genetic diversity of the sars-cov-2 epidemic in guangdong we performed phylogenetic analyses using maximum likelihood and bayesian molecular clock approaches we added our new virus genomes from guangdong to 177 publicly available sequences which includes 73 sequences from china 17 of which were previously reported guangdong genomes the final alignment comprised 250 sequences and increased the number of sars-cov-2 sequences from china by 60 when our data were submitted to gisaid on 9th marchthe estimated maximum likelihood ml phylogeny is shown in figure 3
a the sars-cov-2 sequences from guangdong red are interspersed with viral lineages sampled from other chinese provinces and other countries gray this pattern agrees with the epidemiological time series in figure 1a indicating that most detected cases were linked to travel rather than local community transmission despite this there were a number of instances where sequences from guangdong appeared to cluster together sometimes with sequences sampled from other regions to explore these lineages in more detail we performed a bayesian molecular clock analysis that places the phylogenetic history of the genomes on an estimated timescale a summary visualization of the maximum clade credibility tree from that analysis is shown in figure 3b and is largely congruent with the ml tree the current low genetic diversity of sars-cov-2 genomes worldwide means that most internal nodes have very low posterior probabilities we caution that no conclusions should be drawn from these branching events as they will be informed by the phylogenetic prior distribution rather than variable nucleotide sites figure 3a nevertheless five clusters denoted ae containing guangdong sequences had posterior probability support of 80 ie their sequences grouped monophyletically in 80 of trees in the posterior sample figure 3b these clusters were also observed in the ml phylogeny figure 3a some included only sequences sampled in guangdong a b others included sequences sampled in other countries and provinces c d efrom the molecular clock analysis we were able to estimate the times of the most recent common ancestor tmrca of clusters ae we found that sars-cov-2 lineages were imported multiple times into guangdong during the second half of january 2020 figure 4
 three clusters c d e have earlier tmrcas that coincide with the start of the guangdong epidemic and two a b have later tmrcas around the time of the epidemic peak in the province figure 4 the average time between the tmrca and the earliest sequence collection date in each cluster was approximately 1025 days the observed duration of each phylogenetic cluster tmrca to most recently sampled sequence ranged from 949 cluster b to 452 cluster d days the clusters with earlier tmrcas contain more sequences from travelers sampled outside of china possibly reflecting a decrease in air passenger travel from guangdong after january 2020 flightradar24 2020 the median tmrca estimate of the covid-19 pandemic was 1st december 2019 95 hpd 15th november to 13th december 2019 figure 4 consistent with previous analyses rambaut 2020the apparent clusters of guangdong sequences require careful interpretation because of the relative undersampling of sars-cov-2 genomes from other chinese provinces including hubei specifically it is known that undersampling of regions with high incidence can lead to phylogenetic analyses underestimating the number of introductions into recipient locations and overestimating the size and duration of transmission chains in those recipient locations grubaugh et al 2017 kraemer et al 2018 for example the largest guangdong phylogenetic cluster denoted a in figures 3 and 4 comprises 8 sequences none of which are placed at the root of the cluster and it is tempting to conclude that the entire cluster derived from community transmission within guangdong however 6 of the 8 genomes reported travel from hubei and therefore the cluster in fact represents multiple sars-cov-2 introductions into guangdong with dates of symptom onset around or shortly after the shutdown of travel from wuhan figure 4our analyses of the genomic epidemiology of sars-cov-2 in guangdong province indicate that following the first covid-19 case detected in early january most infections were the result of virus importation from elsewhere and that chains of local transmission were limited in size and duration this suggests that the large-scale surveillance and intervention measures implemented in guangdong were effective in interrupting community transmission in a densely populated urban region ultimately containing the epidemic and limiting the potential for dissemination to other regions leung et al 2020 however vigilance is still required as there remains a risk that sars-cov-2 transmission could reignite in guangdong following the recent increase in the number of covid-19 cases imported to china from other countriesthe results also suggest that analyses of phylogenetic structure during the early phase of the pandemic should be interpreted carefully the number of mutations that define phylogenetic lineages are small often one and may be similar to the number of sequence differences arising from errors introduced during reverse transcription pcr amplification or sequencing bayesian estimates of divergence times rannala and yang 1996 such as the tmrca of the pandemic are based on aggregate numbers of mutations and informed by dense sampling through time and are thus expected to be more robust further the low and variable sampling of covid-19 cases among different regions makes it challenging to evaluate phylogenetic clusters that comprise cases from a single region although such clusters could indeed represent local transmission our results show they can also include multiple introductions from a genomically undersampled location therefore as with all phylogenetic analyses the sars-cov-2 genomes must be interpreted in the context of all available epidemiological information

virus genomes were generated by two different approaches i untargeted metagenomic sequencing on the bgi mgiseq-2000 n  63 and illumina nextseq n  4 sequencing platforms and ii using version 1 of the artic covid-19 multiplex pcr primers httpsarticnetworkncov-2019 followed by nanopore sequencing on an ont minion n  45 untargeted metagenomic sequencing was initially attempted as it is well suited to the characterization of a previously unknown virus subsequently a protocol for sequencing sars-cov-2 using multiplex pcr with nanopore sequencing was made available which showed good performance on samples with higher ct values as described below and in table s13 thereafter most clinical samples were sequenced using this latter approach we report only those genomes for which we were able to generate  50 genome coverage and report only one genome per patientfor metatranscriptomics total rnas were extracted from different types of samples by using qiaamp viral rna mini kit followed by dnase treatment and purification with turbo dnase and agencourt rnaclean xp beads both the concentration and the quality of all isolated rna samples were measured and checked with the agilent bioanalyzer 2100 and qubit for illumina sequencing libraries were prepared using the smarter stranded total rna-seq kit v2 according to the manufacturers protocol starting with 10 ng total rna briefly purified rna was first fragmented and converted to cdna using reverse transcriptase the ribosome cdna was depleted by using zaprv2 mammalian-specific the remaining cdna was converted to double stranded dna and subjected to end-repair a-tailing and adaptor ligation the constructed libraries were amplified using 9-16 pcr cycles sequencing of metatranscriptome libraries was conducted on the illumina nextseq 550 se 75 platform for bgi sequencing dna-depleted and purified rna was used to construct the single-stranded circular dna library with mgieasy rna library preparation reagent set following manufacturers protocol finally 60fmol of pcr products were unique dual indexed udi circularized and amplified by rolling circle replication rcr to generate dna nanoball dnbs-based libraries dnbs preps of clinical samples were sequenced on the mgiseq-2000 platformfor the multiplex pcr approach we followed the general method of multiplex pcr as described in httpsarticnetworkncov-2019 quick et al 2017 briefly the multiplex pcr was performed with two pooled primer mixture and the cdna reverse transcribed with random primers was used as a template after 35 rounds of amplification the pcr products were collected and quantified followed with end-repairing and barcoding ligation around 50 fmol of final library dna was loaded onto the minion the nanopore sequencing platform takes less than 24 hours to obtain 10gb of sequencing data achieving between 0306 million reads per sample the artic bioinformatics pipeline for covid httpsarticnetworkncov-2019 was used to generate consensus sequences and call single nucleotide changes relative to the reference sequence snp differences were sometimes observed when the same sample was sequenced using different sequencing approaches these differences were random and not platform specific and upon close inspection of the reads most likely resulted from low coverage regions in the metagenomics data only the single highest-quality genome was retained per patientto test the precision and threshold of the multiplex pcr and nanopore sequencing method we undertook a serial dilution experiment viral rna was extracted from a cell strain of sars-cov-2 to mimic clinical samples with different viral loads we diluted this viral rna with sars-cov-2-negative rna extracted from nasopharyngeal swab specimens viral loads were estimated using rt-pcr with serial diluted plasmid as a standard at each dilution level we performed multiplex pcr and nanopore sequencing and assembly as per the approach above except that reads were assembled against the consensus genome obtained from the original sample using metagenomic sequencing as expected relative virus load  genome coverage and average read depth decreased at higher dilutions genome coverage exceeded 75 for all except the final dilution table s13reference-based assembly of the metagenomic raw data was performed as follows illumina adaptors were removed and reads were filtered for quality q30 threshold and read length  15nt using cutadapt 118 martin 2011 the mapping of cleaned reads was performed against genbank reference strain mn9089473 using bowtie2 langmead and salzberg 2012 consensus sequences were generated using samtools 12 li et al 2009 sites were called at depth   3 if they matched the reference strain or depth   5 if they differed from the reference otherwise sites were denoted n ambiguity nucleotide codes were used if i the minor variant is observed at  30 frequency and ii the minor variant is represented by 5 or more reads assembly of the nanopore raw data was performed using the artic bioinformatic pipeline for covid-19 with minimap2 li 2018 and medaka httpsgithubcomnanoporetechmedaka for consensus sequence generation for patient samples that were sequenced using both metagenomics and nanopore sequencing we retained only the sequence with the highest genome coverageall available sars-cov-2 sequences n  323 on gisaid gisaidorg on 13th march 2020 were downloaded sequences from gisaid that were error-rich those which represented multiple sequences from the same patient and those without a date of sampling were removed finally the dataset was reduced by only retaining the earliest and most recently sampled sequences from epidemiologically linked outbreaks eg the diamond princess cruise ship the resulting dataset of 250 sequences therefore represents the global diversity of the virus while minimizing the impact of sampling bias sequences were aligned using mafft v74 katoh and standley 2013 and manually inspected in geneious v1103 httpswwwgeneiouscom the final alignment length was 29923 nucleotideswe used both the maximum likelihood ml and bayesian coalescent methods to explore the phylogenetic structure of sars-cov-2 the ml phylogeny was estimated with phyml guindon et al 2010 using the hky4 substitution model hasegawa et al 1985 with gamma-distributed rate variation yang 1994 linear regression of root-to-tip genetic distance against sampling date indicated that the sars-cov-2 sequences evolve in clock-like manner r  0592 figure s3
 the bayesian coalescent tree analysis was undertaken with beast v1104 ayres et al 2012 suchard et al 2018 also using the hky4 substitution model with gamma-distributed rate variation with an exponential population growth tree prior and a strict molecular clock under a non-informative continuous-time markov chain ctmc reference prior ferreira and suchard 2008 taxon sets were defined and used to estimate the posterior probability of monophyly and the posterior distribution of the tmrca of observed phylogenetic clusters a-e table s12 two independent chains were run for 100 million states and parameters and trees were sampled every 10000 states upon completion chains were combined using logcombiner after removing 10 of states as burn-in and convergence was assessed with tracer rambaut et al 2018 the maximum clade credibility mcc tree was inferred from the bayesian posterior tree distribution using treeannotator and visualized with figtreejs-react httpsgithubcomjtmccr1figtreejs-react monophyly and tmrca time to the most recent common ancestor statistics were calculated for each taxon set from the posterior tree distributionthe highly contagious and pathogenic novel severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 causative agent ongoing covid-19 pandemic has spread rapidly and posed a health threat of unprecedented magnitude on the global population the novel sars-cov-2 was first reported in december 2019 to have emerged in the live wildlife market in the wuhan region of hubei province where it has caused mystic pneumonia-like respiratory illnesses in the human population of the affected area 1 according to data presented by the covid-19 situation report from world health organization who as of may 15 2020 the virus has infected more than 4347935 people around the world including a staggering 297241 deaths with a cumulative mortality rate of 68 and exponentially increased in between march and april 2 despite the instantaneous and monumental research efforts from the scientific community around the globe at present no effective antiviral treatment or vaccine is available for covid-19 however significant efforts have been made to the development of vaccines and therapeutic drugs which were under small scale clinical trials 34 presently the sars-cov-2 infected patients treatments have been limited to the use of prophylactic and symptomatic management like mild symptoms such as dry cough sore throat and fever and various fatal complications including organ failure septic shock pulmonary edema severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 5 therefore there is an urgent need for the discovery of a potential treatment therapy to check and control the sars-cov-2 pandemic coronaviruses covs belong to family coronaviridae of viruses constitute an important class of pathogens for humans and other vertebrates 6before the current sars-cov-2 only six of the covs were known to cause mild to severe illnesses in humans the novel human coronavirus hcov229e and hcovnl63 fall in genera alpha-coronavirus cause milder upper respiratory disease in adults and sometimes can also cause severe infection in infants and young children whereas the beta-coronaviruses like hcovoc43 hku1 sars-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus which has triggered an epidemic in china during 200203 and mers-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus an etiological agent of middle east coronavirus epidemic of 2012 have potential to cause infection in lower respiratory tract along with cough  fever and triggers severe respiratory illness in humans 7 the causative agent of the current outbreak sars-cov-2 also belongs to beta coronaviruses 8 and is closely related to sars-cov with an overall genomic sequence similarity of 79 all of these covs belong to the coronaviridae a family of viruses that possess a positive-sense single-stranded rna genome 9the virion of sars-cov-2 is consists of crown-shaped peplomers 80160 nm in diameter and consists of a 30 kb long single-stranded rna molecule of positive polarity with 5 cap and 3 poly-a tail 10the rna genome is composed of at least six open reading frames orfs of which the first orf orf1ab makes up the 5two-third and encodes two polypeptides pp1a and pp1ab both of which furthermore leads to the production of 16 nonstructural proteins nsps other orfs that make up the remaining one-third of the viral genome give rise to the production of four main structural factors of the virion spike protein s envelope protein e membrane protein m and nucleocapsid protein n 11the sars-cov-2 virus uses the heterotrimeric spike s protein which consists of s1 and s2 subunit on its surface to interacts with the ace2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 cellular receptor abundantly expressed on many cell types in human tissues 12 upon internalization into the cell genomic rna is used as a template for direct translation of two polyprotein pp1a and pp1ab which encodes several crucial nonstructural proteins nsps including two proteases chymotrypsin-like protease 3clpro or main protease mpro -nsp5 and papain-like a protease ppro -nsp3 both of which processes the polypeptide pp1a and pp1ab in a sequence-specific manner to produce 16 different nsps 1314 the papain protease processes the polyprotein to generate nsp14 at the same time the mpro operates at as many as 11 cleavage sites by specifically recognizing the sequence leu-glnser-ala-gly  marks the cleavage site to generate rest of the critical nsps including helicase methyltransferase and rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp all of which play a critical role in the viral infection cycle by forming a replication-transcription complex rtc 15 therefore the main protease constitutes a major and attractive drug target to block the production of nonstructural viral components and thereby to hamper the replication event of the virus life cycle additionally no human protease with similar cleavage specificity is known to rule out the possibility of cellular toxicity upon the potential inhibition of the main viral protease 16in recent years drug repurposing methodology has emerged as a resourceful alternative to fasten the drug development process against rapidly spreading emerging infections such as the one of sars-cov-2 17 the approach of drug repurposing has successfully led to the discoveries of potential drug candidates against several diseases such as ebola disease hepatitis c virus and zika virus infection 1819 recently several repurposing studies on sars-cov-2 have been performed using clinically approved drugs 20 among which a very new study comes out on a clinical trial of lopinavirritonavir drug for covid-19 which was indicated on top of our drug repurposing study 21in the present study we have performed in silico based drug repurposing method using molecular docking studies on the spectrum of food and drug administration fda - approved antiviral drugs against sars-cov-2 mpro to this end a recently elucidated x-ray crystal structure of sars-cov-2 mpro pdb id 6y2f which have been shown with an -ketoamide as a potent inhibitor in the enzymes active site was chosen and screened for several fda approved antiviral drugs to simulate the mpro- -ketoamide interactions and thereby blocking the active pocket 16 the crystal structure of sars-cov-2 mpro in the apo form pdb id 6y2e and -ketoamide bound form pdb id 6y2f shows that the protein makes a crystallographic dimer composed of two monomers of identical conformations each protomer furthermore is made up of three domains the interface of domain i and domain ii form the active site of the protein which is composed of a cys145-his41 dyad where -ketoamide derivative 13b is bound fig 1
a the uniquely globular domain iii is linked to domain ii through a linker region and deemed essential for the catalytic activity of these chymotrypsin-like proteas 22 the -ketoamide derivative 13b is shown bound in the active site it is stabilized by several interactions with the active site residues his41  cys145 and adjacent residues in substrate binding cleft such as gly143 and ser144 16 fig 1bwe have selected several existing fda approved drugs most of which are reported to be used in humans for countering certain viral infections and screened them for binding in the active cleft of mpro our results have shown that some of the drugs occupied the active site of mpro with even increased binding affinity than that of the bound -ketoamide 13b while the rest of the compounds has shown appreciable binding while holding most of the crucial active site determinants we envisage that further in vitro examination of the inhibitory potential of these drugs on the catalytic activity of the main protease could lead the way to repurpose one or more of the tested fda approved drugs in this study as a treatment therapy for sars-cov-2 induced diseaseto understand the evolutionary relationship between the previously known human coronavirus and the novel sars-cov-2 we have performed the phylogenetic analysis for analysis all the closely related and complete reference genome sequences of sars-cov-2 were downloaded from the ncbi genbank database a total of 50 genomes were considered for the study mega 60 was used for multiple sequence alignment and construction of a phylogenetic tree and 1000 bootstrap replicates performed using the neighbor-joining method 23the recently elucidated x-ray crystal structure coordinates of sar-cov-2 mpro was downloaded from rcsb pdb pdb id 6y2f having 175  resolution in this structure the mpro was co-crystallized with the improved bound -ketoamide 13b inhibitor and multiple intermolecular interactions of the ligand with the active site residues are characterized 16 to further identify the potent inhibitors for sar-cov-2 mpro among the fda approved antiviral drugs we have downloaded more than 75 drug compounds from the pubchem chemical database 24 for molecular docking based drug repurposing the download 3d structures of compounds and protein were prepared the docking study was performed by autodock vina 25 which uses a lamarckian genetic algorithm ga in combination with grid-based energy estimation to check the docking accuracy of software we have performed re-docking to the co-crystal bound ligand the main aim of this molecular interaction study was to identify the highly interacting drug with sar-cov-2 protein crystal structure and to propose the drug by in-silico repurposing method all the interaction visualization analysis studies were performed by discoverystudio visualizer ds pymol molecular visualization tool and ligplot 2627the molecular dynamics md simulations were performed by yasara version

bat sars-cov genome sl-covzxc21 mg7729341 showed 94 query coverage and 8865 sequence identity both isolated from china majorly phylogenetic tree was clustered into three clades i ii and clade iii clade i consists of 25 sars-cov and bat-sl-cov complete genome and share sequence identity range from 8818 to 100 when sequence was aligned using blastn tool whereas clade ii consists of total 12 complete genomes of sars-cov-2 and bat-sl-cov in which ten genomes are of sars-cov-2 which were isolated from patients in different countries china mn9886681 nc0455122 mn9383841 mn9752621 usa mn9944671 mn9944681 mn9853251 mn9974091 mn9887131 and nepal mt0726881 the other two genomes of bat-sl-cov were isolated from china mg7729331 mg7729341 in clade iii there are two complete genomes of bat coronavirus isolated from germany gu1902151 and kenyan bat ky3524071 the rest of the 11 complete genomes of viruses are from hibicovirus nobecovirus merbecovirus and embecovirus importantly phylogenetic analysis revealed that there is no divergence in the sar-cov-2 genome sequence of different sar-cov-2 viruses isolated from different countries during the ongoing outbreak fig 2
coronaviruses use a chymotrypsin-like a protease along with papain protease to process and cleaves its long polyprotein precursor into individually functional nsps multiple sequence analysis of the main protease of sars-cov-2 with that of sars-cov reveals that amino acid sequence is conserved with a sequence identity of 96 fig 3
 the active site residues are thoroughly conserved and make a catalytic cys145-his41 dyad additionally there are substrate-binding subsites positioned in the active site groove of the protease the specific subsite residues located in the enzyme active site are named as s1 s1 s2 s3 and s4 depending on their relative position to the cleavage site and subsites p1 p1 p2 p3 and p4 in the polyprotein subsite p1 corresponds to the amino acid just before the cleavage site and position p1 corresponds to the residue immediately after the cleavage site 3132in the mpro of sars-cov-2 active site region the s1 residues are contributed by cys145 gly143 and ser144 which also serve as the oxyanion hole the s1 residue is his163 while glu166  gln189 located at the s2 position bulky gln189 and pro168 make the s4 site 16 fig 4
a the main protease recognizes and binds specific residues at each subsite of the peptide substrate to determine the initiation of proteolysis and production of nsps for the formation of the replication-transcription complexthe molecular docking based virtual screening of fda approved antiviral drugs against the sars-cov-2 mpro revealed the strong interaction with higher docking energy and binding affinities all the potential drugs docked with the independent confirmation in the active site of protein where the co-crystal structure ligand improved -ketoamide 13b bound molecular docking binding affinity of all the docked and analyzed drugs with their binding energy ranking is shown in table s1 the molecular re-docking was also performed to check the docking accuracy of the software autodock vina and it was observed that the co-crystal bound ligand and re-docked ligand shows rmsd value of 051  suggesting the high fidelity of docking method fig 4b in the present study we focused on the top 10 docking results for further analysis as these drug compounds showing higher binding affinity as lopinavir-ritonavir -106 kcalmol tipranavir -87 kcalmol raltegravir -83 kcalmol -ketoamide13b -83 kcalmol nelfinavir -82 kcalmol dolutegravir -81 kcalmol tenofovir-disoproxil -81 kcalmol baloxavir-marboxil -81 kcalmol letermovir -80 kcalmol and maraviroc -80 kcalmol although among the top 10 drugs the top three drug compounds were showing binding affinity even higher than that of the improved -ketoamide 13b compound fig 5

 for the top 10 drugsdrug tipranavir or tipranavir disodium is another nonpeptidic protease inhibitor used in combination with ritonavir to treat hiv infection 49 in our study the drug shows interaction with gln192 met165 both form hydrogen bonding gln189 asp187 met49 arg188 ser46 cys44 thr25 and his41 in different conformation from that of -ketoamide inhibitor figs 5b and 9d we hypothesize that tipranavir or its other derivatives with even improved binding affinity in combination with ritonavir could serve as the potential protease inhibitor to counter sras-cov-2 multiplication in cell-based assayanother drug that has shown comparable binding affinity and binding energy with that of the docked -ketoamide in mpro active site the raltegraviris a characterized antiretroviral medication which works by inhibiting the integrase strand transfer and is used in combination with other drugs to relieve the hiv infection 42 in the present study the raltegravir drug shows interaction with his164 arg188 gln192 glu166 all residues were bonded with strong hydrogen bond met49 met165 phe140 pro168 and leu167 the drug shows four h-bonds with nearest interacting amino acids of the sars-cov-2 mpro enzyme which indicates good inhibition figs 5c and 9c this drug could also be used with other combinations like raltegravir and lopinavir for the treatment of covid-19 if found producing desirable inhibitory effect against sars-cov-2 protease in biochemical activity assay or cell-based assays additionally other drugs that were screened and docked in the substrate-binding cleft of the mpro has shown good binding energy score which is comparably similar to the original compound in the protein crystal structure many of these drugs such as dolutegravir letermovir  nelfinavir are commonly used for treating different infections ranging from hiv to cytomegalovirus by employing the different mechanisms of action 50 51 52 the identified repurposed drug and their interaction with binding amino acids in the mpro active site have been shown in table 1after screening the different fda approved drugs the present study enabled us to understand the mode of interaction of approved antiretroviral drugs with new coronavirus sars-cov-2 main protease enzyme the top three drugs lopinavir-ritonavir raltegravir and tipranavir were further run for md simulations studies for the period of 10 ns in the results we see that all three ligands are intact and bound to its binding site later the protein backbone rmsd analysis of all the complexes was performed which reveals that nearly all three complexes were stable after 4 ns and showing rmsd calculations within the range of 152458  after starting from 05  fig 6 the total binding energies were showing that drug lopinavir-ritonavir was showing more stable energy values fig 7 in order to know the effect of ligands binding on the sars-cov-2 mpro we performed the rmsf analysis from the average rmsf of protein constituting residues atoms since all trajectories of all complexes become stable with minor fluctuations between range 102  fig 8 from the analysis it was observed that lopinavir-ritonavir shows all hydrogen bonds made with nine acceptors and two donors whereas a total number of 20 hydrogen bonds are possible fig s1 in raltegravir 11 acceptors and three donors h-bonds were formed whereas a total number of 25 hydrogen bonds are possible similarly drug tipranavir formed eight acceptors and two donors h-bonds in contrast a total number of 18 hydrogen bonds are possible fig s1 this md simulation analysis shows the promising binding stability of the drug compounds with the binding pocket of cov-2 mpro pdb id 6y2fhowever we believe that all the drugs studied and screened for repurposing against covid-19 in this study should furthermore be tested and their in vitro inhibitory potential needs to be investigated through robust biochemical proteolytic activity assays and other biophysical  structural studiesin conclusion this study reveals the potential of repurposed antiviral drugs to bind in the active site of sars-cov-2 main protease in a highly specific binding pattern similar to that of the crystal bound -ketoamide mpro structure three of the screened drugs lopinavir-ritonavir raltegravir and tipranavir have shown the strongest binding and that md simulation study confirmed the stability and conformational flexibility of these drugs in the enzyme active site since all the drugs identified in this study are of known pharmacokinetics standards and approved by fda for human use for the treatment of respective illneses so it may be possible to move straight to clinical trials as per standard and approved by fda for new indication and therefore can fasten up the process of the therapeutics development against sars-cov-2 infection the molecular dynamics studies performed in this study for screened top three drugs also proving the binding conformational stability with cov-2 mpro our phylogenetic analysis of the available genomes of sars-cov-2 isolated from different sources also reveals that the virus is not showing any sign of severing mutation or diversification rapidly therefore the repurposed drug combinations could be used against sars-cov-2 on the pan-community level furthermore we suggest that the efficacy of the repurposed drugs in this study needs to be experimentally confirmed by carrying out the biochemical and structural studies for the prevention and treatment of covid-19no funding sourcesnone declarednot requiredthe clinical samples were

n-linked glycosylation site prediction revealed that two putative glycosylation sites with a low value for jury agreement were present within the epitope stretch 328-344the discontinuous epitopes in the spike protein of the indian sars-cov-2 were further identified using multiple methods ellipro and discotope conformational epitopes based on these methods were mapped on the pre-fusion structure

software based on the threshold of 04 twelve of these were shortlisted considering a binding efficiency of 05 nm and capable of eliciting ifn- response table iiitill february 29 2020 three positive cases of sars-cov-2 were reported from india from 881 suspected cases tested at icmr-niv pune all the three cases had a travel history from wuhan china during january 2020 although ngs was performed on the specimens for all the three positive cases the complete genome sequence could be retrieved only from case 1 and case 3 the three cases were recovered after hospitalization and were home quarantined as per the guidelines of the ministry of health and family welfare government of india14the low viral copy number of the ts specimen from case 2 could be the possible reason for lesser viral reads being retrieved during the ngs run leading to a fragmented genome the recent study from china on serial samples tss sputum urine and stool from two patients followed days 3-12 and days 4-15 post onset20 n gene-specific real-time rt-pcr assay showed that the viral loads in ts and sputum samples peaked at around 5-6 days after symptom onset ranging from around 104-107 copies per ml during this time20 in another study the virus was detected in the saliva specimens of 11 of the 12 patients and serial saliva testing showed declines of viral rna levels21the two indian sars-cov-2 sequences were found to be non-identical 004 nt divergence and the result of phylogenetic analysis indicated that there were two different introductions into the country a recent study using 52 published genbank sequences showed evidence of substantial genetic heterogeneity and estimated the time to the most recent common ancestor to be december 5 2019 95 confidence interval november 6 - december 13 201922 continuous monitoring and analysis of the sequences from the affected countries would be vital to understand the genetic evolution and rates of substitution of the sars-cov-2the comparison of the amino acid sequences of the non-structural nsp1-nsp16 and structural polyproteins was undertaken with reference to the wuhan-hu1 strain for molecular characterization some human betacoronaviruses including hcov-hku1 lineage a have a polybasic cleavage site as well as predicted o-linked glycans near the s1s2 cleavage site of the spike protein as published recently the polybasic cleavage site that has not been previously observed in related lineage b betacoronaviruses and is a unique feature of sars-cov-2 was noted in the indian sars-cov-2 the mutation arg408ile in the spike protein of one of the indian sequences is noted to be in the rbd and ala930val is located in the s2 domain however both are away from the ace2 receptor-binding interface1923 mutations in the spike protein sequences of sars-cov-2 observed currently are localized over the s1 and s2 domains and so far have not been found in the ace2-binding interfacefrom the alignment of the spike protein sequences of sars cov-1 and sars-cov-2 wuhan-hu1 and india it can be observed that the three nucleotide-deletion in the case 1 sars-cov-2 from india is located close to the insert 1 region of the sars cov-1 supplementary fig 3 available from httpwwwijmrorginarticles20201512imagesindianjmedres20201512200281471sm11pdf notably case 1 and case 2 were in close contact while travelling to india but due to the absence of the complete genome of case 2 the genetic relatedness and source of infection could not be pinpointedamong the sars-cov structural proteins the spike protein has been found to elicit neutralizing antibodies24 in this study it was observed that of the five b-cell linear epitopes which were predicted four epitopes were present in the s1 domain and one in the s2 domain prediction of conformational b-cell epitopes revealed that one of these residue positions 341-505 in the spike protein incorporates two of the predicted linear epitopes 327-342 and 404-419 having good antigenicity along with a favourable ifn- response that enables differentiation and proliferation of the b-cells25 notably an equivalent epitope 347-499 is predicted for the model generated using the sars-cov-1 s protein as a template in both cases this epitope lies within the rbd6 although the epitope has two putative n-linked glycosylation sites within it at positions 330 and 332 the probability of these sites being actually glycosylated is very low a major immuno-dominant epitope has been reported from sars-cov between residues 441 and 70026 hence the predicted b-cell conformational epitope identified in the present study may play an important role in initiating a b-cell response among the five linear epitopes predicted in this study epitopes 327-342 and 1204-1219 are conserved between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-1 epitopes 243-258 404-419 and 413-428 are found to have variationsthe spike protein of sars-cov has also been reported to be immunogenic and elicit high ifn--specific t-cell response26 the prediction results in this study revealed that nine possible ctl epitopes possessing good antigenicity and inducing ifn- response were present in the s protein a recent report27 also predicted t-cell epitopes in the s protein based on a similar annsvm method and antigenicity score although the ifn- response was not considered by these authors it was noted that two of the predictions were found to be common among the t-cell epitopes predicted in the present study four epitopes 89-97 and 256-264 in the s1 domain and 825-833 and 1058-1066 in the s2 domain were found to have good ctl prediction scores with a broad hla allele coverage of a and b supertypes these hla supertypes being predominant in the indian population the predicted epitopes may be considered suitable for future experiments towards vaccine designto conclude the prompt intervention by the government of india and the health authorities of the state of kerala ensured that the said cases did not become secondary foci of transmission further the timely identification of sars-cov-2 in these suspected cases by the icmr-niv pune has helped in the isolation of the patients containment and enhanced surveillances for the virus and its restricted movement the availability of the genomic sequences of the identified cases will contribute to the public repositories and help towards the development of diagnostics vaccines and antivirals the sequence data would also help in tracking the virus from its origin and evolution with its transmission in timeavailability of data sequences are deposited in gisaid database with accession numbers epi isl 413522 and epi isl 413523coronaviruses a large family of viruses causing upper-respiratory-tract infections in humans and other higher mammals bedford et al 2020 coronavirus outbreak has been reported three times in the 21st century namely sars in 2002 mers in 2012 and covid-19 in november 2019 the recent outbreak of covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 has emerged from china human-human transmission of this highly infectious zoonotic virus has led to exponential growth in the number of infected cases which resulted in its pandemic outbreak worldwide fahmi 2020 currently more than 225 countries are affected due to covid-19 with more than 25 million people to date which is increasing in thousands per day around the world and approximately 5 to 10 mortality rate fahmi 2020 additionally the lives of millions of people have been impacted due to mandatory lockdowns isolations and quarantines thus the severe effect of the covid-19 outbreak has imposed major challenges for global health society and economy fry 2020 currently there are no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines available for the treatment and management of covid-19 which is further making the situation difficult to handle at present preventive and supportive therapies are being implemented to prevent complications salata et al 2020 several efforts are going on to target key proteins of sars-cov-2 pathogenesis like the main protease mpro rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp rna binding n terminal domain ntd of nucleocapsid protein n protein viral ion channel e protein 2-o-ribosemethyltransferase and human angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 receptor hace-2 gao et al 2020 gupta et al 2020 khan et al 2020 sarma et al 2020 shang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 to propose or repurpose drug andor lead molecules against sars-cov-2 it would be effective to target multiple virus pathogenesis specific proteins within a close network of interaction or having dependent functionality zhou et al 2020for drug discovery purposes the mpro of coronaviruses has been studied extensively they are papain-like proteases involved in the self-maturation and processing of viral replicase enzymes zhang et al 2020 mpro has 11 putative cleavage sites in 790 kd replicase lab indicating its predominance in the proteolytic processing of large polyprotein lab mpro from sars-cov-2 showed high sequence identity and structural similarity to that of the sars-cov mpro it contains two catalytic domains i chymotrypsin and ii picornavirus 3 c protease-like each containing six-stranded antiparallel -barrel containing active diad h41 and c145 since they have a key role in virus replication these proteases have emerged as important drug targets furthermore with their very low similarity with human proteases inhibitors of mpro are found to be very less cytotoxic anand et al 2003 zhang et al 2020 preliminary studies have suggested the potential use of protease inhibitor lopinavirritonavir commonly used drugs for human immunodeficiency virus hiv for the treatment of covid-19 patients cao et al 2020 muralidharan et al 2020 unfortunately in the open-label randomized clinical study these drugs are not found to be that impressive for covid-19 treatment additionally several other viral protease inhibitors like hcv protease inhibitor danoprevir hiv protease inhibitor darunavir are under in vivo and clinical studies for the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection dong et al 2020 to find new or repositioning existing drug molecules the understanding of sequence and structure of sars-cov- mpro in regards to various other coronavirus strains could be important their comparative understanding is enigmatic which could be important to repurpose available antiviral protease inhibitors against sars-cov-2 mprocoronavirus uses a multiprotein complex to replicate its rna based genomes cleavage of viral polyproteins orf1a and orf1b produces a set of non-structural proteins nsp of these rdrp or nsp12 catalyzes the synthesis and is known to play an important role in the replication and transcription cycle of the virus rdrp is a primary target for nucleotide analog antiviral inhibitors such as remdesivir a drug under evaluation for sars-cov2 infection in clinics gao et al 2020 imbert et al 2006 remdesivir a nucleotide analog has shown broad-spectrum antiviral activities and preclinical studies have also shown promising human safety data amirian  levy 2020 dong et al 2020 recently a report suggested that the significant inhibition of rdrp of sars-cov-2 by remdesivir and clinical studies for the same are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of this molecule in the covid-19 patients wwwclinicaltrialsgov study no nct04280705apart from the maturation and replication the entry of this virus by binding its surface spike protein to the hace-2 is also a crucial process that can be targeted hasan et al 2020 kuhn et al 2004 shang et al 2020 since this host cell receptor is essential for the virus entry targeting hace-2 has a promise for preventing sars-cov-2 infection it has been shown that clinically approved serine protease inhibitor tmprss2 can also bind to the sars-cov-2 receptor hace-2 and inhibit viral entry hoffmann et al 2020 to date the chinese clinical trial registry has recorded around 550 trials against sars-cov-2 mostly evaluating existing drug molecules these trials include the application of antiviral favipiravir adalimumab dihydroartemisininpiperaquine leflunomide lopinavir antimalarial drugs chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine highdose vitamin c etc wwwchictrorgcnindexaspx from the available data of experimental and clinical studies it has been found that molecules targeting single protein will be ineffective antiviral lead thus to devise an effective strategy there is a need for molecules that can target multiple key proteins such as rdrp and hace-2 along with the mpro as a major drug target wu et al 2020in silico screening of the drugs is a very vital and useful tool for rapid screening this enables to shortlist leads and thus meet the urgent demand for repurposing drugs for the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection therefore in this study we have performed a comparative analysis of the major target of sars-cov-2 mpro for its structural characteristics to other viruses from the coronoviridea family this information was further used for the virtual screening of the custom-made library of phytochemicals active ingredients present in the commonly used ayurvedic anti-tussive medicines in india and the synthetic anti-viral drugs against mpro top hit molecules from this screen were then docked against sars-cov-2 rdrp and hace2 to find the multi-target-directed molecules we believe that this study will provide a new approach and a base for the discovery of multi-targeted antiviral molecules against sars-cov-2 pathogenesis thus these compounds could be potential candidates for in vitro and in vivo anti-viral studies followed by clinical treatment of sars-cov-2phylogenetic analysis of proteases mpro helped to understand the structural-functional variation of sars-cov-2 concerning other viruses from the coronaviridae family figure 1a this analysis suggested that the mpros from the coronaviridae family are distributed in five clusters it has been observed that these proteases are separated in different clades depending on their zoonotic sources in the clade 1 orange colour which appears to be the ancestral clade in the phylogenetic tree have sequences from porcine transmissible gastroenteritis and pandemic diarrhea coronavirusthis clade appears to be evolutionary primitive to avian coronavirus but also showed coevolutionary traits in the clade 2 cyan most of the sequences are from the strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus it is then followed by clade 3 blue which mainly consists of the sequences from different strains of bat coronavirus it is also found to be the parental clade for the clade 4 red and the clade 5 green which consist of predominantly mammalian host coronaviruses it is interesting to see that the clade 4 which comprises viruses from bats and the majority of human infectious coronaviruses like sars mers and also recent sars-cov-2 our phylogenetic analysis revalidated the bat origin of the sars-cov-2 andersen et al 2020 while the clade 5 has sequences from bovine coronaviruses it also has subclades that are indicative of a distinct host range part of the clade 5 is from the bovine coronavirus and the other part is from murine coronavirus between these two subclades there is a set of sequences that forms clad 52 comprises of human coronaviruses like strain oc43 p0c6u7 and hku1 p0c6x3 which have bovine or murine as primary or intermediate host figure 1a as evident in the multiple sequence alignment supplementary figure 1 the mpro sequences from various coronaviruses strains showed very high conservation in the active site also sequences of mpro from isolates of sars-cov-2 viral strain showed high identity however the sequence variation around the active site can lead to the separation of these proteases in distinct clades depending on their hostsfurthermore the sequence similarity network ssn analysis was carried out to understand the similarities in mpro sequences from viruses of the coronaviridae family it was noted that till e-value 1e-80 all the sequences were clustered together suggesting an extremely high sequence similarity amongst all the coronaviridae proteases supplementary figure 2 at e-value 1e-140 the sequences were segregated in 5 clusters figure 1b the largest cluster green consisted of sequences from bovine coronavirus murine coronavirus and some human coronavirus such as oc43 and hku1 the second cluster orange exclusively consisted of the porcine coronaviruses and related strains bat coronaviruses were grouped in a single cluster blue while cyan cluster housed avian coronaviruses the red cluster consisted of human coronaviruses including sars mers sars-cov-2 along with various other bat coronaviruses the small cluster of 2 sequences that separated from the red cluster at e-value 1e-125 also belongs to the bat coronaviruses the clusters of ssn are showing a high correlation with the clades of the phylogenetic tree figure 1a suggesting high evolutionary divergence amongst the coronaviruses depending on their host reservoir this high specificity of the variations related to the host might have resulted from the natural selection in the animal hosts before human transmission andersen et al 2020a comparison of 49 structures of mpro from different coronavirus strains using the dali server showed five clusters similar to the phylogenetic tree figure 2a supplementary data 1 clusters 1 to 3 contains protease structures from porcine transmissible gastroenteritis and pandemic diarrhea coronavirus also they include the mpro structure from human coronavirus strains like nl63 and huk furthermore clusters 4 and 5 mostly consist of protease structures from the coronavirus strains causing respiratory infections like sars mers and sars-cov-2 the structural similarity matrix with hierarchical clustering also corroborates with the phylogenetic tree and structural cladogram showing the classification of mpro in five major clusters figure 2b these results indicate that sequence variations in the mpro are also reflected in the structural variations resulting in similar clustering at the sequence and structure levelstructural superimposition of representative proteases from each cluster of the structure cladogram and the similarity matrix depicted that the backbone of these proteases is conserved with rmsd less than 1  in the majority of cases figure 2c it suggests that the sequence variation leads to minor structural changes without major changes in the conformation furthermore a comparison of the substrate-binding pocket of these selected proteases shows that active site residue conformation is highly conserved figure 2d there are some variations in the binding pocket residues as shown in the multiple sequence alignment but these variations are subtle and overall binding pocket conformation is conserved structural conservation of backbone and binding pocket of mpro from various coronavirus strains suggest that substrate recognition and inhibitor binding would more or less likely to be similar in them hegyi and ziebuhr 2002 have shown the conservation in the substrate specificities and proteolytic processing of replicase polyproteins in the main proteases across coronaviruses hegyi  ziebuhr 2002this similarity highlights the development of universal mpro assays and the design of broad-spectrum inhibitors of mpro from different coronavirus strains this also suggests that the mpro inhibitor-based drug repositioning would be the rapid and near to accurate approach to screen the drugs against sars-cov-2 infectionbesides structural conservation it is important to understand inter-secondary elements and inter-residue contacts within the protein to unravel the mechanism of these proteases secondary structure topology indicates that proteins are asymmetrically populated by the beta-sheets at the n- terminus and helix at c- terminus figure 3a the chord plot between pairs of secondary structural elements arc of a circle displays the number of interactions chord thickness between the corresponding elements in mpro the contacts between the secondary structural elements indicated that the majority of contacts are present in the n-terminus beta-sheets which makes the juxtaposed beta barrels connected with the loop that harbors substrate binding sitewhereas c-terminus globular cluster of helix showed comparatively less number of contacts indicating the rigid nature of these helix cluster involved in the protease dimerization figure 3b inter-residue contact map showed that the population of inter-residue contact is far denser in the first 200 amino acids which consist of beta barrels having the catalytic role while c-terminus residues show less number of contacts suggesting the involvement of this part of the protein globular cluster of helices in a structural role figure 3c to validate the flexibility of the beta-barrels the normal mode simulation was performed to map the root means square fluctuations of the residues from its mean position structural trajectory and the fluctuation map indicate that most of the residues present in the beta barrels have fluctuation above 1  while the c-terminus is mostly rigid with very few residues having fluctuation above 1  figure 3d and 3e though the n-terminus show high fluctuations the active sites h41 and c145 showed very less variation which is important to maintain the required conformation of these residues in the substrate-binding pocketthe high frequency of inter secondary elements and residue contacts in the n terminus might provide structural flexibility for the proteolytic processing of large replicase polypeptide and they are potential sites to be targeted while designing or screening the inhibitors c li et al 2016screening of the custom made the library of 7100 molecules comprising of different types such as flavonoids glucosinolates anti-tussive anti-influenza anti-viral terpenes terpenoids alkaloids and other know andor predicated anti-sars-cov-2 molecules was done against sars-cov-2 mpro as the main target supplementary data 2 sequence similarity search of mpro against human protein sequences was performed which suggests that the viral proteases do not have any homolog in the human thus targeting mpro will be specific to viral proteases only docking analysis results demonstrated that several phytochemicals and anti-viral have strong binding in the active site of sars-cov-2 mpro the selected molecules also displayed a high binding affinity to sars-cov-2 rdrp and hace-2 supplementary data 3 likewise mpro other viral targets considered in this study rdrp also showed that there is no human homolog present thus could be a potential viral target with mpro top molecules with the highest binding energy and with acceptable absorption distribution metabolism and excretion adme criteria were further selected for interaction analysis figure 4 to validate our docking strategy and obtained outcomes we have used a set of known or predicted anti-sars-cov-2 molecules reported from the literature wu et al 2020 for further interaction analysis we have selected the molecules with a high binding score against all the targets also we have taken into account of earlier reports that support the antiviral properties of these molecules against different virusesas one of the symptoms of covid-19 is cough a library of ayurvedic anti-tussive molecules in indian medicine 82 molecules are screened against sars-cov-2 mpro the resulting top 20 molecules were further screened against other targets- rdrp and hace 2 receptors amongst these molecules -viniferin chrysanthemin myritilin and myricitrin showed strong binding with sars-cov-2 mpro the -viniferin and myricitrin showed high solubility and bioavailability in computational adme analysis thus analyzed for intermolecular interaction with sars-cov-2 mpro -viniferin exhibited binding energy of -84 kcalmol with several non-covalent interactions in the active site and substrate-binding site thr24 and his163 form polar contact with hydroxyl groups of -viniferin while active site residue his41 shows pi-pi interaction with the central aromatic scaffold of a ligand apart from this met165 is involved in pi-sulfur interaction with ligand and other residues from the substrate-binding pocket which are involved in either attractive van der waal interaction or carbon-hydrogen bond figure 5a in addition to mpro -viniferin appeared to have a strong binding with the sars-cov-2 rdrp and hace2 receptor with a score of -83 and -84 kcalmol respectively in the case of rdrp binding pocket residues ala762 trp800 ser814 showed hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl group of the ligand while active site and other key residues namely arg553 asp618 asp623 and asp761 display pi interactions with the aromatic scaffolds of -viniferinthe high density of these intermolecular non-covalent interactions is an indicator of strong and specific binding of -viniferin with rdrp active pocket furthermore hydroxyl and aromatic groups of -viniferin also interacts through polar contacts and pi-alkyl interaction with the glu35 leu39 lys68 and ala71 residues of hace-2 figure 5b and 6c the interaction of -viniferin with mpro rdrp and hace-2 suggests its high potential as a multi-target directed ligand against sars-cov-2 -viniferin is a resveratrol dimer a major stilbene produced by stressed grapevine leaves aresta et al 2003 it is also one of the major stilbenes present along with resveratrol in the red wine vitrac et al 2005 previous studies have also suggested that -viniferin shows potent antiviral activity against a variety of viruses viz rotavirus b yu et al 2018 human immunodeficiency virus hiv pflieger et al 2013 hepatitis c virus hcv lee et al 2019another anti-tussive molecule myricitrin found to have a strong binding with the active site residues of the mpro with a binding score of -89 kcalmol active site residues his41 and cys145 form pi-alkyl and pi-sulfur interactions with the aromatic scaffold of ligand respectively tyr54 phe140 gly143 his163 and glu166 are involved in the formation of 6 hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl and carboxyl oxygen of ligand apart from this there are other additional interactions like van der waals forces that stabilize the binding of the ligand to the enzyme figure 5d myricitrin exhibited equally strong interaction with rdrp and hace-2 with a binding score of -79 and -75 kcalmol respectively for rdrp the carboxyl group of myricitrin forms two hydrogen bonds with arg553 arg555 and thr556 while the active site residue asp623 is having pi-anion interaction with the aromatic rings of the ligand similarly this ligand binds to hace-2 by forming polar interaction with ala348 phe390 arg393 and asn394 this interaction is then further stabilized by pi-stacking of phe40 and pi-anion interactions of asp350 asp382 with aromatic rings of the ligand figure 5e and fmyricitrin is a glycosylated analog of myricetin present in the myrica esculenta although in our docking study myricetin has shown relatively lesser binding affinity when compared to myricitrin previous studies have shown that it possesses potent antiviral activity myricetin inhibited vp35 protein with double-stranded rna interaction in ebola virus daino et al 2018 the glycosylated myricetin ie myricitrin has been found to inhibit hiv ortega et al 2017 herpes simplex virus li et al 2020 sars coronavirus keum  jeong 2012 yu et al 2012together our results suggest that -viniferin and myricitrin could be potent molecules for the mitigation of sars-cov-2 interestingly top anti-tussive molecules in the present study mainly -viniferin chrysanthemin myritilin and myricitrin are present in the extract of black grapes which is one of the key ingredients of ayurvedic antitussive medicines and energy and immune booster chyawanprash georgiev et al 2014 thus these medicines could be helpful in the management and mitigation of covid-19 particularly the herbal formulation and beverages containing vitis vinifera might be helpful in the management of covid-19the tapping of natural molecule libraries to predict inhibitors of mpro showed that several active biomolecules from different medicinal plants have a strong affinity against sars-cov-2 mpro the flavonoid group of compounds showed a high binding score with all three targets suggesting this group of phytochemicals most bioactive against sars-cov-2 infection one of the molecules from this type taiwanhomoflavone a isolated from cephalotaxus wilsoniana showed a strong binding affinity with mpro -96 kcalmol in silico adme study indicated that this molecule possesses high bioavailability and likeliness to be the lead like compoundinteraction analysis depicted that reactive groups of taiwanhomoflavone a form of hydrogen bonds with thr199 and stabilizing forces are provided by electrostatic interaction with leu189 residue of mpro the bulkiness of this ligand leads to a large area of interaction that may lead to a higher contribution of attractive van der waals force between ligand and binding site residues figure 5g furthermore taiwanhomoflavone a also showed extremely strong binding with the rdrp and hace2 receptor with a binding score of  98 kcalmol and -78 kcalmol respectively the rdrp binding pocket residues lys621 and trp800 showed hydrogen bonds with the carboxyl group of the ligand while active site residues namely asp760 and asp761 form pi interactions with the aromatic groups of taiwanhomoflavone a in the case of hace-2 taiwanhomoflavone a makes polar contact with glu75 and pi interaction with glu35 figure 5h and i taiwanhomoflavone a has been explored for its anticarcinogenic anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic propertieskuo et al 2002 it would be interesting to consider this molecule further for anti-viral evaluation in vitro and in vivoin the terpenoids group lactucopicrin 15-oxolate a derivative of lactucin and oxalic acid showed higher interaction the lactucarium compounds are found in lactuca virosa wild lettuce and also in the latex of lactuca species the lactucopirin 15-oxolate has a binding energy of -82 kcalmol with mpro by the virtue of three hydrogen bonds to ser144 gly143 and cys145 of the active site it also showed a high binding affinity with rdrp and hace2 receptor with the binding score of -76 kcalmol and -83 kcalmol respectively figure 5j with rdrp lactucopirin 15-oxolate makes hydrogen bonds at arg553 arg555 and thr556 residues and it is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions of asp623 and thr687 figure 5k in the case of the hace2 receptor it forms three hydrogen bonds with residues ala99 tyr385 asn394 and pi-stacking interaction with phe40 figure 5l the lactucopicrin and lactucin are known for their anti-malarial activity bischoff et al 2004 based on the in silico adme studies the compound is found to be highly soluble bioavailable and high gi absorption criteria which can be utilized for further drug development against novel-sars-cov-2 apart from this biorobin pedunculagin afzelin hysperidin baicalin and other several molecules from alkaloid flavonoids and terpenoid that showed strong interaction with sars-cov-2 targets table 1 supplementary data 3 these findings highlight that the traditional medicines andor nutraceuticals along with synthetic drug molecules could be effective ways to tackle covid-19drug re-purposing is a strategy to investigate existing drugs for new uses the advantage of repurposing is that the drugs are preclinically approved and it helps in the formulation and development of the drug in ease in this case we have used the existing anti-influenza and anti-viral drugs to study the treatment strategy for the sars-cov-2 we screened 17 compounds and found a macrocyclic derivative nympholide a a phytochemical present in the aquatic plant of nymphaeaceae family elegami et al 2003 it showed the highest binding energy with mpro and rdrp with a score of -78 and -93 kcalmol respectively mpro residues met165 glu166 leu 167 have hydrogen bond interaction with the ligand in the case of rdrp residues lys551 arg553 lys798 tyr 619 side chains have strong hydrogen bonding with the ligand and glu811 makes the pi-anion interaction which improves the binding in rdrp compared to protease the hace2 receptor has fewer interacting residues as a result shows a weaker affinity to nympholide a supplementary figure 3 a-cin the case of antiviral compounds saquinavir has the highest binding energy with mpro -9 kcalmol rdrp and hace2 targets have a binding energy of -87 and -75 kcalmol respectively saquinavir aromatic scaffold makes pi-sulfur and pi-pi stacking interaction with the met49 and his41 residues of mpro these interactions help in strong binding to protease active site and further the interaction is

interaction with protease compared to rdrp and hace-2 stefanidou et al 2012 as there are other viral protease inhibitors like danoprevir ritonavir and lopinavir are being tested in clinical trials for potential treatment against sars-cov-2 it would be interesting to consider saquinavir for further studies cao et al 2020this study provides a comprehensive overview of the structural characteristics of the coronaviridea proteases and their potential inhibitors phylogenetic and ssn network analysis has illustrated the divergence in the proteases depending on their host reservoir suggesting the role of natural selection of host in conditioning the virus structural comparison depicted that the high structural similarities in the backbone and substrate binding pocket indicating conservation in the substrate specificities over different strains of coronavirus asymmetrical structural flexibility in the mpro might be crucial for its activity thus it can be targeted for inhibition the structural similarity in the binding pocket assisted the prediction of repositioning of known protease inhibitors as sars-cov-2 mpro several molecules were identified as of the potent sars-cov-2 mpro inhibitors like delta -viniferin myricitrin chrysanthemin myritilin taiwanhomoflavone a lactucopicrin 15-oxalate nympholide a afzelin biorobin herperidin and phyllaemblicin b these molecules also equally showed strong binding with other targets of sars-cov-2 like rdrp and hace-2 figure 6 interestingly most of the potential lead natural molecules of our study are anti-tussive and anti-virals thus we speculate that the herbal formulation containing these bioactive phytochemicals might be applicable in the management of covid-19 these molecules could be potential lead molecules for

systmes biovia discovery studio modeling environment release 2017 san diego dassault systmes 2016by far the largest mers-cov outbreak is in saudi arabia and almost all human cases have a direct or indirect link to arabian peninsula in this study we collected 74 human mers-cov whole genome sequences from 9 countries supplementary table 1 the geographic distribution of these samples is shown in supplementary fig 1a the majority of them are from the countries in arabian peninsula 784 5874 and more than half of them are from saudi arabia 649 4874 supplementary fig 1a the peak season for mers is between april 265 and may 250 supplementary fig 1bbased on the whole-genome alignment of our collected sequences supplementary table 1 we performed the phylogenetic analysis for these sequences with two sras-covs serving as the outgroup our phylogenetic tree shows that all camel and human mers-covs are clustered together the bat and hedgehog mers-covs formed a basal paraphyletic group to all camel and human mers-cov clade fig 1a a single camel mers-cov isolated in egypt gi 589588051 forms a single basal clade to human and the other camel mers-covs fig 1b the human-camel mers-cov cluster can be further divided into two cladesclade a and clade b as previously reported16 clade a contains four human strains isolated in jordan and saudi arabia while 70 human and 17 camel mers-covs are mixed in clade b there are five groups in clade b and we named them as group i to group v as the previous study15 there are 25 17 14 2 and 29 mers-cov sequences in group i to group v respectively fig 1bwe performed the recombination analysis on the collected full-length mers-cov sequences we find that there are 28 of them experienced potential recombination events 304 2892 including three camel mers-covs and 25 human mers-covs supplementary table 1 we divided 28 potential recombinant sequences into seven different types and named them as type 1 to type 7 fig 1bd supplementary table 1 type 1 means the recombination happened between group ii and group v which includes 3 sequences and is about 11 of total recombinant sequences type 2 means the recombination happened between group iii and group v which includes 6 sequences 22 interestingly the mers-covs newly found in 2015 in south korea and china are type 2 recombinants1523 type 3 means the recombination happened between group i and group iii which includes 2 sequences 7 type 4 5 and 6 are the recombination happened between different genomic regions of group iv and group v which include 7 4 and 4 sequences 25 14 and 14 respectively type 7 is the recombination happened among three groups group i iv and v which includes 2 sequences 7 our phylogenetic analysis showed type 1 belongs to phylogenetic group ii while type 2 and 3 belong to phylogenetic group iii and type 4 to 7 belong to phylogenetic group v there is no recombination found in phylogenetic group i and group iv fig 1b we also reconstructed the phylogenetic tree using non-recombinant sequences only and found that its topology is consistent with the tree based on all sequences supplementary fig 2 we also performed the snp single-nucleotide polymorphisms analyses for each recombinant types and found the large recombination segments in type 2 4 6 7 are conspicuous but in type 1 3 5 are obscure supplementary fig 3in order to explore the selection pressure on the mers-cov proteins when it transmitted from animal host to human we performed the adaptive evolution analyses for all mers-cov protein in absence of recombinant strains firstly we set camel and human mers-covs as the foreground branch and bat and hedgehog mers-covs as the background branch to preform branch-site test in codeml of paml program see fig 1a the strong positive selection is detected in spike s glycoprotein between these two branches p  0001 while there is no significant positive selection in the other mers-cov genes table 1 we find nine positive selection sites in mers-cov spike s glycoprotein and eight of them are statistically significant table 1 six significant positive selection sites are located in the receptor binding domain of s protein fig 2a we utilized a published crystal structure pdb id 4l72 in rcsb protein data bank the receptor binding domain rbd aa 367-606 fig 2b of mers-cov spike glycoprotein complexed with the human receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ddp4 to demonstrate their locations in a 3d environment fig 2b the receptor binding domain of mers-cov s protein can be further divided into a receptor-binding sub-domain and a core sub-domain two significant positive selection sites k511r and g521n are in the receptor-binding sub-domain and k511r is in direct contact with human receptor ddp4 q419s g436n d472s and r479l are in the core sub-domain moreover we also detected a positive selection site in s proteins c-terminal l775s secondly we screened the positive selection sites among human-camel mers-covs table 2 five significant positive selection sites are found in orf 8b m protein n protein and s protein table 2 two of them are located in n proteins and one of them are located in m s or open reading frame 8b orf8b respectivelythe mers-cov genome contains 11 open reading frames supplementary fig 1c the nucleotide substitution rate of each open reading frame and the whole-genome sequence was estimated for camel and human mers-covs table 3 the genome-wide average nucleotide substitution rate of camel and human mers-covs was 481  104 substitutions per site per year open reading frame 3 orf3 has the fastest substitution rate while orf5 has the slowest substitution rate the orf4b nucleocapsid n glycoprotein and spike s glycoprotein have a similar substitution rate which is faster than the whole-genome substitution ratein order to study the temporal and spatial pattern of mers-cov transmission a maximum clade credibility mcc tree was constructed using mers-cov whole genome sequences without recombinant strains fig 3c the ancestral host state with time reference was estimated for each tree node and marked with different colors we named six important nodes in mers-cov divergence on mcc tree for node a to f fig 3c the possible transmission time for each node and its 95 highest posterior density hpd are shown in fig 3b we found that the origin time of human-camel mers-cov is relatively late node d furthermore the tmrca for clade b is in 2012 fig 3b node f and clade a and clade b are divergent in 2011 fig 3b node e interestingly the mcc tree shows that there are six cross-species transmission events with high posterior probabilities in clade b five of them are human-to-camel transmission events and one of them are camel-to-human transmission events fig 3c additionally with the mers-cov of humancamel and bathedgehog mers-cov together we inferred the ancient mers-cov exists for decades of years fig 3bc the tmrca of the mers-covs for vespertilio superans neoromicia capensis or erinaceus europaeus can be traced back to 2006 node c 2003 node b and 1996 node a respectively before the emergence of human-camel mers-cov the estimated tmrca for all mers-covs appeared in 1996 fig 2c node a we also preformed root-to-tip analysis using the consistent dataset fig 3a and the result shows that the origin time of tmrca is in 1995 with high statistical supports r2  0874 p value  0001 together these results suggest that the ancient mers-cov should have existed for decades in animal host and got the ability to infect human or camel recentlymers-cov belongs to coronavirus beta-coronavirus lineage c since it was discovered in 2012 mers-cov has attracted extensive attention due to its human-to-human infection capability and high mortality rate recombination events have been confirmed in human mers-cov23 the fact that mers-cov can be found in multiple species proposes its cross-species transmissibility456711 by far the evolutionary details of how mers-cov transmitted to human are still unknown based on the most comprehensive collection of mers-cov genome sequences so far we tried to elucidate the evolution and transmission of mers-cov among different speciesmers-cov has been reported in five species including european hedgehog two species of bats dromedary camel and human we used the ml method to reconstruct the whole-genome phylogenetic tree of mers-covs isolated from these species the ml tree shows that the hedgehog mers-covs are basal to all the other mers-covs and two bat mers-covs are basal to camel and human mers-covs this result suggests that the ancestor of camel and human mers-covs may be from other animal host such as the hedgehog or bat we also reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of mers-cov using nj method or based on each mers-cov protein these trees show a consistent topology which proposes that the phylogenetic relationship estimated in our study is credible supplementary fig 5we divided clade b into five groups as pervious study to detect the recombination of mers-cov15 because the evolutionary distances among mers-covs are close table 3 no large segment recombination could be detected among them thus according to discontinuous recombination segments we defined potential recombination events in mers-covs this method has been used in the previous study to label potential recombination event24 in our study we found 28 strains form seven recombinant types which took more than 30 of all isolated mers-covs in human and camel among them we found 26 strains in six recombinant types type 1 to type 6 between two phylogenetic groups and two strains in one type type 7 among three phylogenetic groups for now the recombination of mers-cov was confirmed in previous study but no report about the recombination among more than two groups of mers-cov interestingly most recombinant types type 1 2 4 5 6 and 7 are related to group v and they make up 929 of total recombinant strains 2628 the result suggests that recombination events might happen frequently and the recombinant types involving group v might happen broadly additionally multiple recombination events indicate that double infection and super infection likely existed during the transmission history of mers-cov we failed to detect possible large recombination segments in type 1 3 and 5 by comparing the snps single-nucleotide polymorphisms of reference sequences with recombinant sequences we reckoned that specific nucleotide mutation might influence the results of recombination analysis this problem can be solved by discovering more mers-cov sequences or developing more detailed genotype classification for mers-covs in the future we also performed phylogenetic analyses for potential recombinant region and got similar results supplementary fig 3interestingly the east asian mers-cov strains china and south korea belong to type 2 recombinant and the previous study show that their tmrca might be a result of potential recombination event23 which indicates the recombinant strains have transmitted broadly moreover one recombinant mers-cov lineage has led to the large-scale outbreak in both camel and human26 it proposes that recombinant mers-covs have experienced cross-species infection additionally our study reveals that the number of recombinant strains is large and the potential recombinant types are abundant together these findings highlight that we should take more attention to recombinant mers-cov transmissionalthough how the mers-cov transmitted from its natural host to human is still unknown it is confirmed the mers-cov have been found in many animal hosts such as bats and hedgehog to study the evolutionary pressure on each mers-covs protein during its potential cross-species transmission we conducted a comprehensive scan for positive selection sites in mers-covs proteins recombinant strains were excluded in this analysis we set camel-human mers-covs as the foreground branch and hedgehog-bat mers-cov as the background branch and estimated the relative evolutionary pressure on the foreground branch compared to the background branch we only found that mers-covs s protein underwent strong positive selection and there are nine significant positive selection sites in s protein it suggests that s protein was under strong evolutionary pressure during the transmission from its natural host to human among significant positive selection sites six of them are located in s proteins receptor binding domain rbd rbd is crucial for virus to enter host cells and it comprises of one binding region and one core region based on the rbds 3d model we find that two sites are located in the binding region of rbd which suggests that these amino acid substitutions might change mers-covs binding capability to host cells and thus facilitate its cross-species transmission the other four sites are located in the core region of rbd these amino acid substitutions might change the structure of core region and indirectly influence mers-covs cross-species capability in order to eliminate the sample bias between humancamel group and bathedgehog group we also did random sampling for the 68 non-recombinant human and camel sequences we tried 10 20 and 50 random sampling respectively using random sampled sequences together with bat and hedgehog mers-cov sequences we performed branch-site analyses and got the same results as our aforementioned data not showwe also estimated the nucleotide substitution rates of camel-human mers-covs to investigate its evolutionary dynamics after it infected camel and human our estimated nucleotide substitution rate for mers-covs whole genome is 481  104 which is slower than the previous estimation9 one explanation for the phenomenon is that we used a larger dataset than the previous study which includes all available mers-cov whole genome sequences our estimated confidence interval of the substitution rate of mers-cov genome is largely overlapped with the result from another study16 the estimated nucleotide substitution rates show that four proteins experienced the accelerated evolutionthrough evolutionary pressure analysis we found camel-human mers-covs four proteins underwent positive selection and detected five significant positive selection sites one of them is located in m proteins there is evidence that m proteins are powerful interferon antagonist26 which proposes that the evolutionary pressure on m proteins are from hosts immune system two out of five significant sites are found in n protein which is fundamental for mers-cov self-assembly coronavirus n protein is able to bind to different host cell proteins and demonstrated to have various functions one of which is also counteracting host interferon as shown in sars-cov27282930 it is reasonable to speculate that mers-cov n protein under intensive selection because its functions were similar to those of sars-cov n protein the results above suggest that the arm race between mers-cov proteins and hosts immune system might be the main evolutionary driving force behind mers-covs adaptive evolution after it began to infect camel and human mers-cov spike s glycoprotein evolves slightly faster than the genome-wide average rate which indicates that the nucleotide substitution rate of mers-cov s protein still maintains a fast speed even after it crossed the species boundary the positive selection site we found in mers-cov s protein with site-specific test is identical to the previous studys result3 this site is located in heptad repeats 1 which is a key component in membrane fusion architecture and required for mers-cov entering host cells31in absence of recombinant strains we performed the mcc analysis using mers-cov whole-genome sequences in order to infer the time and source species when mers-cov crossed the species boundary the topology of the mcc tree is highly congruent with that of the whole-genome phylogenetic tree we defined six nodes af to explain transmission the posterior probability for the ancestral sate of node a b or c is not very high in our mcc analysis and the 95 highest posterior density hpd of the divergence time for these three nodes is quite long so these results are weak for demonstrating the exact origin time or ancestor state of mers-cov however these estimations still provided the evidence that the ancestor mers-cov should have been infected a number of animal hosts such as bat or hedgehog for decades of years supplementary fig 4 the x-intercept tmrca in root-to-tip is 1995 with high statistical supports which is close to the estimated time of tmrca in mcc analysis this hypothesis is in agreement with the result of serological studies23 the appearance of the common ancestor of human-camel mers-cov is in 2010 and the appearance of the tmrca of clade a and b is in 2011 which are exactly the same as the previous report16 in clade b we detected five possible human-to-camel transmission events and one camel-to-human transmission event it suggests that mers-cov frequently transmitted back and forth between human and camel after it acquired the capability of infecting both hosts actually there is at least one confirmed case of camel-to-human mers-cov transmission32in conclusion we found that potential recombination events are common in mers-covs evolutionary history and potential recombinant mers-covs can be divided into seven types the amino acid sites under positive selection in mers-cov s protein especially those in its receptor binding domain might have facilitated its cross-species transmission from animal host to human we detected the strong positive selection in four proteins of camel-human mers-covs which indicates that they probably experienced strong adaptive evolutionary pressure from hosts immune system additionally we also found six possible cross-species transmission cases between human and camel our study investigated the evolutionary dynamics of mers-cov which shall provide a basis for mers-cov control and treatmentthe complete genomic nucleotide sequences of 91 mers-covs and two sars-covs were downloaded from ncbi nucleotide database among 91 mers-cov genomic sequences 68 of them are from human 18 of them are from dromedary came two of them from two bat species neoromicia capensis and vespertilio superans and 3 of them are from european hedgehog erinaceus europaeus two sars-cov genomic sequences are from human and bat rhinolophus ferrumequinum respectively we used sequences

clustalw and mafft used to validate the muscle result3435 alignments were refined manually in bioedit httpwwwmbioncsuedubioeditbioedithtml only unambiguously aligned positions were used for subsequent phylogenetic analyses supplementary files we used the jmodeltest 31 to estimate the best nucleotide substitution model for our alignment36 which is gtrig we used the phyml 31 to perform the phylogenetic analysis for 93 collected genomic sequences based on their genomic sequence alignment37 the branch support values were calculated with shimodaira-hasegawa test integrated in phymlin clade

sequence in clade b was used as the query to detect the possible recombination using simplot software25 the window is set to 200 bp and the step is set to 20 bpwe extracted the coding region of each mers-cov protein using mers-cov 453061240 strain as a reference template the codeml program implemented in paml 47 package was used to detect the positive selection in the codon alignment of each mers-cov protein set38 in the branch-site model the group of human-camel mers-covs was set to be foreground the group of bat-hedgehog mers-covs was set to be background and model a with estimated  value was compared with the null model model a with fixed  value to reduce the bias from sample size we performed random sampling on 68 human and camel mers-covs clade a and b which are all non-recombinant sequences we used 10 20 and 50 as the random sample size with and without replacement the random sampled sequences together with bat and hedgehog mers-covs were used to generate the datasets for branch-site model analysis as aforementioned method script see supplementary files moreover for each random sample size we repeatedly drew five times in order to make results robustwe also used the site-specific model to detect positive selection in the human-camel clade the site-specific model was performed by comparing the models m2a positive selection and m8 beta   vs the null models m1a nearly neutral and m7 beta respectively evolutionary distance of each protein was estimated using mega 639the crystal structure of the receptor binding domain rbd of mers-cov spike s

 five and four of these six residues differ between sarscov 2 vs ratg13 and pangolincov respectively whereas a pangolincov project id prjna573298 had 100 66 residues similar to sarscov2 suggesting there are differences among pangolincov and 50 36 similarity were seen between ratg13 and pangolincov figure 2a another notable feature of sarscov2 is a prra insertion compared to ratg13 and only prr to pangolincov in a polybasic cleavage site this polybasic cleavage site in s2 glycoprotein 681to 684 has a role in determining viral infectivity and host range the functional consequence of the polybasic cleavage site in sarscov2 is unknown and it will be important to determine its impact on transmissibility and pathogenesis in animal models besides olinked glycans to s673 t678 and s686 which side the cleavage site of sarscov2 and compared to ratg13 and pangolincov only serine ser in pangolin and both threonine thr and serine ser olinked glycans were seen in ratg13 between the olinked glycans pangolin had varied aa sequences compared to ratg13 figure 2b and the structural difference of ace2 contact residues and olinked glycan among sarscov are shown in table 1cov are enveloped have a nonsegmented positivesense rna genome ranging from 26 to 32kilo bases in length

 and divided into four genera including  evolutionary analyses have shown that bats civet camel murine canine bovine equine and rodents are the gene sources of most cov and cov whileavian species whale and porcine are the gene sources of most cov and cov

 before december 2019 6 cov were described to be pathogenic to humans
23
 in this study for the first time we have constructed the phylogenetic tree with all the species of the cov and current outbreak of sarscov2 seventh human cov infection belong to cov lineage bthe earliest genomic characterization of sarscov2 strains in wuhan had 88 to 89 nucleotide identity with batslcov batslcovzc45 and batslcovzxc21 79 to 89 nucleotide identity with human sarscov and more distant from merscov 50

 although the sarscov2 epidemic was linked to the wuhan seafood market huang et al
26
 reported a total of 41 patients and 14 cases are not related to the seafood market and no trace of bats has been found so exact place of origin need to be studied in detail
26
 subsequently zhou et al

 from wuhan institute of virology zheng li shi lab showed that sarscov2 was highly similar throughout the genome to ratg13 with an overall genome sequence identity of 962 and 931 nucleotide identity to s protein also the author did not mention when it has been sequenced and rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp data not shown to compare sarscov2

 ratg13 was isolated from the bat rhinolophus affinis on 24 july 2013 by zheng li shi group and the reason unclear why they did not submit the sequence before instead on 27 january 2020 although it is proximal to batslcov accession number avp780421 avp780311 and acu310511 figure s3 sarscov rs8062006 accession number acu310511 already has proven for intraspecies diversity and its implications for the origin of sars coronaviruses in humans
27
 hence the detailed investigation needed for ratg13 isolate and origin scientists report genetic sequences of viruses isolated from pangolins are 99 similar to that of the covid19 strains

28
 lam et al identified two sublineages of sarscov2related cov in malayan pangolin one that exhibits strong similarity to sarscov2 in the rbd
29
 zhang et al assembled a draft genome of the sarscov2 using the metagenomic samples from the lung of manis javanica showing an overall coverage of 73 of covid19 strains with 91 sequence identity
30
 however li et al
31
 concluded that the human sarscov2 virus did not come directly from pangolins based on a unique peptide prra insertion seen in the human sarscov2 virus and not in pangolins carried cov
32
 also a study demonstrated sarscov2 is not a purposefully manipulated virus based on highaffinity binding to human ace2 polybasic cleavage site and the three adjacent predicted olinked glycans are unique to sarscov2 and were not previously seen in lineage b cov
11
 hence we compared ratg13 and pangolincov with sarscov2 for an update and betterment of understandingrbd of s protein in sarscov2 binds strongly to human pangolin and bat angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors

33
 
34
 studies have confirmed that s protein in the sarscov2 uses the ace2 found in the lower respiratory tract of humans

 and other certain species pangolin civet swine cow buffalo goat cat sheep and pigeon as cellular entry receptor

36
 liu et al
37
 indicated that other than pangolins and snakes turtles may act as the potential intermediate hosts transmitting sarscov2 to humans based on the key amino acid interaction between rbd and ace2 choudhury et al
38
 showed sarscov2 is close to batcov strongly binds with ace2 receptor protein from both human and bat origin and tlr4 is most likely to be involved in recognizing molecular patterns from sarscov2 to induce inflammatory responses li et al
39
 demonstrated that sarscov2s entire rbm was introduced through recombination with cov from pangolins possibly a critical step in the evolution of sarscov2s ability to infect humans a study data support the natural origin of sarscov2 likely derived from bats possibly transferred to pangolins before spreading to man and it not artificial cov including the chimeric slshc014ma15
40
 the study proposes a unique cleavage motif promoting sarscov2 infection in humans may be under strong selective pressure given that replication in permissive veroe6 cells leads to the loss of this adaptive function
41
 overall we demonstrate the key residues of rbd 455 486 493 494 501 and 505 and polybasic cleavage sites varies significantly need to be studied in detail for a better understanding of crossspecies transmission pubmed search results showed only three bat rhinolophus affinis and five pangolin cov sequences were available and more cov isolation need to verify the origin of ratg13although ratg13 and pangolinderived cov is very proximal to sarscov2 the key receptor binding and olinked glycan residues vary significantly except a malayan pangolin prjna573298 isolate has 100 identity the polybasic cleavage site prra insertion was absent in ratg13 and pangolin prjna573298 whereas it is only prr in other pangolin isolates with unique amino acid changes within thus animal study isolation of cov from pangolin manis javanica and bat rhinolophus affinis is necessary to help in the understanding of sarscov2 origin and intermediate transmissionthe authors declare that there are no conflict of interestsjm contributed to the conceptualization study design critical review of the content and approved the final version of the manuscript sa contributed to study design data analysis and approved the final version of the manuscript km contributed to data analysis and approved the final version of the manuscript ggr contributed to data analysis and approved the final version of the manuscriptthe aa sequences of ace2s of homo sapiens human rhinolophus sinicus chinese horseshoe bat paguma larvata civet sus scrofa swine and mus musculus mouse were downloaded from uniprot knowledgebase the rest of 248 vertebrate species were downloaded from genbank file s1 multiple sequence alignment was performed for the whole aa sequences of aces using mafft with a local alignment strategy fft-ns-2 the phylogenetic tree was constructed by mega7 using the neighbour-joining nj method with 1000 bootstrap replicates and visualized using figtreethe critical aa sites for the utilization by sars-cov-2 were selected by picking the unique aa residues in mouse ace2 which distinct from human ace2 and the sites reported to be critical for the receptor binding of sars-cov in the previous study 14 the initial mark for every ace2 was 100 and the substitution on each critical sites resulted in a reduction of its mark of 50 for substitutions reported to abolish the receptor binding of sars-cov or 10 for other substitutions the utilizing capability by sars-cov-2 of the ace2s were ranked by the final scores and ace2s with scores 50 were considered to be potentially utilized by sars-cov-2to evaluate the homology of ace2s in different species we built a phylogenetic tree haboring ace2s of 253 vertebrate species fig s1 the tree was branched to two major groups the first group included the classes of mammalia aves and reprilia and the second group included the classes of amphibian chondrichthyes and teleostomi this tree indicated that besides mammalia ace2s of aves and reprilia were more likely to be utilized by sars-cov-2 than other vertebrates as shown in fig 1
 among mammals human ace2 was clustered with bat civet and swine ace2s but not mouse ace2 matching the previous report about the utilizing capability by sars-cov-2 of these ace2s intriguingly cat pangolin cow and goat ace2s were also clustered with human ace2 considering the widespread of stray cats wildlife markets and stock farms it was not strange that these animals could serve as potential intermediate hosts of sars-cov-2 indeed it was reported in the local news that sars-cov-2 was detected in pangolins though further verification is requiredwe further tried to predict the receptor utilizing capability by sars-cov-2 via looking into the critical single aa polymorphism in different ace2s we screened the aa sites critical for sars-cov-2 utilization by two approaches first it has been proved that human chinese horseshoe bats civet and swine ace2s can be utilized by sars-cov-2 but mouse ace2 cannot 6 we aligned the aa sequence of these five ace2s file s2 eleven aa residues distinct in mouse ace2 but conserved in other ace2s were identified which were t20 y83 s218 a246 k353 p426 t593 n636 a714 r716 and a774 however according to the complex structure of human ace2 and the receptor binding domain rbd in sars-cov-2 s protein pdb id 6vw1 only three of the eleven sites are located near the interface and potentially mediate the binding which were t20 y83 and k353 fig 2
a second sars-cov-2 shares an identity of 746 with sars-cov in the aa sequences of their rbds and thus the aa residues critical for the receptor binding of sars-cov may be also critical for sars-cov-2 according to the previous study such critical sites include k31 y41 k68 y83 k353 d355 r357 and m383 14 among these sites k31d y41a y83f k353 had d355a and r357a abolish or strongly inhibit sars-cov binding while the substitutions on k68 and m383 slightly inhibit sars-cov binding 1415 combining the two screening we got nine critical aa sites as shown in fig 2b based on these sites we established a marking system to evaluate the utilizing capability by sars-cov-2 of different ace2s in the system the initial score for every ace2 was 100 and substitution on the critical sites would result in reduction of 50 marks for k31d y41a y83f k353 had d355a and r357a or 10 marks for other substitutions k31t and y41h would not reduce the scores since these two substitutions exist in civet and chinese horseshoe bat ace2s respectively fig 2b a final score less than 0 was adjusted to 0 as the result a final score equal to or less than 50 means that the ace2 contains either at least one substitution that will abolish the receptor binding or at least five other substitutions that will make it quite different from human ace2 therefore the ace2s with final scores higher than 50 were considered to be potentially utilized by sars-cov-2 while those with scores less or equal to 50 were unlikely to be utilized by sars-cov-2 the final scores for all ace2s we analysed were listed in table s1 as shown in table 1
 excluding the animals unlikely contacted by people pangolin cat cow buffalo goat and sheep ace2 were ranked as the top mammals that could be potentially used by sars-cov-2 while murine ace2s such as mouse and rat ace2s got the lowest scores as for birds pigeon ace2 reached the highest score of 70 table 1 though birds are not natural reserviors for currently know species of betacoronavirus the classification of coronaviruses is based on the genome feature not the host range and thus we could not exclude the possibility that new betacoronavirus may infect birds considering pigeons are food in many places around the world more attention should be paid on the non-mammalian hosts of sars-cov-2 ace2 of protobothrops mucrosquamatus pallas pit viper a common snake got a score of 20 indicating that reprilia ace2s were unlikely to be utilized by sars-cov-2 to verify the robustness of our ranking system we labelled the utilizing capability of different ace2s on the phylogenetic tree and found that the ace2s confirmed or potential to be utilized by sars-cov-2 labelled with circles were obviously clustered from those unlikely to be utilized by sars-cov-2 labelled with triangles fig 1 the well matching with the phylogenetic tree elevated the liability of this marking systemin summary we combined phylogenetic analysis and critical site marking to predict the utilizing capability of ace2s from different animal species by sars-cov-2 the results from these two analysis matched each other quite well indicating relative reliability of our prediction we have shown that besides currently confirmed ace2s utilized by sars-cov-2 pangolin cat cow buffalo goat sheep and pigeon ace2s might be utilized by sars-cov-2 indicating potential interspecies transmission of the virus from bats to these animals and among these animals considering the widespread existing of these animals some of them might serve as intermediate hosts for sars-cov-2 which called for the attention in disease control however these are still preliminary results predicted by sequence analysis which cannot accurately reflect the infection in the animals and more laboratory and epidemiological investigation are required to uncover the true intermediate hosts of sars-cov-2the authors declare no competing intereststhe 21st century is witnessing a 3rd outbreak of zoonosis 1 associated with a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 in this case similar to its predecessors the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 23 infection with sars-cov-2 officially named covid-19 by the world health organization on february 11 2020 can manifest as bronchitis pneumonia or a severe respiratory illnessinterestingly these novel human coronaviruses hcovs emerged 810 years apart sars-cov emerged in china in november 2003 where the pandemic infected more than 8096 people resulting in 774 deaths who 2002 the pandemic warning was removed by the world health organization who in 2004 and there was no evidence of new cases of infection in humans thereafter approximately eight years later in 2012 a new coronavirus mers-cov surfaced in saudi arabia 3 and periodic outbreaks of mers-cov are still a matter of immense concern for global health security a total of 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases have been documented to date resulting in 858 deaths spanning 27 countries overall saudi arabia has led in the number of infections with 2102 confirmed cases and 780 deaths 5similar to many other covs mers-cov has a very large rna genome of approximately 30 kb including the 5 and 3 utrs which encodes three broad protein classes 67 several structural and non-structural proteins are encoded within the intact virion the structural proteins include the spike s protein nucleocapsid n protein envelope e protein and membrane m protein the two main polyproteins pp1ab and pp1a encoded by orf1ab are cleaved into 1516 different non-structural proteins 67 together they form the replicase complex which is essential for polyprotein processing and efficient virus replication mers-cov encodes accessory proteins including orf 3 orf 4a orf4b and orf 5 67 similar to many other coronaviruses the exact roles and precise locations of the accessory proteins of mers-cov are not quite clear however it has been suggested that these proteins influence viral replication pathogenesis and disease outcomes as observed in sars-cov and other coronaviruses 8the entry of mers-cov into human cells is facilitated by a heavily glycosylated type i transmembrane protein s that binds to the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 protein a receptor on host cells 9 there is a strong consensus that dromedary camels camelus dromedarius are the primary source of the transmission of mers-cov to humans 10 whether camels serve as mixing vessels for the emergence of variant mers-cov strains warrants further investigation 11 a low mutation rate has been demonstrated in mers strains isolated from humans which is attributed to the low level of immunological pressure exerted on this coronavirus in humans 12 a high frequency of mutations and recombinant events is observed in mers-cov strains isolated from camels 13 sporadic cases of mers-cov are in continuous circulation in saudi arabia and the currently available epidemiological data cannot explain the changing epidemiology of the virusin this study we obtained complete genome sequences of mers-cov from eight individuals from the riyadh region in saudi arabia we carried out molecular epidemiology analysis to investigate their epidemiological connection with one another and with past strains an in-depth genetic analysis was performed to construct an

table 1
presents the baseline and clinical characteristics of the 8 studied patients infected with mers-cov the mean age of the patients was 57 years and they included 6 males and 2 females most of the patients had a history of hypertension and 4 of the 8 had diabetes all these patients were admitted to the intensive care unit icu of kamc mng-ha and 4 of the patients diedthe evolutionary relationships of these newly sequenced saudi mers-cov isolates were assessed in combination with the globally isolated sequences available in the genbank database fig 1 fig 2
 seven of these isolates were assembled with lineage b3 while one strain belonged to the lineage b4 sequences in the complete genome phylogenetic analysis fig 1 all the studied isolates were closely related to previous strains from riyadh isolated during 20152017 two of the 2019 strains and one 2017 strain specifically exhibited longer branch lengths due to a large number of substitutions the only lineage b4 strain mh013216 appeared in the complete genome tree together with a recombinant strain from jeddah isolated from a camel in the subgenomic phylogenetic analysis all b3 strains remained in the same clade fig 2a 2b 2c whereas the b4 strains resembled the b2 strains more closely in the orf1a gene phylogeny fig 2a further analysis using the simplot program 16 confirmed that mh013216 is a complex recombinant strain with contributions from multiple lineages of mers-cov fig 3
 the close similarity of mh013216 with b4 sequences was mainly located between nucleotides 16500 and 24000 in orf1 however the strain sequence matched parts of a2 b1 b2 and b3 the assembly of the strain within b2 occurred because of similar nucleotides at certain sites within lineages and an exclusive b2-like arrangement between nucleotides 12000 and 12500 fig 3we compared the deduced amino acid sequences of the studied isolates with the reference jx869059 emc2012 and searched for amino acid substitutions in mers-cov proteins that are probably associated with disease severity or transmissibility in humans we were astounded to note a variety of unique mutations not detailed previously in mers-covthe majority of these mutations were found in orf1ab 41 unique mutations followed by the n protein 10 mutations the s protein 9 mutations and orf4b 5 mutations supplement table 2a and supplement table 2b in the orf1ab replicase mutations were quite evident in nsp3 n  17 putative papain-like protease plpro nsp12 n  9 putative rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp nsp13 n  6 putative helicase hel and nsp14 n  6 putative exonuclease exon random mutations were also found in nsp4 and nsp6 putative hydrophobic regions nsp16 putative s-adenosylmethionine-dependent 2-o-ribose methyltransferase and nsp1 and nsp2 proteins of unknown functioncharacteristic nsp3 plpro amino acid substitutions were observed at positions g981s p1099r and k1255r in 58 isolates and v1375i and m2119i in 48 isolates similarly an nsp13 hel substitution at position v5551a and annsp14 exon substitution at position v6030 f were present in 58 isolates supplement table 2athe s protein of mers-cov is a heavily glycosylated type 1 transmembrane protein found on the surface of the virus forming spikes consisting of receptor-binding subunit s1 and membrane fusion subunit s2 7 the noteworthy substitutions in the receptor-binding domain rbd of the s1 subunit were t424i in 28 isolates and s459 t in 18 isolates another substitution w553r was found in the overlapping rbdrbm receptor binding motif region in 28 isolates the s2 subunit substitutions included s950 t in the fusion peptide q1009 l in hepatad repeat region 1 hr1 and c1313s in the transmembrane tm region supplement table 2bn proteins are essential for the packaging of viral rna into viable virus-like particles the characteristic substitutions included v178a in the n-terminal domain ntd present in 68 isolates and a300 v in the c-terminal domain ctd present in all studied isolates table 2
other ctd amino acid substitutions observed were l293 f present in 28 isolates and v263a r292 p and w293c present in one isolate each the substitutions in the linker region lkr of the n protein include g198s which was present in 28 isolates and d242e which was present in one isolate the n arm of the n protein included s11 f which was present in 28 isolates and p7l and g28 v which were present in one isolate each the c-tail of the n protein also contained a single amino acid substitution s391i supplement table 2bsimilar to other lineage c betacoronaviruses mers-cov encodes five unique accessory proteins designated 3 4a 4b 5 and 8b 7 we found a two-amino acid substitutions in orf3 encoding a protein of unknown function which was g85dp86 f in 38 isolates and the single-amino acid substitutions v62 f in 28 isolates and t87 n in one isolate the orf4a 4b and m proteins have recently been found to antagonize type i inf productionfour of the studied isolates exhibited the orf4a substitution e102q the substitutions observed in orf4b were h73 n and a218s in 28 isolates and v51i i147 l and h243q in 1 isolate each two of the isolates exhibited an amino acid substitution in the m protein t127i while one isolate exhibited a mutation in orf5 i98 m supplement table 2bsporadic cases of mers-cov continue to occur in middle eastern regions including saudi arabia in this study we conducted sequencing to determine the genome sequences of 8 mers-cov isolates we performed evolutionary and genomic analyses to address several among many unanswered questions related to persistent mers-cov infectionwe found a number of genomic variations in the crucial regions of mers-cov including the replicationtranscription complex rtc the nucleocapsid protein n the surface protein s and orf4a and orf44b involved in the host-mediated immune response we identified a genomic recombinant isolate exhibiting characteristic substitutions representing almost all the group a and b mers-cov strains phylogenetic analysis resulted in the assembly of 78 sequences into 3 subclusters within lineage 3 of group b mers-cov the longer branch lengths of these strains from the common node of their closest relatives in the phylogenetic tree were notable new isolates were detected within a period of 6 9 or 12 months after the detection of their closest relatives one possible explanation for the longer branch length observed is the large number of substitutions found in these isolates and another that we missed or could not detect were their close relatives during that period homology searches did not reveal any specific relatedness of mers-cov variants with sars-cov or mers-cov-2 in agreement with recently reported studies 121the recombination frequency in coronaviruses is quite high and recombination is known to occur due to the exchange of functional motifs or even entire genes 17 some previous reports have also suggested the occurrence of recombination in association with host switching in many coronaviruses 18 19 20 the mh013216 strain showed complex genomic recombination including a major portion of the genome resembling strains of lineage 4 however it harboured lineage-specific residues of both groups a and b of mers-cov this strain was assembled within lineage 2 of the group b mers-cov strains in the subgenomic phylogenetic analysis of orf1athe mers-cov 30 kb genome encodes structural proteins accessory proteins and two orfs orf1a and orf1b from which two large polyproteins are translated and subsequently processed by the viral proteinase into nonstructural proteins nsp that together form rtcs 7 the synthesis of genomic rna grna and subgenomic messenger rnas sgmrna occurs at rtcs 8 involving interaction with the n protein 2223 amino acid substitutions in the nsp proteins as well as the n protein are therefore crucial in the cov life cycle in fact yeast two-hybrid y2h assays of mouse hepatitis virus mhv and sars-cov revealed that nsp3 is the main rtc component that interacts with the n protein 2425 the direct interaction of the n protein with rtcs is considered critical as impairment of this interaction greatly reduces cov replication and progeny production 24we found amino acid substitutions in the nsp3 helicase nsp13 an important enzyme for viral tropism and virulence rdrp nsp12 and exoribonuclease nsp14 proteins how these proteins either individually or together interact with the n protein in viral replication sgmrna production and translation warrants functional studies most of the adaptive events in mers-cov in humans and camels 26 are now thought to occur through nsp3 via its deubiquitination and de-esterification activity to inhibit the ifn response 27irrespective of the cov strain involved accessory orfs have been implicated in the context of infection specifically in the antagonization of the host response 2829 mers-cov orf4a suppresses ifn production by binding to dsrna 28 and the 4b gene product is reportedly associated with the evasion of host cell ifn defence mechanisms 3031 amino acid substitutions in these proteins may impact the host immune response to the disease and ultimately its pathogenesis the variant strains may have acquired high pathogenicity but intense surveillance studies will be required to elucidate how this will be reflected in viral spreading and persistence in the futuresimilar to other coronaviruses the mers-cov spike protein s is highly exposed to the virus surface and is the first line of contact in virus infection and the host immune response amino acid substitutions in the rbdrbm region that play any role in virus binding to host dpp4 need to be investigated the heptad repeat region hr1 has recently been reported to be a major selection target among mers-covs for their interspecies jump and spread to humans one of the studied isolates presented the hr1 substitution q1009l and a nearby amino acid substitution t1015 n has been implicated in an increased mers-cov infection efficiency in vitro 32although camels are thought to be the primary zoonotic reservoir responsible for human transmission there is some evidence that bats might be the ancestral reservoir host for mers-cov 17 direct contact with dromedary camels or camel products has been reported in only 55  of primary mers-cov cases and the contact history in the remaining cases is unknown 33 this study has some limitations as we do not have samples from camels or other domestic and wild animals to confirm the possible contact history of the disease in our patientswe identified novel point mutations and mutation complexes indicating a changing epidemiology of mers-cov potentially raising the alarm regarding new viral outbreaks and associated morbidity and mortality the search for intermediate hosts in mers-cov evolution is necessary as are functional studies to determine the pathogenic potential of such substitutions which may aid in the screening of patients at higher riskin conclusion the results of this study lead to the recommendation that the complete genome sequencing of all new cases of mers-cov to monitor virus evolution a clear understanding of the recombination events involved in mers-cov evolution would aid in developing effective tools for controlling new human coronavirus infections worldwidemab designed and supervised

terrestrial ecosystems 2 in the last few decades they have been associated with several emergent zoonotic agents and recognized as potential reservoir of zoonotic viruses belonging to different families such as hendra nipah ebola lyssa and sars coronavirus 3 bats represent ideal hosts and reservoirs of viruses due to their high diversity and ecological characteristics that potentially facilitate virus transmission such as the roosting together behavior and their ability to fly over distance 4 5 therefore it is essential to identify and characterize the currently unrecognized viruses circulating in bat populationscoronaviruses cov family coronaviridae are enveloped viruses with large single-stranded rna genomes ranging between 27 and 32 kb 6 7 based on genome-scale phylogenies they are classified into four genera alphacoronavirus -cov and betacoronavirus -cov pathogenic for mammals gammacoronavirus -cov and deltacoronavirus -cov primarily but not exclusively circulating in birds 8 9 most covs are disease-causing agents associated with a range of respiratory gastrointestinal hepatic and neurological diseases both in humans and animals they are also potentially transmitted among species causing epidemics after host transition 1012 due to mutation and recombination events new strains constantly originate and spread 4 13different bat species have been identified as natural reservoirs of most mammalian -cov and -cov including the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov 14 15 which recently caused outbreaks in the human population 4 sars-related cov was first identified in rhinolophus bats from china 16 and subsequently many mammalian covs were detected in chinese bats 17 18 and globally 19 further investigations identified -cov and -cov in several european countries from bats of various species 2022in italy few studies have been conducted on bat cov ecology viral detection and prevalence was investigated in greater horseshoe bats 23 alpha- and betacoronaviruses were identified in different species such as kuhls pipistrelle lesser horseshoe bats and serotine bats 10 24 and recently two mers related beta cov detected in italian kuhls pipistrelle and savis bat were fully sequenced 25 a total of 21 bat species are currently recognized as living on the island of sardinia italy lying geographically at the interface between europe and africa and recently indicated as a major mediterranean hotspot for bat biodiversity 26 nothing is known about cov presence and distribution among bat populations on the island and this is the first study aiming to fill this gap herein we report the molecular identification and typing of a sars-like coronavirus detected in three species of sardinian bats belonging to rhinolophus plecotus and tadarida genera during a viral survey conducted on non-invasive bat samples collected from different localities on the island we also inferred the phylogenetic characteristics of the identified -cov and its evolutionary relationships with other bat covs identified in europe and globallya total of 46 bats belonging to 15 different species were captured using mist nets or hand nets in 8 different localities distributed in northern and central sardinia grotta sa rocca ulari borutta galleria casteldoria santa maria

woods abandoned bridges and other type of natural roosts captures were performed by expert and trained biologists within a regular census program of sardinian bat populations between november 2015 and november 2016 bats were placed individually into cotton bags before investigation species sex age category and forearm length were determined oral and cutaneous swabs were collected using sterile micro-swabs aptaca and then bats were released at their capture site faecal samples were readily collected from cotton bags or during bat handling and suspended in 1 ml rna later rna stabilization

dna was extracted from oral and skin swabs tips using the qiamp dna mini kit qiagen following the manufacturers protocol specific for swabs dna was stored at  20 c for subsequent amplification analysis after suspending faecal samples in phosphate buffered saline pbs rna was extracted from faeces by using the qiamp viral rna mini kit qiagen according to the instructions suggested by the manufacturer extracted rna was stored at  80 c first-strand cdna was synthesized utilizing the affinity script multi temperature cdna synthesis kit agilent technologies following the random primers strategy protocol and then stored at  20 cdna extracted from bat oral swabs was tested for the presence of herpesvirus using a universal nested pcr 27 dna extracted from skin swabs was screened for poxvirus and papillomavirus presence by pcr based on pan-pox primers 28 and on primers targeting a conserved region of ppv l1 gene 29rt-pcr was performed to detect coronavirus in bat faecal samples by using two pairs of primers targeting a conserved fragment of rna-dependent rna polymerase gene rdrp 11fw and 13rv 23 and corona 1 forward and corona 2 reverse 10 17 30 targeting 170 bp and 440 bp respectively in a typical pcr 2 l of cdna was amplified in a 50 l reaction mixture containing 02 mm of each dntps 02 m each of forward and reverse primers 1x taqbuffer and gotaq promega italy dna polymerase the cycling conditions were as follows 5 min at 95 c followed by 40 cycles of 1 min at 95 c 1 min at 50 c and 1 min at 72 c followed by a final extension time of 5 min at 72 c from the first amplified sequence of approximately 170 bp in order to further amplify the rdrp gene 4 sets of primers were newly designed after aligning the sequence detected in this study with the most similar sequences obtained by blast analysis and choosing conserved regions to design consensus walking primers the first 170 bp amplicon was extended by designing and using downstream primers within the fragment and upstream primers based on alignments of phylogenetically related cov from genbank table 2 lists the primers designed in this study batcv1fr batcv2fr batcv3fr and batcv4fr pcr products were purified using dna clean  concentrator purification kit zymo research ca usa and directly sequenced in both forward and reverse directions by bmr genomics sequencing service padova italy forward and reverse sequences were edited and aligned with muscle multiple sequence alignment tool httpwwwebiacuktoolsmsa alignments were edited with bioedit software 31 sequences were checked against the genbank database using nucleotide blast httpblastncbinlmnihgovblastcgi

phylogenetic trees were estimated using the maximum likelihood ml and maximum parsimony mp methods implemented in mega 6 32 after testing the best fitting evolutionary model to the data bootstrap support values and reliability of internal branches were calculated from 1000 replicate trees models with the lowest bic scores bayesian information criterion are considered to describe the substitution pattern the best non-uniformity of evolutionary rates among sites was modeled by using a discrete gamma distribution g with 5 rate categories and by assuming that a certain fraction of sites are evolutionary invariable i after generating a gap-free nucleotide alignment of 1090 bp containing the novel virus as well as of coronavirus rdrp reference strains the most likely nucleotide substitution model selected to analyze these data was tn93g tamura-nei gamma distributed while analyzing an alignment of a higher number of cov rdrp sequences of 396 bp the model t92g was selected tamura 3-parameter gamma distributed the cov sequence obtained in this study was submitted to the genbank database under accession number mg978754coronavirus rna was detected in three out of 27 faecal samples 11 close to previously reported frequency 10 less than that observed in other studies 17 30 unlike results obtained in central-southern italy 33 positive samples were collected in different locations of northern and central sardinia from three different bat species the greater horseshoe bat rhinolophus ferrumequinum the brown long-eared bat plecotus auritus and the european free-tailed bat tadarida teniotis table 3 lists samples positive for cov detected in this study including the genbank accession number assigned to the novel sequence no herpesvirus poxvirus and papillomavirus were detected in the oral andor cutaneous samples collected within this sardinian bats viral survey

after detecting cov in faecal samples a total of 1110 bp of rdrp gene were successfully amplified and directly sequenced the same betacoronavirus sequence was detected in all three positive bat species upon blastn analysis the viral sequence identified was found highly similar to bat coronavirus bm48-31bgr2008 gu190215 detected in a blasiuss horseshoe bat rhinolophus blasii in bulgaria 14 with 100 query coverage and 96 identity the obtained sequence also showed high nucleotide similarity 89 with bat sars cov rs6722006 fj588686 identified in a chinese rufous horseshoe bat rhinolophus sinicus 34 and with bat sars-like coronavirus rsshco14 kc881005 from the same bat species 35 a first phylogenetic analysis was performed based on 1090 bp amplified fragment of the rdrp gene including the cov identified in sardinian bats and other 16 sequences representatives of cov genetic variability the phylogram tn93g fig 1 clearly showed that sardinian bat cov belong to the -cov genus and clustered together with the bulgarian bat cov identified in a rhinolophus blasii gu190215 to have a deeper look into clade structuring within genera and further characterize the phylogenetic relationships of the detected cov especially with other european bat coronaviruses another phylogenetic analysis was performed based on 396 bp of the rdrp gene and including a total of 30 sequences figure 2 shows the t92g tree obtained clearly assigning the sardinian bat cov to clade 2b within the -cov genus the branching also showed that the detected sequence was closely related to a betacoronavirus previously identified in a greater horseshoe bat rhinolophus ferrumequinum in italy btcovrhiferit17ita2009 genbank number kc633199 as well as other bat covs detected in rhinolophus spp from slovenia gq409747 36 and again from italy ie kf500954 10 all other clade groupings were consistent with previous studies 14



at least 21 bat species are currently recognized as living on the island of sardinia italy 37 some species are common and adaptable inhabiting both wild and urban habitats while others are rare and restricted to limited areas of the island recently an island endemic species was characterized plecotus sardus and an endemic lineage of plecotus auritus was also identified 38 the existence of endemic bat taxa on sardinia highlights the island importance in the conservation of the european bat community some sardinian bat populations appear genetically differentiated and isolated from any continental gene pool and should therefore be considered as an evolutionarily significant unit esu 39this is the first report of coronavirus detection in faeces from bat species in sardinia a sars-like betacoronavirus was detected in three species table 3 the greater horseshoe bat rhinolophus ferrumequinum common cave species distributed all over the island the brown long-eared bat plecotus auritus rare species inhabiting few localities especially mountain woods in central sardinia and the european free-tailed bat tadarida teniotis common species usually colonizing rocky slopes and mediterranean bushes as well as buildings and bridges in urban areasthe detected virus sarbatcov1 belonged to clade 2b including most of the sars-like covs found in bats as well as human sars coronavirus figs 1 2 sarbatcov1 appeared related to another betacoronavirus previously identified in the italian greater horseshoe bat btcovrhiferit17ita2009 genbank number kc633199 and also clustered with a -coronavirus isolated from a blasiuss horseshoe bat in bulgaria bm48-31bgr2008 genbank number gu190215 as shown in fig 2 the two clades within -coronaviruses are strongly supported in the phylogram and clade 2c clustered many other bat covs identified in europe italy and spain from different species these findings confirm a correlation between sars-like covs and bats belonging to rhinolophus spp consistently with previous studies 14 40 although the same rdrp sequence in this study was also detected in two other species belonging to the genera plecotus and tadarida as previously discussed phylogenetic analyses providing insights into viral transmission among bat species have revealed a general clustering by geographic location rather than by bat species 4 however our results also show that similar coronaviruses with nucleotide identity up to 96 are found in bats distributed in geographically distant regions such as the island of sardinia mainland italy and bulgariasince the identification of sarsr-rh-batcov in bats of the rhinolophus genus 16 an intense effort was dedicated to investigate covs in bats and many sars-like viruses were detected and characterized in various species worldwide 4 19 recent studies also provided evidence that bats may be the original ancestor hosts for sars and mers viruses which recently caused pandemic and heavy consequences in humans 4143 therefore it is paramount to investigate and characterize covs distribution and diversity in bat species before their potential emergence in humansfull-length genome analysis of the detected cov should be attempted to thoroughly understand phylogenetic relationships between sarbatcov1 and betacoronaviruses previously described in european bats further studies including larger number of samples as well as continued surveillance on viruses circulating in sardinian species are also needed to understand the role played by bats in the maintenance and transmission of beta covs monitoring and research on potential zoonoses are essential and the prevalence and distribution of covs in sardinian bats should be further investigated in urban and rural environment however without specific evidence bats should not be considered as a major concern for public health especially given the key ecosystem services they perform 44 bats play essential ecological roles in mosquito and pest control as pollinators and are keystone species in natural ecosystems on top of this bat species are often protected by national and international laws as their conservation status may be vulnerable or threatened and sardinia was recently indicated as a major mediterranean hotspot for bat biodiversity 26severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 a new coronavirus that causes severe respiratory diseases and is closely related to sarscov was described for the first time in the city of wuhan in the hubei province of china in late december 2019 httpswwwwhointcsrdon05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-chinaen it belongs to the coronavirus genus of the coronaviridae family and has 96 genomic identity with a previously detected sarslike bat coronavirus

 it also shows that the whole genomes of the three sarscov2 strains isolated from patients in northern italy and characterized by us are closely related to each other as well as to the other two published italian sequences and the german finnish mexican and brazilian sequences all of which formed a highly supported cladethe german sequence at the outgroup of the clade came from a covid19 outbreak reported between 20 and 24 january and occurring after business meetings with a shanghai business woman who tested positive after returning to china
10
 our tmrca estimate showed that the root of clade a was in the month of january 2020 a period compatible with this event however our data do not allow us to make any hypotheses concerning the possible routes followed by the virus to reach italy because given the limited number of sparsely sampled sequences in the tree
11
 it is impossible to infer the directionality of transmission and this means that multiple independent importations to europe cannot be excludedour data suggest that sarscov2 virus entered northern italy between the second half of january and early february 2020 which is weeks before the first italian case of covid19 was identified and therefore long before the current containment measures were takeninterestingly although they were sampled in the same area on the same day the genomes isolated from these three patients have a number of different mainly synonymous substitutions in particular one patient living near the municipality in which the highest number of cases was recorded showed a high degree of genomic heterogeneity thus suggesting considerable genetic driftin conclusion our data show that the sarscov2 isolates infecting the italian patients involved in the early epidemic in northern italy and those isolated from other european and latin american patients reporting contacts with italy are closely related to the strain isolated during one of the first european clusters observed in bavaria in late january 2020
12
 on the basis of the phylogenetic analysis alone we cannot exclude possibly multiple introductions in germany and italy from china or other countries but the epidemiological data showing that the first cases in germany preceded the first cases in italy by almost a month suggest that the strain entered germany before italy finally as we have characterized only three genomes so far we cannot exclude the presence of other different strains in italy that may be the result of multiple introductions further epidemiological and molecular studies of a larger sample are needed to clarify these issuesthe authors declare that there are no conflict of interestsal gz and mg conceived and designed the study lm ar db sr gr sa and mg were involved in patient care and the collection of biological materials al ab mt ag and cb performed the experiments gz al and ab made the phylogenetic analyses al gz ab sr and mg wrote the first draft of the manuscript all of the authors contributed to revising the manuscript and read and approved the submitted versionto confirm our assumption we downloaded raw rna sequencing rna-seq data sra prjna573298 for those two lung samples from the sra and conducted consistent quality control and contaminant removal as described by lius study 1 we found 1882 clean reads from the lung08 sample that mapped to the sars-cov-2 reference genome genbank mn908947 6 and covered 7602 of the sars-cov-2 genome we performed de novo assembly of those reads and obtained 36 contigs with lengths ranging from 287 bp to 2187 bp with a mean length of 700 bp via blast analysis against proteins from 2845 cov reference genomes including ratg13 sars-cov-2s and other known covs we found that 22 contigs were best matched to sars-cov-2s 706100 amino acid identity average 9541 and that 12 contigs matched to bat sars-cov-like cov 927100 amino acid identity average 9748 table s1 these results indicate that the malayan pangolin might carry a novel cov here named pangolin-cov that is similar to sars-cov-2using a reference-guided scaffolding approach we created a pangolin-cov draft genome 19587 bp based on the above 34 contigs to reduce the effect of raw read errors on scaffolding quality small fragments that aligned against the reference genome with a length less than 25 bp were manually discarded if they were unable to be covered by any large fragments or reference genome remapping 1882 reads against the draft genome resulted in 9999 genome coverage coverage depth range 1x47x figure 1
a the mean coverage depth was 771x across the whole genome which was two times higher than the lowest common 3x read coverage depth for snp calling based on low-coverage sequencing in the 1000 genomes project pilot phase 7 similar coverage levels are also sufficient to detect rare or low-abundance microbial species from metagenomic datasets 8 indicating that our assembled pangolin-cov draft genome is reliable for further analyses based on simplot analysis 9 pangolin-cov showed high overall genome sequence identity to ratg13 9055 and sars-cov-2 9102 throughout the genome figure 1b although there was a higher identity 962 between sars-cov-2 and ratg13 3 other sars-cov-like covs similar to pangolin-cov were bat sarsr-cov zxc21 8565 and bat sarsr-cov zc45 8501 while this manuscript was under review two similar preprint studies found that covs in pangolins shared 903 10 and 924 11 dna identity with sars-cov-2 approximating the 9102 identity to sars-cov-2 observed here and supporting our findings taken together these results indicate that pangolin-cov might be the common origin of sars-cov-2 and ratg13the pangolin-cov genome organization was characterized by sequence alignment against sars-cov-2 genbank mn908947 and ratg13 the pangolin-cov genome consists of six major open reading frames orfs common to covs and four other accessory genes figure 1c table s2 further analysis indicated that pangolin-cov genes aligned to sars-cov-2 genes with coverage ranging from 458 to 100 average coverage 769 pangolin-cov genes shared high average nucleotide and amino acid identity with both sars-cov-2 genbank mn908947 932 nucleotide941 amino acid identity and ratg13 928 nucleotide935 amino acid identity genes figure 1c table s2 surprisingly some pangolin-cov genes showed higher amino acid sequence identity to sars-cov-2 genes than to ratg13 genes including orf1b 734728 the spike s protein 975954 orf7a 969936 and orf10 973946 the high s protein amino acid identity implies functional similarity between pangolin-cov and sars-cov-2to determine the evolutionary relationships among pangolin-cov sars-cov-2 and previously identified covs we estimated phylogenetic trees based on the nucleotide sequences of the whole-genome sequence rna-dependent rna polymerase gene rdrp non-structural protein genes orf1a and orf1b and main structural proteins encoded by the s and m genes in all phylogenies pangolin-cov ratg13 and sars-cov-2 were clustered into a well-supported group here named the sars-cov-2 group figures 2
 s1 and s2 this group represents a novel betacoronavirus group within this group ratg13 and sars-cov-2 were grouped together and pangolin-cov was their closest common ancestor however whether the basal position of the sars-cov-2 group is sarsr-cov zxc21 andor sarsr-cov zc45 is still under debate such debate also occurred in both the wu et al 6 and zhou et al 3 studies a possible explanation is a past history of recombination in the betacoronavirus group 6 it is noteworthy that the discovered evolutionary relationships of covs shown by the whole genome rdrp gene and s gene were highly consistent with those exhibited by complete genome information in the zhou et al study 3 this correspondence indicates that our pangolin-cov draft genome has enough genomic information to trace the true evolutionary position of pangolin-cov in covsthe cov s protein consists of two subunits s1 and s2 mediates infection of receptor-expressing host cells and is a critical target for antiviral neutralizing antibodies 12 s1 contains a receptor-binding domain rbd that consists of an approximately 193 amino acid fragment which is responsible for recognizing and binding the cell surface receptor 13 14 zhou et al experimentally confirmed that sars-cov-2 is able to use human chinese horseshoe bat civet and pig ace2 proteins as an entry receptor in ace2-expressing cells 3 suggesting that the rbd of sars-cov-2 mediates infection in humans and other animals to gain sequence-level insight into the pathogenic potential of pangolin-cov we first investigated the amino acid variation pattern of the s1 proteins from pangolin-cov sars-cov-2 ratg13 and other representative sarssarsr-covs the amino acid phylogenetic tree showed that the s1 protein of pangolin-cov is more closely related to that of 2019-cov than to that of ratg13 within the rbd we further found that pangolin-cov and sars-cov-2 were highly conserved with only one amino acid change 500h500q figure 3
 which is not one of the five key residues involved in the interaction with human ace2 3 14 these results indicate that pangolin-cov could have pathogenic potential similar to that of sars-cov-2 in contrast ratg13 has changes in 17 amino acid residues 4 of which are among the key amino acid residues figure 3 there are evidences suggesting that the change of 472l sars-cov to 486f sars-cov-2 corresponding to the second key amino acid residue change in figure 3 may make stronger van der waals contact with m82 ace2 15 besides the major substitution of 404v in the sars-cov-rbd with 417k in the sars-cov-2-rbd see 420 alignment position in figure 3 and without amino acid change between the sars-cov-2 and ratg13 may result in tighter association because of the salt bridge formation between 417k and 30d of ace2 15 nevertheless further investigation is still needed about whether those mutations affect the affinity for ace2 whether the pangolin-cov or ratg13 are potential infectious agents to humans remains to be determinedthe s1s2 cleavage site in the s protein is also an important determinant of the transmissibility and pathogenicity of sars-covsars-covr viruses 16 the trimetric s protein is processed at the s1s2 cleavage site by host cell proteases during infection following cleavage also known as priming the protein is divided into an n-terminal s1-ectodomain that recognizes a cognate cell surface receptor and a c-terminal s2-membrane anchored protein that drives fusion of the viral envelope with a cellular membrane we found that the sars-cov-2 s protein contains a putative furin recognition motif prrarsv figure 4
 similar to that of mers-cov which has a prsvrsv motif that is likely cleaved by furin 16 17 during virus egress conversely the furin sequence motif at the s1s2 site is missing in the s protein of pangolin-cov and all other sarssarsr-covs this difference indicates the sars-cov-2 might gain a distinct mechanism to promote its entry into host cells 18 interestingly aside from mers-cov similar sequence patterns to the sars-cov-2 were also presented in some members of alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus and gammcoronavirus 19 raising an interesting question regarding whether this furin sequence motif in sars-cov-2 might be derived from those existing s proteins of other coronaviruses or alternatively if the sars-cov-2 might be the recombinant of pangolin-cov or ratg13 and other coronaviruses with a similar furin recognition motif in the unknown intermediate hostthe n protein is the most abundant protein in covs the n protein is a highly immunogenic phosphoprotein and it is normally very conserved the cov n protein is often used as a marker in diagnostic assays to gain further insight into the diagnostic potential of pangolin-cov we investigated the amino acid variation pattern of the n proteins from pangolin-cov sars-cov-2 ratg13 and other representative sars-covs phylogenetic analysis based on the n protein supported the classification of pangolin-cov as a sister taxon of sars-cov-2 and ratg13 figure s3 we further found seven amino acid mutations that differentiated our defined sar-cov-2 group covs 12n 26 g 27s 104d 218a 335t 346n and 350q from other known sars-covs 12s 26d 27n 104e 218t 335h 346q and 350n two amino acid sites 38p and 268q are shared by pangolin-cov ratg13 and sars-covs which are mutated to 38s and 268a in sars-cov-2 only one amino acid residue shared by pangolin-cov and other sars-covs 129e is consistently different in both sars-cov-2 and ratg13 129d the observed amino acid changes in the n protein would be useful for developing antigens with improved sensitivity for sars-cov-2 serological detectionbased on published metagenomic data this study provides the first report on a potential closely related kin pangolin-cov of sars-cov-2 which was discovered from dead malayan pangolins after extensive rescue efforts aside from ratg13 the pangolin-cov is the cov most closely related to sars-cov-2 due to unavailability of the original sample we did not perform further experiments to confirm our findings including pcr validation serological detection or even isolation of the virus particles our discovered pangolin-cov genome showed 9102 nucleotide identity with the sars-cov-2 genome however whether pangolin species are good candidates for sars-cov-2 origin is still under debate considering the wide spread of sarsr-covs in natural reservoirs such as bats camels and pangolins our findings would be meaningful for finding novel intermediate sars-cov-2 hosts to block interspecies transmission

research in context
evidence before this study
the causal agent of an outbreak of severe pneumonia in wuhan china is a novel coronavirus provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov the first cases were reported in december 2019
added value of this study
we have described the genomic characteristics of 2019-ncov and similarities and differences to other coronaviruses including the virus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic of 200203 genome sequences of 2019-ncov sampled from nine patients who were among the early cases of this severe infection are almost genetically identical which suggests very recent emergence of this virus in humans and that the outbreak was detected relatively rapidly 2019-ncov is most closely related to other betacoronaviruses of bat origin indicating that these animals are the likely reservoir hosts for this emerging viral pathogen
implications of all the available evidence
by documenting the presence of 2019-ncov in a sample of patients our study extends previous evidence that this virus has led to the novel pneumonia that has caused severe disease in wuhan and other geographical localities currently available data suggest that 2019-ncov infected the human population from a bat reservoir although it remains unclear if a currently unknown animal species acted as an intermediate host between bats and humans
in late december 2019 several patients with viral pneumonia were found to be epidemiologically associated with the huanan seafood market in wuhan in the hubei province of china where a number of non-aquatic animals such as birds and rabbits were also on sale before the outbreak a novel human-infecting coronavirus10 11 provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov was identified with use of next-generation sequencing as of jan 28 2020 china has reported more than 5900 confirmed and more than 9000 suspected cases of 2019-ncov infection across 33 chinese provinces or municipalities with 106 fatalities in addition 2019-ncov has now been reported in thailand japan south korea malaysia singapore and the usa infections in medical workers and family clusters were also reported and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed12 most of the infected patients had a high fever and some had dyspnoea with chest radiographs revealing invasive lesions in both lungs12 13
we report the epidemiological data of nine inpatients from at least three hospitals in wuhan who were diagnosed with viral pneumonia of unidentified cause using next-generation sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples and cultured isolates from these patients 2019-ncov was found we describe the genomic characterisation of ten genomes of this novel virus providing important information on the origins and cell receptor binding of the virusnine patients with viral pneumonia and negative for common respiratory pathogens who presented to at least three hospitals in wuhan were included in this study eight of the patients had visited the huanan seafood market before the onset of illness and one patient wh04 did not visit the market but stayed in a hotel near the market between dec 23 and dec 27 2019 table

nine patients samples analysed eight complete and two partial genome sequences of 2019-ncov were obtained these data have been deposited in the china national microbiological data center accession

samples were tested by a different real-time pcr assay developed by the chinese cdc with ct values ranging from 2285 to 3241 table these results confirmed the presence of 2019-ncov in the patientsbronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples or cultured viruses of nine patients were used for next-generation sequencing after removing host human reads de novo assembly was done and the contigs obtained used as queries to search the non-redundant protein database some contigs identified in all the samples were closely related to the bat sars-like betacoronavirus bat-sl-covzc45 betacoronavirus23 bat-sl-covzc45 was then used as the reference genome and reads from each pool were mapped to it generating consensus sequences corresponding to all the pools these consensus sequences were then used as new reference genomes eight complete genomes and two partial genomes from samples wh19002 and wh02 table were obtained the de novo assembly of the clean reads from all the pools did not identify any other long contigs that corresponded to other viruses at high abundancethe eight complete genomes were nearly identical across the whole genome with sequence identity above 9998 indicative of a very recent emergence into the human population figure 1a
 the largest nucleotide difference was four mutations notably the sequence identity between the two virus genomes from the same patient wh19001 from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and wh19005 from cell culture was more than 9999 with 100 identity at the amino acid level in addition the partial genomes from samples wh02 and wh19002 also had nearly 100 identity to the complete genomes across the aligned gene regionsa blastn search of the complete genomes of 2019-ncov revealed that the most closely related viruses available on genbank were bat-sl-covzc45 sequence identity 8799 query coverage 99 and another sars-like betacoronavirus of bat origin bat-sl-covzxc21 accession number mg77293423 8723 query coverage 98 in five gene regions e m 7 n and 14 the sequence identities were greater than 90 with the highest being 987 in the e gene figure 2a
 the s gene of 2019-ncov exhibited the lowest sequence identity with bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 at only around 75 in addition the sequence identity in 1b about 86 was lower than that in 1a about 90 figure 2a most of the encoded proteins exhibited high sequence identity between 2019-ncov and the related bat-derived coronaviruses figure 2a the notable exception was the spike protein with only around 80 sequence identity and protein 13 with 732 sequence identity notably the 2019-ncov strains were less genetically similar to sars-cov about 79 and mers-cov about 50 the similarity between 2019-ncov and related viruses was visualised using simplot software with the 2019-ncov consensus sequence employed as the query figure 2bcomparison of the predicted coding regions of 2019-ncov showed that they possessed a similar genomic organisation to bat-sl-covzc45 bat-sl-covzxc21 and sars-cov figure 1b at least 12 coding regions were predicted including 1ab s 3 e m 7 8 9 10b n 13 and 14 figure 1b the lengths of most of the proteins encoded by 2019-ncov bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 were similar with only a few minor insertions or deletions a notable difference was a longer spike protein encoded by 2019-ncov compared with the bat sars-like coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov figure 1bphylogenetic analysis of 2019-ncov and its closely related reference genomes as well as representative betacoronaviruses revealed that the five subgenera formed five well supported branches figure 3
 the subgenus sarbecovirus could be classified into three well supported clades two sars-cov-related strains from rhinolophus sp from bulgaria accession number gu190215 and kenya ky352407 formed clade 1 the ten 2019-ncov from wuhan and the two bat-derived sars-like strains from zhoushan in eastern china bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 formed clade 2 which was notable for the long branch separating the human and bat viruses and sars-cov strains from humans and many genetically similar sars-like coronaviruses from bats collected from southwestern china formed clade 3 with bat-derived coronaviruses also falling in the basal positions figure 3 in addition 2019-ncov was distinct from sars-cov in a phylogeny of the complete rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene appendix p 2 this evidence indicates that 2019-ncov is a novel betacoronavirus from the subgenus sarbecovirusas the sequence similarity plot revealed changes in genetic distances among viruses across the 2019-ncov genome we did additional phylogenetic analyses of the major encoding regions of representative members of the subgenus sarbecovirus consistent with the genome phylogeny 2019-ncov bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 clustered together in trees of the 1a and spike genes appendix p 3 by contrast 2019-ncov did not cluster with bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 in the 1b tree but instead formed a distinct clade with sars-cov bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 appendix p 3 indicative of potential recombination events in 1b although these probably occurred in the bat coronaviruses rather than 2019-ncov phylogenetic analysis of the 2019-ncov genome excluding 1b revealed similar evolutionary relationships as the full-length viral genome appendix p 3the envelope spike s protein mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion24 and is crucial for determining host tropism and transmission capacity25 26 generally the spike protein of coronaviruses is functionally divided into the s1 domain especially positions 318510 of sars-cov responsible for receptor binding and the s2 domain responsible for cell membrane fusion27 the 2019-ncov s2 protein showed around 93 sequence identity with bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21much higher than that of the s1 domain which had only around 68 identity with these bat-derived viruses both the n-terminal domain and the c-terminal domain of the s1 domain can bind to host receptors28 we inspected amino acid variation in the spike protein among the sarbecovirus coronaviruses figure 4
 although 2019-ncov and sars-cov fell within different clades figure 3 they still possessed around 50 conserved amino acids in s1 whereas most of the bat-derived viruses displayed mutational differences figure 4 most of these positions in the c-terminal domain figure 4 in addition a number of deletion events including positions 455457 463464 and 485497 were found in the bat-derived strains figure 4the receptor-binding domain of betacoronaviruses which directly engages the receptor is commonly located in the c-terminal domain of s1 as in sars-cov29 for lineage b and mers-cov30 31 and batcov hku432 for lineage c figure 5
 through phylogenetic analysis of the receptor-binding domain of four different lineages of betacoronaviruses appendix p 4 we found that although 2019-ncov was closer to bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 at the whole-genome level the receptor-binding domain of 2019-ncov fell within lineage b and was closer to that of sars-cov figure 5a the three-dimensional structure of 2019-ncov receptor-binding domain was modelled using the swiss-model program33 with the sars-cov receptor-binding domain structure protein data bank id 2dd834 as a template this analysis suggested that like other betacoronaviruses the receptor-binding domain was composed of a core and an external subdomain figure 5bd notably the external subdomain of the 2019-ncov receptor-binding domain was more similar to that of sars-cov this result suggests that 2019-ncov might also use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a cell receptor however we also observed that several key residues responsible for the binding of the sars-cov receptor-binding domain to the ace2 receptor were variable in the 2019-ncov receptor-binding domain including asn439 asn501 gln493 gly485 and phe486 2019-ncov numberingfrom genomic surveillance of clinical samples from patients with viral pneumonia in wuhan china a novel coronavirus termed 2019-ncov has been identified10 11 our phylogenetic analysis of 2019-ncov sequenced from nine patients samples showed that the virus belongs to the subgenus sarbecovirus 2019-ncov was more similar to two bat-derived coronavirus strains bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 than to known human-infecting coronaviruses including the virus that caused the sars outbreak of 2003epidemiologically eight of the nine patients in our study had a history of exposure to the huanan seafood market in wuhan suggesting that they might have been in close contact with the infection source at the market however one patient had never visited the market although he had stayed in a hotel near the market before the onset of their illness this finding suggests either possible droplet transmission or that the patient was infected by a currently unknown source evidence of clusters of infected family members and medical workers has now confirmed the presence of human-to-human transmission12 clearly this infection is a major public health concern particularly as this outbreak coincides with the peak of the chinese spring festival travel rush during which hundreds of millions of people will travel through chinaas a typical rna virus the average evolutionary rate for coronaviruses is roughly 104 nucleotide substitutions per site per year1 with mutations arising during every replication cycle it is therefore striking that the sequences of 2019-ncov from different patients described here were almost identical with greater than 999 sequence identity this finding suggests that 2019-ncov originated from one source within a very short period and was detected relatively rapidly however as the virus transmits to more individuals constant surveillance of mutations arising is neededphylogenetic analysis showed that bat-derived coronaviruses fell within all five subgenera of the genus betacoronavirus moreover bat-derived coronaviruses fell in basal positions in the subgenus sarbecovirus with 2019-ncov most closely related to bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 which were also sampled from bats23 these data are consistent with a bat reservoir for coronaviruses in general and for 2019-ncov in particular however despite the importance of bats several facts suggest that another animal is acting as an intermediate host between bats and humans first the outbreak was first reported in late december 2019 when most bat species in wuhan are hibernating second no bats were sold or found at the huanan seafood market whereas various non-aquatic animals including mammals were available for purchase third the sequence identity between 2019-ncov and its close relatives bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 was less than 90 which is reflected in the relatively long branch between them hence bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 are not direct ancestors of 2019-ncov fourth in both sars-cov and mers-cov bats acted as the natural reservoir with another animal masked palm civet for sars-cov35 and dromedary camels for mers-cov36 acting as an intermediate host with humans as terminal hosts therefore on the basis of current data it seems likely that the 2019-ncov causing the wuhan outbreak might also be initially hosted by bats and might have been transmitted to humans via currently unknown wild animals sold at the huanan seafood marketprevious studies have uncovered several receptors that different coronaviruses bind to such as ace2 for sars-cov29 and cd26 for mers-cov30 our molecular modelling showed structural similarity between the receptor-binding domains of sars-cov and 2019-ncov therefore we suggest that 2019-ncov might use ace2 as the receptor despite the presence of amino acid mutations in the 2019-ncov receptor-binding domain although a previous study using hela cells expressing ace2 proteins showed that 2019-ncov could employ the ace2 receptor37 whether these mutations affect ace2 binding or change receptor tropism requires further studyrecombination has been seen frequently in coronaviruses1 as expected we detected recombination in the sarbecoviruses analysed here our results suggest that recombination events are complex and are more likely occurring in bat coronaviruses than in 2019-ncov hence despite its occurrence recombination is probably not the reason for emergence of this virus although this inference might change if more closely related animal viruses are identifiedin conclusion we have described the genomic structure of a seventh human coronavirus that can cause severe pneumonia and have shed light on its origin and receptor-binding properties more generally the disease outbreak linked to 2019-ncov again highlights the hidden virus reservoir in wild animals and their potential to occasionally spill over into human populationsdata are available on various websites and have been made publicly available more information can be found in the first paragraph of the results sectionthe global community is at the peak of emerging bugs even though the earlier scares of zoonotic viruses were not retained the re-emergence of viral agents is a great threat and challenge for the global health community 1 the global community has witnessed that over the last two decades the world has experienced three outbreaks of coronaviruses with elevated morbidity rates in december 2019 cases of mysterious pneumonia with unknown etiology were reported in wuhan hubei a province of china which got the attention of the world 2 researchers and the chinese government responded swiftly and after deep etiological and sequencing investigation the international committee on taxonomy of viruses entitled it as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 3the sars-cov-2 belongs to betacoronavirus a member of the subfamily coronavirinae having four genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus in family coronaviridae categorized in the order nidovirales figure 1generally covs are broadly distributed among humans birds and other mammals usually causing hepatic enteric neurologic and respiratory syndromes 45 four 229e oc43 nl63 and hku1 out of six human disease-causing covs are widespread and in immune-competent individuals they normally cause common cold symptoms 6 two other strains that were linked with fatal illness were zoonotic in origin including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 7in 20022003 the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome occurred due to sars-cov in the guangdong province of china and quickly became pandemic to twenty-seven countries infecting 8098 people with 774 deaths and was declared the first endemic of the 21st century 8 a decade later in 2012 mers-cov caused a severe respiratory disease that emerged in the middle east with 2494 confirmed human infection cases and 858 deaths 9 in both epidemics bats were identified as the original source of sars and mers-covs the rate of human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 appears higher than earlier outbreaks of covs via cough andor sneezing droplets emitted from an infected person sars-cov-2 has appeared more transmissible but less deadly than sars-cov to date worldwide 194029 confirmed cases of human infection and 7873 deaths across 164 countries have been recorded 10in natural populations mutations recombination and reassortment are the strategic evolutionary process considered for genetic diversity the high incidence of homologous rna recombination is one of the most fascinating features of covs replication 11121314 kottier et al reported the first experimental-based recombination evidence for avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv 15 although additional studies have also concluded that ibv evolves through recombination 161718192021 moreover murine hepatitis virus mhv evolution through recombination was also practically confirmed 22 this encouraged exploration of the probable role of recombination in the sars-cov emergence the current condition might appear as a vulnerable factor for severe disease and may impose serious health threats to the human due to wide distribution with the increasing prevalence of covs frequent genomes recombination large genetic diversity and high human-animal interface behavior covs might be emerged from time-to-time in humans due to occasional spillover and recurrent cross-species infectious events 723as an emerging virus very limited information is available to describe the genetic diversity evolutionary ancestors and possible routes of transmission of sars-cov-2 from the natural reservoir to humans this study aimed to track the evolutionary ancestors of sars-cov-2 and different evolutionary strategies mutations recombination or reassortment that were genetically adapted by the novel coronavirusit is the utmost priority of the scientific community to minimize the public health risk through tracing the origin and natural inhabitants of sars-cov-2 to restrict human-to-human and cross-species transmission to understand the genetic diversity relationship and potential origin of sars-cov-2 with the other members of coronavirinae we have performed molecular phylogenetic analysis with a number of covs whole-genome sequences obtained from national center for biotechnology information ncbi table s1 the phylogenetic tree results demonstrate that all the covs responsible for the outbreak of concentrated pneumonia belong to the genera betacoronavirus figure 2 all the sars-cov-2 clade grouped with the cluster of sarssars-like covs with bat covs hku9-1 hku9-2 hku9-3 and hku9-4 as an immediate ancestor figure 2 the interior shared neighbors include sars-cov ns-1 sars-cov sino1-11 sars-cov gz02 and sars-cov gd01 and they were the human-infecting covs figure 2 the whole genome-based phylogenetic analysis presented that two bat sars-like covs zxc21 and zc45 were the closest relatives of sars-cov-2 most of the inner and outer joint neighbors of sars-cov-2 were found to have bats as their natural reservoir including bat sars-cov wiv1 in rhinolophus sinicus bat sars-cov hku3-1 and bat cov hku9-3 in rousettus bats consequently the bat would be the convenient native host of sars-cov-2 thus the probable intermediate host for the transmission cascade used by sars-cov-2 from bats to humans would be the same as that used by other sars-covcovs genome is comprised of single-stranded positive-sense rna with 5-cap and 3-poly-a tail figure 3 at the 5 end non-structure protein including poly-proteins pp1a and pp1b are directly translated from the genomic rna strand other structure proteins are envelope e nucleocapsid n membrane m and spike s proteins in addition covs encoded some special accessory proteins like 3ab 4ab 5 6 7ab etc proteins figure 3wuhan-hu-1-cov in the phylogenetic tree was uniquely positioned with sarssars-like covs that share a common ancestor which resembled bat coronavirus hku9-1 hku9-2 hku9-3 and hku9-4 during the course of evolution various recombinant events possibly obscure the path substantially by the patterns of genomic homologous diversity thus we compared the e m n and s genomic regions of wuhan-hu-1-cov as representative of sars-cov-2 sars and mers-cov figures s1s4 wuhan-hu-1-cov genome had more sequence homology with sars-cov table 1 figure 4 as compared to mers-cov although high genetic diversity was found between wuhan-hu-1-cov and sars-cov table 1 in the e m n and s genes low sequence homology between wuhan-hu-1-cov and mers-cov was observed figures s1s4examining the envelop e protein disclosed that the sequence conservation of wuhan-hu-1-cov in view of sars-cov was more than mers cov figure s1 wuhan-hu-1-cov shared 93 amino acid sequence homology with 7 genetic variation in the e protein with the sars-cov table 1furthermore the amino acid sequence of the membrane m protein of wuhan-hu-1-cov sars-cov and mers-cov were compared figure s2 in wuhan-hu-1-cov about 92 conservation of amino acid sequences and 17 mutations 8 with respect to sars-cov were observed table 1further we analyzed the nucleocapsid n protein which is a more abundant protein in covs with no exception about 93 of the amino acid sequence identity of the n protein for wuhan-hu-1-cov with sars-cov table 1 with 7 genetic variations was found while a less conserved sequence percentage was found with mers-cov figure s3 the conserved nature of sars-cov-2 along with other covs was an important factor to trace the evolutionary pathway of the cov and would be important to limit the outbreak of pneumonia-related viruses in covs the n protein was crucial for rna transcription and viral assembly disrupting the host cell and is also important to evaluate the virus-host adaptation and drug designfurther we compared spike glycoprotein s protein of wuhan-hu-1-cov sars-cov and mers-cov figure s4 it was observed that during the viral infection s protein underwent several drastic changes the s protein of wuhan-hu-1-cov was more prone to mutations particularly the amino acid sequence represented 19 alteration with four major insertions and 81 homology in contrast to sars table 1 figure 4ab additionally we found that the wuhan-hu-1-cov s protein was vulnerable to mutations especially in spike protein-cell receptor interface-associated amino acidssars-cov used a receptor-binding domain that stretched between 306527 amino acid sequences we compared the receptor-binding domain of sars-cov and wuhan-hu-1-cov and we found that 73 of conserved amino acid regions were observed in wuhan-hu-1-cov figure s5 in the meantime similar conservation patterns of the amino acid were also found in the binding receptor motif extended 424494 amino acid residues used by sars-cov to bind human ace2 figure s6 it was suggested that a significant affinity of wuhan-hu-1-cov with ace2 imposed high public health risk for humans by transmission through the s protein-ace2 binding channel subsequently homology protein modeling was used to predict the s protein structure of wuhan-hu-1-cov via the structure of sars-cov spike glycoprotein pdb c5xlrc figure 4bcnine regions in complete genome nucleotide sequences of wuhan-hu-1-cov were detected as putative recombinant regions and our recombination detection program rdp analysis suggested that wuhan-hu-1-cov could be a recombinant of sars gz02 rf1 sars-like zxc21 zc45 w1v1 and mers-covs table 2 the phi-test provided significant evidence of recombination p-value  000001 moreover the similarity plot showed that the 5-genomic region of wuhan-hu-1-cov shared substantially higher similarity with sars-like covs while the 3-genomic region shared a mixture of sars and sars-like covs nucleotide sequence figure 5 taken together our study found that most of the recombination events occurred in the spike glycoprotein motif of wuhan-hu-1-cov mostly towards the 5end of the s gene only a single recombination event was identified in rna-dependent rna polymerase helicase and orf3a table 2sars-cov-2 is a novel emerging contagious agent that found a way into human civilization the outbreak of sars-cov-2 is the third pandemic of the 21st century and the situation is still ongoing the prediction of fan et al 24 that a future sars or mers-like covs epidemic would emerge in china with a probable bat source became reality when the first case of concentrated viral pneumonia was reported on december 30 2019 in wuhan city of china 25 later on the novel coronavirus designated as sars-cov-2 was found responsible for the viral outbreak of pneumonia in wuhan 26generally emerging and re-emerging viral infections belong to the rna family of viruses since these viruses have high mutation rates that lead to eminent environmental adaptation with rapid evolution 27 to date very little knowledge is available about sars-cov-2 to understand the genetic diversity relationship and potential origin of sars-cov-2 our molecular phylogenetic analysis predicted that sars and sars-like covs were the ancestors of sars-cov-2 two bat sars-like covs zxc21 and zc45 were the closest relatives of sars-cov-2 figure 2 consequently we found that the bat would be the convenient native host of sars-cov-2 previously it was found that several bat covs were able to cause infection in humans without any intermediate host 2829rapid sequencing of sars-cov-2 provided an opportunity for the research community to look into its genetic diversity developing diagnostic tests and ultimately helping with vaccine production the whole-genome sequence of sars-cov-2 retained 80 nucleotide homology with sars epidemic viruses all the structural proteins were well conserved except for spike glycoprotein that showed a high rate of mutation in sars-cov-2 3031 our results demonstrated that compared with sars-cov the sars-cov-2 shares 81 amino acid similarity in spike s protein table 1 figure 4 which represented less conserved patterns of s protein than other covs like hku3-cov 32 through deep receptor-binding domain rbd analysis of sars-cov amino acids the sars-cov-2 rbd was 73 preserved comparatively to the pandemic rbd figure s5 this conservation pattern of rbd placed the sars-cov-2 between hku3-4 627 conserved a bat virus that was not capable of using the human ace2 receptor and the divergent bat cov rshc014 808 a spike known to use the human ace2 receptor for entrance 2933 moreover the binding free energies for the s-protein to human ace2 binding complexes were calculated and the binding free energy for the wuhan-hu-1-cov s-protein increased by 28 kcal mol1 when compared to the sars-cov s-protein binding representing more binding affinity to the human ace2 receptor 34moreover a recent study revealed that a polybasic cleavage site was present at the s1 and s2 junction of sars-cov-2 that effectively allowed cleavage by furin and the other protease and took part in viral host range and infectivity 35 whereas these polybasic cleavage sites in other human beta-corona viruses have not been detected 36 experimental investigation of follis et al with sars-cov demonstrated that furin cleavage site insertion at the s1-s2 junction increases cell-cell fusion 37 additionally an effective cleavage site in the mers-cov spike motif empowers bat mers-like covs to infect human cells 38 on the other hand in avian influenza viruses quick replication and diffusion effectively acquired polybasic cleavage sites in the hemagglutinin ha protein which served a similar function to that of the coronavirus spike protein in covs insertion or recombination facilitates acquisition of transforming low-pathogenicity into highly pathogenic forms for polybasic cleavage sites 39 so far sampled pangolin beta-corona viruses and the bat beta coronaviruses do not have polybasic cleavage sites covs could have adopted a natural evolutionary mechanism to mutate and to attain the polybasic cleavage site because the virus must have both the mutations and polybasic cleavage site for appropriate human ace2 receptor binding for this purpose it required a large population density for natural selection to attain an ace2-encoding gene that is akin to the human ortholog 4041 the recent study of peng et al revealed that might it be possible that sars-cov-2 ancestors jumped into humans getting the genetic features through adaptation and remaining undetected during human-to-human transmission once it adapted these variations became pandemic and sufficiently produced a large number of cases to activate the immune system that identified it 4041usually viruses adopt different strategies including recombination mutation and reassortment which facilitate the viruses in getting to equilibrium in the final host due to low fidelity of reverse transcriptase and rna-dependent rna polymerase rna viruses are more vulnerable to point mutations even though the point mutation rates in rna viruses are approximately 104 to 105 42 during the 2002 sars-cov epidemics three mutations per rna in each replication round were estimated 826  106 per nucleotide per day 43 often large population size and high rate of mutations in rna viruses rapidly adjust genotypes allowing for quick adaptations in a rapidly changing environment respectively mutations have a specific influence on virus reproductive fitness as positive selection drives to fix the positive fitness effects of beneficial alleles while negative selection removes lethal and deleterious alleles from a population together with these selective approaches the evolutionary routes of virus populations can be figured out across a sequence space 34 examining the genetic insight of sars and wuhan-hu-1-cov presented more than 90 sequence conservation between the e m and n protein with few numbers of point mutations table 1 whereas the higher rate of mutations in the s protein of wuhan-hu-1-cov were also observed and shared 81 identity table 1 figure 4a these results were in accordance with the results of xu et al and pradhan et al 4445recombination and reassortment became a powerful tool of emerging viruses to get innovative antigenic combinations that might aid the course of cross-species diffusion the recombination strategy facilitates this mechanism to find a better fraction of sequence space than the mutation raising the probability of finding a genetic configuration which supports host adaptations 46 it is important to note that numerous recently emerged rna viruses which were involved in human diseases exhibited active recombination or reassortment events mostly rna viruses get entry into the new host through the cross-species transmission 47 the recombination events in viruses are in fact related to discontinuous utilization of rna polymerase involved in the transcriptional mechanism to make mrnas rna polymerase of viruses must use different rna prototypes while making negative or positive rna strands that eventually result in rna recombination that is either homologous or non-homologous 12 in rna viruses this model of recombination is called the copy-choice model of recombination 1314 in covs a high recombination rate has been reported 48 it might be due to having large genome size discontinuous transcription and sub- or fully transcriptionally active genomic length of rna the co-infection of two covs in same animal or cells can potentially facilitate crossing over in the recent past the emergence of new infectious bronchitis virus recombinant ibv a new type of cov in turkeys was reported the genome sequence revealed that the s protein gene of this virus was the recombinant of another covs 49 in the s protein the recombination event is certainly significant as it permits the virus to modify superficial antigenicity to get from the immune reconnaissance into the animals and then adapt to a human host we identified nine putative recombination patterns which encompass in terms of genes involved the spike glycoprotein rdrp helicase and orf3a six of the nine recombination regions were spotted in the s gene table 2 significantly in this study each of the recombinant regions were predicted with at least two methods table 2 according to the method of posada he recommended that one should not be dependent on a single method 50 these results were in agreement with previous reports where the recombinant event was reported between parent viruses in the avian-like and mammalian-like sars-cov evolution 5152when segments of multiple viral genomes infect the same animal or tissue simultaneously it ultimately results in new viral progeny with a multiple parent genome set this process is termed as gene reassortment used by viruses for evolution 28 the literature suggests that a typical rna influenza a virus has eight ssrna segments and the assortment occurred among multiple influenza viruses termed as genetic shift or antigenic shift resulted in the change of influenza viral surface glycoproteinsneuraminidase thus the sequence of these virus strains diverges widely when host animal cell gets infected by confection and the progeny is developed by reassortment or recombination 27taking this together we found that sars-cov-2 was the descendent of sarssars-like coronaviruses being a close relative of bat sars-like covs zxc21 and zc45 we confirmed that mutations in different genomic regions of sars-cov-2 have a specific influence on virus reproductive adaptability allowing genotypes to adjust and quickly adapt in a rapidly changing environment moreover for the first time we identified nine putative recombination patterns in sars-cov-2 which were undoubtedly important for evolutionary survival meanwhile permitting the virus to modify superficial antigenicity to get from immune reconnaissance into animals and then adapting to a human host with these combined natural selected strategies sars-cov-2 emerged as a novel virus in human societyfor molecular phylogenetic analysis the whole-genome sequences of 53 viruses including 10 sars-cov-2 were retrieved from ncbi through blastn search with wuhan-hu-1-cov being used as reference table s1 all the sequences were aligned by using mafft v 7452 online server 53 to determine the nucleotides substitution model the bayesian information criterion bic value for aligned sequences was determined using jmodel test 2 and the substitution model with minimum bic values was considered for phylogenetic inference table s2 54 the whole-genome sequence was considered as a single partition and three chains of bayesian analysis were performed by applying the gtrig model of substitution reaching the maximum allowed number of generations after discarding burin 270030000 the optimal analyses trees were pooled into a single tree file posterior probability values with majority consensus rule were visualized figure 3 was used to visualize the best tree and the likelihood phylogram was exported as a picture 55 multalin software was used to align and visualized the envelope membrane nucleocapsid and spike glycoprotein regions of sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 56 the amino acid conservation motifs of the receptor-binding domain rbd in sars-cov and sars-cov-2 genome were traced by performing muscle alignment using megax software the three-dimensional structures of spike glycoproteins of sars-cov2 and sars-cov were generated by using an online server protein homologyanalogy recognition engine v 20 phyre2 57 and the structure was visualized and marked by using pymol 58 to detect the recombination events whole-genome nucleotide sequences of seven viral strains wuhan-hu-1-cov bat sars-like including w1v1 zxc21 zc45 bat sars gz02 rf1 and mers were aligned using clustalw preliminarily maxchi and chimaera algorithms were used to detect the recombination events in the dataset by a recombination detection program rdp5 59 additionally bootscan analyses and similarity plots were performed using simplot 351 60 to confirm the rdp-suggested potential recombination events and were analyzed on the whole-genome sequence of wuhan as a query and bat sars-like sars and mers as potential parental sequences table s1 a phi statistical test was applied to evaluate the significance of recombination evidence between closely and distantly related genomes furthermore the point of recombination along with major and minor parents of the recombinant was accessed through rdp bootscan maxchi chimaera and 3seq methods 59covid-19 has opened a new chapter of human civilization with a lots of tragedy stories a new strain of coronavirus family 2019 novel coronavirus or sars-cov-2 has emerged and infected thousands of humans it is gaining importance due to daily increases in the deaths caused by this disease who 2020c zhou et al 2020 hui et al 2020 the virus has already been reported from

clustalw thompson et al 2003 and phylogenetic relationship maximum parsimony mp studies by using mega x kumar et al 2018 to understand the ancestral origin and antigenic resemblance of sars-cov-2 with other coronaviruses in addition pairwise sequence alignment of sars-cov-2 proteins with other viral strains was performed by the emboss needle online software which uses the needleman-wunsch alignment algorithm to find the optimum alignment including gaps of two sequences along their entire length chojnacki et al 2017 moreover sequence alignment was also visualized and analyzed by using jalview software httpswwwjalvieworgtargeting potential antigens from viral proteins is crucial for constructing peptide-based vaccine molecules that can interact with b lymphocytes hasan et al 2019a it was reported that peptide flexibility and proper surface accessibility are prerequisites for being a potential b cell epitope considering those parameters the immunogenic peptide sequences from four types of viral proteins were determined by using the b cell epitope prediction tools of the immune epitope database iedb vita et al 2015 which employs the bepipred linear epitope prediction method larsen et al 2006 the vaxijen v20 server httpwwwddgpharmfacnetvaxijen was used for screening out the most immunogenic peptides determined from iedb vita et al 2015 however epitope conservancy analysis is an important step to determine the degree of desired epitope distribution in its homologous protein set in this study the conservancy pattern of mostly immunogenic b cell peptide sequences of covid-19 was compared with other homologous sequences retrieved from the ncbi database by using blastp hasan et al 2019b moreover the conservancy study of immunogenic peptides predicted from the sars-cov-2 proteins was also compared against other human coronavirus strains hcov-229e hcov-oc43 sars-cov hcov-nl63 hku1 and mers-cov the epitope conservancy analysis tool httptoolsiedborgconservancy of the iedb was used to continue the conservancy analysis hasan et al 2019chomology modeling of spike glycoprotein p0dtc2 membrane proteinp0dtc5 envelope protein p0dtc4 and nucleoprotein p0dtc9 of sars-cov-2 was performed by using the i-tasser server zhang 2008 although 3d structures were generated by multiple threading alignments in the i-tasser server refinement was conducted using modrefiner xu and zhang 2011 followed by the fg-md refinement server to improve the accuracy of the predicted 3d modeled structure zhang et al 2011 modrefiner allowed for significant improvements in the physical quality of the local structure based on hydrogen bonds side-chain positioning and backbone topology of the native-state proteins again fg-md a molecular dynamics-based algorithm for structure refinement usually works at the atomic level the refined protein structure was further validated by rampage wang et al 2016 and eraat analyses gundampati et al 2012structures were visualized and analyzed by pymol l delano 2002we illustrated the number of cases and deaths of sars-cov-2 in a consecutive way through graphs to elucidate the pattern of occurrence of those outcomes we covered country-wise cases and deaths the onset of global and chinese cases by date the global death toll per day and province-wise cases and deaths in chinawe calculated the crude mortality rate and case fatality according to the formulas suggested by the cdc cdc 2020 as well as jacob and ganguli jacob 2008 here we calculated the crude mortality rate for those countries and for chinese provinces having death records per 1 crore persons for better interpretationit is already known that the sars-cov-2 can multiply even at high temperatures especially temperatures higher than 15 c chan et al 2011 kampf et al 2020 however sars-cov-2 is rapidly inactivated at 20 c kampf et al 2020 therefore temperature plays a great role in its multiplication for this purpose recent environmental temperature data from the place of first occurrence as well as bangladesh were obtained from landsat-8 satellite data this satellite provides high spatial resolution 30 m data at 15-day intervals using the brightness temperature of band number 10 tir-1 and emissivity data temperature in c of bands 4 and 5 l8 data users handbook a large area a 30-km-wide swath can be obtained for a time with minor deviation from in situ temperature data maximum 045 degree celsius sd therefore cloudless or less cloudy images less than 90 were obtained from the usgs webpage wwwearthexplorerusggov a maximum of 2 data points were available for one area in each month however neighboring path and row image borders shared some common areas which provided more frequencies for those overlapped areas level-1

spike membrane envelope and nucleoproteins of sars-cov-2 hcov-229e hcov-oc43 sars-cov hcov-nl63 hku1 mers-cov hku4 hku5 and bufcov-hku26 clearly demonstrated the ancestral origin and distant evolutionary relationships of the newly epidemic novel coronavirus covid-19 it was found that sars-cov-2 was evolutionarily related to sars-cov fig 1
 in every case sars-cov-2 aligned with the same clade of sars-cov where two bat-originated coronaviruses hku4 and hku5were found to have divergent relationships with covid-19 rather hku4 and hku5 showed ancestral relationships with mers-cov moreover bufcov-hku26 of bangladesh origin always showed a phylogenetic relationship with the animal-originated coronavirus hcov-oc43 multiple sequence alignment msa of covid-19 proteins with sars-cov and bufcov-hku26 proteins is shown in fig 2
i and ii the results clearly suggested that major proteins four proteins of sars-cov-2 were more aligned with the sars-cov proteins which might strengthen the claim of evolutionary convergent relation of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov fig 2 i on the other hand the major proteins of bufcov-hku26 were also employed to msa with sars-cov and study found that there were significant dissimilarities between these two strains fig 2 ii moreover pairwise sequence alignment by emboss needle strengthened the phylogenetic relationship of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov table 1
included the similarity and identical pattern of sars-cov-2 proteins with their homologous proteins of other coronaviruses it had been raveled that sars-cov-2 proteins were highly similar and identical with sars-cov proteins for examples spike membrane envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of sars-cov-2 showed that approximately 764 905 947 and 905 nucleotide similarities with the respective protein molecules of sars-cov again in case of identity pattern results showed that spike membrane envelope and nucleoproteins of sars-cov-2 were 870 964 961 and 943 identical with the respective homologous proteins of sars-cov besides fewer level of similarity and identical patterns were found with other viral strains including bufcov-hku26 of bangladesh origin table 1four types of viral proteins supplementary file 1 of sars-cov-2 hcov-229e hcov-oc43 sars-cov hcov-nl63 hku1 mers-cov hku4 hku5 and bufcov-hku26 were employed to determine the most antigenic sites by using the b cell epitope prediction tool of iedb and vaxijen scoring the vaxijen server which gave a result well above the threshold value 040 usually reveals the immunogenic potential to stimulate a protective response in host organisms flower et al 2017 from the analysis a total of 17 epitopes from s proteins 1 epitope from m proteins 1 epitope from e proteins and 5 epitopes from n proteins were found to be mostly immunogenic in sars-cov-2 with almost 100 of peptides carrying more than the threshold value of the antigenic score of the vaxijen server table 2 similarly other coronavirus proteins also showed different lengths of immunogenic epitope candidates with values exceeding the antigenic threshold supplementary table 1 moreover homologous sequences of sars-cov-2 s m e and n proteins were retrieved from the ncbi database supplementary file 2 and were subjected to conservancy analysis with the immunogenic epitopes from sars-cov-2 proteins it was found that antigenic sites are almost conserved in all of the homologous protein sequences deposited in the ncbi database table 2 cross-checked conservancy analysis of covid-19 antigenic epitopes with sars-cov proteins showed that conservancy when cross-checked with other coronaviruses including bufcov-hku26 of bangladesh origin was not significant table 3the 3d structures of the sars-cov-2 proteins were modeled using the i-tasser server where sars-cov complex with human neutralizing s230 antibody fab fragment pdb id 6nb6 membrane protein complex pdb id 5x5y coronavirus envelope proteins pdb id 2 mm4 and sars cov nucleocapsid pdb id 1ssk acted as the top threading templates of the s m e and n proteins respectively the sars-cov-2 proteins showed 36 to 93 coverage and 40 to above 90 identity to the i-tasser template proteins supplementary table 3 as i-tasser usually deduces 5 different models for each operation refinement by modrefiner and validation by rampage and errat were performed to check the accuracy of the modeled structuresafter the refinement process ramachandran plot analysis was investigated to fix the structural accuracy from homology modeling ramachandran plot could do the placement of amino acids from modeled protein structure following the all attributes of structural biology from where comparatively better model could be screened out the present study revealed that the spike protein of sars-cov-2 showed 752 residues in the favored region 148 residues in the allowed region and only 10 residues in the outlier region fig 3 ia on the other hand membrane protein exhibited 777 residues in the favored region 15 residues in the allowed region and only 7 residues in the outlier region fig 3 ib in addition two other envelopes and nucleoproteins also showed the highest number of residues in the favored regions 74 for e and 681 for n and a lower number of residues 73 for e and 115 for n in the outlier regions fig 3 ic and id again for assuring more structural validity of the constructed models the results of errat had been analyzed it had been found that values of the highest quality factor from the modeled sars-cov-2proteins s  71 m  88 e  89 and e  73 were significant fig 3ii and supplementary table 3 in addition the probable immunogenic epitopes of major sars-cov-2 proteins were studied in the previous steps and here all of the predicted immunogenic epitopes of sars-cov-2were presented into the validated 3d structures of the s m e and e by using pymol in fig 4over two and half months from its outbreak on 31 december 2019 to 20 march

supplementary file 3 among 34 provinces in china including sars special administrative regions up to 19 march 2020 the highest number of cases occurred in hubei 67869 fig 6b in addition other highly affected provinces were guangdong 1370 henan 1273 zhejiang 1232 hunan 1018 anhui 990 and jiangxi 935 supplementary file 4 for both global and chinese cases there was a steady increasing trend of the occurrence of the disease per day from 22 january 2020 to 05 february 2020 and in the same way a steady decreasing trend from 06 february 2020 to 16 february 2020 interestingly on 17 february 2020 the number of cases worldwide 19572 cases and in china 19461 cases soared suddenly however the number started declining up until 25 february 2020 and then started rising sharply and reached to an apex on 20 march 2020 with 43957 cases fascinatingly after 25 february 2020 cases outside china increased more than those in china which was an alarming signal that covid-19 became a pandemic fig 5iand supplementary fig 1the first death by covid-19 occurred on 11 january 2000 and by 19 january 2020 another three persons had died the global death toll fig 6c started to increase from 20 january 2020

the satellite-derived temperatures c for wuhan china south korea italy and bangladesh during february 2020 are shown in fig 7
 in this figure a single scale at the rightmost part of the image is used to indicate the temperature for all subimages however for the wuhan area no cloud-free clear image data were available for the western part of the image for that period therefore only the eastern part is shown here similarly during the study period in the mid-region of korea the temperature was very low which was caused by the presence of heavy and widespread clouds in that region during satellite image acquisition however very few clouds covers were found for the landsat-8 image acquisition for february 2020 for the italy areas in almost all areas temperature were lower than 20 c except a few places where the temperature did not exceeded 25 c therefore interpretations from the figures for these regions should be guarded in order to avoid errorsthe novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 became a pandemic because of its global spread jung et al 2020 coronaviruses are one of the most diverse groups of viruses and have emerged as deadly pathogens of the human race with sars-cov-2 being the latest added to the list in most cases human coronaviruses evolve from zoonotic transmission and bats are reported as the best reservoirs for zoonotic viruses graham and baric 2010 although the causative agent of covid-19 has already been declared sars-cov-2 lai et al 2020 phan 2020 we adopted a protein-based phylogenetic study to reveal the phylogenetic relationships and divergent links of sars-cov-2 with other human coronavirus strains seven coronaviruses covid-19 hcov-229e hcov-oc43 sars-cov hcov-nl63 hku1 and mers-cov two bat-originated coronaviruses hku4 and hku5 and one buffalo-originated coronavirus bufcov-hku26 reported from bangladesh were subjected to phylogenetic analysis of four types of their viral proteins s m e and n proteins it was clearly demonstrated that sars-cov-2 and sars-cov shared asimilar pattern of ancestral origin fig 1 and pairwise alignment indicated maximum similarity and identity between these two viruses table 1 and fig 2 recently after the rapid transmission of sars-cov-2 and the resulting deaths who 2020c wu et al 2020 bogoch et al 2020 chinazzi et al 2020 the who announced the genetic similarities between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov which were clearly reflected in the present study in addition hku4 and hku5 are bat-originated coronaviruses and the similar genetic makeup of the other viral strains could indicate a similar host preference desjardins et al 2010 although there were a few unclear reports regarding the possibilities of bats as reservoirs of sars-cov-2 giovanetti et al 2020 benvenuto et al 2020b however the divergent phylogenetic relationships and minor alignment patterns of sars-cov-2 with the bat-originated viruses hku4 and hku5 suggested that there was a low possibility of sars-cov-2 being connected with bats fig 1 and table 1as the ncbi database until now documented only the genome materials of a buffalo coronavirus bufcov hku26 from domestic water buffaloes bubalus bubalis in bangladesh lau et al 2016 a comparative study of bufcov-hku26 with sars-cov-2 was employed with phylogenetic analysis and pairwise alignment of the targeted viral proteins the study revealed that bufcov-hku26 showed divergent relationships and low pairwise alignment of s 295 identity and 442 similarity m 374 identity and 557 similarity e 209 identity and 442 similarity and n proteins 327 identity and 486 similarity with sars-cov-2 however as bufcov-hku26 is an animal-originated coronavirus its proteins always exhibited an ancestral relationship with the other animal-originated virus hcov-oc43 fig 1 bufcov-hku26 was detected in bangladesh which suggests that the country does provide a favorable environment for the transmission and pathogenesis of buffalo-originated coronaviruses sooryanarain and elankumaran 2015 rowe and east 1997 as the genetic architecture of sars-cov-2 was highly divergent from that of bufcov-hku26 fig 1 fig 2 and table 1 and viral transmission or pathogenesis is directly or indirectly governed by the genetic makeup of the virus it is possible that the conditions in bangladesh could be less favorable for the high occurrence of covid-19 although technical supports and policy level management could also influence the rapid transmission of any pandemicthe novel coronavirus has been making headlines since it first came to light late in 2019 covid-19 has already spread to all continents except antarctica geographically bangladesh is located in a temperate zone we performed a comparative study of the temperatures between bangladesh wuhan south korea and italy interestingly temperature could be another factor reducing the risks of covid-19 to bangladesh although the country still has as a high risk index haider et al 2020athe high temperature and high humidity can effectively reduce the transmission of the covid-19 wang et al 2020a and temperature variation and humidity may be important factors affecting the covid-19 mortality ma et al 2020 however experts cannot yet predict the trajectory of the virus covid-19 sars-cov-2 might have different persistence times on inanimate surfaces but these times should be similar to those of sars-associated viruses 34 days kramer et al 2006 human coronaviruses such as middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus and endemic human coronaviruses hcov can persist on inanimate surfaces but not for long periods of time chan et al 2011 kampf et al 2020 however at lower temperatures such as 4 c or less this virus persisted for as long as 28 days and the lowest level of inactivation occurred at 20 relative humidity inactivation was more rapid at 20 c than at 4 c at all humidity levels likewise coronaviruses were inactivated more rapidly at 40 c than at 20 c kampf et al 2020 recently the authors established that temperature significantly changed covid-19 transmission in 429 cities in which covid-19 appeared to spread fastest at 872 c wang et al 2020b moreover scientists discovered that sars-cov-2 has mutated into a more aggressive disease tang et al 2020 population genetic analyses of sars-cov-2 genomes indicate two major lineages designated l and s with a higher possibility of infection by both types the ancestral s-type is suspected to be less infectious and milder in severity 30 while the later emerging l-type is more prevalent 70 tang et al 2020 if the continuing evolution of sars-cov-2 continues countries such as bangladesh will truly be in great trouble as human intervention may have placed more severe selective pressure on the l type which might be more aggressive and spread more quickly tang et al 2020 although according to the who this virus is unique in its continuous mutation who 2020a until now there has been no concrete evidence that the virus has already changed with regards to disease severity or infectivity however based on this brief discussion it can be presumed that this virus has a lower possibility of vertical spread and lower severity in countries or seasons with relatively higher temperatures respectively thus in affected countries covid-19 might disappear with rising temperatures when spring comes however caution should be used when interpreting these kinds of computer-based studies more comprehensive genomic data are required for further testing of this hypothesisin fig 7 the temperatures of wuhan china south korea italy and bangladesh during february 2020 are compared it can be observed that the temperature ranged from 13 to 22 c in many places of wuhan korea as well as in italy however across bangladesh the temperatures were above 25 c except for a very few small areas with temperatures of approximately 20 c which were caused by small patches of cloud cover thus the temperature is much higher in bangladesh than in wuhan korea and italy we know that during this period of modern science many people are moving from one place to another which allows for vertical spread of any severe disease from any small place to areas all over the world similarly coronavirus has spread to more than 182 countries and territories including a recent introduction into bangladesh however these temperature data indicate that if the virus has not yet undergone mutation to be able to sustain high temperatures such as 25 c which occur in bangladesh there is less possibility of this virus replication moreover currently in march the temperature may have increased considerably giving hope that the virus will not multiply much only 20 cases including 1 death of covid-19 have been confirmed in bangladesh as of march 20 2020 however more people 10929 cases and 183 deaths as of may 5 2020 documented to have been affected while visiting other countries are being treated carefully in quarantine which might result in the fast disappearance of covid-19 with little or no spread due to the higher temperatures in bangladesh the largest international airport in bangladesh is situated in dhaka and is a main entrance for people from all over the world as dhaka is an industrial and commercial zone and all the official works of bangladesh are centralized here most of the visitors or people returning to the country stay here for an extended period due to industrialization the temperature of dhaka is much higher than that of any other parts of bangladesh which is also evident from fig 7 d indicated by the black circle in the figure many of the scientists and pathologists revealed that high temperature and humidity able to restrict the spread of covid-19 and spread of disease will be suppressed as the weather warms sajadi et al 2020 zhang and zeng 2020 this also supports our hypothesis interestingly coronaviruses that cause colds do tend to subside in warmer months however it is highly uncertain whether sars-cov-2 will behave the same way current research by scientists is too early to predict how the virus will respond to changing weather national geographic 2020immunogenicity and epitope conservancy analyses of coronavirus proteins were performed to determine the potential b-cell epitopes that would interact efficiently with b lymphocytes to initiate the immune response against specific viral pathogens klingen et al 2018 the study identified a total of 24 highly immunogenic b-cell epitopes from sars-cov-2 proteins 17 epitopes of s 1 epitope of m 1 epitope of e 5 epitopes of n proteins conservancy analysis table 3 demonstrated that selected epitopes were highly conserved in other homologous strains of sars-cov-2 which suggested the possibility of peptide-based vaccine development from s m n or e proteins azim et al 2019 abdulla et al 2019 preethika nair 2020 moreover potential b-cell epitopes were also identified from hcov-229e hcov-oc43 sars-cov hcov-nl63 hku1 mers-cov hku4 hku5 and bufcov-hku26 proteins supplementary table 1 the antigenic sites of covid-19 were also crosschecked with other coronavirus-corresponding proteins table 3 higher levels of conservation among antigenic epitope sites of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov supported a similar ancestry in their pathogenicity in contrast antigenic epitopes from sars-cov-2 exhibited the minimum conservancy pattern with bufcov-hku26 which suggested a distinct pathogenicity pattern between sars-cov-2 and bufcov-hku26the national health authorities of china detected a cluster of 44 pneumonia patients of unknown etiology from 31 december 2019 to 3 january 2020 in wuhan city hubei province of china and reported this detection to the who chinese office who 2020c moreover on 7 january they identified the pathogen as a novel coronavirus world health organization who 2020 similar to covid-19 the world experienced an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 caused by a coronavirus also originating from china guangdong province which was suggested to be a potential zone of re-emergence of coronaviruses lai et al 2020 who 2020d however on 14 march 2020 who declared europe as new epicentre of covid-19 outbreak syariz et al 2015within a very short time covid-19 was transmitted globally who 2020c wu et al 2020 bogoch et al 2020 chinazzi et al 2020 world health organization who 2020 by 20 march 2020 the viruses had spread to up to 182 countries and territories and one cruise ship named diamond princess in japan worldometers covid-19 coronavirus outbreak 2020 infecting 253796 persons globally who 2020c in contrast sars infected 8450 persons and caused 810 deaths globally in 33 countries chen et al 2005 moreover mers another coronavirus associated with an epidemic started in saudi arabia in september 2012 and spread to up to 27 countries affecting a total of 2494 persons and causing 858 deaths throughout the world up to november 2019 who 2020b therefore covid-19 has already covered approximately 552 times more countries than sars and mers who 2020c chen et al 2005 in addition up to 20 march covid-19 has been attributed 3003 and 10176 times more cases and 1285 and 1213 times more deaths globally than sars and mers respectively worldometers covid-19 coronavirus outbreak 2020 chen et al 2005 who 2020b although the occurrence of cases per day was high in china at the beginning of the outbreak after 25 february 2020 the number of cases declined in china and dramatically increased outside of china for example all of italy has been placed under lockdown due to covid-19 the majority of the cases are in mainland china followed by italy spain iran germany usa france and korea and the world health organization has formally declared the covid-19 outbreak a pandemic in march 11 2020 who 2020c jung et al 2020the case fatality of covid-19 as of 19 march was 410 and 400 globally and in china respectively this calculation agrees with the report of wang et al wang et al 2020c who stated that the global case fatality was close to 3 however the global case fatalities of sars 960 and mers 3440 were higher than that of covid-19 who 2020b cameron et al 2008 by february 2020 the case fatality of china was 380 worldometers covid-19 coronavirus outbreak 2020 which supports our estimate despite the lower case fatality than the previous coronaviruses sars and mers covid-19 poses a great burden across the world in terms of geographical coverage occurrence of cases and death toll and became a pandemic causing extensive public panic the covid-19 coronavirus has spread in the neighboring countries of bangladesh as well it has also spread in the middle east a region with which bangladesh has economic relationships therefore bangladesh faces a high risk of being affected by novel coronavirus outbreaks as the virus has already spread in different parts of the globe over182

a total of 26 out of the 30 known bat species known for iberian peninsula were screened for cov and 14 samples taken from 9 bat species all included in the family vespertilionidae were positive for cov rna tables 1 and 2 twelve of them were found within faecal samples 55 of 7 different bat species in 6 locations and two were obtained in oral samples 05 of 2 other different species in the same location table 1 in view of these results it is not surprising that the presence of cov rna is significantly more frequent in faeces than in oral cavity p00001 fisher exact test it is of interest that none of the viruses has been found in oropharingeal and faecal samples of the same individual when both samples were available this fact may indicate either that the infection was at different stage in the different individuals at the time of sampling or that replication of virus may take place independently in the intestinal and respiratory tracts 25 most of the cov rna sequences found in faecal samples 83 correspond to  cov the remaining two belonging to  cov all cov rnas from oral samples 100 were found to contain viral rna sequences corresponding to  cov in agreement with all previous studies 7 none of the coronavirus detected in spanish bats belong to group the phylogenetic analysis of spanish batcov was performed using 396nt out of the 512 nt rt-pcr amplified fragments 116nt fragment information was lost to allowed us include more sequences from other european countries and other continents deposited in genbank to perform a meaningful analysis this small part of the rdrp gene has been previously used and sufficiently represents the full gene information for phylogenetic analysis of batcov 11 14 20the phylogenetic reconstruction showed 6 different lineages of spanish batcov fig 2 batcov a and b were closely related to other  batcov found in china 12 although they appeared to display certain genetic differentiation fig 2 myotis daubentonii-associated cov h and pipistrellus-associated cov k clustered respectively with lineages 4 and 3 of  cov previously described in germany and are hosted by the same bat species or genera 11 fig 2 batcov l was closely related to cluster hku7 described in china 10 batcov c d e f g and i belonged to the same lineage and showed an intriguing new independent cluster significant posterior probability  095 including batcov i fig 2 in addition batcov j and m were genetically related to  cov although they did not really associate with any of their previously described linages sequences corresponding to two different groups of cov were found in the same bat species hypsugo savii as it was also found for other bat species elsewhere 12 spanish batcov described here were also classified calculating amino acid distances of these viruses from phylogenetic neighbours and related reference species 21 amino acid distance criteria recently described for separating rdrp grouping units rgu were adopted 21 interestingly the amino acid distance criteria 48 for alphacoronavirus and 63 for betacoronavirus reinforced the presence of the new group of alphacoronaviruses mentioned above including spanish batcov c d e f g and i and additionally showed four new tentative groups fig 2 batcov a and b were included in a new alphacoronavirus group and batcov i constituted another independent alphacoronavirus group batcov j and m represented two new betacoronavirus groups and batcov h k and l remained as part of several established species fig 2
it has been previously suggested that some cov associate to certain bat species 10 11 however we found that different bat species from the same colony or location harbour cov of the same genetic lineage batcov a and b g and i indicating a greater diversity and higher complexity than previously described for the ecology of batcov similar exceptions were found in china and south america 12 16 26 and could also be observed with australian batcov fig 2 and table 2in conclusion previous studies showed the presence of batcov in europe however to our knowledge this is the first report describing the presence of cov rna in iberian bat species phylogenetic data indicate high diversity wide distribution and complex ecology of cov in bats captured in diverse spanish locations the sequences reported herein provide new insights into the diversity of coronaviruses and describe new phylogenetic linages that appear to diverge from all genotypes previously detected in other european locations future studies should clarify whether such apparently high diversity reflects the bio-geographical peculiarities of the iberian peninsula or not this study contributes with a new dataset to the global surveillance of emerging batcov with pathogenic potential in humans our data reinforce the notion that the ecology and transmission of cov in bat reservoirs is far from being completely understood and that more studies will be necessary to evaluate the magnitude of the potential threat that these viruses pose to human healththe recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus sars-cov and of middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus mers-cov order nidovirales family coronaviridae subfamily coronavirinae as dangerous zoonoses stirred great interest in the ecology and evolution of coronaviruses before the sars-cov epidemic only two hcovs were known hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 two additional hcovs hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 were discovered in 20042005 from clinical specimens 1 these viruses originated in animals and are mainly responsible for respiratory diseases in humans figure 1a key figure specifically all hcovs are thought to have a bat origin with the exception of lineage a beta-covs which may have reservoirs in rodents 2 the phylogenetic relationships of hcovs and other animal covs mentioned in this review are summarized in figure 1aa number of field studies identified and sequenced viruses related to hcovs in wildlife reservoirs and phylogenetic reconstruction provided important clues on the most likely events that led to the introduction of hcovs in human populations several recent excellent reviews delve into the knowns and unknowns of hcov origin in terms of reservoir species amplification host and more generally of cov ecology 1 3 4 5 in this review we instead focus on the molecular evolution of hcov genomes the general concepts of evolutionary analyses in viruses are outlined in box 1
 whereas the most common approaches that were applied to the analysis of cov sequence evolution in terms of phylogenetic reconstruction detection of recombination and identification of selection signatures are summarized in boxes 1 and 2
box 1molecular evolution in viruses general conceptsrna viruses are rapidly evolving pathogens that can accumulate considerable genetic diversity in relatively short time periods this is mostly due to their high nucleotide mutation rates but see text for covs the diversity of extant viral sequences can be analyzed to construct phylogenetic relationships among speciesstrains and to infer the underlying evolutionary patterns in the presence of recombination a single phylogenetic tree is unable to describe the evolution of homologous sequences because recombination is common in many viruses including hcovs the evolution of viral genomes is best modeled by several phylogenies one for each nonrecombinant fragment box 2 by reassorting mutations recombination has the potential to generate novel viral phenotypes thus not only recombination is of interest per se but failure to account for its presence can distort phylogeny-based analyses including estimates of natural selection 66 natural selection acts pervasively on viral sequences when coding regions are concerned natural selection is commonly estimated in terms of  also referred to as dnds  that is the observed number of nonsynonymous differences per nonsynonymous site dn over the observed number of synonymous differences per synonymous site ds under neutral evolution  is expected to be equal to 1 as the rate at which amino acid substitutions accumulate is similar to the rate for synonymous changes due to the fact that essential protein domains can often tolerate only minor sequence changes most amino acid replacements are eliminated by selection this generates  values 1 a situation referred to as negative or purifying selection nevertheless amino acid replacements can be advantageous for a virus in terms for example of host adaptation or immune evasion in this case  values can be higher than 1 positive selection thus evaluation of how  varies from site to site or from branch to branch in a phylogeny is commonly used to describe selective events some possible caveats should nevertheless be kept in mind i the saturation of substitution rates especially ds may occur and affect evolutionary inference when fast-evolving sequences are analyzed see box 3 for an example and box 2 for methods to overcome this problem ii in viral genomes synonymous substitutions are not always neutral this may be due to the presence of overlapping reading frames conserved rna secondary structures packaging signals and other functional elements box 3 iii a relaxation in the intensity of both negative and positive selection may occasionally occur box 2 and figure 2abox 2molecular evolution in viruses methods and caveatsphylogenetic tree constructiondistance-based and character-based approaches can be used in phylogenetic tree reconstruction distance-based methods measure pairwise differences among sequences and generate the tree from the resultant distance matrix eg upgma neighbour joining character-based methods evaluate all possible trees and estimate the one that best fits the data this approach includes maximum likelihood ml and bayesian methods eg phyml 67 raxml 68 mrbayes 69recombination detectionthe location of recombination breakpoints can be detected using phylogenetic incongruence among segments in a sequence alignment eg gard 70 or by evaluating the distribution of nucleotide substitution along genomic regions eg recco 71 a common approach is to use different methodologies to identify breakpoint locations and contributing sequences eg rdp 72positive selection analysespositive selection is usually estimated based on  variation across sites andor lineages box 1 a common approach is to compare ml models that allow or not a class of codons in the alignment to evolve with   1 eg the site models in paml 73 likelihood ratio tests are then applied to determine whether the neutral model can be rejected in favor of the positive selection model alternatively branch-site models can be applied to detect episodic positive selection on specific branches of the phylogeny different methods allow to test a priori whether a branch is under selection 74 75 or to model different evolutionary scenarios for each branch 76 when evolutionary analysis is focused on recent timescales selection may not have yet fixed the advantageous mutations or removed the deleterious ones one possibility is to compare the distribution of nonsynonymous and synonymous polymorphisms in a specific lineage with the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous fixed differences between lineagesspecies the mcdonald-kreitman test 77 has been widely applied for this purposerelaxed selectionwhen selection is relaxed smaller  values tend toward 1 whereas  values higher than 1 decrease this phenomenon can be confused with episodic selection specific methods allow one to infer whether a branch in the phylogeny is under positive or relaxed selection 18subsitution rate saturationsaturation of substitution rates can be a serious issue for deep tree branches nonetheless branch-site methods are relatively insensitive to biases introduced by ds saturation and can be applied to the analysis of distantly related species 78 alternatively specific indexes have been developed to detect substitution saturation 79 in the presence of ds saturation third-codon positions can be removed to obtain reliable phylogeniessynonymous constraintregions with an excess of synonymous constraint can be identified using a recently developed sliding-window ml-based method 80covs are positive-sense single-strand rna viruses with a likely ancient origin and hcovs repeatedly emerged during the past 1000 years box 3
 all covs have nonsegmented genomes that share a similar organization about two thirds of the genome consists of two large overlapping open reading frames orf1a and orf1b see glossary that are translated into the pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins these are processed to generate 16 nonstructural proteins nsp1 to 16 the remaining portion of the genome includes orfs for the structural proteins spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleoprotein n a variable number of accessory proteins are also encoded by distinct viruses figure 1bbox 3time origin of cov genera and hcov emergencecoronaviruses are classified into four distinct genera alpha beta gamma and delta 81 alpha-covs and beta-covs circulate in mammalian hosts whereas gamma-covs and delta-covs mainly infect birds 82 an analysis of the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene in 43 covs provided a first estimate of around 10 000 years ago for the time of the most recent common ancestor tmrca of the four genera 83 this result was questioned on the basis of observations suggesting a longstanding interaction between covs and their hosts 82 thus wertheim and coworkers hypothesized that natural selection in particular negative selection resulted in a bias of the tmrca estimate 82 indeed strong negative selection can result in the saturation of substitutions at synonymous sites and consequently in underestimation of branch lengths in a phylogeny to overcome this issue the authors applied a branch-site test see box 1 76 to estimate branch lengths while taking into account the effect of different selective pressures among lineages in the cov phylogeny 82 their findings placed the separation of the four cov genera around 300 million years ago highlighting the importance of evolutionary models in molecular clock dating interestingly this tmrca is consistent with the separation time between mammals and aves 84 suggesting a coevolutionary relationship between coronavirus and their hosts however the dating estimates obtained for closely related viruses by wertheim and coworkers were in agreement with previous studies suggesting that the action of natural selection is not biasing the estimation of more recent divergence times although most hcovs were identified only recently molecular clock analyses indicate that some of these viruses diverged from closely related covs hundreds of years ago in particular the emergence of hcov-nl63 and hcov-229e has been roughly estimated around 500800 and 200 years ago respectively 85 86 hcov-oc43 is thought to have shared a common ancestor with bcov around 120 years ago 87 as for sars-cov and mers-cov molecular dating studies estimated that they diverged from bat covs in the last three decades 14 88 finally the mrca of hcov-hku1 extant lineages was estimated to have existed in the 1950s 60 clearly these dates should be regarded as estimates and confidence intervals are often wide a timeline for the emergence of hcovs is depicted in figure i
among rna viruses covs have exceptionally long genomes up to 32 kb genome expansion in covs is believed to be at least partially mediated by increased replication fidelity although estimates of the mutation rate for covs differ possibly depending on the phase of cov adaptation to novel hosts several studies have shown that these viruses may possess an unusually high replication fidelity 6 7 8 indeed a major step that allowed genome expansion in covs and more generally in nidovirales was the acquisition of a set of rna-processing enzymes that improved the low fidelity of rna replication 9 these enzymes include an rna 3-to-5 exoribonuclease exon and possibly an endoribonuclease nendou 9 additional evidence though suggests that features distinct from replication fidelity underlie genome expansion in nidovirales these include a peculiar genome organization 9 and a processive replication complex 10importantly cov genome expansion allowed the acquisition and maintenance of genes encoding diverse accessory proteins that may promote virus adaptation to specific hosts and often contribute to the suppression of immune responses as well as to virulence accessory proteins differ in number and sequence even among covs belonging to the same lineage figure 1b raising interesting questions about their origin and evolutionthe acquisition or loss of novel protein-coding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes thus tracing these gainloss events may identify important turning points in viral evolutionamong sars-cov accessory proteins the origin of orf8 has remained mysterious for a while as sars-cov-related sarsr bat viruses were isolated but found to encode divergent orf8 proteins amino acid identity with sars-cov orf8 around 33 11 12 13 very recently sarsr-batcovs from rhinolophus sinicus rs and rhinolophus ferrumequinum rf were isolated 14 15 analysis of the orf8 region revealed high sequence identity with civethuman sars-cov two groups came to the conclusion that recombination within sarsr-rs-covs or between sarsr-rs-covs and sarsr-rf-covs led to the acquisition of an orf8 closely related to that of civethuman sars-cov and ultimately originated the virus responsible for the human epidemic 14 15 interestingly lau and coworkers also reported that the orf8 region has a dnds
  35 in sars-covs isolated from humans but not in sarsr-batcovs indicating the action of positive selection box 1 14 this finding is interesting per se and becomes even more important considering that early in the human epidemic sars-covs acquired a signature 29-nucleotide deletion which split orf8 into two functional orfs orf8a and b 16 these findings suggest that rapid evolution of orf8 might facilitate host shifts 14 this possibility is however questioned by the presence of additional sars-cov human isolates that carry independent and larger deletions in the orf8 region 16 thus an alternative explanation for these findings is that the activity of orf8 became dispensable in the human host if this were the case relaxed purifying selection rather than positive selection might be responsible for the high dnds to disentangle these alternative possibilities we analyzed orf8 in human and civet viruses that carry an intact gene as well as in bat viruses although we confirmed that dnds is well above 1 for humancivet sars-cov orf8 we detected no evidence of positive selection using the m7m8 site models from paml box 2 or with parris partitioning approach for robust inference of selection 17 figure 2a instead we obtained evidence that relaxation of natural selection 18 in orf8 accompanied the shift from bats to civetshumans figure 2a these results suggest no major adaptive role for orf8 during the human sars-cov epidemic and support the view that orf8 is dispensable for virulence and transmission at least in the humancivet hosta similar gene loss from the genome of a bat-derived ancestor occurred during the evolution of hcov-229e covs closely related to hcov-229e were recently isolated from african hipposiderid bats 19 and a cov belonging to the same species as hcov-229e had been described in captive alpacas suffering from an acute respiratory syndrome 20 21 figure 1a analysis of these viral genomes indicated that compared to hcov-229e they carry an additional orf at the genomic 3 end 20 figure 1b this orf which is designated orf8 but shares no homology with the homonymous sars-cov gene has unknown function and shows limited similarities to any other cov gene 20 we analyzed the sequences of recently identified alpha-covs from camels 22 and found that orf8 is encoded by these viruses as well figure 1b thus it is presently unknown whether the loss of orf8 conferred some advantage during the host shift to humans or as in the case of orf8 in sars-cov it became dispensable in the human hostanother interesting feature of some covs is that they encode phosphodiesterases pdes figure 1b these viral enzymes cleave 25-oligoadenylate the product of oas proteins to prevent activation of the cellular endoribonuclease rnase l and consequently block interferon ifn-induced antiviral responses 23 the pde activity in the mouse hepatitis virus mhv ns2a protein is critical for hepatovirulence 23 hcov-oc43 as well as other lineage a nonhuman beta-covs encode ns2a proteins that are characterized by a high degree of sequence similarity to the mhv pde figure 1b a protein with structure and sequence homology to ns2a is also encoded by an unrelated virus group a rotavirus in this case the pde activity resides in the c-terminal portion of vp3 a virulence factor 24 interestingly both vp3 and ns2a show two motifs that are characteristic of the 2h-pde family and share very little sequence similarity to the pde domain of a cellular protein akap7 24 figure 2b akap7 and the viral pdes display structural homology figure 2b and murine akap7 can complement an inactive mhv ns2a gene 25 from an evolutionary standpoint these observations suggest that i beta-covs and rotaviruses have independently acquired pde activities and ii akap7 served as the source gene in both viral genera figure 2b more recently a pde activity was also discovered in the ns4b protein of mers-cov figure 1b and other lineage c beta-covs 26 similar to those in lineage a beta-covs and rotavirus ns4b belongs to the 2h-phosphoesterase family and displays a predicted structure homologous to akap7 26 figure 2b it remains to be determined whether ns4b was acquired by capturing a vertebrate akap7 but the observation that distinct viruses acquired most likely independently a pde activity underscores the importance of these enzymes for viral fitnessit was recently proposed that covs and other viruses stole additional genes from their hosts 27 hemagglutinin-esterases hes are encoded by lineage a beta-covs eg hcov-hku1 and hcov-oc43 figure 1b as well as influenza c virus and toroviruses structural analysis suggested that these viral enzymes derive from an ancestral host lectin although it is unclear whether acquisition occurred in an ancestral virus followed by speciation or multiple times 27 incidentally the n-terminal domain of the cov spike protein is also believed to derive from a cellular lectin 28 unlike the influenza virus c enzyme cov hes lack membrane-fusion activity and are accessory to the spike protein by serving primarily as receptor-destroying enzymes rde  that is they aid viral detachment from carbohydrates present on infected cells 29 30 in fact hes are present only in the genome of lineage a beta-covs most of which use sialic acids as coreceptors 1 figure 1b these observations suggest that sialic acid-binding spike proteins coevolved with he genes serving as rdes this hypothesis is supported by the observation that the mhv spike protein evolved from an ancestral sugar-binding preference to a protein-binding mode and that several mhv strains lost expression of he 27 28 figure 1bfinally it is important to notice that artificial selection can lead to unintended changes in viral genomes such changes most likely result from passages in culture that on one hand relieve the virus from pressures exerted in vivo eg by the host immune system and on the other hand derive from viral adaptation to the in vitro system an example of these effects is the loss of a full-length orf4 in the hcov-229e prototype strain which due to a two-nucleotide deletion has a split gene encoding two proteins orf4a and orf4b 31 32 figure 1b conversely clinical isolates display a full-length orf4 sequence 32 an intact orf4 is also observed in bat and camel viruses related to hcov-229e 19 22 whereas the alpaca alpha-cov displays a one-nucleotide insertion resulting in a frameshift 20 figure 1b the availability of only a single alpaca cov genome makes it impossible to determine whether the inserted sequence is representative of the alpaca cov population or else if it represents a sequencing erroroverall these observations suggest that loss of full-length orf4 is a result of passaging in cell culture a process that often generates attenuated viruses an interesting finding on the role of orf4a came from the observation that its protein product regulates virus production in vitro by functioning as a viroporin
33 most likely the same function is performed by the full-length orf4 as wellviroporins were also detected in sars-cov hcov-oc43 and hcov-nl63 34 35 figure 1b as expected given the relatedness of the two viruses the proteins from hcov-nl63 and hcov-229e share substantial sequence similarity limited similarity is also observed with the sars-cov protein especially in the first and second transmembrane regions suggesting either a common origin or independent acquisition followed by convergent optimization of residues in the transmembrane helices figure 2c conversely the hcov-oc43 protein encoded by orf5 originally denoted ns129 is unrelated to the other cov viroporins both in terms of sequence and of domain topology 34 figure 2c a protein homologous to the hcov-oc43 viroporin is instead encoded by mhv accessory protein ns5a and functions as an antagonist of ifn-induced antiviral responses 34 36 whether the hcov-oc43 viroporin has the same ifn-antagonizing activity remains to be investigated however mutant viruses lacking orf5 display growth defects in vitro and in vivo as well as reduced virulence in mice 34 interestingly the viroporins from sars-cov hcov-nl63 and hcov-229e can complement the viroporin-defective mutant hcov-oc43 in vitro
34 thus the conserved function of cov viroporins was most likely attained by convergent evolution for acquisition of unrelated genesthe evolutionary analysis of mers-cov is a rapidly moving field as sequences from the latest phases of the epidemic have just become available analysis of an ever increasing number of viral sequences of both mers-cov and of related beta-covs revealed that genetic variability in the s gene was shaped by recombination and positive selection in fact both ancient and recent intra-spike recombination events were described 22 40 41 interestingly recombination events with breakpoints within the s gene occurred in camels in saudi arabia and originated the mers-cov lineage that spread to south koreaanalysis of positive selection of mers-cov spike genes indicated that several adaptive variants arose in mers-cov and in phylogenetically related covs 42 contrary to common expectation and to what happened during the sars-cov host shift to humans positive selection did not target the rbd in fact most adaptive substitutions were detected in the region encompassing the heptad repeats regions of central importance for virus cell entry figure 3a 42 43 in other covs variants in the heptad repeats were previously shown to affect host or tissue tropism 44 45 46 interestingly during the south korean outbreak mers-covs that carry point mutations in the spike protein rbd emerged and rapidly spread 47 these viruses showed decreased binding to the cellular receptor 47 figure 3a because several immune epitopes are located in the rbd these findings point to the possibility that mers-cov is evolving to avoid the binding of neutralizing antibodies resulting in a trade-off with receptor-binding affinity 47 if this were the case the phases of mers-cov adaptation to humans may have consisted of initial events that modulated host tropism through changes in the heptad repeats followed by the emergence of virus variants that escape immune responses in mers-cov and other lineage c beta-covs positive selection also targeted the nonstructural components particularly orf1a 48 most adaptive events occurred in nsp3 a multifunctional protein which acts as a viral protease and contributes to the suppression of interferon responses through its deubiquitinating and deisgylating activities 49 selection in nsp3 is ongoing among mers-cov isolated from humans and camels 48 in analogy to the s protein though no major selective event was found to be associated with camel-to-human transmission although a positively selected change r911c in nsp3 was observed among human-derived viruses alone suggesting that viral adaptation to our species represented the underlying pressure 48a recent analysis indicated that hcov-229e may have recombined with the alpaca alpha-cov virus within the s gene as also demonstrated by the distinct phylogenetic trees for the s1 and s2 regions 19 also hcov-229e acquired a deletion in the s gene compared to bat viruses 19 recent sequencing of several of such viruses showed that this deletion is also present in the alpaca cov s gene and in camel-derived alpha-covs 22 this finding is particularly interesting because deletions in the ntd are associated with changes in tissue tropism in tgev transmissible gastroenteritis virus in this porcine virus the spike has dual tropism for the respiratory and intestinal tracts but the n-terminally deleted variants from prcv porcine respiratory coronavirus only infect the respiratory tract 50 51 in chiroptera covs are mainly restricted to the gastrointestinal tract whereas in humans and camelids the upper and lower respiratory airways are infected it will be important to determine whether the s gene deletion in hcov-229e and camelid alphacovs is indeed responsible for a change in tissue tropismrecombination contributed to shaping the diversity of the s gene among hcov-nl63 viruses recombination between an ancestral hcov-nl63 virus and the related pedv was also detected in the m gene that in its 3 portion is more similar to pedv than to hcov-229e 52 like sars-cov hcov-nl63 uses its rbd to bind ace2 the binding site on the cellular receptor is the same for the two viruses but the rdbs show no sequence similarity interestingly the rbds of sars-cov and hcov-nl63 do not display any structural similarity either hcov-nl63 contacts ace2 with three discontinuous beta-loops whereas sars-cov binds the receptor through a continuous subdomain 53 figure 3b these observations suggest that the two viruses independently acquired the ability to bind the same ace2 region via convergent evolution or that they shared an ace2-binding ancestor long ago strikingly tgev which is phylogenetically related to hcov-nl63 uses two regions corresponding to the hcov-nl63 beta-loops to bind a distinct cellular receptor anpep figure 1b figure 3b 54 finally hcov-229e sharing sequence homology with hcov-nl63 and tgev figure 1a binds anpep but engages a region distinct from that bound by tgev 55 overall these data highlight the extraordinary plasticity of cov rbds and their complex evolutionary dynamics whereby divergent evolution can be followed by convergent adaptation to the same receptor this complexity is further expanded by the ability of some covs to use other cellular attachment molecules to complement the function of the rbd indeed the s protein of hcov-nl63 exploits heparan sulfate proteoglycans to adhere to host cells 56 interestingly a similar ability to bind heparan sulfate can be gained by mhv with relatively few in vitro-acquired mutations in the s protein 57 in line with the view that heparan sulfate is an aspecific receptor the mutant mhv viruses display expanded host tropism 57 highlighting the potential relevance of combinatorial receptor usage or receptor shifts for interspecies transmissionrecombination seems to be rampant in hcov-oc43 viruses and contributed to originate the a to e viral genotypes as well as viruses that do not belong to these major genotypes 58 59 60 to our knowledge no study has analyzed the fitness of recombinant viruses or more generally of viruses belonging to distinct genotypes nonetheless two reports indicated that genotype d has become predominant in the east asian population 58 59 whether this is due to population acquired immunity against the older a and b genotypes or to viral features unrelated to antigenicity remains to be determinedthe active recombination in hcov-oc43 suggests that inference of natural selection is best performed by analysis of sequences belonging to the same genotype in one such analysis positive selection was found to act on the s gene of genotype d viruses 61 interestingly several positively selected sites with high posterior probability of positive selection are located in the ntd which is involved in the binding of sialic acidsa positively selected site was located in the ctd a region that has unclear function in the hcov-oc43 s protein as no known protein receptor has been identified to date 61 however recent data from hku1 suggest that by analogy a protein receptor for hcov-oc43 may exist 62 see belowthe structure of the s protein of hku1 was recently solved the glycan-binding site is located in the ntd and is conserved with bovine coronavirus bcov s1 63 nonetheless antibodies against the ctd but not those against the ntd block hku1 infection of human trachealbronchial epithelial cells suggesting that the ctd is the major rbd and that a protein receptor for hku1 exists 62 in analogy to hcov-nl63 glycans may mediate only the initial attachment to the host cellsa recent survey of hku1 clinical isolates from different geographic origins indicated that most viruses from colorado form a subclade in the hku1 phylogeny and carry three distinctive substitutions in the s protein within the ntd ctd and close to the s1s2 cleavage site w197f f613y and h716d respectively 64 it will be interesting to assess whether these differences are functional and derive from a selective processthanks to high-throughput techniques a large number of complete cov genomes have become available to the scientific community and many more will be coming in the near future field studies have contributed enormously to widen our knowledge on the diversity of covs hosted by different vertebrates and epidemiological surveys have provided cov sequences from distinct geographic areas and associated with different disease phenotypes in parallel resources have been created to store and mine these data eg the virus pathogen database and analysis resource vipr 65 these advances have allowed tracing the evolutionary history of the large and complex cov genomes to an unprecedented detail the emerging picture indicates that cov genomes display high plasticity in terms of gene content and recombination the long cov genome expands the sequence space available for adaptive mutation and the spike protein can adapt with relative ease to exploit different cellular receptors these features are likely to underlie the alarming propensity of covs for host jumps despite these advances major challenges remain see outstanding questions efforts to underscore the viral genetic determinants that favor interspecies transmission should be pursued as an effective strategy to prevent or prepare for future hcov emergenceoutstanding questionsdo different genotypes arising from recombination or mutation of the same cov species result in distinct viral phenotypeswhat is the relevance of adaptive changes in nonstructural proteins for host adaptation and what is the role played by accessory proteins in interspecies transmission and virulencewhy do similar viruses determine very different disease phenotypes in distinct mammalian hosts do the viral and host genome interplay in determining disease and to what extentwhat is the distribution of covs in different mammalian orders and how genetically diverse are covs hosted in wild or domestic mammalscan evolutionary information be applied to develop tools to predict which viruses have greater zoonotic potential and may result in the next epidemic
