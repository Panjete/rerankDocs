protein structure analysis of the interactions between sars-cov-2 spike protein and the human ace2 receptor from conformational changes to novel neutralizing antibodies ivan mercurio vincenzo tragni francesco busto anna de grassi ciro pierri leonardo   the scientific community is called to respond to a pandemic of respiratory disease that has spread with impressive rate among people of all the world the new coronavirus has been called sars-cov-2 and the related disease indicated as covid-19 who reports that positive patients in the world increased from 1353361 with 79235 ascertained deaths 9 april 2020 to 10021401 with 499913 confirmed deaths 29 june 2020 in less than 3 months due to covid-19 complications it also appears that these numbers might be a smaller number of real cases due to our inability in quantifying rescued or asymptomatic people to limit death rate and sars-cov-2 spread it needs to develop a vaccine and to identify new small molecules able to prevent or treat covid-19 complications as well as to prepare new quick diagnosis kits able to quantify the real number of people exposed to sars-cov-2 among the main actors of sars-cov-2 infection sars-cov-2 spike proteins rna-dependent rna polymerases and proteases deserve to be mentioned indeed rna-dependent rna polymerase has become one of the main targets of a nucleoside analog antiviral drug the remdesivir already used for reducing complications due to ebola dengue and mers-cov infections 17 at the same time viral protease inhibitors 812 are under investigation for their ability in preventing virus protein cleavage with specific reference to spike protein cleavage 13 leading to the fusion of virus proteins with host cell membranes also anti-inflammatory antibodiesdrugs in combination with anticoagulant molecules are under investigation for limiting coagulopathies 1418 and cytokine signaling impressively triggered by sars-cov-2 infection 1923 finally the same sars-cov-2 spike protein has become the most investigated target due to its ability in forming interactions with the human ace2 receptor causing fusion events that make possible for the virus to penetrate host human cells 2427 the crucial role played by the spike protein is also due to the possibility to use the recombinant sars-cov-2 spike protein for triggering an immune response working as a vaccine that may help in preventing and treating covid-19 similarly to what recently proposed 2834 for clarifying sars-cov-2 infection mechanisms several research groups have recently solved the structure of the entire sars-cov-2 spike protein 6vsbpdb 24 6vxxpdb and 6vybpdb 25 in pre-fusion conformation andor sars-cov-2 spike rbd domain in complex with the human ace2 6vw1pdb 6lzgpdb in light of the available cited crystallizedcryo-em solved structures here we propose a strategy for identifyingdrawing new sars-cov-2 therapeutic antibodies directed against the rbd of sars-cov-2 spike protein that could be used for contrasting sars-cov-2 infection aiming to prevent pre-post-fusion spike conformation interconversion responsible for virus invasion and to provide a molecular structural context for studying new diagnosis kits based on the interactions between our engineered antibodies and the human sars-cov-2 spike rbd cov-spike and ace2 homologous protein-crystallized structures were searched using the folding recognition methods implemented in pgenthreader and i-tasser with this aim the amino acid sequence of the sars-cov-2 spike protein monomer fasta sequence of the monomer taken from 6vsbpdb chain a and of the ace2 fasta sequence of the monomer taken from 6m18pdb chain b were used as query sequences for running pgenthreader httpbioinfcsuclacukpsipred and i-tasser httpszhanglabccmbmedumichedui-tasser to screen the pdb searching for the most similar deposited crystallized structures 3538 the sequences of the retrieved 48 crystallized structures with reference to those crystallized structures indicated with certain or high confidence level in the pgenthreader output were aligned using clustalw 39 implemented in the jalview package 40 the 3d coordinates from the 48 crystallized structures were superimposed using the super command available in pymol 41 the super command allows aligning the selected proteins under investigation for performing a comparative structural analysis due to its ability in providing a sequence-independent structure-based pairwise alignment notably the super command is more robust than the align command because it successfully performs also superimposition of proteins with a lower sequence similarity 37 42 proteinprotein and proteinligand binding regions were highlighted by selecting residues within 4  at the proteinprotein interface or from the investigated ligands in the superimposed structures all the generated 3d all-atom models were energetically minimized using the yasara minimization server 43 or the rosetta relax application within the rosetta scoring and prep tools httpswwwrosettacommonsorgdemoslatesttutorialsscoringandprepscoringandprep 5759 independently the 3d comparative model of sars-cov-2 spike trimer in post-fusion conformation was built by multi-template modeling using modeller 44 more in detail the human sars-cov-2 spike protein sequence was aligned to the sequences of the available entire post-fusion conformation of the murine coronavirus spike protein 6b3opdb 45 and the remaining available crystallized subdomains of other coronavirus spike proteins in post-fusion conformations 5yl9pdb 46 1wyypdb 47 and 1wdfpdb 48 sequences of the cited crystallized structure fragments were used as query sequences for sampling the corresponding entire spike monomer sequences by reciprocal-blastp to be aligned with sequences of the investigated structures for comparative purposes the obtained msa was used for driving the multi-template modeling then a complex 3d model representing the pre-fusion spike trimer interacting with three ace2 functional receptor units was built by superimposing the recently solved cryo-em prefusion structure of sars-cov-2 spike trimer complex 6vsbpdb 24 6vybpdb and 6vxxpdb 25 the sars-cov-2 spike rbd crystallized in complex with the human ace2 6vw1pdb 6lzgpdb the sars-cov-1 spike trimer interacting with one ace2 functional receptor conformations 13 6acgpdb 6acjpdb 6ackpdb 49 and 6cs2pdb 50 the sars-cov-1 spike-rbd crystallized in complex with the human ace2 2ajfpdb 51 for investigating pre-post-fusion conformation interconversion we superimposed the pre-fusion available crystallized structures of sars-cov2 spike proteins and the generated 3d models about the pre-fusion conformation of the spike trimer in complex with three ace2 units to the obtained 3d model of the post-fusion conformation all the generated 3d all-atom models were energetically minimized using the yasara minimization server 43 or the rosetta relax application within the rosetta scoring and prep tools httpswwwrosettacommonsorgdemoslatesttutorialsscoringandprepscoringandprep 5759 independently starting from the 3d atomic coordinates of the crystallized neutralizing antibodies m396 2dd8pdb 52 and s230 6nb7pdb 53 both complexed with the sars-cov-1 spike rbd domain we modelled the interactions of m396 and s230 6nb7pdb 53 with sars-cov-2 spike rbd domain by superimposing the fragment antigen-based fab portions of m396 2dd8pdb 52 and s230 6nb7pdb 53 with the sars-cov-2 spike rbd domain complexed with ace2 6vw1pdb using pymol for creating a more specific antibody directed against sars-cov-2 spike rbd we replaced residues of the cdr regions of the m396 crystallized fab portion with residues that may complement and fulfill better the sars-cov-2 rbd surface also based on interactions observed in the crystallized structures of sars-cov-2-rbd-ace2 protein complex mutagenesis analyses and modeling of the incomplete residues within the crystallized structures were performed using spdbv 54 andor pymol 55 the proposed complete igg chimeric antibodies were obtained by superimposing the above-cited m396 and the resulting engineered fab portions in complex with sars-cov-12 rbd to the 3d atomic model of a crystallized igg available on the pdb 1igtpdb 56 using spdbv and pymol more in detail m396 and the engineered fab portions were superimposed through the pymol super command to the fab portions of the crystallized structure of an igg 1igtpdb starting from the structural alignment of their backbones then it was possible to model missing residues located at the fabfc interface solving clashes and breaks in the backbone 37 38 42 by using spdbv each glycosylation ladder coming from the crystal structures here investigated 1igtpdb 2dd8pdb 6nb7pdb was alternatively retained within the generated structural models after superimposition operations allowing backbone connections we renumbered all the atoms and the residues present in the resulting final pdb file using an in-house developed perl script all the generated 3d all-atom models were energetically minimized using the yasara minimization server 43 or the rosetta relax application within the rosetta scoring and prep tools httpswwwrosettacommonsorgdemoslatesttutorialsscoringandprepscoringandprep 5759 independently the obtained final models were examined in vmd pymol and spdbv by visual inspection searching for putative unsolved clashes 38 42 the foldx analysecomplex assay was performed to determine the interaction energy between the four generated antibodies and the rbd domains of sars-cov-12 spike proteins but also for determining the interaction energy between ace2 and the interacting spike rbds for comparative purposes the way the foldx analysecomplex operates is by unfolding the selected targets and determining the stability of the remaining molecules and then subtracting the sum of the individual energies from global energy more negative energies indicate a better binding positive energies indicate no binding 60 61 the energy calculated for the crystallized m396-sars-cov-1 rbd protein complex was used as a reference value rosetta applications combine several tools to model and analyze macromolecular structures httpswwwrosettacommonsorgdocslatesthome we chose to use the residueenergybreakdown and the interfaceanalyzer applications httpswwwrosettacommonsorgdemoslatesttutorialsscoringandprepscoringandprep from rosetta scoring and prep tools for analyzing sars-cov-2 spike rbdace2 interface interactions the rosetta residueenergybreakdown application was used to examine the contribution of each protein residue to the score for the lowest energy backbone relaxed structures whereas the rosetta interfaceanalyzer application was used for evaluating interactions across the antibodyreceptor interface 57 6264 the main event that allows virus envelop fusion with the host human cell plasma membrane concerns a conformational change occurring at the sars-cov-2 spike protein that converts from pre-fusion conformation to post-fusion conformation after interactions with ace2 and spike protein cleavage while sars-cov-2 spike protein trimer has been resolved by cryo-em 6vsbpdb 24 6vxxpdb and 6vybpdb 25 the post-fusion conformation is not available yet according to 13 coutard et al protein cleavage at site s1s2 and s2 produces the division of the spike protein in two subdomains ie the n-ter s-i ectodomain containing the rbd interacting with ace2 and the c-ter s-ii membrane-anchored subdomain that will form the sars-cov-2 spike protein in post-fusion conformation able to trigger the fusion of the viral envelope with host cell plasma membrane determining host cell invasion for modelling 3d post-fusion conformation of sars-cov-2 spike protein we searched for sars-cov-2 spike protein homologous structures and found that 48 crystallized structures that included poses of the whole sars-cov-2 spike proteins or about protein domains of sars-cov-2 spike proteins in complex with protein interactors ie ace2 several pre-fusion conformations of other coronavirus spike proteins one spike protein in post-fusion conformation and three further protein subdomains about spike proteins in post-fusion conformation supplementary table 1 thus we built an msa by aligning the sequence of the human sars-cov-2 spike protein the sequence of the available whole post-fusion conformation of a spike protein 6b3opdb 45 sequences of the remaining crystallized subdomains of other virus spike proteins in post-fusion conformations 5yl9pdb 46 1wyypdb 47 and 1wdfpdb 48 together with their complete counterpart sequences sampled by reciprocal-blastp fig 1 in the provided msa fig 1 it is possible to observe the conserved s1s2 and s2 cleavage sites according to 13 and the sequence of the c-terminal domain resulting from the cleavage furthermore it is also possible to observe several clusters of conserved residues fig 1 that were used as anchor points of the proposed sars-cov-2 spike sequencemulti-template-structure alignment for building the 3d model of a monomer of sars-cov-2 spike protein in post-fusion conformation fig 2 among those conserved protein regions six clusters of residues host conserved cysteine residues fig 2 forming disulfide bridges crucial for stabilizing both pre-fusion and post-fusion sars-cov-2 spike protein conformation 45 the modelled sars-cov-2 spike post-fusion conformation consists of residues 704771 and 9221147 yp0097243901 residues numbering resulting from protein cleavage 13 those protein fragments are the main constituents of the post-fusion conformation and also the only fragments which can be modelled using as a protein template the uniquegreatest existing solved post-fusion conformation structure of a sequencestructure related spike protein 6b3opdb amino acids 741807 and 9721248 np04530016b3opdb residues numbering 45 the trimer of the sars-cov-2 spike protein in post-fusion conformation was obtained by duplicating two times the obtained monomer and superimposing the resulting three sars-cov-2 spike protein monomers on the three spike protein monomers reported in 6b3opdb fig 2 the releaxed 3d comparative model of sars-cov-2 spike protein trimer built by multi-template comparative modeling showed an rmsd lower than 05  with the available spike protein in post-fusion conformation 6b3opdb the resulting model fig 2 appeared elongated and narrow with respect to the pre-fusion conformation according to what observed in fragments of the spike proteins crystallized in post-fusion conformations whose sequences are reported in fig 1 and whose pdbids are listed in supplementary table 1 the resulting sars-cov-2 spike post-fusion spike conformation was obtained following the loss of the cited n-terminal domain residues 1703 black cartoon yp0097243901 residues numbering fig 3 and of a middle protein portion residues 772921 black cartoon the resulting post-fusion structure shows regions that underwent few conformational changes with respect to the pre-fusion structure ie see residues 715771 yellow cartoon 9831028 red cartoon 10291126 magenta cartoon yp0097243901 residues numbering fig 3 whereas other regions show important conformational changes ie see residues 704715 yellow cartoon 922979 green cartoon 11271146 orange cartoon yp0097243901 residues numbering fig 3 notably regions showing few conformational changes are those hosting conserved cysteine residues involved in disulfide bridges in both pre-fusion and post-fusion structures figs 1 3 on the other hand the important conformational changes observed at regions 704715 and 11271146 appears to be related to the loss of the n-terminal portion residues 1703 black cartoon which causes the reorientation of the 704715 peptide involved in the perturbation of the 11271146 protein region that can re-orient itself in the free space due to the n-terminal missing residues similarly the important conformational changes observed at the 922982 protein region fig 3 appears to be due to the loss of the middle protein region residues 772921 black cartoon fig 3 whose removal causes the reorientation and the relaxation of the 922982 amino acid protein region green cartoon fig 3 that may occupy the space previously occupied by the cleaved n-terminal region 1703 residues black cartoon notably a further stabilization of the post-fusion conformation depends on the re-orientation of the c-terminal 11211196 protein region orange and cyan cartoon fig 4 indeed the c-terminal portion with specific reference to residues 11791196 of each monomer is deeply involved in intermonomer hydrophilic and ionic interactions with residues of the 922982 re-oriented amino acid protein region with specific reference to residues 926949 of the close monomers notably the 11471196 protein region was not solved in the pre-fusion structure fig 4 but the previous protein segment ie residues 11211146 showed a completely different orientation in the available pre-fusion structures among the sampled crystallized structures it was possible to observe three pdbids about the entire sars-cov-2 spike proteins and two about sars-cov-2 spike rbd protein interacting with the human ace2 supplementary table 1 furthermore it was possible to highlight several crystallized structures about sars-cov-1 and mers-cov spike proteins as single proteins or in complex with their receptors or dedicated antibodies supplementary table 1 notably among the sampled structures also the four entries used for building the 3d comparative model of the post-fusion conformation were considered supplementary table 1 for modeling main interactions occurring between sars-cov-2 spike proteins and ace2 thanks to the high percentage of identical residues shared by spike rbd from several cov strains fig 5 it was possible to structurally align three objects consisting of the human ace2-sars-cov-1 spike-rbd protein complex 2ajfpdb to the human ace2-sars-cov-2 spike-rbd protein complex 6vw1pdb 6lzgpdb and the sars-cov-2 spike protein trimer 6vsbpdb 6vxxpdb 6vybpdb more in detail the superimposition performed using pymol was led by the structural alignment of the rbd of ace2-sars-cov1 2ajfpdb and ace-2-sars-cov-2 6vw1pdb 6lzgpdb spike proteins fig 6 followed by the structure alignment with sars-cov-2 spike protein trimer 6vsbpdb 6vxxpdb 6vybpdb notably we obtained an efficient superimposition of the two rbd domains rmsd lower than 05  of the human sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 spike proteins also due to their high percentage of identical residues  75 it was possible to superimpose the crystallized sars-cov-2 spike protein in pre-fusion conformation and the modelled sars-cov-2 spike protein trimers in post-fusion conformation for showing the deep conformational changes occurring along conformation interconversion fig 6 indeed it is known that rbd subunits are further mobile being able to exhibit multiple conformational states that modulate the accessibility of rbds triggering interactions with receptor proteins of the host cell plasma membranes 53 in the proposed conformational changes reported in the scheme of fig 6 the sars-cov-2 spike protein goes from a closed state in which rbd residues interacting with ace2 are not accessible fig 6a g to a partially open state with one fig 6b h or two fig 6c i rbd accessible subunits till a final open state in which rbd residues interacting with ace2 at each rbd subunits are accessible and ready to establish interactions with ace2 fig 6d j the established rbdace2 interactions are the first step of the fusion of plasma membrane with the viral protein envelop followed by cleavage events and conformational changes that determine the set-up of the post-fusion conformation fig 6e f k l the resulting post-fusion conformation appears to be elongated about 180  long and narrower figs 3 4 6f l than the pre-fusion conformation about 88  long a structural comparison is viewable in figs 3 4 6e k the top portion of the post-fusion conformation extends beyond ace2 receptors fig 6e k known for being anchored to the plasma membrane and involved in internalization events 8 49 52 53 65 from the available crystallized structures and from the obtained 3d structure models it was possible to highlight sars-cov-1 spike rbd 2ajfpdb and sars-cov-2 spike rbd residues 6 involved in the binding of the human ace2 fig 7 and supplementary table 1 notably ion-pair interactions observed between sars-cov-1 spike rbd and the human ace2 are also observed between sars-cov-2 spike rbd and the human ace2 the reported data represent an updatedintegrated analysis of a similar one reported in 66 in light of the recently deposited sars-cov-2 spike rbd in complex with the human ace2 6vw1pdb rbd from sars-cov-1 was crystallized in complex with the fab domain of two different antibodies namely m396 2dd8pdb 52 and s230 6nb7pdb 53 both of them show high affinity for sars-cov-1 spike rbd 52 53 nevertheless they show different peculiarities in their mechanism of action indeed s230 after binding rbd similarly to ace2 can trigger the sars-cov spike transition to the post-fusion conformation and it is not clarified yet if viruscell fusion may be triggered by s230 also when s230-rbd interactions occur close to the surface of the host cell plasma membrane protein targets of the sars-cov-1 53 at variance with s230 the m396 antibody appears to be able to prevent sars-cov-1 spike-ace2 interactions and sars-cov-1 spike pre-post-fusion conformation transition neutralizing virus attack 52 thanks to the high percentage of identical residues  75 between sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 spike rbd domains and to their highly similar tertiary structure as observed from the rmsd of 05  between the coordinates of rbds from sars-cov-1 6nb7pdb 53 and 2dd8pdb 52 and sars-cov-2 6vw1pdb 67 and 6vsbpdb 24 spike proteins it was possible to evaluate interactions between m396 and sars-cov-2 spike rbd and to propose a sequencestructure of an ideal fab m396-based chimeric antibody for targeting sars-cov-2 spike rbd domain preventing fusion events with ace2 and thus the following infection with this aim we first highlighted the different rbd portions bound to the known antibodies then we superimposed sars-cov-1 rbd to sars-cov-2 rbd for highlighting differences in residues involved in direct interactions with m396 cdr regions and with s230 cdr regions fig 8 and table 1 due to the uncertain data concerning fusion events and mechanism of action of s230 antibody we built a new sars-cov-12 rbd-directed antibody focusing and starting from the analysis of monomermonomer interface interactions observed between the m396 antibody crystallized in complex with sars-cov-1 rbd 52 superimposed to sars-cov-1 spike rbdace2 complex 2ajfpdb and by comparing them with monomermonomer interface interactions observed between the modelled m396 antibody in complex with sars-cov-2 rbd superimposed to sars-cov-2 rbdace2 6vw1pdb 6lzgpdb protein complex fig 9 then we highlighted m396 cdr residues table 2 for replacing them aiming to increase m392 affinity versus sars-cov-12 spike rbds residues to be mutatedreplaced were chosen according to space-restraints and chemical needs for better complementing sars-cov-12 spike rbd surface based on the available sars-cov-12 rbd structures in complex with ace2 aiming to produce something that resembled ace2 surface tables 1 2 some of the proposed mutated residues table 3 are surely allowed because already observed at the corresponding sites of other known antibodies according to chotiakabat rules httpwwwbioinforgukabschothiahtml 68 residue replacement was directly performed in the newly generated 3d model hosting the interacting m396-sars-cov-2 spike rbd similarly a complex of the modified m396 antibody interacting with sars-cov-1 rbd was also created all m396 cdr mutated residues are reported in table 3 furthermore mutated residues within m396 cdr interacting with sars-cov-2 spike rbd residues can be observed in fig 10 the engineered fab portions were thus aligned and superimposed on the fab portion of a crystallized igg 1igtpdb 56 the sequence of the chimeric antibodies can be observed in supplementary fig 1 whereas their complete structure can be observed in supplementary fig 2 the interaction energies calculated between the sars-cov-2 spike rbd domain and m396 native antibody fab portion give a negative value table 4 confirming that there might be a binding interaction between m396 native antibody fab portion and sars-cov-2 spike rbd this result is encouraging also due to the indirect validation obtained by getting similar interaction energies for the crystallized sars-cov-1 rbd in complex with m396 2d88pdb and for sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 spike rbd domains crystallized in complex with ace2 2ajfpdb and 6vw1pdb respectively table 4 furthermore a strong interaction in terms of interaction energies calculated by foldx analyse complex assay is also predicted between sars-cov-2 spike rbd but also sars-cov-1 spike rbd and the modified m396 antibody see table 4 suggesting that the engineered m396 might be more efficient than the native m396 in binding the sars-cov-2 more than sars-cov-1 spike rbd the rosetta relax application was used for relaxing energetically the investigated crystallized structures and 3d models in the rosetta force field and for each relaxation run the script provided a new pdb file whose structural energy features are reported in table 5 the residueenergybreakdown tool confirmed that the m396sars-cov-2 spike rbd complex might have a number of interchain interactions comparable to those observed at the interface of the crystallized m396sars-cov-1 spike rbd complex supplementary tables 2 and 3 furthermore the proposed mutations favor new interactions at the interface of the m396-based mutated antibody and sars-cov-12 spike rbds at the level of the proposed ten mutations and in their neighborhoods supplementary tables 25 then the investigated crystallized structures and 3d models were analysed with the rosetta interfaceanalyzer application for estimating interchain binding energies the analyses provided negative binding energies see dgseparated parameter table 5 for all the investigated structures indicating a binding interaction between m396 native antibody fab portion and sars-cov-2 spike rbd comparable in terms of binding energy to the ones calculated for the crystallized sars-cov-1 spike rbdm396 protein complex notably the resulting binding energies obtained for the 3d models hosting the investigated m396 and m396-based modified antibodies in complex with sars-cov-12 spike rbd domains were comparable see dgseparated parameter table 5 to the binding energies calculated for the 3d models hosting the crystallized sars-cov-12 spike rbd domains in complex with ace2 2ajfpdb and 6vw1pdb respectively table 5 supplementary tables 27 the indicated pipeline has allowed to set up a molecular framework hosting sars-cov-2 spike protein ace2 receptor and different antibodies in the same pdb session that could be handled with different molecular visualizers in this molecular framework it is possible to study and predict at molecular level interactions between the different pieces of the framework that may help in understanding virus invasion mechanisms developing new vaccines or antibodies identifying small molecules with high affinity for viral proteins and establishing quicksafe diagnosis selectivespecific kits indeed the scientific community is now focused in the development of new weapons for containing sars-cov-2 spread and covid-19 complications as it could be observed in the enormous effort in developing new vaccines based on a virus proteinnucleic acid portion able to induce an efficient and specific immunogenic response 6973 or in developing a neutralizing therapeutic antibody highly specific for sars-cov-2 spike rbd 29 30 7477 maybe starting from antibodies isolated from hyperimmune plasma from convalescent patients 78 or in identifying chemicals with high affinity for sars-cov-2 crucial proteins 13 7982 maybe chosen also among repositories of inhibitors of proteases or rna-dependent polymerases 8385 notably it needs to develop trustable titer serologic assay kits for establishing the level of the antibodies in different biological samples indeed the most important question ie the ones about the real number of people exposed to the virus has not a clear answer yet 77 8688 within the presented molecular framework we have highlighted a set of possible efficient interactions between the crystallized m396 antibody and sars-cov-2 spike rbd raising the question about the possibility to test directly m396 on cultured cells exposed to the virus and then hopefully on patients starting from that observation we have also proposed a set of modifications of m396 cdr residues resulting in a higher specific antibody to be expressed and tested on cultured cells along the development of our antibody engineering modeling session an important paper was published and another is under revision in support of the hypothesis that m396 may be able to bind sars-cov-2 spike protein 74 75 foldx and rosetta analyses employed independently for monitoring binding energies at the antibody receptor interface provided coherent results strengthening the hypothesis that the original m396 antibody might have high affinity also against sars-cov-2 spike protein as indicated by the calculated negative binding energy see the foldx interaction energy parameter or the rosetta dgseparated parameter furthermore the employed tools indicate a local break down in structural energy in correspondence of the proposed mutated sites at the antibodyreceptor complex interfaces reflecting an increased affinity in terms of newly established interactions among the investigated m396-based mutated antibodies and sars-cov-12 spike rbds although the calculated binding energies cannot be considered an absolute estimation of the real affinity between the investigated proteins the binding energies obtained for the analysed crystallized structures and 3d engineered models were of the same order of magnitude suggesting that the original m396 and the m396-based modified antibody might be very efficient in binding the sars-cov-2 as well as sars-cov-1 spike rbd it was also possible to pose in the proposed molecular framework the recent proposed sars-cov-2 spike rbd directed cr3022 fab antibody 6ylapdb 6w41pdb 75 showing that it binds a different site of rbd that protrudes towards the central cavity of the spike protein trimer data not shown it appears that the rbd-antibody interaction is possible only if at least two rbds on the trimeric spike protein are in the open state of the prefusion conformation and slightly rotated in a site distant from ace2 receptor-binding region according to what proposed by the authors 75 dedicated studies are necessary for understanding if steric hindering problems might arise using the whole antibody and deepening the comprehension of the not competitive mechanism that would be observed between cr3022 and rbd in presence of ace2 receptor studying all the cited interactions in the same pdb-molecular session has allowed highlighting the most crucial ace2 portions involved in direct interactions with sars-cov-2 rbd suggesting that the administration of the recombinant rbd a spike monomer or the entire spike trimer if correctly folded might result in the efficient triggering of antibody production from our plasma b-cells reducing covid-19 complications supporting what has been recently proposed 6973 at the same time the ace2rbd interaction estimated in our molecular framework has strengthened the hypothesis to use the recombinant ace2 for limiting covid-19 infection complications according to what recently proposed 89 90 a molecular framework like the ones here proposed will also help in studying the putative role of ace inhibitors in perturbing ace2rbd interactions indeed it was recently proposed that patients treated with ace inhibitors might be more exposed to sars-cov-2 infection 91 although ace1 refseq accession number np0685761 representing the main target of ace inhibitors and ace2 np6900431 testis isoform or np000780 somatic isoform among the most studied isoforms share the 40 of identical residues few uncertain data about ace inhibitors and a possible greater selectivity for ace1 versus ace2 or on their effect on ace12 expression regulation are available in the literature 91 92 from a structural comparison it is observed that the rmsd of the crystallized native ace2 coordinates 1r42pdb 93 and ace1 coordinates 1o8apdb 94 is lower than 25  notably the presence of ace inhibitors captopril and enalaprilat 1uzepdb 95 4c2ppdb 96 and lisinopril 1o86pdb 94 produces an rmsd lower than 03  in the atomic coordinates of the cited crystallized structures with reference to the native ace2 1r42pdb 93 conversely we cannot establish if the slightly higher rmsd observed between the native ace2 1r42pdb and ace2 complexed with sars-cov-1 spike rbd 041  2ajfpdb and sars-cov-2 spike rbd 12  6vw1pdb can be attributed exclusively to interactions with sars-cov-12 spike rbds because the observed rmsds are of the same order of magnitude of the experimental resolution of the investigated crystallized structures however also admitting that ace1 inhibitors at the employed dosage would target ace2 with the same efficiency observed versus ace1 the presence of those inhibitors in ace2 binding cavity should not be able to induce an important conformational change in ace2 which might favor a greater affinity of ace2 versus sars-cov-2 spike rbd thus the only mechanism for which patients treated with ace inhibitors would be more exposed to sars-cov-2 would rely on a positive feedback induced by ace inhibitors in ace2 expression nevertheless pieces of evidence in support of this hypothesis need to be deepened 92 97 along with manuscript revisions a couple of interesting papers have been published on this concern showing that patients treated with ace inhibitors show a slightly less severe set of complications due to covid-19 than patients that do not use ace inhibitors 98 99 in conclusion the presented analysis highlights the importance to use fold recognition tools along the approach to a drug design problem according to a rational protocol similar to what previously reported 37 38 42 like the ones presented indeed in this case fold recognition tools have helped us in identifying crystallized structures of ace2 and sars-cov spike proteins similar to those under investigation in just 2 days furthermore performing structural comparative analysis has allowed us to identify a possible good starting point like the ones represented by m396 already crystallized in complex with sars-cov-1 spike rbd for building the proposed antibodies in just few weeks the same strategy might be promptly applied also for future infections by those researchers involved in drawing new antibodies andor developing new vaccines ie for dealing with future coronaviruses outbreaks to the best of our knowledge the reported sars-cov-2 spike protein trimer 3d model is the first model describing a possible conformational change leading to a reliable sars-cov-2 spike protein in post-fusion conformation the proposed model based on the only available spike protein 6b3opdb crystallized in post-fusion conformation will help in understanding the mechanism allowing the virus envelop fusion with host cell plasma membranes through and following interactions with ace2 notably it was possible to propose a 3d model for the main states reached by the sars-cov-2 spike protein through the cited conformational changes leading to the post-fusion conformation because a closed state in which rbd residues interacting with ace2 are not accessible a partially open state with one or two rbd accessible subunits a final open state in which rbd residues interacting with ace2 at each rbd subunits are accessible and ready to establish interactions with ace2 and a post-fusion conformation were already described for mers-cov 6nb3pdb 6nb4pdb and sars-cov-1 6nb6pdb 6nb7pdb 6b3opdb spike proteins 45 53 considering that ace2 works as a dimer and the spike protein consists of a trimer it might be even speculated that a fusion complete mechanism might involve three ace2 dimers and two spike trimers simultaneously notably since 27 may 2020 three crystallized structures of sars-cov-2 spike protein in the closed conformation with not accessible rbd subunits or in the partially open conformations with one or two accessible rbd subunits without ace2 interacting subunits have been deposited 6x2apdb 6x2bpdb and 6x2cpdb and are coherent with our proposed corresponding models indeed the rmsd between the coordinates of the crystallized 6x2cpdb closed state and our starting crystallized structures 6vsbpdb 6vxxpdb depicting a possible closed state of sars-cov-2 spike protein is lower than 13  furthermore the rmsd between the coordinates of the crystallized partially open states of sars-cov-2 spike protein 6x2bpdb showing two accessible rbds and 6x2apdb showing one accessible rbd and our corresponding 3d models showing two or one accessible rbds is lower than 14  in both cases our analysis through the provided 3d model in post-fusion conformation coherently to the crystallized 3d structure of sars-cov-2 spike protein in pre-fusion conformation further confirms the presence and stability of a sort of channel at the interface of the three monomers that could represent a good target site for a virtual screening of a chemicaldrug library aiming to identify a small moleculepeptide with high affinity for the central region of the spike protein trimer which should be able to block conformational changes leading to post-fusion conformation indeed it was recently observed that a peptide named ek1 5zvmpdb 100 showing high affinity for the 920935 protein region yp0097243901 residues numbering was able to prevent conformational changes and post-fusion conformation stabilization the screening of a drugpeptide library would help in identifying an already approved drugpeptide maybe structurally related to ek1 with high affinity for the spike trimer central channel that might be immediately translated to the patient bed-side after successful in silico analyses in the context of the drug-repositioning approaches 101 102 notably the provided molecular framework for investigatingdrawing new antibodies based on space-restraints needs would be used for the set-up of new antibodies based on the available tissue-specific immunoglobulin structures as the proposed igg2a 1igtpdb 56 or other specialized antibodies already optimized for targeting specific cells or receptors ie1hzhpdb 103 also among those that may successfully target the respiratory tract 1r70pdb 104 or 2qtjpdb 105 or 6ue7pdb 106 that might be administered even by aerosol 107 108 at the same time already at the preclinical level the administered vaccines based on the administration of the entire sars-cov-2 spike protein 6971 or on the administration of the single sars-cov-2 spike rbd will induce the production of specific antibodies that might be sequenced and modelled in silico on this concern the provided molecular network will help in quantifying interactions between sars-cov-2 spike rbd also in cases of different rbd variants 109 and the newly investigated antibodies ie lower the calculated binding energy in the modelled complex higher the likelihood to obtain strong rbd-antibody interactions that would result in more efficient treatments the discovered antibodies with the highest affinity for the spike rbd might also be implemented in an antibody titer serologic kit for diagnosis aiming to the early identification and quantification of sars-cov-2 in sera also in asymptomatic people conversely a new diagnosis kit could also be based on the native rbd or a modified synthetic rbd with greater affinity for the detected human antibodies directed against sars-cov-2 spike rbd protein for determining the real number of healthy people already exposed to the virus in the population by quantifying anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies in seraplasma of rescued patients andor asymptomatic peoples the lacking knowledge about the real number of people exposed to the virus including asymptomatic people people with mild symptoms and rescued people that never needed hospitalization or quarantine is the only important data that we still miss without data about the real number of people exposed to the virus in the population coming back to normal life will be extremely slow  title protein structure analysis of the interactions between sars-cov-2 spike protein

severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus cov receptor binding domain rbd angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 fragment antigen binding fab word health organizzation who complementary-determining regions cdr swisspdbviewer spdbv abstract the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome known as corona virus disease 2019 covid-19 has spread so much rapidly and severely to induce world health organization who to declare state of emergency over the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 pandemic while several countries have chosen the almost complete lock-down for slowing down sars-cov-2 spread scientific community is called to respond to the devastating outbreak by identifying new tools for diagnosis and treatment of the dangerous covid-19 with this aim we performed an in silico comparative modeling analysis which allows to gain new insights about the main conformational changes occurring in the sars-cov-2 spike protein at the level of the receptor binding domain rbd along interactions with human cells angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor that favour human cell invasion furthermore our analysis provides i an ideal pipeline to identify already characterized antibodies that might target sars-cov-2 spike rbd for preventing interactions with the human ace2 and ii instructions for building new possible neutralizing antibodies according to chemicalphysical space restraints and complementary determining regions cdr mutagenesis of the identified existing antibodies the proposed antibodies show in silico a high affinity for sars-cov-2 spike rbd and can be used as reference antibodies also for building new high affinity antibodies against present and future coronavirus able to invade human cells through interactions of their spike proteins with the human ace2 more in general our analysis provides indications for the set-up of the right biological molecular context for investigating spike rbd-ace2 interactions for the development of new vaccines diagnosis kits and other treatments based on the usage or the targeting of sars-cov-2 spike protein  scientific community is called to respond to a pandemic of respiratory disease that has spread with impressive rate among people of all the world the new coronavirus has been called sars-cov-2 and the related disease indicated as covid-19 who reports that positive patients in the world are 1353361 with 79235 april 9 th  2020 ascertained died people due to covid-19 complications it also appears that these numbers might be a smaller number of real cases due to our inability in quantifying rescued or asymptomatic people in order to limit death rate and sars-cov-2 spread it needs to develop a vaccine and to identify new small molecules able to prevent or treat covid-19 complications as well as to prepare new quick diagnosis kits able to quantify the real number of people exposed to sars-cov-2 among the main actors of sars-cov-2 infection the sars-cov-2 spike proteins rna dependent rna polymerases and proteases deserve to be mentioned indeed rna dependent rna polymerase has become one of the main targets of a nucleoside analog antiviral drug the remdesivir already used for reducing complications due to ebola dengue and mers-cov infections 1 2 3 4 5 6  at the same time viral protease inhibitors 7 8 9 10 are under investigation for their ability in preventing virus protein with specific reference to spike proteins cleavage 11 leading to the fusion of virus proteins with host cell membranes also anti-inflammatory antibodiesdrugs in combination with anticoagulant molecules are under investigation for limiting coagulopathies 12 13 14 15 and cytokine signaling impressively triggered by sars-cov-2 infection 16 17 18 19 20  finally the same sars-cov-2 spike protein has become the most investigated target due to its ability in forming interactions with the human ace2 receptor causing fusion events that make possible for the virus to penetrate host human cells 21 22 23  the crucial role played by the spike protein is also due to the possibility to use the recombinant sars-cov-2 spike protein for triggering immune response working as a vaccine that may help in preventing and treating covid- 19  similarly to what proposed recently 24 25 26  for clarifying sars-cov-2 infection mechanisms several research groups have recently solved the crystallized structure of the entire sars-cov-2 spike protein 6vsbpdb 21  6vxxpdb and 6vybpdb 22  in pre-fusion conformation andor sars-cov-2 spike rbd domain in complex with the human ace2 6vw1pdb 6lzgpdb in light of the available cited crystallizedcryo-em solved structures here we propose a strategy for identifyingdrawing new sars-cov-2 antibodies directed against the rbd of sars-cov-2 that could be used for contrasting sars-cov-2 infection aiming to prevent pre-post-fusion spike conformation interconversion responsible for virus invasion and to provide a molecular structural context for studying new diagnosis kits based on the interactions between our engineered antibodies and the human sars-cov-2 spike rbd cov-spike and ace2 homologus protein-crystallized structures were searched by using the folding recognition methods implemented in pgenthreader and i-tasser according to our validated protocols 27 28 29 30  the sequences of the retrieved 48 crystallized structures with reference to those crystallized structures indicated with certain or high confidence level in pgenthreader output were aligned by using clustalw 31 implemented in the jalview package 32  the 3d coordinates from the 48 crystallized structures were superimposed for comparative purposes by using pymol 33 according to our validated protocols 29 34  protein-protein and protein-ligand binding regions were highlighted by selecting residues within 4  at the protein-protein interface or from the investigated ligands in the superimposed structures all the generated 3d all atom models were energetically minimized by using the yasara minimization server 35  the 3d comparative model of sars-cov-2 spike trimer in post-fusion conformation was built by multi-template modeling by using modeller 36  more in detail the human sars-cov-2 spike protein sequence was aligned to the sequences of the available entire post fusion conformation of the murine coronavirus spike protein 6b3o 37  and the remaining available crystallized subdomains of other coronavirus spike proteins in post fusion conformations 5yl9pdb 38  1wyypdb 39 and 1wdf 40  sequences of the cited crystallized structure fragments were used as query sequences for sampling the corresponding entire spike monomer sequences by reciprocalblastp to be aligned with sequences of the investigated structures for comparative purposes the obtained msa was used for driving the multi-template modeling then a complex 3d model representing the pre-fusion spike trimer interacting with three ace2 functional receptor units was built by superimposing the recently solved cryo-em prefusion structure of sars-cov-2 spike trimer complex 6vsbpdb 21 6vybpdb and 6vxxpdb 22  the sars-cov-2 spike rbd crystallized in complex with the human ace2 6vw1pdb 6lzgpdb the sars-cov-1 spike trimer interacting with one ace2 functional receptor conformations 1-3 6acgpdb 6acjpdb 6ackpdb 41 and 6cs2pdb 42  the sars-cov-1 spike-rbd crystallized in complex with the human ace2 2ajfpdb 43  for investigating pre-post-fusion conformation interconversion we superimposed the pre-fusion available crystallized structures of sars-cov2 spike proteins and the generated 3d models about pre-fusion conformation of the spike trimer in complex with three ace2 units to the obtained 3d model of the post fusion conformation all the generated 3d all atom models were energetically minimized by using the yasara minimization server 35 starting from the 3d atomic coordinates of the crystallized neutralizing antibodies m396 2dd8pdb 44  and s230 6nb7pdb 45  directed against the sars-cov-1 spike rbd domain we modelled the interactions of m396 and s230 6nb7pdb 45  with sars-cov-2 spike rbd domain by superimposing the fragment antigen based fab portions of m396 2dd8pdb 44  and s230 6nb7pdb 45 both complexed with sars-cov-1 rbd with the sars-cov-2 spike rbd domain complexed with ace2 6vw1pdb by using pymol for creating a more specific antibody directed against sars-cov-2 spike rbd we replaced residues of the cdr regions of the m396 crystallized fab portion with residues that may complement and fulfill better the sars-cov-2 rbd surface mutagenesis analyses and modeling of the incomplete residues within the crystallized structures were performed by using spdbv 46 andor pymol 47  the proposed complete igg chimeric antibodies were obtained by superimposing the above cited m396 and the resulting engineered fab portions in complex with sars-cov-12 rbd to the 3d atomic model of a crystallized igg available on the pdb 1igtpdb 48 by using spdbv and pymol according to our validated protocols 29 30 49  that allow to model missing residues solving clashes and breaks in the backbone each glycosylation ladder coming from the crystal structures here investigated 1igtpdb 2dd8pdb 6nb7pdb was alternatively retained within the generated structural models after superimposition operations allowing backbone connections we renumbered all the atoms and the residues present in the resulting final pdb file by using an in-house developed perl script the obtained final models were examined in vmd pymol and spdbv according to our protocols 30 49  all the generated 3d all atom models were energetically minimized by using the yasara minimization server 35 the foldx analysecomplex assay was performed to determine the interaction energy between the four generated antibodies and the rbd domains of sars-cov-12 spike proteins but also for determining the interaction energy between ace2 and the interacting spike rbds for comparative purposes the way the foldx analysecomplex operates is by unfolding the selected targets and determining the stability of the remaining molecules and then subtracting the sum of the individual energies from the global energy more negative energies indicate a better binding positive energies indicate no binding 50 51  the energy calculated for the crystallized m396-sars-cov-1 rbd protein complex was used as a reference value the main event that allows virus envelop fusion with the host human cell plasma membrane concerns a conformational change occurring at the sars-cov-2 spike protein that converts from pre-fusion conformation to post-fusion conformation after interactions with ace2 and spike protein cleavage while sars-cov-2 spike protein trimer has been resolved by cryo-em 6vsbpdb 21 6vxxpdb and 6vybpdb 22  the post-fusion conformation is not available yet according to 11 coutard et al protein cleavage at site s1s2 and s2 produces the division of the spike protein in two subdomains ie the n-ter s-i ectodomain containing the rbd interacting with ace2 and the c-ter s-ii membrane anchored subdomain forming the sars-cov-2 spike protein in post fusion conformation able to trigger the fusion of the viral envelope with host cell plasma membrane determining host cell invasion in the provided msa  fig 1 it is possible to observe the conserved s1s2 and s2 cleavage sites according to 11 and the sequence of the c-terminal domain resulting from the cleavage starting from the cited multi-template sequence alignment and according to our validated protocols about multi-template 3d modeling 30 36  we built the 3d model of a monomer of sars-cov-2 spike protein in post fusion conformation fig 2  the modelled sars-cov-2 spike post-fusion conformation consists of residues 704-771 and 922-1147 yp0097243901 residues numbering resulting from protein cleavage 11 and also the only protein fragments with a solved structure in 6b3opdb aligned aminoacids 741-807 and 972-1248 np04530016b3opdb residues numbering counterpart 37  the trimer of the sars-cov-2 spike protein in post fusion conformation was obtained by duplicating two times the obtained monomer and superimposing the three sars-cov-2 spike protein monomers on the three sars-cov-1 spike protein monomers reported in 6b3opdb fig 2  the 3d comparative model of sars-cov-2 spike protein trimer built by multi-template comparative modeling showed an rmsd lower than 05  with the murine coronavirus spike protein in post-fusion conformation 6b3opdb the resulting model fig 2  appeared elongated and narrow according to what observed in fragments of the spike proteins crystallized in post-fusion conformations whose sequences are reported in fig 1 and whose pdbid are listed in supp tab 1 for modeling main interactions occurring between sars-cov-2 spike proteins and ace2 thanks to the high percentage of identical residues shared by spike rbd from several cov strains fig 3  it was possible to structurally align three objects consisting of the human ace2-sars-cov-1 spike-rbd protein complex 2ajfpdb to the human ace2-sars-cov-2 spike-rbd protein complex 6vw1pdb 6lzgpdb and the sars-cov-2 spike protein trimer 6vsbpdb 6vxxpdb 6vybpdb more in detail the superimposition performed by using pymol was leaded by the structural alignment of the rbd of ace2-sars-cov1 2ajfpdb and ace-2-sars-cov-2 6vw1pdb 6lzgpdb spike proteins fig 4  followed by the structure alignment with sars-cov-2 spike protein trimer 6vsbpdb 6vxxpdb 6vybpdb notably we obtained an efficient superimposition of the two rbd domains rmsd lower than 05  of the human sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 spike proteins also due to their high percentage of identical residues  75 it was possible to superimpose the crystallized sars-cov-2 spike protein in pre-fusion conformation and the modelled sars-cov-2 spike protein trimers in post-fusion conformation for showing the deep conformational changes occurring along conformation interconversion fig 4  apparently the post-fusion conformation appears to be elongated and narrower than the pre-fusion conformation the top portion of the post-fusion conformation locates beyond ace2 receptors fig 4  known for being anchored to plasma membrane and involved in internalization events 7 41 44 45 52   from the available crystallized structures and from the obtained 3d structure models it was possible to highlight sars-cov-1 spike rbd 2ajfpdb and sars-cov-2 spike rbd residues 6 involved in the binding of the human ace2  fig 5 and supp tab 1 notably ion pair interactions observed between sars-cov-1 spike rbd and the human ace2 are also observed between sars-cov-2 spike rbd and the human ace2 the reported data represents an updatedintegrated analysis of a similar ones reported in 53  in light of the recently deposited sars-cov-2 spike rbd in complex with the human ace2 6vw1pdb  tab 1 list of sarscov1 and sarscov2 rbd residues and of ace2 bold black residues delimited by borders indicate a pair or a cluster of residues involved in polar inter-protein interactions normal black residues indicate residues at the spike-rbdvsace2 protein interface distant less than 4  the longest chains were chosen within those crystallized structures with multiple chains for highlighting the listed interacting residues rbd from sars-cov-1 was crystallized in complex with the fab domain of two different antibodies namely m396 2dd8pdb 44  and s230 6nb7pdb 45  both of them show high affinity for sars-cov-1 spike rbd being able to block attachment to ace2 44 45  nevertheless they show different peculiarities in their mechanism of action indeed s230 after binding rbd similarly to ace2 is able to trigger the sars-cov spike transition to the post-fusion conformation and it is not clarified yet if virus-cell fusion may be triggered by s230 also when s230-rbd interactions occurs close to the surface of the cells target of the sars-cov-1 45  at variance with s230 m396 antibody appears to be able to prevent sars-cov-1 spike-ace2 interactions and sars-cov-1 spike pre-post-fusion conformation transition neutralizing virus attack 44  thanks to the high percentage of identical residues  75  between sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 spike rbd domains and to their highly similar tertiary structure as observed from the rmsd of 05  between the coordinates of rbds from sars-cov-1 6nb7pdb 45 and 2dd8pdb 44  and sars-cov-2 6vw1pdb 54 and 6vsbpdb 21 spike proteins it was possible to evaluate interactions between m396 and sars-cov-2 spike rbd and to propose a sequencestructure of an ideal fab m396-based chimeric antibody for targeting sars-cov-2 spike rbd domain preventing fusion events with ace2 and thus the following infection with this aim we firstly highlighted the different rbd portions bound to the known antibodies then we superimposed sars-cov-1 rbd to sars-cov-2 rbd for highlighting differences in residues involved in direct interactions with m396 cdr regions and with s230 cdr regions  fig 6  due to the uncertain data concerning fusion events and mechanism of action of s230 antibody we built a new sars-cov-12 rbd directed antibody starting from the analysis of monomer-monomer interface interactions observed between the m396 antibody crystallized in complex with sars-cov-1 rbd 44 superimposed to sars-cov-1 spike rbd  ace2 complex 2ajfpdb and by comparing them with monomer-monomer interface interactions observed between the modelled m396 antibody in complex with sars-cov-2 rbd superimposed to sars-cov-2 rbdace2 6vw1pdb 6lzgpdb protein complex fig 7  55 residues replacement was directly performed in the newly generated 3d model hosting the interacting m396-sars-cov-2 spike rbd similarly a complex of the modified m396 antibody interacting with sars-cov-1 rbd was also created all m396 cdr mutated residues are reported in tab 3 furthermore mutated residues within m396 cdr interacting with sars-cov-2 spike rbd residues can be observed in fig 8   the engineered fab portions were thus aligned and superimposed on the fab portion of a crystallized igg 1igtpdb 48  the sequence of the chimeric antibodies can be observed in supp  the interaction energies calculated between the sars-cov-2 spike rbd domain and m396 native antibody fab portion gives a negative value tab 4 confirming that there might be a binding interaction between m396 native antibody fab portion and sars-cov-2 spike rbd this result is encouraging also due to the indirect validation obtained by getting similar interaction energies for the crystallized sars-cov-1 rbd in complex with m396 2d88pdb and for sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 spike rbd domains crystallized in complex with ace2 2ajfpdb and 6vw1pdb respectively tab 4 furthermore a strong interaction in terms of interaction energies calculated by foldx analyse complex assay is also predicted between sars-cov-2 spike rbd but also sars-cov-1 spike rbd and the modified m396 antibody see tab 4 suggesting that the engineered m396 might be more efficient than the native m396 in binding the sars-cov-2 more than sars-cov-1 spike rbd  the indicated pipeline has allowed to set-up a molecular framework hosting sars-cov-2 spike protein ace2 receptor and different antibodies in the same pdb session that could be handled with different molecular visualizers in this molecular framework it is possible to study and predict at molecular level interactions between the different pieces of the framework that my help in a molecular framework like the ones here proposed will also help in studying the putative role of ace inhibitors in perturbing ace2-rbd interactions indeed it was recently proposed that patients treated with ace inhibitors might be more exposed to sars-cov-2 infection 70  although ace1 refseq accession number np0685761 representing the main target of ace inhibitors and ace2 np6900431 testis isoform or np000780 somatic isoform among the most studied isoforms share the 40  of identical residues few uncertain data about ace inhibitors and a possible greater selectivity for ace1 versus ace2 or on their effect on ace12 expression regulation are available in literature 70 71  from a structural comparison it is observed that the rmsd of the crystallized native ace2 coordinates 1r42pdb 72  and ace1 coordinates 1o8apdb 73 is lower than 25  notably the presence of ace inhibitors captopril and enalaprilat 1uzepdb74 4c2ppdb 75  and lisinopril 1o86pdb 73 produces an rmsd lower than 03  in the atomic coordinates of the cited crystallized structures with reference to the native ace1 1r42pdb 72  conversely we cannot establish if the slightly higher rmsd observed between the native ace2 however also admitting that ace1 inhibitors at the employed dosage would target ace2 with the same efficiency observed versus ace1 the presence of those inhibitors in ace2 binding cavity should not be able to induce an important conformational change in ace2 which might favour a greater affinity of ace2 versus sars-cov-2 spike rbd thus the only mechanism for which patients treated with ace inhibitors would be more exposed to sars-cov-2 would rely in a positive feedback induced by ace inhibitors in ace2 expression nevertheless evidences in support of this hypothesis need to be deepened 71 76  in conclusion the presented analysis highlights the importance to use fold recognition tools along the approach to a drug design problem according to a rational protocol similar to what previously reported 29 30 49  like the ones presented high affinity for the spike channel that might be immediately tested on the bed-side in the context of the drug-repositioning approaches 78 79  notably the provided molecular framework for investigatingdrawing new antibodies based on space-restraints needs would be used for the set-up of new antibodies based on the available tissue-specific immunoglobulin structures as the proposed igg2a 1igtpdb 48  or other specialized antibodies already optimized for targeting specific cells or receptors ie1hzhpdb 80 also among those that may successfully target the respiratory tract 1r70pdb 81 or 2qtjpdb 82 or 6ue7pdb 83  that might be administered even by aerosol 84 85  at the same time already at the preclinical level the administered vaccines based on the administration of the entire sars-cov-2 spike protein  56 57 58 or on the administration of the single sars-cov-2 spike rbd will induce the production of specific antibodies that might be sequenced and modelled in silico on this concern the provided molecular network will help in quantifying interactions between sars-cov-2 rbd also in cases of different rbd variants 86  and the newly investigated antibodies ielower the calculated binding energy in the modelled complex higher the likelihood to have more success with the investigated vaccinesantibodies the discovered antibodies with the highest affinity for rbd might also be implemented in a diagnosis kit aiming to the early identification of sars-cov-2 in sera also in asymptomatic people conversely a new diagnosis kit could also be based on the native rbd or a modified synthetic rbd with greater affinity for the detected human antibodies directed against sars-cov-2 spike rbd protein for determining the real number of healthy people already exposed to the virus in the population the lacking knowledge about the real number of people exposed to the virus including asymptomatic people people with mild symptoms and rescued people that never needed hospitalization or quarantine is the only important data that we still miss without data about the real number of people exposed to the virus in the population coming back to normal life will be extremely slower detailed instructions for the set-up of the shown molecular framework have been provided in the manuscript nevertheless we can also

william schief r brian pierce g   coronaviruses covs have been responsible for several outbreaks over the past two decades including sars-cov in 2002-2003 mers-cov in 2012 1 and the current covid-19 pandemic caused by sars-cov-2 which began in late 2019 2 the scale of the covid-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented efforts by the research community to rapidly identify and test therapeutics and vaccines and to understand the molecular basis of sars-cov-2 entry pathogenesis and immune targeting since february 2020 a large number of sars-cov-2 protein structures have been released in the protein data bank pdb 3 as of june 17th 2020 this includes 28 spike glycoprotein structures over 150 main protease structures and over 60 structures of other sars-cov-2 proteins these high-resolution protein structures are of immense importance for understanding viral assembly and to aid rational vaccine and therapeutic design the first structures of the sars-cov-2 trimeric spike glycoproteins the major target of sars-cov-2 vaccines and antibody therapeutics were reported in february and early march 2020 45 previously determined spike glycoprotein structures have enabled advances including rational stability optimization of sars-cov and mers-cov spikes yielding improved protein expression and immunogenicity 6 given that the rapid rate of coronavirus protein structural determination and deposition is likely to continue a simple and updated resource detailing these structures would provide a useful reference here we describe a new database of experimentally determined coronavirus protein structures cov3d cov3d is updated automatically on a weekly basis as new structures are released in the pdb structures are classified by cov protein as well as bound molecule such as

reference sequences were generated using clustalx 17 and visualized using the ape package 18 in r wwwr-projectorg the main components of the cov3d database are interrelated tables datasets and tools for coronavirus protein structures and spike glycoprotein sequences a schematic of the cov3d input organization and contents is shown in figure 1 the structure portion of the database includes dedicated pages and tables for spike glycoprotein structures are annotated by binding partners including bound antibody and receptor as well as domains present in the structure protease structures include annotation of bound ligand for convenience of those investigating protease inhibitors computationally or experimentally antibody structures are annotated by complementarity determining region cdr loop clusters assigned by pyigclassify 19 spike conformational classifications are performed for each chain in structures containing full spike glycoproteins with a receptor binding domain rbd present in the structure unsupervised clustering based on spike root-mean-square distances rmsds automatically classifies the spike structures into two broad clusters figure 2 corresponding to open and closed conformations also referred to as up and down conformations these forms are relevant for receptor binding and vaccine design 45 and annotations of those states based on this analysis are included in cov3d out of 129 sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov spike structures in the current set 39 of them are assigned to the open state while the remaining 90 are closed figure 2 the sequence section of cov3d focuses is focused on spike glycoprotein variability and includes additional features of the database include a page with recently released structures and a downloads page for users to download structural data sequence data and tables summary statistics are also given providing metrics such as number of spike structures released for sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 in addition to a table of all known structures of cov spike proteins and their interactions cov3d provides a viewer with sars-cov-2 spike rbd interactions with antibodies and the ace2 receptor superposed by rbd in a common reference frame figure 3a this viewer permits users to assess overlapping or shared rbd binding modes among antibodies and ace2 one antibody of interest is s309 which is a human antibody that was cloned from an individual who was infected with sars-cov in 2003 and potently neutralizes sars-cov-2 20 comparing its rbd binding with ace2 in the rbd interaction viewer figure 3a highlights how s309 engages the rbd at a distinct site from ace2 in accordance with their lack of observed rbd binding competition 20 the epitope targeted by s309 is dominated by rbd residues 334-346 circled in figure 3a on the cov3d sequence logo generator page users can enter spike residue ranges and generate sequence logos that represent positional residue propensities and conservation for regions of interest based on sets of cov spike sequences a sequence logo generated from a reference set of spike proteins from 18 sars-like covs is shown in figure 3b indicating the conservation of the n-glycosylation site nxsnxt sequon at position 343 and amino acid variability at position 340 which is glutamic acid e in sars-cov-2 both the n343 glycan and the e340 side chain are directly engaged by s309 in the recently determined complex structure 20 n-glycosylation of viral glycoproteins can play a key role by masking the glycoprotein from the immune system or affecting function 21 experimentally reported protein structures often lack n-glycans or large portions thereof due to limitations from resolution or intrinsic glycan dynamics or heterogeneity to enable visualization and additional analysis or modeling of glycosylated spike glycoproteins cov3d includes sets of structures with modeled n-glycans at all predicted glycosylation sites with n-glycans built onto the glycoprotein structures and refined using new tools in rosetta based on previously developed glycan functionality 10 examples of glycosylated structures that can be visualized in cov3d are shown in figure 4 and these can be downloaded directly by users for further processing this permits users to view features such as the n-glycosylation present on the ace2 surface figure 4a and the relatively high glycosylation of the spike glycoprotein stem bottom in figure 4b presently these structures include uniform oligomannose glycoforms that were found to be prevalent on the sars-cov spike based on previous mass spectroscopy analysis 22 with five branched mannose sugars in the future we plan to include more spike structures with modeled glycans and to possibly include glycoforms that reflect mass spectroscopy experimental characterization of the sars-cov-2 spike 23 we have constructed the cov3d database as a reference for the research community providing a simple and updated interface to all coronavirus 3d structures with integrated molecular viewers structural classification and a variety of other useful features this will allow researchers to identify new coronavirus protein structures as they are released particularly for sars-cov-2 while enabling insights into spike glycoprotein antibody recognition sequence features polymorphisms and glycosylation recently released sars-cov-2 spike-antibody complex structures have revealed mechanisms of cross-reactive cov spike targeting and neutralization 202425 and many ongoing antibody identification and characterization studies are likely to result in many more antibody-spike structures in the near future cov3d facilitates the use of these growing structural datasets in analysis modeling and structure-based design

 this in turn raises two interesting possibilities first do the natural genetic polymorphism in human ace2 gene andor protein influence their attachment with sarscov2 spike protein second are these genetic variants of ace2 benign or could it be considered as an evolutionary tradeoff where a variation in a trait may bring both advantage and disadvantage to the fitness of an organism this study aims to explore both these possibilities by a battery of sequence and structure analysis tools the findings provide interesting insights into the potential relationship between natural genetic variants in human ace2 and susceptibility andor resistance against covid19 infection protein sequences of sarscov2 spike protein yp0097243901 and human ace2 q9byf1 were retrieved from ncbi and uniprot respectively structures of both the proteins were identified by pdbblast and retrieved from rcsb protein data bank

 have identified the critical residues that underpin the interaction between the rbd of viral spike protein and ace2 peptidase domain in this study among the 345 and 242 natural ace2 coding variants identified from ensembl genome browser and gnomad respectively 17 were found at positions that have shown to be important for the binding of ace2 with the viral spike protein table s1 allele frequencies of these variants range from 545e6 rs1299103394 to 388e3 rs4646116 to predict the potential pathological consequences rendered by ace2 alleles changes in the free energy of ace2 variants were estimated the results showed that amino acid substitutions in only three alleles rs73635825 s19p rs1299103394 k26e and rs766996587 m82i may adversely affect the stability of the encoded protein compared with the wild type table 1 however to date no pathogenic consequences have been reported in relation to these variants in humans moreover except for rs73635825 s19p which was predicted to be damaging by only polyphen2 different prediction tools designed to assess the functional impact of the mutations andor singlenucleotide polymorphisms did not reveal any ensuing pathogenicity rendered by these variants table 1 conversely rs961360700 d355n and rs762890235 p389h were predicted to be detrimental by sift and polyphen2 whereas rs1396769231 m383t was predicted to be damaging by sift polyphen2 and revel prediction tools nevertheless no report of any functional impact was found in the literature for these allelic variants of ace2 as well to explore the structural changes in the protein encoded by different alleles of ace2 molecular models of all the selected protein variants were developed and superimposed over the structurally resolved template of wildtype ace2 structurally all ace2 variants bear the characteristic two subdomains of peptidase m2 domain with active site cleft present in between the overall protein architecture of ace2 allelic variants is largely conserved with rmsd of c backbone that varies from 017 to 058  compared with the wild type table 1 and figure 1ab like sarscov rbd of sarscov2 spike protein comprises two subdomains core and extended loop cocrystal structures of sarscov and sarscov2 spike proteins complexed with ace2 have demonstrated that the extended loop of rbd directly interacts with loops flanked by 2 and 3 helices and a  hairpin loop between 3 and 4 sheets of ace2

15
 lies at cterminal to these regions though the c backbone of ace2 allelic variants was found to be highly conserved the spatial orientation of substituting residues varied noticeably compared with the wild type figure 1cd therefore it is possible that these variations in the orientation of amino acid side chain may in turn alter the intramolecular interactions in different allelic variants this consequently may affect the orientation of other critical amino acids of ace2 otherwise not substituted in the respective variants but required for the interaction with sarscov2 spike protein to compare the binding of different ace2 allelic variants with sarscov2 spike protein docking poses were generated by the superimposition of structures of ace2 variants over ace2sarscov2 complex structure pdbid 6lzg all ace2 variants were found to bind with the viral spike protein with topology nearly identical to the resolved ace2sarscov2 complex structure pdbid 6lzg figure 2a this is not surprising as no major structural change was observed in the protein backbone of different ace2 variants figure 1ab by and large the nature and number of intermolecular contacts between sarscov2 spike protein and humans ace2 variants were found to be comparable figure 2b however some important variations were observed for example compared with a total of 70 interactions found in sarscov2 spike protein and wildtype ace2 complex 60 and 81 intermolecular interactions were observed between sarscov2 spike protein and rs143936283 e329g and rs961360700 d355n variants of ace2 respectively among the six compared types of interactions the three most strongest chargedcharged chargedpolar and chargedapolar were found nearly identical between rs961360700 d355n and sarscov2 spike protein compared with the wildtype ace2 and sarscov2 spike protein complex in comparison ace2 variant rs143936283 e329g showed less chargedcharged chargedpolar chargedapolar polarapolar and apolarapolar interactions with sarscov2 spike protein this implies that rs143936283 e329g in humans may confer some level of resistance against the attachment of sarscov2 to the receptor molecule however accounting for the dynamic nature of proteinprotein interaction it is difficult to draw a fair conclusion from simply these observations therefore interresidual interaction maps were developed for complexes between each ace2 allelic variant and sarscov2 spike protein the recent cocrystal structure of sarscov2 spike protein with ace2 pdbid 6lzg highlighted the interaction points of both the proteins figure 2c many of these interactions were also reported in a previously resolved structure of sarscov spike proteinace2 complex pdbid 2ajf
14
 a representation of the comparison of these interactions for different ace2 alleles is shown in figure 2d briefly the most conserved intermolecular interactions hydrogen bonds between different ace2 variants and sarscov2 spike protein were found between y41 h34 y83 and k353 of ace2 and t500 y453 except m82i n487 except t27a and d427y and g502 except s19p and e329g of sarscov2 spike protein respectively similarly hydrophobic interactions between k31 and k353 of ace2 and y489 and y505 of sarscov2 spike protein respectively were also found to be conserved in complexes of all ace2 variants with the viral spike protein this implies that none of these ace2 allelic variants offer complete resistance against the attachment of sarscov2 however some important variations are noteworthy to mention here for example q42 of wildtype ace2 interacts with g446 and q449 of the sarscov2 spike protein but all ace2 allelesspike protein complexes did not show any such interaction the q42 of ace2 also interacts with y449 of the spike protein and this interaction is also absent in ace2 alleles corresponding to t27a e35d e37k m82i e329g and m383t amino acid substitutions a similar observation was made for the interaction between e35 of ace2 and q493 of the sarscov2 spike protein figure 2d and supporting information figures this may suggest that ability of e35 and q42 to interact with sarscov2 spike protein could be affected by its spatial positioning in ace2 protein which may get affected by the change in the intramolecular interaction andor electrostatic potential due to the substitution in the flanking residues with respect to the threedimensional conformation of ace2 conversely k353 of ace2 establishes hydrogen bond interactions with g496 and g502 of sarscov2 spike protein both these interactions were found to be absent in only the s19p rs73635825 variant of ace2 moreover the binding affinity of the s19p ace2 variant for sarscov2 spike protein was also predicted to be lowest 103 among all the alleles including the wildtype ace2 similarly e329g ace2 variant which was predicted to have the secondlowest binding affinity 108 for sarscov2 spike protein also lacked k353g502 interaction in the respective complex it is important to note here that k353 is one of the key residues of ace2 that not only showed interaction with the spike proteins of both sarscov
14
 and sarscov2 but also its substitution in in vitro mutation analysis which has been shown to completely abolish the interaction between ace2 and coronavirus spike protein
15
 therefore it is likely that rs73635825 s19p and rs143936283 e329g alleles of ace2 may offer some level of resistance against the sarscov2 attachment with the human ace2 receptor 
ace2 gene encodes a zinc metalloprotease which acts as a receptor molecule for three strains of coronavirus sarscov nl63 and recently sarscov2 several studies have explained the variations in the coronavirus spike protein and host ace2 receptor to predict andor prove the origin and potential of crosstransmission of the virus
1

8
 
9
 however less attention has been given to explore the effect of natural genetic and expressional variants of human ace2 for the potential susceptibility andor resistance against the coronavirus infection in vitro assays have shown that expression of ace2 is positively correlated with the sarscov infection
25
 similarly genetic variants in ace2 have been proposed to affect the interaction of the receptor with the viral spike protein
15
 conversely a recent preliminary study predicts no such link between the human ace2 variants and coronavirus infection
26
 the present study focuses to explore the variation in the binding of the protein encoded by ace2 coding variants with sarscov2 spike protein many coding variants of ace2 in humans have been associated with cardiovascular disorders hypertension and diabetes
27
 
28
 although some variants of ace2 assessed in the present investigation were predicted to have some functional impact but to date no empirical data show their link with any disease or genetic disorder in humans moreover compared with the wild type no significant change has been observed in the overall structural conformation of the ace2 protein variants and the substituted amino acids which are located on one of the subdomains of peptidase m2 distant to the catalytic sites of ace2
24
 thereby it is plausible to suggest that these variants of ace2 may be under neutral selection protein molecular modeling and related bioinformatics tool could provide significant insights to predict the potential variations in the protein structures and complexes
29
 in the present study a comparative modeling and molecular superimposition revealed important variations in the intermolecular interaction between ace2 alleles and sarscov2 spike protein it is interesting to note that for two ace2 alleles rs73635825 s19p and rs143936283 e329g low binding affinity and lack of some of the key residues in the complex formation with sarscov2 spike protein could be suggestive of intrinsic resistance to some scale against the sarscov2 infection therefore it is conceivable that under new selection pressure as offered by sarscov2 these alleles may undergo positive selection however as proteinligand and proteinprotein interactions are dynamic
30
 therefore the implementation of molecular dynamic simulation could further validate the absence of some of the critical interactions between these ace2 alleles and sarscov2 spike protein consistently empirical means of deducing binding affinity of intermolecular complexes could also provide important insights in this regard
31

 where mutations in viruses enable them to cross species barrier andor become more virulent natural genetic variants in host receptors may concomitantly offer susceptibilityresistance against evolving pathogenic viruses for example genetic variations in cd4 receptor c868t and ccr532 in humans confer susceptibility and resistance respectively against certain hiv strains
32
 
33
 the present investigation highlights candidate alleles of ace2 that may lead to the variation in the susceptibility andor resistance against covid19 moreover it provides a template for similar investigations in relation to the recently reported molecule tmprss2 required for priming the spike protein for cellular entry of the virus
34
 finally clinical manifestations and recovery rate of covid19 varies significantly between different age groups nationalities and race
4
 
5
 
35
 it is possible that in some individuals if not all the positive prognosis of the covid19 may be due to the existence of ace2 variants like rs73635825 s19p and rs143936283 e329g therefore the findings of this investigation provide clues to screen frequencies of the candidate alleles in different populations to predict the prognosis of covid19  the discovery of potential natural products for targeting sars-cov-2 spike protein by virtual screening guan-yu chen tsung-you yao azaj ahmed yi-cheng pan juan-cheng yang yang-chang wu  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 enters into the cells through its spike proteins binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 protein and causes virus infection in host cells until now there are no available antiviral drugs have been reported that can effectively block virus infection the study aimed to discover the potential compounds to prevent viral spike proteins to bind to the human ace2 proteins from taiwan database of extracts and compounds tdec by structure-based virtual screening in this study to rapidly discover potential inhibitors against sars-cov-2 spike proteins the molecular docking calculation was performed by autodock vina program herein we found that 39 potential compounds may have good binding affinities and can respectively bind to the viral receptor-binding domain rbd of spike protein in the prefusion conformation and spike-ace2 complex protein in silico among those compounds especially natural products thioflexibilolide a and candidine that were respectively isolated from the soft corals sinularia flexibilis and phaius mishmensis may have better binding affinity than others this study provided the predictions that these compounds may have the potential to prevent sars-cov-2 spike protein from entry into cells  recently world health organization who httpswwwwhoint declared that the outbreak spread of the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 causes over 8 million reported cases and more than 4 hundred thousand deaths in 216 countries most of the coronaviruses cause only mild 3 respiratory distress 1 2  however three coronaviruses namely the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov sars-cov-2 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov have been found so far highly pathogenic transmitted from animal to human 3  the sars-cov in 2003 brings about a 10  case fatality rate cfr and mers presented a cfr of about 344 4 5 6  the cfr for the novel coronavirus cannot be stated at the moment as the pandemic is not over yet although 34 is estimated and one thing is apparent the transmission rate of the infection is higher than the previous outbreaks 7  the sars-cov-2 causes mainly severe acute respiratory distress by attacking lung cells and other complications in the heart kidney brain and spleen and ultimately succumbed to a disastrous effect in coronavirus afflicted patients 8  in this hour of crisis there is no available effective standard-of-care present to treat the coronavirus affected patients this makes an urgent need to find out agents to get control over the pandemic scientists globally make an effort to do their best to come up with effective therapeutic agents so to design a drug for the virus first we have to see the indispensable processes of the virus which help them to survive and replicates its copy number the genome of the virus showed a sequence similarity of 963 batcov ratg13 and 79 with the sars-cov 9 10  sars-cov-2 is an enveloped single-stranded positive-sense rna genome containing viruses the rna consists of 29891 nucleotides which transcribed for 6-12 orfs can be translated into around 28 identified non-structural and structural proteins ncbi reference sequence nc0455122 11  sars-cov-2 enters into the host cells containing ace2 such as lung oral and nasal mucosa by glycosylated spike protein 12  human ace2 interacts with sars-cov-2 spike proteins and facilitates sars-cov-2 entry into target cells 13  the 4 viral glycosylated spike protein composed of s1 and s2 subunits in the coronaviruses which enables them access into the host cell the rbd of s1 subunit in sars-cov-2 attaches to ace2 led to the shed of s1 subunit and subsequently triggers the cleavage of the s2 subunit by host protease protein tmprss2 that can cleave s1s2 protease cleavage site 13  the cleavage changes the conformation and allowing hr1 hr2 to form 6-hb which facilitates membrane fusion and virus releases its payload rna into the cytoplasm the first translation product of the rna genome is polyprotein pp1a and pp1ab subsequently 3cl protease 3clpro and papain-like protease plpro cleave pp1a and pp1ab to functional proteins required for genome amplification the other structural proteins are produced and the host er-golgi system assembles and releases mature virus from infected cells 14 15  the current understanding strongly recommends targeting the surface protein of the viral particle which possibly prevents them from entering the host cell sars-cov-2 spike protein is a trimeric protein the rbd of each subunit has two types of conformations one conformation is up and the other is down when the conformation is up the viral spike protein could smoothly interact with human ace2 protein otherwise it is inaccessible 16  comparing the structure of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov in spike protein they have similar amino acid sequences and functions 17  however the rbd of sars-cov-2 spike protein in the down conformation n packs tightly against the n terminal domain ntd of the neighboring protomer whereas the sars-cov-2 in the down conformation is angled closer to the central cavity of the trimer additionally the binding affinity between sars-cov-2 spike protein and ace2 protein is stronger than sars-cov even 10-20 folds 18  therefore we deduce that the structure of sars-cov-2 is similar to sars-cov but not the same 5 drug discovery and development is a time taking costly and complex process it usually takes years of effort to get clinically successful 19  however the virtual screening of authentic databases and the use of advanced bioinformatics and cheminformatics can reduce the time to come up with the best drug match to the selected target this process of virtual screening has become a gold standard method for the preliminary phase of drug designing to discover the potential hits against sars-cov-2 we have screened the essential entry pathway targeting virus penetration into cells this study aims to find the potential hit compounds from taiwan database of extracts and compounds tdec httpstdeckmuedutw for and against sars-cov-2 spike protein we focus on the screen of hit compounds that can interact with viral spike protein and spike-ace2 complex protein leading to the prevention of viral payload into the host cytoplasm we have selected our target mainly in the rbd of spike proteins for viral and host cell interactions tdec is an academic and scientific platform for investigators in different fields to share their research information it includes much information such as compounds structures physicochemical properties and biological activities etc on pure natural isolates crude extracts and synthesized extract from plants microbes marine organisms and chinese herbal medicines in the present study an attempt has been made to virtually screen candidates from tdec for a selected target and did all the high throughput bioinformatics and cheminformatics analysis to get an insight into the interaction of spike protein and hits 6  the protein superimposition was performed by pymol software version 099rc6 to compare the conformation of spike proteins in two states 20  one was spike protein in the prefusion ace2-free conformation and the other was rbd of spike protein in the ace2-bound conformation in this study the simulated structure of the rbd of spike protein in the prefusion ace2-free conformation was constructed by homology modeling using the structure of the experimental structure of ace2-free spike protein resolved by cryogenic electron microscopy cryo-em as the modeling template s1a fig and the simulated spike protein was able to be obtained from swiss model website s1b fig 18 21  the other was rbd of the spike protein bound with ace2 protein that was an experimental protein structure resolved by x-ray crystallography and it was able to be downloaded from protein data bank pdb httpswwwrcsborg s1c fig 22  the protein superimposition calculations were analyzed and shown by pymol software the virtual screenings with molecular docking calculations were performed by autodock vina version 112 program within pyrx version 08 software to discover the potential compounds binding into the viral spike protein from the compound database 23 24  the 2321 structures of compounds were downloaded may 9 2020 from tdec and then collected those compounds together and save it as an sdf format file by discovery studio 2019 visualizer software ds 2019 25  subsequently these structures of compounds were optimized by energy minimization with steepest descent algorithm using mmff94 force field and then translated and 7 divided to 2321 individual pdbqt format files by open babel program within pyrx software 26  the experimental structure of spike-ace2 complex protein resolved by x-ray crystallography was obtained from protein data bank pdb id 6m0j and the simulated structure of prefusional spike protein was downloaded from swiss model website 21 22 27  after that the substrates including ligands metal ions and water molecules existed in both protein structures were all removed and the atoms of residues in both protein structures were modified by added the polar hydrogens and partial charges using ds 2019 software with charm force field moreover to discover the potential compounds binding into the rbd of spike protein in the prefusion conformation and the site of the connective interface of spike-ace2 complex protein from the database by virtual screening dimensions of docking search spaces were respectively set big enough to contain the residues of ace2 binding site on the rbd of spike proteins therefore the size of the docking sites was respectively set as follows in experimental spike-ace2 complex protein  a previous report had been shown that once the rbd of sars-cov-2 spike protein bound to human ace2 protein it can assist virus entry into the cells 17  recently the 3d protein structure of the viral spike protein has been resolved by cryo-em technique 18  however we found that the structure of the spike protein resolved by cryo-em was incomplete because it lacked parts of residues in the rbd of spike protein s1a fig  therefore the structure of the spike protein with the complete amino acid sequences in the prefusion conformation was needed to be constructed by simulation fortunately a useful and trusted simulated structure of sars-cov-2 spike protein in the prefusion conformation that has been constructed by homology modeling and could be easily downloaded from swiss-model website s1b fig additionally the viral rbd of spike protein bound with human ace2 protein the spike-ace2 complex protein was also recently resolved by x-ray crystallography s1c fig to investigate whether the conformation between the rbd of spike proteins in ace2-free state and ace2-bound state have differences or not the protein superimposition was performed by pymol software using the structural aligning method the data showed that the value of root mean square rms of the two conformations was 1735   2 it meant that the superimposition between both rbd of spike proteins was good fig 1  however comparing the rbd regions of both spike proteins in the simulation models it was significantly different in structural conformation blue ring in fig 1  the simulation showed that the position of receptor-binding motif rbm regional structure in prefusion conformation was close to the rbd core than in the fusion conformation besides the pose of rbm regional structure in the fusional conformation was more close to ace2 protein than in the prefusion conformation generally sar-cov-2 rbm contains many contacting residues binding to human ace2 protein 22  we concluded that the conformation changing of the rbm regional structure in the spike protein might affect the spike protein binding behavior to human ace2 protein  the study reported that c-terminal domain ctd of sars-cov spike protein bound to ace2 protein with different kinds of angles and its conformations or poses would be changed to well fit the conformation of dynamic ace2 protein such as ace2 unbound-up conformation ace2-bound conformation and ace2 unbounddown conformation 10  additionally we have observed that the conformation of the rbd of sars-cov-2 spike protein in the prefusional state is different from in the fusional state fig 1  in other words we can speculate that the conformation of the dynamic rbd of sars-cov-2 spike protein would change to well bind and fit dynamic ace2 protein therefore we could design a strategy that two potential hitting sites could be set as the compound docking sites to prevent the spike protein to bind to ace2 protein one was that compounds docked on the rbd of the spike protein to prevent spike protein to bind to the human ace2 protein and the other was that compounds docked to the site of the connective interface of the spike-ace2 complex protein to influence the affinity of binding between dynamic viral spike protein and dynamic human ace2 protein and to cause nonfunctional changing of structural conformation to prevent viral spike protein from cleaved by human proteases in this study our aim was going to discover the compounds that not only can bind to the rbd of spike protein in the prefusion conformation but also bind to the site of the connective interface of spike-ace2 complex protein to discover the potential compounds the virtual screening with molecular docking calculation was performed by autodock vina program within pyrx software all molecular structures prepared for virtual screening were downloaded from tdec website the results showed that the numbers of docked compounds binding energy  -8 kcalmol in the prefusion rbd of spike protein and the spike-ace2 complex protein were respectively 53 and 222 among those compounds the numbers of overlapped compounds and non-overlapped compounds were respectively 39 and 197 the binding energies and properties of 39 overlapped compounds were respectively shown in fig 2 s2 fig and s1 table subsequently once the value of the screening threshold raised and limited to -9 kcalmol only compounds tdec2018cn001781 thioflexibilolide a and tdec2020cn000246 candidine reached the condition with amino acid his34 and its interactive distance was 471 fig 5d  the data also showed that candidine could dock with the prefusional rbd of spike protein cyan cartoon and its value of binding energy was -90 kcalmol  fig   6a  it also formed many interactions with amino acids in the prefusional rbd of the with amino acid leu452 and their interactive distances were respectively 383 395 377 and 355 moreover it also formed a pi-pi t-shaped interaction pinking purple dashed line with amino acid phe486 and its interactive distance was 539 fig 6b  candidine docked with the site near the connective interface of the 14 rbd of spike-ace2 complex protein and its value of binding energy was -98 kcalmol fig 6c  besides it also formed many interactions with amino acids in the space near the connective interface of the rbd of spike-ace2 complex protein the results showed that it formed an electrostatic hydrogen-bonding interaction green dashed line with amino acid glu37 and its interactive distance was 225 besides it also formed a hydrophobic pi-sigma interaction dark purple dashed line with amino acid asn33 and its interactive distance was 394 fig 6d  vaccines for coronaviruses 13 30  the predictions obtained from virtual screening such as binding energy possible flexibility in conformation are still very useful to lead the way of drug discovery or drug repurposing as represented in fig 4 we have started with 2321 compounds taken from tdec and applied the filters to get compound which can bind to the target structures with high affinity notably we got the two natural products thioflexibilolide a and candidine which passed all the filters applied with the strong binding energy respectively -92 kcalmol and -90 kcalmol on the prefusion spike protein and -98 kcalmol and -89 kcalmol on the spike-ace2 complex protein fig 5 and fig 6  the other compounds listed in the s1 in the further phenotypic assay among them hit compounds were able to influence the interaction between viral rbd of the spike protein and the human ace2 protein in two dynamic proteins besides we also found among these 39 compounds that dioscin actinomycin d and saikosaponin c had been reported that they had antivirus activity against others virus s2 table  although those compounds that we discovered from the database may have the potential ability to prevent the binding between viral spike protein and human ace2 protein the efficacy of compounds were still needed to be further verified by bioassay thioflexibilolide a and candidine were natural products respectively isolated from soft coral sinularia flexibilis and phaius mishmensis 31 32  in chemical structure the structure of candidine is more solid than thioflexibilolide a it it might be caused that the rbm of spike protein is major composed of chain type of structure rather than -helix or -sheet structure s1 fig besides we also deduce that two compounds bind to side face respectively with the rbm of the ace2-free spike protein and the connective interface of spike-ace2 complex protein probably affect the affinity of binding between viral spike protein and human ace2 protein or influence its conformation changing to prevent spike protein to be cleaved by host protease like tmprss2 fig 5 and fig 6  to rapidly develop useful drugs against sars-cov-2 computer-aid drug screening was performed in many studies sars-cov spike protein were homology proteins with greater than 70 similar sequences and have the same function for binding ace2 however the previous report also showed that the binding affinity between sars-cov-2 spike protein and ace2 was higher than sars-cov spike protein approximately 10-20 folds 18 39  these reports suggested that it is highly similar but not the same in partial structure or conformation in the spike proteins between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov moreover spike-ace2 complex protein was constructed by protein-protein docking may not good enough to directly exhibit the protein-protein binding situation in fact recently the rbd of sars-cov-2 spike protein in the prefusion conformation pdb id 6vsb and the complex protein that sars-cov-2 spike proteins rbd bound with ace2 protein had already been resolved pdb id 6m0j respectively by cryo-em and x-ray crystallography with high resolution 18 22  therefore the two new resolving protein structures were likely more close to the structural situations in fact in other words it could raise the accuracy in structure-based virtual screening with docking calculation because of those structures resolved with high resolution that is why we did that in this study developing the viral spike antibody is one of the good strategies to fight against sars-cov-2 it could bind to the rbd of spike protein to neutralize sars-cov-2 had been reported 40 41  however it is concerned about inducing antibodydependent enhancement ade 42  herein we reported that the 39 potential compounds against sars-cov-2 spike protein may have the advantage of avoiding to induce ade ace2 was a type i transmembrane protein and it functioned as a carboxypeptidase to mediate homeostasis of renin-angiotensin system ras such as blood volume lung and cardiovascular regulating functions by cleaving angiotensin ii ang ii to ang1-7 43  ace2 was higher expressed in the small intestine kidneys testicles adipose tissue and thyroid and moderate in the lungs liver adrenal glands and rectum and lower in the blood blood vessels spleen brain muscle and bone marrow 44 45  on the other hand gender and age characters could affect ace2 expression under inflammatory conditions in the skin lung brain and thyroid 44  recent studies also showed that gender could affect sars-cov-2 infection susceptibility and virus clearance 17  besides another report also pointed out that covid-19 patients symptoms including dysfunctions in diarrhea taste and smell injuries in the liver kidney and heart may have a close relationship with ace2 expression 46  herein our results showed the 39 potential compounds could prevent the binding between viral spike protein and human ace2 protein in silico it 20 is speculated that those potential compounds could fight against covid-19 and lower the expression in the above symptoms for humans natural products proved to be beneficial due to the contribution from a long time to develop effective drugs for several diseases 47  therefore we have tried our endemic tdec which is very rich and diverse in natural product resources derived from traditional medicine domestic microbes and marine organisms thioflexibilolide a is well-known for its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory activities derived from soft corals whereas about gravicycle is reported non-toxic after its in vitro toxicity assessment in the cell 48  the results we are reporting here about the compounds which are screened by employing virtual screening with molecular docking approach from the database for disabling sars-cov-2 spike proteins rbd from its interaction with ace2 receptor of the host cell is very first of its kind as far as possibly know the compounds perform well to get the filter into potential drug candidate during our screening process and we strongly recommend our compound for further in vitro and in vivo investigation the study carried out intending to come up with potential drugs for covid-19 therapy here in this piece of work we virtually screened more than 2000 drugs against the target spike proteins rbd after data mining and filtering out the unfitted compounds we finally found two compounds named thioflexibilolide a and candidine we have done the molecular docking to check whether it binds with the target with strong affinity or not as per our result we found these two compounds bind with strong affinity to the selected target of the viral protein we believed that these two compounds could be potential drugs for sars-cov-2 the two 34 s1 sinularia flexibilis 31 tdec2020cn000246 -90 -98 phaius mishmensis 32 51 tdec2019ca001707 -89 -83 tripterygium wilfordii 52

the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a major public health concern a handful of static structures now provide molecular insights into how sars-cov-2 and sars-cov interact with its host target which is the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 molecular recognition binding and function are dynamic processes to evaluate this multiple all atom molecular dynamics simulations of at least 500 ns each were performed to better understand the structural stability and interfacial interactions between the receptor binding domain of the spike protein of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov bound to ace2 several contacts were observed to form break and reform in the interface during the simulations our results indicate that sars-cov and sars-cov-2 utilizes unique strategies to achieve stable binding to ace2 several differences were observed between the residues of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov that consistently interacted with ace2 notably a stable salt bridge between lys417 of sars-cov-2 spike protein and asp30 of ace2 as well as three stable hydrogen bonds between tyr449 gln493 and gln498 of sars-cov-2 and asp38 glu35 and lys353 of ace2 were observed which were absent in the sars-cov-ace2 interface some previously reported residues which were suggested to enhance the binding affinity of sars-cov-2 were not observed to form stable interactions in these simulations stable binding to the host receptor is crucial for virus entry therefore special consideration should be given to these stable interactions while designing potential drugs and treatment modalities to target or disrupt this interface  the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019  caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has affected all walks of life genomic studies have established that sars-cov-2 belong to the betacoronavirus genus which also includes sars-cov and mers-cov that were associated with previous outbreaks of relatively smaller scale 1 2 3  these coronaviruses attach to the host cell with the aid of the spike glycoprotein present on its envelope coronavirus spike glycoprotein is composed of two subunits -the s1 subunit is important for binding to the host cell receptor and the s2 subunit is responsible for the fusion of the virus and the host cells membrane angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 an enzyme located on the outer surface of a wide variety of cells is the primary host cell target with which the spike protein of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 associates 4 5 6  the receptor binding domain rbd of the s1 subunit of these viruses binds to outer surface of the claw like structure of ace2 7  the sequence similarity of the rbd region of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 spike protein is between 73 to 76 7  fourteen residues of the sars-cov spike protein rbd have been reported to interact with human ace2 these are tyr436 tyr440 tyr442 leu443 leu472 asn473 tyr475 asn479 gly482 tyr484 thr486 thr487 gly488 and tyr491 8 9  only eight of these residues are conserved in sars-cov-2 9 the equivalent conserved residues in sars-cov-2 are tyr449 tyr453 asn487 tyr489 gly496 thr500 gly502 and tyr491 while leu455 phe456 phe486 gln493 gln498 and asn501 are substituted the atomic level three-dimensional structure of several sars-cov-2 proteins have now been determined 10 11 12 13  these x-ray crystallography based structures provide remarkable insights into macromolecular structure and intermolecular interactions however molecular recognition and binding are dynamic processes molecular dynamics md simulation often complement traditional structural studies for looking at the dynamics of these processes at the atomic level 14 15  such simulations can provide insights into the structural stability of macromolecular complexes flexibility of interacting subunits and the interactions of residues in the interface here we report the stability and binding dynamics of sars-cov-2 spike rbd bound to ace2 and compare this with the dynamics of sars-cov spike rbd by running multiple 500 ns allatom md simulations high resolution x-ray crystal structures of sars-cov-2 spike rbd bound to ace2 illustrate fourteen positions that are associated with the interaction between sars-covsars-cov-2 and ace2 the primary objective of this study was to identify both similarities and dissimilarities in the dynamics of the interactions between sars-covsars-cov-2 and ace2 and to identify key residues that could be vital to the integrity of this interface this would provide insights into residues that could be targeted for disrupting this interface md simulations of sars-cov-2-ace2 and sars-cov-ace2 complexes 500 ns md simulations of sars-cov-ace2 complex pdb id 6m0j and sars-cov-ace2 complex pdb 2ajf were performed in triplicate one of the 500 ns simulations of sars-cov-2-ace2 complex was further extended to 1 s to ensure that the interactions are faithfully retained for a longer duration additionally triplicate 500 ns simulations of a second sars-cov-2-ace2 structure pdb id 6lzg was also performed to ensure that results were not biased by a single structure the overall structural integrity of all stimulations of sars-cov2-ace2 complex were retained with a c root mean square deviation rmsd from the starting structure that was less than 4  in the case of the sars-cov-ace2 simulations one of simulations had a c rmsd that was under at 5  the oscillating rmsd of this simulation was characteristic of the closingopening motion of the ace2 claw like structure 16 figures 1a and figure 1b  the other two sars-cov-ace2 simulations had a higher rmsd that was associated with the detachment of the spike protein from one end of interface  figure 1b  interestingly the other end remained attached as evident from specific contacts that were retained throughout the simulations protein secondary structure composition and compactness as indicated by the radius of gyration of ace2 and spike protein structures were also preserved throughout the simulations supplementary figure 1  this included salt bridges hydrogen bonds - and cation- interactions supplementary table   1  some of these interactions were more persistent than others the residues of sars-cov-2sars-cov spike rbd that interacted with ace2 consistently are shown in figures 3a and 3b  interfaces and the dynamics of the salient ones along the length of the simulation trajectories are shown in figure 4 and supplementary figures 4 and 5  table 1  the likelihood of an interaction between gln493 of sars-cov-2 and lys31 residue of ace2 was reported recently 7  next the backbone of gly488 of sars-cov consistently interacted with lys353 of ace2 in all three simulations while the gly502 at the equivalent location in sars-cov-2 formed sustained interactions with lys353 of ace2 in only one simulation figures 4a and 4b  additionally the side chain of gln498 and backbone of gly496 of sars-cov-2 spike rbd formed sustained interactions in three and two simulations respectively with lys353 of ace2 such an interaction was absent in equivalent residues of sars-cov  figures 4a and 4b  this suggests that sars-cov-2 and sars-cov differs in how they target the basic lys31 and lys353 residues of ace2 tyr449 and tyr489 two conserved residues in sars-cov-2 spike rbd consistently interacted with asp38 and gln24 of ace2 in multiple simulations tyr453 and tyr505 were observed to interact with his34 and gln37 respectively of ace2 for at least 80 of one simulation each  figures 4a and 4b  the corresponding residues in sars-cov did not appear to form such sustained interactions except tyr491 which consistently interacted with gln37 in two simulations furthermore gln493 and gln498 of sars-cov-2 showed sustained interactions with glu35 and asp38 respectively while the corresponding asn479 and tyr484 in sars-cov exhibited extremely weak interactions  figures 4a and 4b  this is in agreement with recent work that shows the likely existence of tyr449-asp38 tyr453-his34 tyr489-gln24 and gln493-glu35 interactions between sars-cov-2 spike rbd and ace2 16 17 18  three residues which are mutated in sars-cov-2 ala475 lys417 and gly446 interacted with ace2 residues gln24 asp30 and gln42 such interactions were not observed in corresponding residues of sars-cov  figures 4a and 4b supplementary table 1  significantly a very strong salt bridge was established and sustained between lys417 of sars-cov-2 spike rbd and asp30 of ace2 for nearly the full duration of all simulations notably this salt bridge is absent in sars-cov since the equivalent residue is val404 which is incapable of forming such an interaction  figures 4a and 4b  gly446 maintained an interaction with gln42 of ace2 for majority of only one simulation  figure 4a  while ala475 exhibited only weak interactions with gln24 in the simulations to look at the dynamics of the interface interactions that were maintained for at least 50 of the total simulation time in three simulations in the two complexes were evaluated four interfacial residues in sars-cov-2 lys417 gln493 tyr449 and gln498 and two in sars-cov thr486 and gly488 maintained such interactions with four asp30 glu35 asp38 and lys353 and two lys353 and asp355 residues of ace2 respectively figures 4a and 4b  hence there are noteworthy differences between how the two viral spike proteins interact with ace2 and the larger number of sustained interactions in sars-cov-2 spike protein could be associated with a higher binding affinity of sars-cov-2 additionally similar dynamics of interacting residues were also observed in triplicate 500 ns simulations of another complex structure of sars-cov-2-ace2 pdb 6lzg that was simulated to ensure that the results were not biased by one structure recent studies based on models of the sars-cov-2 spike protein rbd have indicated that leu455 phe486 ser494 and asn501 of sars-cov-2 are important for binding to ace2 via their interaction with met82 tyr83 lys31 and tyr41 residues 3718  however from the simulations only a weak - interaction was observed between phe486 and tyr83 supplementary table 1  while leu455 ser494 and asn501 were not observed to form any significant interactions with ace2 water molecules play an important role in many intermolecular interfaces in this instance six conserved water sites were found in the interface between ace2 and sars-cov-2 spike rbd water-mediated indirect interactions were formed between ace2lys31 and spikephe490leu492 ace2asp38 and spikegly496 ace2asn33his34glu37asp38 and spikearg403  figure 5  these could also play a role in stabilizing the interface  this study provides insight into the stability of the interactions that define the sars-cov-ace2 and sars-cov-2-ace2 interfaces using extended md simulations of x-ray crystal structures of these complexes firstly interactions that were shared by sars-cov-2-ace2 and sars-cov-ace2 complexes were assessed sars-cov-2 spike protein rbd consistently interacted with ace2 in three clusters at one end gln493 and gln498 formed sustained hydrogen bonds with glu35 and lys353 of ace2 at the other end tyr449 formed hydrogen bond with asp38 of ace2 in the middle lys417 formed a strong and stable salt bridge with asp30 of ace2 additionally several intermittent interactions of sars-cov-2 could permit it to bind more stably than sars-cov figures 3b and 4a and supplementary table 1  these findings were also supported by the results from two different structures of the sars-cov-2-ace2 complex supplementary figure 6 and supplementary table 1  loop regions residues 484-505 of sars-cov-2 fluctuated less when bound to ace2 when compared to sars-cov this is stabilized by the formation of sustained interactions between gln493 and gln498 of sars-cov-2 and glu35 and lys353 of ace2 respectively  figures 4a and supplementary figure 4  unlike sars-cov-2 in sars-cov the region in the middle was devoid of any stable interactions with ace2 however at the two ends a different set of residues in sars-cov formed interactions with ace2  figure 3d  therefore it is apparent that there are several similarities and differences in the structure and dynamics of the interactions of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov with ace2 hence antibodies or antiviral treatment modalities that target the spike protein of sars-cov is not expected to produce a similar effect with sars-cov-2 some of the recent studies that failed to inhibit the binding of sars-cov-2 rbd to ace2 support these findings 13 19  secondly two charged virus binding hot spots on human ace2 lys31 and lys353 which are essential for the binding of sars-cov have been studied extensively 4 8  charge neutralization of these hot spot lysines has been shown to be important for the binding of coronavirus to ace2 7 8  sars-cov-2 and sars-cov utilizes unique strategies to achieve this interestingly sars-cov-2 residues only formed sustained interactions with lys353 of ace2 and these were absent in sars-cov indicating an adaptation to a stronger interface  figure 4a figure   2b and 2d the strength of this sustained salt bridge between lys417 and asp30 could contribute to the substantially different binding affinity of sars-cov-2 to ace2 receptor when compared to sars-cov 16 18  notably some of the previously reported residues leu455 phe456 tyr473 phe486 ser494 and asn501 that were suggested to enhance the binding affinity of sars-cov-2 were not observed in these simulations 3 16 18  in conclusion while sars-cov-2 and sars-cov spike rbd bind to the same region of ace2 and share several similarities in how they interact with ace2 there are a number of differences in the dynamics of the interactions one salient difference is the presence of a stable salt bridge between lys417 of sars-cov-2 spike protein and asp30 of ace2 as well as three stable hydrogen bonds between tyr449 gln493 and gln498 of sars-cov-2 and asp38 glu35 and lys353 of ace2 which were not observed in the sars-cov-ace2 interface stable viral binding with the host receptor is crucial for virus entry thus special consideration should be given to these stable interactions while designing potential drugs and treatment modalities to target or disrupt this interface coordinates of the three dimensional x-ray crystal structures of the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 rbd in complex

relaxation protocol before the start of the production run 500 ns simulations were performed in triplicate with a different set of initial velocities for simulations involving 6m0j 6lzg and 2ajf while one 500 ns simulation each were run for the isolated spike protein structures one of the 500 ns simulations of the sars-cov-2-ace2 complex was extended to 1 s to ensure that the interactions are retained for a longer period for the simulations the isotropic martyna-tobias-klein barostat and the nose-hoover thermostat were used to maintain the pressure at 1 atm and temperature at 300 k

michael l kayvon modjarrad henry jackson m  sars-cov-2 is a zoonotic virus that has caused a pandemic of severe respiratory disease-covid-19within several months of its initial identification comparable to the first sars-cov this novel coronaviruss surface spike s glycoprotein mediates cell entry via the human ace-2 receptor and thus is the principal target for the development of vaccines and immunotherapeutics molecular information on the sars-cov-2 s glycoprotein remains limited here we report the crystal structure of the sars-cov-2 s receptor-binding-domain rbd at a the highest resolution to date of 195  we identified a set of sars-reactive monoclonal antibodies with cross-reactivity to sars-cov-2 rbd and other betacoronavirus s glycoproteins one of these antibodies cr3022 was previously shown to synergize with antibodies that target the ace-2 binding site on the sars-cov rbd and reduce viral escape capacity we determined the structure of cr3022 in complex with the sars-cov-2 rbd and defined a broadly reactive epitope that is highly conserved across betacoronaviruses this epitope is inaccessible in the closed prefusion s structure but is accessible in open conformations this first-ever resolution of a human antibody in complex with sars-cov-2 and the broad reactivity of this set of antibodies to a conserved betacoronavirus epitope will allow antigenic assessment of vaccine candidates and provide a framework for accelerated vaccine immunotherapeutic and diagnostic strategies against sars-cov-2 and related betacoronaviruses high resolution structure of the sars-cov-2 receptor-binding-domain rbd structure of the sars-cov-2 rbd in complex with antibody cr3022 identification of a cryptic site of vulnerability on the sars-cov-2 spike  the emergence of sars-cov-2 marks the seventh coronavirus to be isolated from humans and the third to cause a severe disease-named covid-19-after severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers  the rapid spread of sars-cov-2 and the grave risk it poses to global health prompted the world health organization to declare on 30 january 2020 the covid-19 outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern and on 11 march 2020 to be a pandemic zhou et al 2020  as of 13 march 2020 there have been nearly 140000 sars-cov-2 infections and more than 5000 associated deaths reported across at least 100 countries the rapidly evolving epidemiology of the pandemic and absence of licensed prophylactics or therapeutics for the disease have accelerated the need to elucidate the molecular biology of this novel coronavirus although sars-cov-2 is a newly identified virus it shares genetic and morphologic features with others in the coronaviridae family particularly those from the betacoronavirus genus the genome of the recently isolated sars-cov-2 shares 82 nucleotide identity with human sars-cov and 89 with bat sars-like-covzxc21  the spike s glycoprotein in particular bears significant structural homology with sars-cov compared to other coronaviruses such as mers-cov like sars-cov the surface spike s glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 binds the same host receptor ace-2 to mediate cell entry letko et al 2020 yan et al 2020a  s-a class i fusion protein-is also a critical determinant of viral host range and tissue tropism and the primary target of the host immune response li 2016  as such most coronavirus vaccine candidates are based on s or one of its sub-components coronavirus s glycoproteins contain three segments a large ectodomain a single-pass transmembrane anchor and a short intracellular tail the ectodomain consists of a receptor-binding subunit s1 which contains two subdomains one at the n-terminus and the other at the c-terminus the latter comprises the receptor-binding domain rbd which serves the vital function of attaching the virus to the host receptor and triggering a conformational change in the protein that results in fusion with the host cell membrane through the s2 subunit recently the molecular structure of recombinant full-length sars-cov-2 spike protein was solved in a stabilized pre-fusion state by single particle cryo-electron microscopy cryo-em at a resolution of 38  wrapp et al 2020  despite the comprehensive structural characterization of the spike protein as a whole movement of the rbd between up and down conformational states prevented complete modeling of the rbd domains subsequent cryo-em investigations of sars-cov-2 provided more detail of rbd particularly at sites that contact the human ace-2 receptor yan et al 2020a  here we report the first high resolution-less than 2 -sars-cov-2 rbd additionally we present the antigenicity of this recombinant rbd particularly of interest given the equipoise in the literature regarding the binding affinities of sars-cov antibodies for sars-cov-2 rbd early reports have described that the human sars-cov antibody cr3022 is able to bind to the sars-cov-2 rbd in the present study we verify binding and subsequently solved the structure of sars-cov-2 rbd in complex with cr3022 with a novel cryptic epitope the sars-cov-2 rbd residues 313-532 with a c-terminal his-tag was expressed in 293f cells and purified by ninta affinity and size-exclusion chromatography crystallization condition screening identified 20 jeffamine d2000 10

sars-cov-2 rbd structure pdb id 6vw1 with 23 aa differences compared to sars-cov-2 in complex with human ace-2 was recently released in the pdb comparisons with previously published structures with the sars-cov-2 rbd highlight residues 473-488 as an area with significant structural plasticity in the rbd structure from this study we observe electron density for two conformations of the 482-486 loop one of these conformations is highly similar to the ligand bound form of the rbd while the second conformation would clash with the ace2 receptor both this structural detail of the unliganded rbd and comparison to previously described rbd structures indicates that this area of the rbd is structurally malleable with implications for antibody or small molecule therapeutics design in an effort to identify antibodies that could bind to sars-cov-2 we screened a set of sars-cov tripp et al 2005 and mers cov wang et al 2018 wang et al 2015 rbd-reactive antibodies for binding to the sars-cov-2 rbd we demonstrated that the sars-cov mouse antibody 240cd tripp et al 2005 had nanomolar nm affinity for the sars-cov-2 rbd and did not significantly block ace-2 receptor binding figure 2  cr3022-a sars-cov neutralizing antibody tian et al 2020 identified from a human phage-display library ter meulen et al 2006 -also bound to sars-cov-2 rbd with nm affinity  figure 2b  we assessed competition binding between 240cd and cr3022 and show that these antibodies cross-compete with each other for binding to the sars-cov-2 rbd figure 2c 2d  sars-cov-2 has a likely zoonotic origin and horseshoe bats have been implicated as natural reservoirs of both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 menachery et al 2015 zhou et al 2020  as such we next explored antibody cross-reactivity with the s glycoproteins of two bat sars-related covs sarsr-cov rs4874 ge et al 2013 yang et al 2015 and rs4231 hu et al 2017  which are closely related to the progenitor of sars-cov and retain the ability to utilize human ace-2 cr3022 was able to recognize a recombinant spike glycoproteins generated from bat sarsr-cov rs4874 while 240cd and other mouse generated monoclonal antibodies have a mixed recognition phenotype  figure 2f  the antigenic cross-reactivity of this set of antibodies precipitated an investigation into their molecular recognition determinants the potential relevance of a human antibody motivated the investigation to prioritize studies of cr3022 for which a sequence was available ter meulen et al 2006  the cr3022 heavy chain is encoded by ighv5-5103 contains a 12-aa cdr h3 with 8 v gene-encoded residues altered by somatic hypermutation cr3022 light chain is encoded by igkv4-101 with 1 v geneencoded residue altered by somatic hypermutation and a 9-aa cdr l3 extended data figure 2a  to provide an atomic-level understanding of the structure of the cr3022 antibody we crystallized the antigenbinding fragment fab of cr3022 crystals diffracted to 32  resolution in space group p 21 table 1  overall the structure of the cr3022 fab revealed a relatively flat antigen-combining site with the exception of an extended protruding 12-aa cdr l1 loop  figure s2a  to determine the structure of cr3022 in complex with the sars-cov-2 rbd we carried out crystallization conditions screening with crystals of the cr3022-rbd complex forming in 1m succinic acid 01m hepes ph 7 2 peg mme2000 and determined the crystal structure by x-ray diffraction to 425   table 1  the complex structure was solved by molecular replacement using the refined cr3022 and sars-cov-2 rbd structures as search models and was refined to an rworkrfree of 02420292 table   1  cr3022 bound to the rbd at an epitope centered on s glycoprotein residues 377-386 with a total buried surface area of 871  figure 3 figure s2  and table s1  this region is highly conserved between sars-cov and sars-cov-2  figure s3  comparison of the cr3022 epitope site with previously described antibody-complex structures for sars-cov and mers-cov indicates that cr3022 describes a novel recognition site figure 3 and figs s3 s4 further sequence analysis of the epitope indicates that this epitope is conserved in betacoronavirus clade 2b with also some similarity in clade 2d fig s3  to confirm that this site was also shared with 240cd we produced an rbd knockout mutant by introducing a glycan sequon at position 384 and by biolayer interferometry show that both cr3022 and 240cd binding to the rbd can be eliminated by the introduction of a glycan at this site fig s2d  the epitope conservation within the clade explains the antigenic cross-reactivity with both human sars-cov and bat sars related cov to date there has been extensive structural characterization of the sars-cov and mers-cov spike molecule and domains which provides a framework for understanding the novel sars-cov-2 spike molecule table s2  in the context of the coronavirus trimeric s glycoproteins the rbd displays two prototypical conformations either in an up or down position with implications for receptor binding and cell entry  table s1  to further analyze these conformations we modeled the cr3022 binding to the trimeric structures of sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov the cr3022 epitope is occluded by adjacent spike protomers when the rbd is in the down conformation but becomes more accessible when the spike is in a more open conformation here multiple rbd molecules are in the up conformation  figure 4  there is still a clash of the antibody fc1 region with the ntd from the same protomer or an rbd from an adjacent protomer when modeled using the static structure to understand whether cr3022 could bind to sars-cov s glycoproteins we measured binding to stabilized s-2p or non-stabilized versions of s figure 4  we observed robust binding to the nonstabilized s glycoprotein while binding to sars s-2p trimer was low we then treated the sars s-2p trimer with trypsin andor incubation with the ace2 receptor to assess whether minimal proteolytic action or receptor binding could increase the availability of the cryptic cr3022 epitope incubation of the stabilized s-2p trimer with human ace2 did not dramatically affect cr3022 binding while in contrast the trypsin treatment of the s-2p protein resulted in increased binding akin to the unstabilized s glycoprotein binding and the level of binding was titratable with increasing amounts of s-2p resulting in higher cr3022 binding given the prior neutralization and protection studies utilizing cr3022 and its ability to complement potent neutralizing antibodies it is likely that the cr3022 epitope represents a cryptic epitope that becomes exposed during the processes of viral cell entry in summary our data represents the most detailed structural information for the sars-cov-2 rbd to date and the first structure of the sars-cov-2 in complex with a human antibody the presence of cryptic but protective epitopes for influenza bangaru et al 2019  and ebola viruses west et al 2018  have been previously described the identification of a novel cryptic epitope for betacoronaviruses including sars-cov and sars-cov-2 highlight a novel

representation   molecular mechanism of evolution and human infection with sars-cov-2 jiahua he huanyu tao yumeng yan sheng-you huang yi xiao   coronaviruses covs are a group of enveloped positive-stranded rna viruses that can cause respiratory intestinal and central nervous system infections in humans and animals 1 until 2019 six strains of coronaviruses that are able to infect humans had been identified 12 among them four human coronaviruses including hcov-oc43 hcov-229e hcov-nl63 and hcovhku1 are not highly pathogenic and only cause mild respiratory diseases 1 however two other coronaviruses the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov 3456 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 78 have caused two large-scale pandemics and resulted in more than 8000 cases including nearly 800 related deaths and about 2500 cases including about 860 related deaths respectively the outbreaks of sars-cov and mers-cov indicated that some coronaviruses can be highly pathogenic when they transmit from animals to humans 91011 therefore it is urgent to develop antiviral treatments or vaccines targeting such high-risk coronaviruses like sars-cov and mers-cov before efficient antiviral drugs or vaccines are developed for sars-cov or mers-cov another outbreak of pneumonia covid-19 caused by a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 has emerged in wuhan since december 2019 1213141516171819 as of 30 march 2020 sars-cov-2 has caused 693224 confirmed cases including 33106 related deaths globally 20 the full-length genome sequence of sars-cov-2 was soon determined by the zhang group 21 it was revealed that sars-cov-2 has a probable bat origin and is 96 identical at the whole-genome level to a bat sars-like coronavirus 22 in addition sars-cov-2 is also closely related to other sars-like coronaviruses and shares a 795 sequence identity to sars-cov 22 for some encoded proteins like coronavirus main proteinase 3clpro papain-like protease plpro and rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp the sequence identity is even higher and can be as high as 96 between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov 23 therefore it was thought that sars-cov-2 would function in a similar way to sars-cov in the human-infection and pathogenic mechanism 222324 coronaviruses use the surface spike s glycoprotein on the coronavirus envelope to attach host cells and mediate host cell membrane and viral membrane fusion during infection 25 the spike protein includes two regions s1 and s2 where s1 is for host cell receptor binding and s2 is for membrane fusion the s1 region also includes an n-terminal domain ntd and three c-terminal domains ctd1 ctd2 and ctd3 26 for sars-cov the receptor binding domain rbd is located in the ctd1 of the s1 region sars-cov attaches the human host cells through the binding of the rbd protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme ii ace2 2728 therefore the interaction between rbd and ace2 is a prerequisite for the human infection with sars-cov given the high homology between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 it was expected that sars-cov-2 would also use the ace2 molecule as the receptor to enter human cells 2429 this hypothesis was further experimentally confirmed by the virus infectivity studies from the shi group in which sars-cov-2 is able to use the ace2 proteins from humans chinese horseshoe bats and civet as an entry receptor in the ace2-expressing cells but not cells without ace2 22 xu et al have used moe to calculate the binding free energies between the spike-rbd protein and human ace2 showing that the binding free energy between sars-cov-2 rbd and human ace2 was 506 kcalmol whereas that between sars-cov rbd and human ace2 was 786 kcalmol 24 very recently the cryo-em structure of the sars-cov-2 spike protein in the prefusion conformation has been determined 30 the biophysical and structural evidence suggested that sars-cov-2 may bind ace2 with a much higher affinity than sars-cov 30 although it has been clear that sars-cov-2 infects human cells through the binding of the rbd domain to the human ace2 receptor 3031323334 the molecular mechanism of the binding between the rbd protein and the ace2 receptor is still unknown many questions remain to be answered for example previous simulations showed that the binding affinity between sars-cov-2 and human ace2 is weaker than that between sars-cov and human ace2 24 however in reality sars-cov-2 has resulted in many more cases and seems to be more infectious than sars-cov in this study we have extensively investigated the spike proteinhuman ace2 protein systems of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov by using protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics md simulations specifically we have extensively studied the free energies and dynamics of rbd-ace2 binding spike protein and free rbd protein systems given that the spike protein is not only a potential drug target but also the virus antigen 35 the present study will be beneficial for the drug design vaccine development and disease prevention of sars-cov-2 in this study we have investigated the rbd-ace2 complex spike protein and free rbd systems of sars-cov genbank id np8288511 and sars-cov-2 genbank id mn9089473 for sars-cov the rbd-ace2 complex structure was directly downloaded from the protein data bank pdb entry 3sci 36 then all the water molecules were removed from the complex structure the free rbd structure was obtained by removing the ace2 protein from the rbd-ace2 complex the structure of the trimeric spike protein of sars-cov was also downloaded from the pdb pdb entry 6acd 26 for sars-cov-2 the three dimensional 3d rbd structure was modeled based on the rbd structure of sars-cov using the modeller program 37 where the sequence alignment was performed using the clustalw program 3839 the complex structure between the sars-cov-2 rbd protein and human ace2 was then predicted by our protein-protein docking approach 404142 the 3d structure of the trimeric spike protein for sars-cov-2 was constructed based on the spike protein structure of sars-cov pdb entry 6acd using modeller the complex structure between the sars-cov-2 rbd protein and the human ace2 molecule was predicted using our hybrid protein-protein docking algorithm hdock 40414243 specifically given the individual structures of the sars-cov-2 rbd protein and the human ace2 molecule hdock globally samples all possible binding modes between the two proteins through a fast fourier transform fft-based search strategy 42 then all the sampled binding modes were evaluated by our iterative knowledge-based scoring function itscorepp 44 last the binding modes were ranked according to their binding energy scores and the top ten binding modes were provided to users during the docking calculation all the default parameters were used namely the grid spacing was set to 12  for 3d translational search the angle interval was set to 15 for rotational sampling in 3d euler space and the

pmemdcuda was used as the simulation engine where all the simulations were performed on a gpu compute node 47 specifically for each system the following four stages of md simulations were performed before the production simulation 1 a 1000-step simulation was first run to minimize the solvated protein system with weakly restraints on the backbone atoms 2 the system was then heated to 300 k by a 25000-step ie 50 ps simulation with weakly restraints on the backbone atoms 3 next another 25000-step ie 50 ps constant pressure simulation was conducted to equilibrating the density of the system at 300 k 4 the system was then equilibrated by a 250000-step ie 500 ps of constant pressure simulation at 300 k finally two 2500000-step production simulations were run to record the trajectories of the system at 300 k where the coordinates were written out every 5000 steps ie 10 ps resulting in a total of 10 ns simulation with 1000 recorded trajectories after the simulations the mmpbsapy was used to calculate the free energies of the systems through the mm-gbsa model 48 and the cpptraj was used to analyze the coordinate trajectories 49 to check the statistical significance of the difference between two means a t-test was performed to obtain the p value using two average free energies and their standard deviations the rbd proteins of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov exhibit a high sequence similarity 892 with a sequence identity of 737 the high homology resulted in an accurate 3d rbd model of sars-cov-2 with a small rmsd of 055  from the experimental sars-cov rbd structure with the sars-cov-2 rbd model and experimental human ace2 structure we then performed protein-protein docking to predict their binding mode using our hdock approach 404142 figure 1a shows the predicted complex structure between the human ace2 molecule and the sars-cov-2 rbd protein it can be seen from the figure that the predicted sars-cov-2 rbd-ace2 complex structure is very close to the experimentally determined sars-cov rbd-ace2 complex structure the interface root mean square deviation rmsd between the two complexes is only 0473  demonstrating that the rbds of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov bind to the same site of the human ace2 receptor figure 1a these results can also be understood by comparing the residues at the rbd-ace2 binding interface for sars-cov-2 and sars-cov the binding sites on the rbd proteins of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov are very conserved the corresponding residues show a high sequence similarity of 833 figure 1bc among them the hydrophobic residues which are important for protein-protein interactions are especially conserved for the rbd of sars-cov-2 there are 13 hydrophobic residues at the binding site which are comparable to 13 hydrophobic residues for that of sars-cov figure 1b recently the cryoem structure of the sars-cov-2 rbd-ace2 complex was determined by the zhou group 31 comparing the experimental structure and our predicted model showed that the two complexes are close to each other and have a small interface rmsd of 1108  figure 2a the interface difference is mainly due to the conformational changes in the rbd especially around the loop of residues 475488 figure 2b while the backbone rmsd for the two ace2 monomers is only 0965  if the flexible loop of residues 475488 in the rbd was excluded the interface rmsd between the predicted and experimental complexes would be as small as 0774  these results suggested the accuracy of our predicted sars-cov-2 rbd-ace2 complex structure we have run a long-time md simulation to generate the trajectories of the rbd-ace2 complex system for sars-cov-2 and sars-cov the binding free energies were calculated using the mm-gbsa model by the mmpbsapy script in the amber package table 1 shows a comparison of the rbd-ace2 binding free energies for sars-cov-2 and sars-cov it can be seen from the table that the binding free energy of the sars-cov-2 rbd-ace2 interaction is 5043 kcalmol which is significantly lower than the binding free energy of the sars-cov rbd-ace2 interaction 3675 kcalmol in other words sars-cov-2 binds human ace2 with a significantly higher affinity than sars-cov very recently an experiment study also suggested that sars-cov-2 could bind human ace2 with a higher affinity than sars-cov 30 this may provide one of the possible reasons why sars-cov-2 is much more infectious than sars-cov though other factors like human activities and pathogen persistence can also have a critical impact on the spread of sars-cov-2 further examination of the binding free energy contributions reveals that the higher binding affinity of sars-cov-2 than sars-cov is mostly attributed to the solvation energy contribution gsolv 67497 vs 69656 kcalmol whereas sars-cov-2 has a higher binding free energy in vacuum ggas than sars-cov 72541 vs 73331 in other words sars-cov-2 tends to bind human ace2 better than sars-cov in the water while sars-cov would bind to human ace2 better than sars-cov-2 in the gas further investigation will be needed to reveal the impact of such binding preferences on human infection the spike protein on the coronavirus envelope is a trimeric protein this protein is critical for the vitality of coronaviruses because it is not only an important component for the virus particle but also plays a crucial role in attaching host cells and fusing the membranes 26 in addition the spike protein also determines the solubility of coronavirus particles and thus the viral infectivity because the spike protein is the largest protein located on the coronavirus envelope surface therefore the spike protein is directly related to the stability and functionality of coronaviruses here we have run a lengthy md simulation to study the trimeric spike proteins of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov table 2 gives a comparison between the free energies of the spike proteins for sars-cov-2 and sars-cov it can be seen from the table that the spike protein of sars-cov-2 has a significantly lower total free energy gtotal6730328 kcalmol than the spike protein of sars-cov gtotal6313996 kcalmol table 2 these results suggest that sars-cov-2 is more stable and able to survive a significantly higher temperature than sars-cov this may partly explain the higher infection ability of sars-cov-2 than sars-cov because sars-cov-2 would have a higher persistence than sars-cov at the same temperature the lower free energy of the sars-cov-2 spike protein may result from the virus evolution or adaption to hosts because sars-like coronaviruses normally originate from bats that are known to have a higher body temperature than humans 505152 in other words sars-cov-2 and other sars-like coronaviruses would have evolved to achieve a lower free energy for their spike proteins by recombination or mutations so that they can survive in high-temperature animals like bats 1 in addition the free energy decomposition also shows that the lower free energy of sars-cov-2 spike protein than sars-cov spike protein is mainly attributed to the free energy in a vacuum ggas 3640544 vs 3205343 kcalmol whereas their solvation energies gsolv are more comparable 3089784 vs 3108653 kcalmol table 2 this may reflect an evolution trend of sars-like coronaviruses ie favoring the internal interactions between residues instead of the solvation energy this kind of evolution would also be beneficial for the persistence of coronaviruses because such kinds of coronaviruses with lower internal energy would be more robust and able to survive in both the air and solvent coronaviruses use the spike protein to attach host cells by binding the host cell receptor therefore the receptor binding domain rbd of the spike protein is critical for coronaviruses to infect host cells here we have run lengthy md simulations to investigate the dynamic properties of the rbd proteins for sars-cov-2 and sars-cov table 3 shows a comparison between the free energies of the free rbd proteins for sars-cov-2 and sars-cov similar to the findings in the spike protein as detailed in the last section table 2 the rbd protein of sars-cov-2 also shows a significantly lower free energy than that of sars-cov 409004 vs 361773 kcalmol table 3 which may also be understood by the evolution pressure on coronaviruses due to their high-temperature host environment however unlike in the spike protein where the free energy difference between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov is mostly attributed the inter-residue interactions in a vacuum ggas here in the rbd protein the free energy difference between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov comes from both the free energies in vacuum ggas 210437 vs 170366 kcalmol and solvation energy gsolv 198568 vs 191407 kcalmol table 3 the lower solvation energy of sars-cov-2 rbd than sars-cov rbd may be understood because the rbd must move up away from the spike protein and into the water in order to bind human ace2 27 in other words sars-cov-2 would have evolved to be more soluble so that it can move up and bind the ace2 more easily the better solubility of sars-cov-2 rbd than sars-cov rbd may also contribute to part of the higher infection ability of sars-cov-2 than sars-cov protein flexibility is a critical factor in binding as it may not only change the binding interface between two proteins but also be an important contribution to the entropy penalty upon binding therefore we have investigated the protein flexibility of the rbd domains for sars-cov-2 and sars-cov by analyzing their coordinate trajectories figure 3 shows two ensembles of selected trajectories over a period of 10 ns simulations for the rbd proteins of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov the figure also gives a comparison of the root mean square fluctuations rmsf a rough measurement of protein flexibility for the rbds of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov it can be seen from the figure that the rbd of sars-cov-2 shows a significantly higher rmsf than that of sars-cov in other words the sars-cov-2 rbd is much more flexible than the sars-cov rbd the flexibility is especially higher in the loop of residues 470490 near the binding site than in other regions figure 3a that means that sars-cov-2 must overcome much more entropy penalty than sars-cov when binding to human ace2 as we know the binding free energy between two proteins can be expressed as gets where e is the interaction energy s is the entropy loss upon binding and t is the temperature of the system as s is negative here the binding free energy will become higher and the binding will become weaker with the increasing temperature therefore the rbd-ace2 binding affinity for sars-cov-2 is expected to decrease much faster than that for sars-cov when the temperature increases in other words sars-cov-2 is much more temperature-sensitive than sars-cov in terms of rbd-ace2 binding namely sars-cov-2 will decrease its infection ability much faster than sars-cov when the temperature rises therefore it is expected that sars-cov-2 would become less infectious compared to sars-cov and the disease prevention and control for sars-cov-2 may get easier when the weather gets warmerhotter although the drug and vaccine development targeting the rbd protein may be more challenging because of the high protein flexibility near the binding site previous studies showed that sars-cov-2 is highly homologous to human sars-cov and attaches host cells through the binding of the spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme ii ace2 however the molecular mechanisms of sars-cov-2 binding to human ace2 and evolution of sars-cov-2 remain unclear in this study we have extensively studied the rbd-ace2 complex spike protein and free rbd protein systems of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov through protein-protein docking and md simulations it was found that sars-cov-2 can bind human ace2 with a higher binding affinity than sars-cov which may partly explain that sars-cov-2 is much more infectious than sars-cov the spike protein of sars-cov-2 shows a lower free energy than that of sars-cov suggesting that sars-cov-2 may be more stable and able to survive a higher temperature than sars-cov this may also provide insights into the bat origin of sars-cov-2 as bats have a higher body-temperature than humans in addition the sars-cov-2 rbd exhibits a significantly higher flexibility than sars-cov rbd especially near the binding site that means that sars-cov-2 must overcome a higher entropy penalty in order to bind ace2 and is thus more temperature-sensitive than sars-cov in human infection therefore with the rising temperature sars-cov-2 is expected to decrease its infection ability much faster and become much less infectious than sars-cov which would make the disease prevention and control of sars-cov-2 easier from the above results together one may infer that unlike sars-cov which was gone after 2003 sars-cov-2 might survive a high-temperature environment like summer in which the virus is not activeinfectious due to the high flexibility in the rbd and then become infectious again when the temperature is low in the winter these results may have a far-reaching implication for the disease prevention and control as well as drug and vaccine development for sars-cov-2   in silico comparison of spike protein-ace2 binding affinities across species significance for the possible origin of the sars-cov-2 virus sakshi piplani puneet singh kumar david winkler a nikolai petrovsky  the devastating impact of the covid-19 pandemic caused by sars-coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has raised important questions on the origins of this virus the mechanisms of any zoonotic transfer from exotic animals to humans whether companion animals or those used for commercial purposes can act as reservoirs for infection and the reasons for the large variations in sars-cov-2 susceptibilities across animal species traditional lab-based methods will ultimately answer many of these questions but take considerable time increasingly powerful in silico modeling methods provide the opportunity to rapidly generate information on newly emerged pathogens to aid countermeasure development and also to predict potential future behaviors we used an in silico structural homology modeling approach to characterize the sars-cov-2 spike protein which predicted its high affinity binding to the human ace2 receptor next we sought to gain insights into the possible origins and transmission path by which sars-cov-2 might have crossed to humans by constructing models of the ace2 receptors of relevant species and then calculating the binding energy of sars-cov-2 spike protein to each of these notably sars-cov-2 spike protein had the highest overall binding energy for human ace2 greater than all the other tested species including bat the postulated source of the virus this indicates that sars-cov-2 is a highly adapted human pathogen of the species studied the next highest binding affinity after human was pangolin which is most likely explained by a process of convergent evolution binding of sars-cov-2 for dog and cat ace2 was similar to affinity for bat ace2 all being lower than for human ace2 and is consistent with only occasional observations of infections of these domestic animals snake ace2 had low affinity for spike protein making it highly improbable that snakes acted as an intermediate vector overall the data indicates that sars-cov-2 is uniquely adapted to infect humans raising important questions as to whether it arose in nature by a rare chance event or whether its origins might lie elsewhere  the devastating impact of covid-19 infections caused by sars-coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has stimulated unprecedented international activity to discover effective vaccines and drugs for this and other pathogenic coronaviruses 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 it has also raised important questions on the mechanisms of zoonotic transfer of viruses from animals to humans questions as to whether companion animals or those used for commercial purposes can act as reservoirs for infection and the reasons for the large variations in sars-cov-2 susceptibility across animal species 17 18 19 understanding how viruses move between species may help us prevent or minimize these pathways in the future elucidating the molecular basis for the different susceptibilities of species may also shed light on the differences in susceptibilities in different sub-groups of humans very recently shi et al published the results of experiments to determine the susceptibility to sars-cov-2 of ferrets cats dogs and other domesticated animals 20 they showed that sars-cov-2 virus replicates poorly in dogs pigs chickens and ducks but ferrets and cats are permissive to infection other studies have reported the susceptibility of other animal species to sars-cov-2 17 20 21 susceptible species such as macaques hamsters and ferrets are used as animal models of sars-cov-2 infection 22 23 24 in the absence of purified isolated ace2 from all the relevant animal species that could be used to measure the molecular affinities to spike protein experimentally computational methods offer considerable promise for determining the rank order of affinities across species as a method to impute which species may be permissive to sars-cov-2 here we show how computational chemistry methods from structure-based drug design can be used to determine the relative binding affinities of the sars-cov-2 spike protein for its receptor angiotensin converting enzyme ace-2 a critical initiating event for sars-cov-2 infection across multiple common and exotic animal species 25 26 27 the aim of these studies was to better understand the species-specific nature of this interaction and see if this could help elucidate the origin of sars-cov-2 and the mechanisms for its zoonotic transmission to construct the three-dimensional structure of the sars-cov-2 spike protein the sequence was retrieved from ncbi genbank database accession number yp0097243901 a psi-blast search against the pdb database for template selection was performed and the x-ray structure of sars coronavirus spike template refcode 6acc was selected with 764 sequence similarity to sars-cov-2 spike protein the protein sequences of the ace2 proteins for different species is summarized in table 11 and full sequence alignment in supplementary figure 1  the phylogenetic tree for ace2 proteins from selected animal species is illustrated in supplementary   figure 2  the 3d-structures were built using modeller 921 httpssalilaborgmodeller 28 the quality of the generated models was evaluated using the ga341 score and dope scores and the models assessed using swiss-model structure assessment server httpsswissmodelexpasyorgassess 29 the x-ray crystal structures of human ace2 recode 3sci and human sars spike protein refcode 5xlr were retrieved from protein data bank protein preparation and removal of nonessential and non-bridging water molecules for docking studies were performed using the ucsf chimera package httpswwwcglucsfeduchimera 30 these modelled structures were docked against sars-cov-2 spike protein structure using the hdock server httphdockphyshusteducn 31 32 molecular docking was performed on the homology modelled sars-cov-2 spike protein with human and animal ace2 proteins the sars-cov spike protein was also docked with human ace2 protein to obtain the docking pose for binding energy calculations the docking poses were ranked using an energy-based scoring function the docked structures were analyzed using ucsf chimera software the final models were optimized using the amber99sb-ildn force field in gromacs2020 httpwwwgromacsorg 33 docked complexes sars-cov-2 spike with human ace2 human sars-cov spike with human ace2 sars-cov-2 spike with bat ace2 etc were used as starting geometries for md simulations simulations were carried out using the gpu accelerated version of the program with the amber99sb-ildn force field i periodic boundary conditions on an oracle cloud server docked complexes were immersed in a truncated octahedron box of tip3p water molecules the solvated box was further neutralized with na or cl counter ions using the tleap program particle mesh ewald pme was employed to calculate the long-range electrostatic interactions the cutoff distance for the long-range van der waals vdw energy term was 120  the whole system was minimized without any restraint the above steps applied 2500 cycles of steepest descent minimization followed by 5000 cycles of conjugate gradient minimization after system optimization the md simulations was initiated by gradually heating each system in the nvt ensemble from 0 to 300 k for 50 ps using a langevin thermostat with a coupling coefficient of 10ps and with a force constant of 20 kcalmol2 on the complex finally a production run of 100 ns of md simulation was performed under a constant temperature of 300 k in the npt ensemble with periodic boundary conditions for each system during the md procedure the shake algorithm was applied for the constraint of all covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms the time step was set to 2 fs the structural stability of the complex was monitored by the rmsd and rmsf values of the backbone atoms of the entire protein finally the free energies of binding were calculated for all the simulated docked structures calculations were also performed for up to 500 ns on human ace2 to ensure that 100ns is sufficiently long for convergence duplicate production runs starting with different random seeds were also run to allow estimates of binding energy uncertainties to be determined for the strongest binding ace2 structures the binding free energies of the protein-protein complexes were evaluated in two ways the traditional method is to calculate the energies of solvated sars-cov-2 spike and ace2 proteins and that of the bound complex proteins and derive the binding energy by subtraction g binding aq  g complex aq -g spike aq  g ace2 aq we also calculated binding energies using the molecular mechanics poisson boltzmann surface area mm-pbsa tool in gromacs that is derived from the nonbonded interaction energies of the complex 34 35 the method is also widely used method for binding free energy calculations the binding free energies of the protein complexes were analyzed during equilibrium phase from the output files of 100 ns md simulations the gmmpbsa tool in gromacs was used after molecular dynamics simulations the output files obtained were used to post-process binding free free energy decomposition analyses were also performed by mm-pbsa decomposition to get a detailed insight into the interactions between the ligand and each residue in the binding site the binding interaction of each ligand-residue pair includes three terms the van der waals contribution the electrostatic contribution and the solvation contribution another estimate of the strength of the interaction between protein-protein complex can be obtained from the non-bonded interaction energy between the complex gromacs has the ability to decompose the short-range nonbonded energies between any number of defined groups to compute the interaction energies as a part of our analysis we reran the trajectory files obtained during simulation to recompute energies using -rerun command the interaction energy is the combination of short range coulombic interaction energy coul-srprotein-protein and the short-range lennard-jones energy lj-srprotein-protein see table 3  while this paper was being prepared a paper by guterres and im described a substantial improvement in protein-ligand docking results using high-throughput md simulations 36 they employed docking using autodock vina followed by md simulation using charmm the parameters they advocated were very similar to those used in our study proteins were solvated in a box of tip3p water molecules extending 10  beyond the proteins and the particle-mesh ewald method was used for electrostatic interactions nonbonded interactions over 10 and 12  were truncated their systems were minimized for 5000 steps using the steepest descent method followed by 1 ns equilibration with an nvt setting for each protein-ligand complex they ran 3  100 ns production runs from the same initial structure using different initial velocity random seeds and an integration step size of 2 fs the ancestry of sars-cov-2 traces back to the human civet and bat sars-cov strains which all use the same ace2 proteins for cellular entry 37 38 39 the similarities and variations in sequences for both the sars-cov-2 spike protein and the sars spike protein were determined from sequences retrieved from ncbi genbank databank and aligned using clustalw the spike protein receptor binding domain rbd region showed a 72 identity between the two viruses  figure 1  conserved regions in black and non-conserved residues in red and blue the three-dimensional structure of sars-cov-2 spike protein  figure the ramachandran scores of the modeled ace2 structures for selected species are summarized in table 1 with the actual predicted ace2 structures and ramachandran plots for each selected species shown in supplementary figure 3  figure 3   the modelled structures were further assessed for quality control using ramachandran plot and molprobity scores in swissmodel structure assessment the ramachandran plot checks the stereochemical quality of a protein by analyzing residue-by-residue geometry and overall structure geometry is also a way to visualize energetically allowed regions for backbone dihedral angles  against  of amino acid residues in protein structure the ramachandran score of sars-cov-2 spike protein was 90 in the binding region and molprobity scores that provide an evaluation of model quality at both the global and local level was 317 further the ace2 modelled structures from selected species were also assessed using swiss model structure assessment ramachandran score or the percentage of amino acid residues falling into the energetically favored region for all species ranged from 96-99 table 1  these ramachandran and molprobity scores show that all the built structures were of good quality and were suitable for use in further studies the ramachandran graphs are presented in supplementary figure 3  the receptor binding domain rbd of sars-cov-2 spike protein was docked against ace2 receptor of various species using hdock server the interacting residues of ace2 and sars-cov-2 spike protein are depicted in table 3  we found certain key amino acids in the receptor binding motif rbm that were in accordance with previous studies 40  certain amino acids including phe28 asn330 asp355 and arg357 were conserved in ace2 of most of the selected species and were observed to take part in the interaction with spike protein tyr41 lys353 ala386 and arg393 also interacted with spike protein residues and were highly conserved across all species except bat mouse ferret and pangolin respectively spike protein interacting residues with ophiophagus hannah king cobra were least common amongst all the ace2 species included in the study consistent with its low sequence similarity to human ace2 homo sapiens human the molecular dynamics simulation of complexes of sars-cov-2 spike protein and ace2 receptors of various species were performed for 100ns all complexes became stable during simulation with rmsd fluctuations converging to a range of 05 to 08 nm from the original position the calculated binding energies for the interactions of sars-cov-2 with ace2 from the species studied are presented in table 4  the table 4 also includes observational in vivo data on sars-cov-2 infectivity and disease symptoms in the species where this has been reported although bats carry many coronaviruses including sars-cov a relative of sars-cov-2 direct evidence for existence of sars-cov-2 in bats has not been found as highlighted by our data the binding strength of sars-cov-2 for bat ace2 is considerably lower than for human ace2 suggesting that even if sars-cov-2 did originally arise from a bat precursor it must later have adapted its spike protein to optimise its binding to human ace2 there is no current explanation for how when or where this might have happened instances of direct human infection by coronaviruses or other bat viruses is rare with transmission typically involving an intermediate host for example lyssaviruses such as hendra are periodically transmitted from bats to horses and then to humans who contact the infected horse similarly sars-cov was shown to be transmitted from bats to civet cats and from them to humans to date a virus identical to sars-cov-2 has not been identified in bats or any other non-human species making its origins unclear to date the most closely related coronavirus to sars-cov-2 is the bat coronavirus batcov ratg1 which has 96 whole-genome identity to sars-cov-2 50 hence other genetic factors could underlie the apparent lack of susceptibility of dogs to covid-19 clinical infection it is known that gain of function gof mutations occur in viruses that can lead to pandemics gof means viruses gain a new property eg in influenza virus gof has been associated with the acquisition of a new function such as mammalian transmissibility increased virulence for humans or evasion of existing host immunity 49 the conditioning of viruses to humans as pandemics progress is well recognized however the sars-cov-2 structures and sequences that we employed were from viruses collected very early in the pandemic it is therefore not clear how sars-cov-2 could have developed such a high affinity for human ace2 notably higher than for those of putative zoonotic sources for sars-cov-2 unless it has been previously selected on human ace2 or an ace2 of another species bearing a closely homologous spike protein binding domain interestingly pangolin ace2 bears some similarities in its sbd to human ace2 this marries with the fact that pangolin-cov shares a highly similar rbd to sars-cov-2 although their remaining sequence has only 90 similarity this could be consistent with a process of convergent evolution whereby human and pangolin coronaviruses infecting via ace2 have come to the same solution in respect of evolving an optimal spike rbd for binding of either human or pangolin ace2 respectively our data does indicate that humans might be permissive to pangolin covs that use ace2 for cell entry a fact that needs to be borne in mind in respect of future potential coronavirus pandemic sources however this does not mean that pangolin ace2 was the receptor on which the sars-cov-2 spike protein rbd was initially selected with the strength of binding to pangolin ace2 lower than binding to human ace2 this makes it unlikely that pangolins are the missing intermediate host if sars-cov-2 spike was selected on pangolin ace2 then given the higher affinity of sars-cov-2 for human ace2 than for bat ace2 sars-cov-2 would have to have circulated in pangolins for a long period of time for this evolution and selection to occur and to date there is no evidence of a sars-cov-2 like virus circulating in pangolins another possibility would be a short term evolutionary step where a pangolin was recently coinfected with a bat ancestor to sars-cov-2 at the same time as it was infected by a pangolin cov allowing a recombination event to occur whereby the spike rbd of the pangolin virus was inserted into the bat cov thereby conferring the bat cov with high binding for both pangolin and human ace2 such recombination events are known to occur with other rna viruses and can explain creation of some pandemic influenza strains 49  nevertheless such events are by necessity rare as they require coinfection of the one host at exactly the same time most importantly if such a recombination event had occurred in pangolins it might have been expected to have similarly triggered an epidemic spread of the new highly permissive sars-cov-2 like virus among pangolin populations such as we now see occurring across the human population currently there is no evidence of such a pangolin sars-cov-2 like outbreak making this whole scenario less likely indeed pangolins might be protected from sars-cov-2 infection due to the existence of crossprotective spike rbd neutralising antibodies induced by exposure to pangolin cov given the rbd similarity of these two viruses another possibility which still cannot be excluded is that sars-cov-2 was created by a recombination event that occurred inadvertently or consciously in a laboratory handling coronaviruses with the new virus then accidentally released into the local human population given the seriousness of the ongoing sars-cov-2 pandemic it is imperative that all efforts be made to identify the original source of the sars-cov-2 virus in particular it will be important to establish whether covid-19 is due to a completely natural chance occurrence where a presumed bat virus was transmitted to humans via an intermediate animal host or whether covid-19 has alternative origins this information will be of paramount importance to help prevent any similar human coronavirus outbreak in the future  spike protein fusion loop controls sars-cov-2 fusogenicity and infectivity debnath pal  the spike is a hallmark coronavirus protein that determines virus fusion entry and spread in the host and thus holds clues for the rapid spread of the sars-cov-2 pandemic we have investigated the spike from six -coronaviruses including the sars-cov-2 and find that their surfaceexposed fusion peptides constituting the fusion loop are spatially organized contiguous to each other to work synergistically for triggering the virus-host membrane fusion process the sars-cov-2 fusion peptides have unique physicochemical properties accrued in part from the presence of consecutive prolines that impart backbone rigidity which aids the virus fusogenicity the specific contribution of these prolines has been inferred from comparative studies of their deletion mutant in a fellow murine -coronavirus mhv-a59 that show significantly diminished fusogenicity in vitro and associated pathogenesis in vivo the spike cleavage-linked priming and fusogenic conformational transition steered by the fusion loop may be critical for the sars-cov-2 spread summary the spike protein on the sars-cov-2 surface is the prime mediator of covid-19 1 because of its central role in virus-host attachment virus-entry and virus-spread 2  the contagious nature of sars-cov-2 infection has been attributed to dense glycosylation of the spike glycoprotein 3  its high affinity of binding to human ace2 receptor 4  and cleavage 5  while these may be imperative it does not explain the uncontrolled infectivity here we show that properties of the fusion peptides constituting the fusion loop of sars-cov-2 spike that triggers the virus fusion distinguishes it from the other five -coronaviruses the sars-cov-2 spike trimer surface is relatively more hydrophobic including the surface contributed by the fusion peptides the fusion peptides are structurally rigid owing to its consecutive prolines aromatichydrophobic clusters a stretch of consecutive -branched amino acids and the hydrogen bonds the role of rigidity accrued from the presence of consecutive prolines contributing to virus fusogenicity can be deciphered from our previous murine -coronavirus mhv-a59 studies 6  the synergy brought about by the global location of the surface exposed fusion peptides their physicochemical features and the fusogenic conformational transition appears to drive the fusion process which may explain the severity of the infection and widespread nature of the covid-19 pandemic  on when a rapid viral replication ensues cell-to-cell spread and acute inflammation begins to mount uncontrolled viral replication and dysregulated host immune responses may be the leading cause of fatality by sars-cov-2 despite many studies the underpinnings of high virus infectivity remain poorly understood therefore it is essential to dissect the genomic control of sars-cov-2 infectivity and virulence for the rational designing of therapeutic agents the genome the genomic constitution of sars-cov-2 does not appear to be unique in the background of the disease pathology the mers-cov share 51 genome sequence identity to sars-cov and sars-cov-2 two other  human coronaviruses hcovs hcov-hku1 and hcov-oc43 also share 51 genome identity to sars-cov and sars-cov-2 yet they cause a common cold instead of acute respiratory distress human -coronavirus nl63 and 229e strains which are even further diverged from the -hcov genomes also cause a common cold even essential genes like the rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp have diverged for example rdrp from sars-cov-2sars-cov is only 71-72 identical to mers-cov table s1  therefore what gene or genomic features distinguishes each virus is an important consideration in understanding its infectivity and spread across hosts the spike among all coronaviruses spike is a key gene that determines infectivity due to its established role in initiating virus-host attachment fusion entry and cell-to-cell fusion post replication 3  the expressed protein executes its function through a trimeric quaternary structure with each monomer segmented into the s1 and s2 domains where s1 consists of the n-terminal domain ntd and the c-terminal domain ctd while the s2 also known as the fusion domain consists of the fusion peptides fps central helix ch heptad repeat regions hr1 and hr2 and a transmembrane domain tm followed by the cytoplasmic tail cp fig 1a  the ntd or ctd embeds the receptor-binding domain rbd depending on the individual virus in sars-cov-2 the ctd embeds the rbd the rbd recognizes the host-cell and mediates the virus-host attachment while the s2 domain drives the viral entry into the host cell and cell-to-cell fusion by catalyzing the virus-host membrane fusion process the tm anchors the protein in the viral membrane while the fps contribute to the trigger that drives the virus-host membrane fusion process a transition pathway has been proposed to proceed through a pre-hairpin intermediate structure followed by pre-bundle hemifusion membrane-associated structure bundle structure and the eventual post-fusion structure 8  it is remarkable that despite their similarity in function coronavirus spike proteins have widely diverged with the rbd diverging further 21-61 pairwise sequence identity explained in part by the diversity of its host receptor targets like the human ace2 for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 dpp4 for mers-cov and 9-o-ac-sia for hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 the s2 domain has also diverged but comparatively less with 33 overall pairwise sequence identitythe heptad repeat regions being the most conserved fig 1b  it is pertinent to ask what features of spike sequence and structure determine the virus fusogenicity and infectivity spike glycosylation densely glycosylated spike protein has been suggested as the prime reason for the high sars-cov-2 infectivity 3  this extensive glycosylation of the s2 domain is driven by an intracellular n-terminal signaling peptide for transport and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum see fig 1b multiple sequence alignment 9 bottom panel however this signal sequence is absent in a fellow murine -coronavirus mhv-a59 spike protein 10  indicating limited glycosylation yet mhv-a59 aggressively infects the mouse liver and brain upon intracranial inoculation in mice it can cause acute stage meningoencephalitis and myelitis chronic stage demyelination and axonal loss 11 12 13  it infects the neurons profusely and can spread from neuron to neuron its propagation from grey matter neuron to white matter and release at the nerve ends to infect the oligodendrocytes by cell-to-cell fusion 12 are robust mechanisms to evade immune responses and induce chronic stage progressive neuroinflammatory demyelination concurrent with axonal loss in the absence of functional virions 12 14  therefore high infectivity of the mhv-a59 spike does not appear to be contingent on glycosylation and one can argue the same for sars-cov-2 spike where its glycosylation may only marginally raise the basal fusion efficiency surface glycosylation thus may not be a contributing factor to host cell binding although the successive virus-to-cell and cell-to-cell fusion may all-together play an important role in higher virus infectivity it has been suggested that enhanced virus-to-cell infection can be propelled by the increased number of hydrogen-bonded contacts between sars-cov-2 rbd and ace2 receptor leading to higher affinity and improved host targeting compared to the sars-cov 3 4  however such a proposition is weak because the rbds in all hcovs are diverse including sars-cov where the minimal rbd 318 to 510 residues shares only 74 sequence identity with sars-cov-2 fig s1  besides a significantly higher affinity between ace2 and sars-cov-2 has not been experimentally corroborated 15  also the sars-cov-2 spike may interact with other receptors such as dc-sign and dc-signr as in sars-cov to increase tropism 16 and viral spread therefore there is no direct consequence of ace2 recognition with infectivity unless a virus entry can be realized however when rbds interact with ace2 in large numbers during the acute stage of the infection they may modulate the host immune response by downregulating hydrolysis of the pro-inflammatory angiotensin ii to anti-inflammatory angiotensin 1-7 in the renin-angiotensin signaling pathway 17  this can alter the immune response and increase infectivity but such effects can manifest only beyond the early stage of the infection and for that to happen the efficiency of viral entry is the rate-limiting step spike cleavage the cleavage of the spike protein is said to prime it for the virus-host membrane fusion process how essential is this for virus fusogenicity and infectivity is an important consideration the spike cleavage potentially removes any in situ covalent and noncovalent constraints that the s1 domain may impose on the s2 domain impeding its conformational transition that facilitates the virus entry the comparison of the s1s2 cleavage signal sequence shows that sars-cov-2 has an rrars furin recognition site similar to mhv-a59 spikes rrahr required for activity 5 fig 1b  in contrast the canonical cleavage recognition sequence is missing in sars-cov with only a single arginine present there a regular cleavage at this site has not been reported and cleavage by trypsin has been shown to activate the virus independent of the ph the cleavage site signal at s2 is highly conserved across all hcovs in contrast to the s1s2 cleavage signal fig 1b  the importance of this region has been aptly corroborated by s2 site cleavage studies in sars-cov 18  besides it is also possible for spike to be activated by the low ph environment through protonation of residues if it internalizes in the endosome post interaction with the host receptor on the contrary fusion processes are known to happen in mhv-a59 spike without cleavage as well 19  therefore the sars-cov-2 spike appears competent to access multiple pathways for priming that enhances its infection capability including the possibility that it can infect without a cleavage as well among all the components of the fusion apparatus in the spike s2 domain the fps are the least studied although they have been suggested to contribute to the trigger that drives the virus-host fusion process by initiating the protein-host membrane contacts limited experimental information available shows mutation in fp of sars-cov spike can significantly perturb the fusion efficiency 20 as much as 70 21  most studies of the fp regions have used synthetic peptides in a fusion assay system to understand their membrane perturbing capabilities 22 23 24 25  and how ca 2 ions may interact with these peptides to modulate fusion 8  interestingly the fps also contains a central proline 26 in several viruses such as the avian sarcomaleucosis virus 27  ebola virus 28  vesicular stomatitis virus 29  and hepatitis c virus 30  where its important role has been investigated through mutation studies the location of coronavirus fps proximal to the nterminal of the s2 domain is reminiscent of fps from hiv-1 influenza virus and paramyxoviruses they have been suggested to be at the head a pre-hairpin intermediate structure 31 predicted for the current model of class i viral fusion proteins given that fps are believed to the early initiators of protein and host membrane contact there is still no consensus on their location for example the fusion peptide for sars-cov-2 spike has been cited at 788-806 position by xia et al 32 compared to 816-833 by wrap et al 3  when inferred from alignment to sars-cov spike two additional fp segments at 875-902 position and 1203-1220 can be proposed based on experimental studies by ou et al 33 and guilln et al 23  respectively in reality all four spike fusion domain segments fp-i to fp-iv fig 1b  mentioned can be identified by a simple window-based analysis using interfacial hydrophobicity scales such as from wimley and white 34  given that fp-1 to fp-iii are contiguous to each other in the sequence the whole segment spanning the beginning of fp-1 to the end of fp-iii can be termed together as the fusion loop fig 1a  but how these fps in the loop can act synergistically to trigger the membrane fusion process has not been understood yet spike receptor binding and fusion peptide a structural perspective to understand the synergy of the fps in the trigger process it is important to understand the structure of the spike protein in the proper context the fp-i to fp-iii are surface exposed and are contiguous to each other in space as seen from the three-dimensional structures of the spike fusion domain fig 2  cartoon diagrams while fp-i to fp-iii are always surface exposed in the full-length the fp-iv is deeply buried and interface the virus membrane therefore while fp-i to fp-iii are always available for early contacts with the host membrane fp-iv can participate in the process post the conformational transition which may expose it for interaction with the host membrane to understand what guarantees the fp surfaces to make the initial protein-host membrane contact one must look at the possible modes of virus-host attachment through the spike for example if three rbds in the trimeric structure finds a host receptor it can attain a tripod binding mode fig 3a  a recent structure of the trimeric spike complexed with a host receptor reveals the precise geometry of ceacam1 binding the rbd of spike from mhv-a59 35  however a tripod binding requires receptor molecules on the host membrane to be pre-available in a specific arrangement high expression of receptor molecules on the host cell surface is expected to increase the probability of tripod binding but there is no existing information whether such a precise arrangement is present on the host surface suitable for interaction with the trimeric rbd moreover the membrane bilayer structure does not contain any feature that can direct such regular host receptor arrangement it may be noted that only in a tripod arrangement the pre-hairpinprebundle helices of the fusion domain are expected to interact head-on with the host membrane and the n-terminal segment of the s2 domain will interact early during the protein-membrane contact in such a situation the existing model of structural transition will follow 8  fp-i and fp-ii are located middle of the cylinder-like spike s2 structure fig 3a and a conformational transition is needed to place them near the head of the cylinder here fp1 is expected to make the early hostmembrane contact if the cleavage is at the s1s2 site and fp-ii if the cleavage is at the s2 site see fig 1a  the fp-iii region has limited scope to make any early contact due to its farthest position from the host membrane surface in tripod binding mode the virus membrane is still 150 away and the three hr2 regions need to fold back and bind to the hydrophobic grooves of the hr1 trimer in an antiparallel manner to bridge this gap and form a hemifusion structure with the host membrane 8  spike fusion peptide trigger alternately if only one or two rbds bind the receptor the vertical anchoring of the spike fusion domain relative to the host surface is not feasible based on simple structural considerations also a recent trimeric structure of sars-cov-2 spike has shown a single rbd to be in open conformation 3  in such a state the interaction of the open rbd with the host fig 3b is not expected to stabilize the spike anchoring in any specific orientation relative to the host due to the weak interaction with the fusion domain here a post-cleaved s2 domain is expected to interact side-on to the membrane surface through a belly landing to trigger the fusion process fig 3c  it is to be noted that the shape of the trimeric s2 domain is not a proper cylinder but with a bulge in the mid-segment which we call a belly the fp-ii and fp-i surfaces are located at the crest of this bulge such that it is able the make the initial contact with the host membrane the structural constraints that guarantee the belly landing can be understood from the overall geometry of the spike fig 3d  the relative location of the ntd in spike form three vertices of a triangle while the fp-i to f-iii are located midpoint of the sides forming the vertices of an inner triangle if the receptor attachment is in two rbd locations the s2 landing will be close to the midpoint of the two vertices of the outer triangle coincident to the fp surfaces even for one-legged attachment the contact must always be directed towards the midpoint of the two ntds because that allows maximum contact surface to be formed where the spike can stably rest on the host surface during the contact the membranotropic segment of the fusion loop spanning the fps is expected to engage the host membrane during the fusogenic conformational change in this case the fp sites are proximal to the virus membrane surface such that hemifusion membrane structures can be initiated early in comparison to the tripod-binding mode which requires an intermediate pre-hairpin structure to be formed it is also to be noted that weak rbd binding to s2 domain or disintegration of the spike trimer post tripod binding can mimic the one-or two-legged binding mode the physicochemical property of the fusion loop and the synergy of the fps therein is critical to the rapid initiation and transition to the hemifusion stage of the membrane fusion process the reorganization of the fusion loop and formation of the eventual six-helix bundle would have its side-face making maximum possible interface while contacting the host surface since the exerted force during the conformation transition is tangential to the host surface the orthogonal frictional forces may allow an efficient scything action based on the physiochemical nature of the contact engaged by the fusion loop the nature of the initial surfaces of the fusion loop can be obtained from the electrostatic potential of the fp-i to fp-iii surface patches 36 fig 2 surface diagrams  among the six spike proteins considered in this study sars-cov-2 has the most hydrophobicneutral electrostatic fp patches white colored most suitable for membrane disruption it also has the least amount of highly negative electrostatic surface red colored patches which repel the attachment of the s2 domain to the host membrane due to the repelling hydrophilic surface of the outer membrane composed of negatively charged fatty acid groups on the other hand a positive electrostatic surface blue colored patches may allow protein surface to tightly attach to the membrane exterior through charge attraction the presence of an interfacial ion like the ca 2 can cap the negative charge at the fp surface to assist fusion trigger -consistent with the membrane charge compatibility requirements the disruption efficiency of surface patches is therefore likely to be highest for the hydrophobicneutral followed by the positive and negative electrostatic potential unless modulated by an interfacial cation like the ca 2  one may argue that large patches of negative electrostatic surface potential red color in the hcov-hku1 and hcov-oc43 spike fusion domain may explain the mild nature of those viruses aside from the electrostatics the physical rigidity of the fusion loop in spike is of prime importance for the virus fusogenicity this is because the spike fusion domain being metastable any local alteration of rigidity has global implications for the molecule this has been alluded to by the mutation studies on the fusion peptide central prolines 27 28 29 30  but its criticality was recently revealed from our comprehensive studies on centrally located consecutive prolines in mhv-a59 spike fusion peptide 6  proline being an imino-acid with unique structure has restricted torsional freedom which in turn restricts the torsional freedom of the protein backbone where it is located 37  when two consecutive prolines are located the rigidity of the protein backbone is further enhanced among the six spike proteins in our study three has a single central proline in fp-i and two centrally located consecutive prolines occur in sars-cov-2 spike fp-1 there are no central prolines in fp-ii and a single conserved central proline in fp-iv while consecutive prolines exist at a central location in hcov-hku1 hcov-oc43 and mhv-a59 fp-iii spikes to understand the intrinsic flexibilityrigidity of the surface exposed fps we set up a 500 ns molecular dynamics simulations 38 using charmm forcefield 39 fig 4  the starting structures of all the fp-i fragments are devoid of stable secondary structures such as helices or sheets and is dominated by turns and irregular structures indicating that the region prefers to be in a loop conformation this is true even for the mhv-a59 spike which is flexible as experimentally evidenced by the lack of coordinate from the electron density map for complete fp-i in the pdb file 3jcl in comparison fp-iis in all cases are dominated by helical conformation with the nterminal fp segments always in a helical state this is true for fp-iii region fragments as well given an irregular structure the effect of proline is more dramatic on the fp-i region in contrast to fps from fp-ii and fp-iii which are already stabilized by hydrogen bonds in helices for all fps in the fp-i region although local secondary structures are induced during simulation the lowest root-mean-square fluctuation rmsf for a residue is achieved only by the sars-cov-2 consecutive proline containing fp this can also be confirmed from the energy landscape plot created from the molecular dynamics simulation trajectory fig s2 where it has the most compact single conformational well among all the fp-is if we look at the fp-iii regions where other consecutive proline containing fps exist hcov-oc43 has the lowest rmsf sars-cov-2 fp-iii segment does not have any central proline but it contains a unique thr-ile-thr segment constituted of three consecutive -branched side-chain residues that can impart substantial rigidity based on steric considerations 37 if not as much as the consecutive prolines this can be again confirmed from the energy landscape plot which shows a single compact conformational well in contrast to the other fp-iiis fig s2  the observations are consistent with our previous comparative molecular dynamics studies 6 on mhv-a59 fp-iii and single central proline containing fp-iii from another parental non-neurotropic strain of murine hepatitis virus mhv mhv-2 where we found the fp-iii from the former became more rigid than the latter in methanolic conditions compared to water additionally nmr studies on the mhv-a59 fp-iii fragment revealed its unique ability to form cis-peptide at the central p-p peptide bond 6  a cistrans isomerization during the membrane fusion process has the potential to expose the hydrophobic residues efficiently around the isomerized-peptide neighborhood enhancing the fusion trigger potential while the structural role of proline cannot be discounted other stabilizing interactions also dominate the fps among which the formation of the aromatichydrophobic clusters is of relevance to the fusion process see fig s2 for examples as observed from the packing of the loops a combination of aromatic and valileleu side chains pack tightly to exclude water but when these regions become exposed during the conformational transition they would enhance the hydrophobic interaction of the protein surface with the membrane in all s2 domains however fp-iii regions are in part masked by the fp-i segment as evident from the relative solvent accessible surface area sasa values indicated in fig 4  the fp-iii region can get fully exposed post cleavage at the s2 site which dislodges the sheathing fp-i segment or when the site gets progressively exposed during the conformational transition amidst the fusion process experimental corroboration additional evidence of rigidity imparted by proline being critical for virus fusogenicity infectivity and pathogenicity can be obtained from our previous in vitro and in vivo studies 6  we generated the spike containing two consecutive prolines at 938-939 s-mhv-a59pp in the fp-iii and its proline deletion 938 mutant s-mhv-a59p from isogenic recombinant strain of mhv-a59 rsa59 6 spike protein the proline deleted mutant only spike gene construct s-mhv-a59p show slower trafficking to the cell surface and significantly less fusogenicity established on differential properties of proline deletion in spike construct we generated proline deleted targeted recombinant mutant strain rsa59p- which contains s-mhv-a59p and compared it with two consecutive proline-containing parental isogenic strain rsa59 containing s-mhv-a59pp proline deleted mutant rsa59p- infection in neuronal cell line demonstrated less aggressive and fewer syncytia formation and one order lower viral titers postinfection in vitro based on these in vitro differential properties of proline deletion in spike construct we generated proline deleted targeted recombinant mutant strain of rsa59p- which contains s-mhv-a59p and compared it with two consecutive proline containing parental isogenic strain rsa59 containing s-mhv-a59pp the in vivo studies in mice parallels the in vitro studies demonstrating significantly reduced viral replication and consecutive disease pathologies like less severity in meningitis encephalitis and demyelination and inability to infect the retina nor induce loss of retinal ganglion cells 40  the non-neurotropic strain mhv-2 sharing 91 genome identity with mhv-a59 and 83 pairwise spike sequence identity with a single central proline in fp-iii causes only meningitis and is unable to invade the brain parenchyma computational studies of s2 fusion domains of s-mhv-a59pp and mhv-2 spike involving molecular dynamics confirmed the former to be more rigid and containing more residues in the regular secondary structure 6  target for therapy our study brings out the importance of the fusion loop region which could be a legitimate target for the design of vaccine or synthetic agents for therapy against covid-19 the s2 domain serves as a better therapeutic target than s1 due to higher evolutionary conservation but the few attempts made have mainly focussed attention on the heptad repeat regions 8  two important features that also make the fusion loop an attractive therapeutic target are its accessibility due to its surface exposure in the full-length spike and the relatively high conservation of residues in the fusion loop especially around the fp-ii region which increases its scope as a pan-coronavirus target that can cater to future pandemic threats as well mimetic peptides can be designed to bind to the fusion loop to inhibit the fusogenic conformational transition of the s2 domain impairment of the fusion trigger would have a direct bearing on the fusogenicity of the virus and contribute to the reduction of lung invasion and damage that clinically results in acute pneumonia systematic studies can identify the minimal motif in the fusion loop serving as the fusogenic determinant to improve our selection of a potential therapeutic target to prevent cell-to-cell fusion and subsequent pathogenesis the interplay of the outlined physicochemical features determines the virus-entry process to become more efficient the local and global stability of the s2 domain is important since the s2 domain undergoes a conformational transition local stability means reasonably rigid moving parts and global stability means a well-defined conformational transition pathway from the metastable to the stable state this local and global stability requirement could be attributed to the physicochemical efficiency needed in disturbing the host membrane secondly the electrostatic potential of the fusion peptide derived surface patches must be neutral or positive to be able to engage the host membrane the presence of glycosylation sites adds to the hydrophobicity of the s2 domain surface but it is a small fraction of the available surface for interaction with the host membrane the fusogenic conformational transition requires optimal synergy between the physical and chemical properties of the fusion loop to allow a concurrent scything action to rapidly facilitate transition to the host-virus hemifusion membrane state the free-energy available from the conformational transition of s2 to a more relaxed helical bundle is available to disrupt the host membrane and overcome the kinetic barrier to bring the host and virus membrane lipid bilayers together the pre-hairpin s2 intermediate as suggested to exist by many researchers may be one of the many conformational states interacting with the host membrane priming by spike cleavage is important for facilitating the fusion process and therefore a part of the synergy at play however the open conformation of rbd seen in pdb id 6vsb for sars-cov-2 suggests that flexible linker segments loosely connect the rbd back to the fusion domain leaving it relatively free for unfettered conformational transition therefore multifarious options to prime and trigger appear to be available to sars-cov-2 for viral entry which contributes to its increased infectivity preventing the trigger by inhibiting the fusion loop is therefore a suitable target for therapy given the importance a more extensive study of sars-cov-2 spike protein and the mechanistic hypothesis described here is therefore warranted

of sars-cov-2 a systematic review manisha prajapat phulen sarma nishant shekhar ajay prakash pramod avti anusuya bhattacharyya hardeep kaur subodh kumar seema bansal amit sharma raj bikash medhi   sars-corona virus cov-2 is the newest member of a large group of viruses coming under the order nidovirales and family coronaviridae and genera beta coronavirus group 2b1 sars-cov-2 consists of four basic structural proteins which are club shape trimeric spike protein s membrane m protein envelop e protein and helically symmetrical nucleocapsid protein n2 the molecular basis of transmission of coronavirus cov is already explained in our previous systematic review3 the infection process starts with the binding of the spike protein s1-domain to the human host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 aces which leads to conformational change in the s1 and s2 domain of spike protein these changes expose the fusion peptide of s2-domain which mediates the fusion of the viral and host cell membranes the rna genome of the virus is then subsequently released into the host cell the virus uses host-cell machinery to start the translation process to synthesize necessary polyproteins such as a pp1a pp1ab which are further processed by proteases to release the nonstructural viral proteins nsps the structural proteins spike e n and m protein are translated from their respective location in the viral genome the synthesized structural proteins nonstructural proteins and rna genome assembles which is then transported outside the cell by exocytosis4 coming to the presently available pharmacotherapeutic options for the treatment of covid-19 chloroquine hydroxychloroquine5 interferon- ribavirin corticosteroids3 plasma therapy6 intravenous immune-globulins7 lopinavirritonavir etc are the mainstream treatment options however most of the agents are being used without major clinical evidence of efficacy and safety although many therapeutic options are under evaluation in different settings for example in silico in vitro preclinical and clinical studies however definite evidence of efficacy of any of the agents in clinical settings is still not clear2358 sars-cov-2 is 7080 similar to sars-cov at the genomic level9 recent studies highlighted many important genomic variations in sars-cov-2 for example the absence of 8a protein changes in number of amino acid in 3c and 8b protein4 the spike protein is also modified by the homologous recombination process10 as compared to sars-cov a mutation n501t in the spike protein of sars-cov-2 confers higher-binding affinity of sars-cov2 to the ace2 receptor11 better understanding the viral life cycle in terms of structural biology perspectives can help us in identifying druggable targets which can be approached from drug design perspective here we systematically reviewed the available target protein structures of sars-cov2 in relation to the viral life cycle and drug-design perspective we included peer-reviewed published studies evaluating target protein three-dimensional 3d structure nuclear magnetic resonance x-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy structure with or without bound ligand with structures deposited and published in rcsborg among unpublished studies with structure published in rcsborg we included only inhibitor bound structures after reviewing the full text of the articles we could find published papers with 3d structures of only four targets which are spike protein main protease also known as main protease mpro and 3clpro rna-dependent rna-polymerase rdrp and nsp15 of sars cov-2 the spike proteins are trimeric fusion proteins with two main domains the s1 and the s2 domain the structure the spike protein of sars-cov2 is around 77 conserved when compared to sars-cov12 root mean square deviation rmsd between sars-cov receptor-binding domain rbd and sars-cov-2 rbd is around 12 angstrom and rmsd between receptor-binding motif rbm of sars-cov and rbm of sars-cov-2 is around 13 angstrom implicating high similarity between these two structures13 the affinity of interaction between ectodomain of sars-cov-2 and ace-2 is very high 1020 fold as compared to sars-cov and thus it contributes to the high infectivity sars-cov-214 the spike proteins are considered as a class-1 viral fusion-protein and it requires two-step protease cleavages for activation the site between s1 and s2 is the location of priming cleavage however the activation cleavage occurs solely on s2 different protease for example trans-membrane protease serine protease-2 tmprss-2 tmprss-4 human airway trypsin hat like protease cathepsins etc are involved in these proteolytic activation process in cell-based experiments 293hace2 cells the expression of different tmprss iso-forms enhanced sars-cov-2 spike protein-mediated cell-cell fusion15 the s1-rbd-mediated recognition and attachment to the host receptor ace2 is a prime-initiating event which leads to viral and host-cell fusion and other subsequent events this highlights the importance of detailed understanding of the interactions between the s1 domain of spike protein and ace2 the rbd of the s1-spike protein of sars-cov-2 consists of a core region and the receptor-binding motif rbm16 the core region consists of 5 beta-pleated sheets 1 2 3 4 and 7 which are organized in the antiparallel mode the rbm consists of two short beta-pleated sheets 5 and 6 loops and alpha helices alpha 4 and 5 a total of three cysteine residue pairs provide stability to the core and another cysteine residue pair helps in connecting the distal end of rbm13 however the interacting surface between the s1 rbd and ace2 is quite huge total buried surface area of 1687 angstraon2 with around 800  each on the s1 rbd side and ace2 side13 compared to sars-cov many variations were seen in the sars-cov rbd region for example in the n terminal the variations arg426 to asn 439 tyr484 to gln498 and thr487 to asn50 were observed between sars-cov and novel sars-cov217 ace2 also serves as a chaperone to the amino acid transporter boat1 slc6a19 a full length structure of ace2-boat1 complex is already reported the complex represent a homodimer 2 ace2-boat1 of two heterodimers ace2-boat1 exhibit closed or open conformation due to shift of the peptidase domain pd of ace2 however the homo-dimerization is mediated by the collectrin like domain cld18 interestingly the open close conformation of the complex is governed by the state of the peptidase domain of the ace2 the peptidase domain also binds to the s1 domain of spike protein a dimeric ace2 complex can accommodate two s proteins together these interactions may play an important role in membrane invagination during endocytosis however ace2 may stay as homodimer even in the absence of bo at118 pdb i d 6m17 represents a cryo-em structure ace-2 amino acids 814 in the presence of the transporter b0at1 with and without rbd of sars-cov-2-spike protein resolution of 29 angstroms18 the structure of spike-protein rbd in complex with ace2-boat complex is shown in figure 2 the pd of ace2 is the main region responsible for its interaction with the spike protein dissociation constant kd of 15 nm17 the major interactions being h bond between rbd gln498 thr500 and asn501 with n terminal of ace-2 tyr41 gln42 lys353 and arg357 tyr453 and lys417 of rbd region bind with middle of the bridge region of ace2 asp30 and his34 hydrogen bond forms in between gln474 residues of rbd and gln24 residues of c terminal of ace2 phe486 of the rbd shows van-der waal force interaction with met 82 of ace-217 the s2 subunit has a key role in the membrane fusion19 the homology between s2 segments of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 is around 8920 the fusion process is initiated by the initial interactions between the rbd of spike s1 domain of sars-cov-2 and the pd of ace220 this process is followed by the interaction between heptad repeat1 hr1 and heptad repeat2 hr2 domain of s2 to form a six helix bundle fusion core which fuses with the host cell membrane21 compared to sars-cov-2 an eight residue sequence in the fusion region of s2 of sars-cov-2 imparts more stability to the six helix bundle core22 an already established pan cov inhibitor ek1 was also found to be useful against sars-cov-2 by conjugating cholesterol with the ek1 a new molecule was designed ek1c4 which showed more potent inhibitory action against sars-cov-223 compared to sars-cov the host membrane fusion ability is higher in the case of sars-cov-2 few mutated amino acids in the hr1 results in enhanced interaction with the hr2 domain22 details of interaction between hr1 and hr2 of s2 can be visualized in the pdb 6 lxt22 the s2 domain contains two heptad repeats hr1 and hr2 and one fusion peptide in case of sars-cov critical cleavage at r797 may expose the viral fusion peptide24 this fusion peptide-associated fusion platform bipartite alters the membrane integrity in the presence of calcium25 a proteolytic cleavage in the s2 exposes the fusion peptide in virology fusion peptides are used as the mediators for the fusion process as they help lipid membranes to fuse and permeabilize in case of sars-cov-2 two fusion peptides are recognized that is sarsww-i and sarsww-ii at the n terminal region of spike protein of ncov however among these only sarsww-i peptide robustly divided into the membranes of large unilamellar vesicles and induced the fusion of lipid vesicles causing vesicular aggregation and induced the leakage of lipid vesicles an indicator of the propensity to perturb membrane integrity26 in another experiment treatment with bafilomycin or ammonium chloride decreased the sars-cov-entry to 293hace2 cells indicating endocytosis as the possible route of establishment of cellular infection some phosphoinositides may play an important role in this endocytosis process for example phosphatydleinositol 3-phosphate 5 kinase pipkin which plays a major role in the synthesis of phosphotydilinositol 35 bis phosphate in early endosome inhibiting pipkin with apilimod resulted in the decreased entry of sars-cov-2 spike pseudo-virion into 293hace2 cells however in the downstream tcp2 was found to be another major determinant in the sars-cov-2 endocytosis process15 after searching the rcsb database we could find eight structures of spike protein s1 and s2 domain of which respective study was also published in a peer reviewed journal however we could find few structures of which details were not available in the peer reviewed domain however among these structures we could find one structure pdb i d 6w41 in which rbd of s1 of sars-cov-2 was co-crystallized with a neutralizing antibody isolated from convalescent sars-cov patients12 the pdb i d 6vw1 represents sars-cov-2 chimeric rbd crystallization structure complex16 the structures 6vxx and 6vyb represent the sars-cov-2 s ectodomain trimer both in both closed and open states the pdb i d 6vsb represents a high-resolution structure cryo em of the spike protein 346  with sequence length of 1288 amino acids14 the pdb i d 6m0j represents a crystal structure of rbd region of spike protein s bound to the ace2 receptor at the resolution of 245 13 again some of the polyclonal antibodies against spike protein of sars-cov also neutralized satrs-cov-2 indicating that the conserved regions of the s epitopes can be targeted for developing a vaccine27 however three sars-cov specific antibodies failed to bind against the spike protein of sars-cov-214 the replicase gene of sars-cov-2 encodes two polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab which are necessary for replicationtranscription process of the virus202829 the main protease and the papain-like protease are the two major proteases which processes these two polyproteins to release 16 nonstructural proteins nsps of polyproteins which results from translation of viral rna28 the structure typically contains two protomers protomer i and ii each of which consisting of 3 domains domain i ii and iii with around 100 amino acids in each domain the substrate-binding site residues in the gap between i and ii domain one interesting feature is that the substrate binding site is highly conserved among all sars-cov main protease and the most variable domain being helical domain iii30 in domain iii five helices cluster is located which implicated in dimerization of mpro through a salt bridge interaction arg-4 of one protomer and glu-290 of the other protomer for the catalytic activity the dimerization is necessary because the n-finger of each protomer interacts with the other protomer through its interaction with residues glu166 and thus helps to form the shape of the substrate binding site28 the structure of the main protease is represented in figure 3 m pro has ability to cleave the larger pp1ab at particular 11 sites the recognition site being leu-gln-ser-ala-gly in most of the cases28 the mpro crystal structure with an inhibitor n3 is already reported pdb i d 6 lu730 structure of sars-cov-2 mpro is reported with -ketoamide inhibitor pdb 6y2e6y2g6y2f28 the genomic organization of covid-19 contains 5 utr orf-1ab s e m n gene and utr 3 among them orf1ab cover the largest part of viral genome and is responsible for coding of 16 nsp nonstructural-proteins 1-1631 nsp3 and nsp 5 encodes the papain like protease pl pro and chymotrypsin-like protease cl pro or m pro respectively while nsp15 shows endo-ribonulease activity32 orf1b encoded nsps 1216 are involved in rna replicationtranscription process these nsps eg rdrp and helicase complex comprises the replication transcription complex rtc3233 these rtc are typically anchored in endoplasmic reticulum er originated double membrane containing vesicles which are further integrated into convoluted membranes network of modified er membrane33 among the all sars-cov-2 nsp the only available crystal-structure of is of nsp15 pdb i d 6vww 371 amino acid 220 34 however none of the structures of nsp 15 were inhibitor bound nsp15 belongs to the endoribonuclease endou family35 which play role in rna processing nsp15 is an essential element in the coronavirus life cycle36 nsp15 is an endoribonuclease nidoviral rna uridylate-specific nendou belonging to the endou family the c-terminal-nendou domain is responsible for the catalytic-function of nsp15 the active site present in between 2 b sheet which comprises of six conserved residues his235 ly290 his250 thr341 ser294 tyr34336 nendou activity of the nsp15 can induce protein-interference in the innate-immune response however this effect may be independent of the endonuclease activity also nsp-15 is a necessary element in the life cycle of for coronavirus36 nsp12 also known as a rdrp is a key component in viral life cycle which plays an essential role in synthesis of viral rna and transcriptionreplication nsp7 and nsp8 act are required cofactors for this machinery37 the nsp12 structures comprises of the niran domain towards the n terminal end and the rdrp domain toward the c terminal end38 niran domain and polymerase domain are linked by an interface domain39 the complex structure of rdrp is depicted in figure 4 nsp12 is thought to be a primary target of nucleotide analogues such as remdesvir antiviral inhibitor which has the ability to treat sars-cov-2 viral infection40 a cryo em structure of nsp12 with remdesvir is reported in complex with triphosphate form of remdesvir nsp-7 and nsp-8 pdb i d 7bv2 29-

implications for vaccination and antibody therapeutics dapeng zhou xiaoxu tian  ruibingqi chao peng wen zhang  coronaviruses hijack human enzymes to assemble the sugar coat on their spike glycoproteins the mechanisms by which human antibodies may recognize the antigenic viral peptide epitopes hidden by the sugar coat are unknown glycosylation by insect cells differs from the native form produced in human cells but insect cell-derived influenza vaccines have been approved by the us food and drug administration in this study we analyzed recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 spike protein secreted from bti-tn-5b1-4 insect cells by trypsin and chymotrypsin digestion followed by mass spectrometry analysis we acquired tandem mass spectrometry msms spectrums for glycopeptides of all 22 predicted nglycosylated sites we further analyzed the surface accessibility of spike proteins according to cryogenic electron microscopy and homolog-modeled structures and available antibodies that bind to sars-cov-1 all 22 n-glycosylated sites of sars-cov-2 are modified by highmannose n-glycans msms fragmentation clearly established the glycopeptide identities electron densities of glycans cover most of the spike receptor-binding domain of sars-cov-2 except yqagstpcngvegfncyfplqsygfqptngvgyq similar to a region fspdgkpctppalncywplndygfytttgigyq in sars-cov-1 other surface-exposed domains include those located on central helix connecting region heptad repeats and nterminal domain because the majority of antibody paratopes bind to the peptide portion with or without sugar modification we propose a snake-catching model for predicted paratopes a minimal length of peptide is first clamped by a paratope and sugar modifications close to the peptide either strengthen or do not hinder the binding  spike proteins are located on the surface of coronaviruses and serve as entry proteins for infection xu et al 2004  the spike molecules form trimers which must be cleaved by cellular proteases so that the fusion peptide can facilitate the fusion of virus membrane with the infected cells the proteases generate s1 and s2 subunits from spike molecules and the s1 subunit contains the critical receptor-binding domain to bind the ace2 receptor on host cells the receptor-binding motif of the receptor-binding domain rich in tyrosine forms direct contacts with ace2 fusion of the virus with host cells involves several other critical structures of the spike protein including central helix and heptad repeat 1 and 2 domains spike glycoproteins are major targets for vaccine design and antibody-based therapies for coronaviruses including middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 sars-cov-1 which caused a multi-country outbreak in 2002-2003 and sars-cov-2 which is responsible for a pandemic beginning in 2019 several antibodies targeting spike proteins of sars-cov-1 have shown promising efficacy in preclinical trials berry et al 2010  bian et al 2009  greenough et al 2005  he et al 2006  he et al 2005  hwang et al 2006  ishii et al

al 2007  furthermore structural studies suggest that domains other than the crucial receptor-binding domain are also potential targets for antibody binding these include the fusion peptide heptad repeat 1 and central helix domains yuan et al 2017  table si  in all coronaviruses spike glycoproteins are densely glycosylated with more than 20 predicted sites for n-glycosylation the function of these glycans in immune evasion by the virus remains unknown in this study we analyzed a recombinant sars-cov-2 spike protein expressed by insect cells we acquired tandem mass spectrometry msms spectrums for all glycopeptides generated by sequential digestion using trypsin and chymotrypsin we further analyzed the cryogenic electron microscopy structures of the spike proteins to identify surface-exposed epitopes for antibody recognition and vaccine design a total of 22 n-glycosylation sites were found in the recombinant spike protein of sars-cov-2secreted from bti-tn-5b1-4 insect cells  figure 1  all 22 n-glycosites were confirmed by fragment ions of glycan moieties and characteristic by ions derived from peptide backbones supplemental figure 1 and 2 among them eight are located in the n-terminal domain twon331 and n343 are located in the receptor-binding domain but are outside of the receptorbinding motif limited to amino acids 438-506 and three are located in the rest of the s1 subunit nine are located in the s2 subunit the glycosylation pattern of the spike protein is highly conserved in sars-cov-1 sars-cov-2 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus the n-terminal and heptad repeat 2 domains are densely glycosylated the fusion peptide domain is neighbored by n-glycosite n657 in contrast the receptor-binding motif central helix domain and heptad repeat 1 domain are free of glycosylation the majority of nglycan moieties are a high-mannose type table sii  which is consistent with the glycosylation pathway of the bti-tn-5b1-4 insect cell line used to produce the recombinant spike protein to evaluate the efficiency of glycosylation at every n-glycosite we calculated the relative ion abundance of glycopeptide and non-glycosylated sequences generated by trypsin and chymotrypsin digestion all 22 n-glycosylation sites were occupied by n-glycans table siii  for 18 of the 22 n-glycosites more than 90 of ions were glycosylated peptides for nglycosites 331 1074 1158 and 1173 more than 80 of ions were glycosylated peptides we also searched for the o-glycosylated glycopeptides table siv  preliminary analysis indicated that the ion abundance of o-glycopeptide sequences was less than 3 as compared with nonglycosylated sequences for all predicted o-glycosites t323 t325 s678 s673 and s686 by cryogenic electron microscopy structure modeling protein data bank pdb 5x58 of the sars-cov-1 spike protein 14 sites of n-glycosylation were observed the asn-glcnac groups were identified at the reducing end of the glycans at atomic resolution pdb 5x58 32  and the density maps of extending glycan chains were still visible although the density was relatively weak figure 2a  b and c the receptor-binding domain region of the sars-cov-1spike protein is densely covered by glycans except fspdgkpctppalncywplndygfytttgigyq which overlaps with a previously identified achilles heel ie vulnerable spot for antibody binding berry et al 2010  the spike protein of sars-cov-2 contains 22 n-glycosylation sites in yellow in figure 2d  when trimer structures of the s protein of sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 are aligned rootmean-square deviation132 for single chain the structures are very similar except for a few loops such as those at the n-terminal of the n-terminal domain supplemental figure 3  sequence alignment and structure comparison revealed that the predicted glycosylation sites are highly conserved fourteen of 22 sites were observed by cryogenic electron microscopy for the sars-cov-1 s protein and most predicted sites of sars-cov-2 are located similarly to sars-cov-1  figure 2e  the receptor-binding domains were overall highly conserved with sequence identity 745 structure root-mean-square deviation114 and two identical glycosylation sites near the n-terminal  figure 2f  while the sequence specificity of epitopes remained unique in some regions tables i and ii  a similar surfaced-exposed region or achilles heel yqagstpcngvegfncyfplqsygfqptngvgyq was identified in the receptor-binding domain of sars-cov-2 interestingly the achilles heel regions for both sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 were also free of glycosylation whereas its neighboring fragments were covered or interacting with glycosylation this region free of glycosylation is favorable for ace2 and other protein binding  figure 2g  accessible surface area profiling was used for predicting epitopes for monoclonal antibodies mabs supplemental figure 4  candidate epitopes are listed in table i and figure 3  in addition to receptor-binding domains multiple potential candidate epitopes were found from amino acid sequences at fusion peptide heptad repeat 1 and central helix domains similar sites were found in receptor-binding domains and central helix domains of both viruses  figure 3  however unique sites were also found for each virus for example a unique epitope existing in sars-cov-2 but not in sars-cov-1 is the rarr 682-685 site for furin recognition supplemental figure 5  to evaluate the conservation of spike epitopes on a structural level we further aligned the epitopes of sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 based on cryogenic electron microscopy structures eleven predicted epitope pairs were found in receptor-binding domain heptad repeat 1 and central helix table ii figure 4  and supplemental figure 6  two structurally conserved epitope pairs ah1ah1 and ah2ah2 were predicted at the achilles heel region which interacts with ace2 table ii  we also identified two conserved epitope pairs located on the surface of the receptor-binding domain but outside the ace2-binding region ii and iiii epitope pair iiii has been proven to be a target for recognition by mab s309 pinto et al 2020  a potent neutralization antibody with half-maximal inhibitory concentration ic50 at 69 ngml neutralizing antibodies toward spike proteins are critical for protective immunity traggiai et al reported spike-specific mabs isolated from a patient who recovered from sars-cov-1 infection with in vitro neutralizing activity ranging from 10 -8 to 10 -11 m traggiai et al 2004  several other groups have reported mabs targeting spike berry et al 2010  bian et al 2009  greenough et al 2005  he et al 2006  he et al 2005  ishii et al 2009  miyoshi-akiyama et al 2011  rockx et al 2008  sui et al 2014  sui et al 2005  ter meulen et al 2006  van den brink et al 2005  zhu et al 2007  spike protein has also been the focus for vaccine development for example mice vaccinated with dna or subunit vaccines composed of spike proteins or receptor-binding domain of spike proteins and adjuvants had high titers of immunoglobulin g antibodies and were protected from sars-cov-1 or middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection du et al 2010  du et al 2007  honda-okubo et al 2015  iwata-yoshikawa et al 2014  li et al 2013  lu et al 2010  sekimukai et al 2020  yang et al 2004  zhao et al 2014  toll-like receptor ligands delta inulin and monophosphoryl lipid a were reported as effective adjuvants to be combined with subunit vaccines however to avoid the use of adjuvant inactivated sars-cov-1 or recombinant adeno-associated virus encoding the receptor-binding domain of the sars-cov-1 spike protein has also been studied these induced potent protective antibody responses against infection du et al 2008  okada et al 2005  see et al 2006  spruth et al 2006  the safety and efficacy of antibody therapeutics and vaccines in human clinical trials remain to be studied as well as the mechanisms for specific vaccine components and formulations for example pulmonary pathology was reported when alum was used as an adjuvant for a spike protein subunit vaccine tseng et al 2012  antibody-induced lung injury was also reported in a macaque model of sars-cov-1 infection liu et al 2019  which highlights the importance of avoiding antibody-mediated inflammation the receptor-binding domain has been a major focus for antibody and vaccine studies three antibodies80r m396 and f26g19 complexed with the receptor-binding domain of sars-cov-1 have been co-crystalized hwang et al 2006  pak et al 2009  prabakaran et al 2006  all three antibodies recognize non-continuous conformational epitopes table si  several mab clones that recognize linear continuous peptide sequences have also been reported 4d5 17h9 f26g18 and 201 although co-crystal structures are not available yet in this study we identified the accessible surface area profiling of the receptor-binding domain of sars-cov-2 and found a vulnerable region yqagstpcngvegfncyfplqsygfqptngvgyq previously the structural counterpart of this region was termed the achilles heel of sars-cov-1 berry et al 2010  it mostly overlaps with the interface between ace2 and s protein  figure 2g  for sars-cov-1 multiple mabs targeting its achilles heel have been generated including f26g18 4d5cr3006m396fm39cr3014f26g19and 80r table si  for antibody and vaccine development ongoing studies are focusing on epitopes at the achilles heel of sars-cov-2 especially ah1 and ah2 sites listed in table ii and figure 4  which directly interact with ace2 however neutralizing antibodies which do not directly compete with ace2 binding also exist in recovered sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 patients for example the cr3022 mab neutralizes sars-cov-1 but not sars-cov-2 yuan et al 2020 the s309 mab isolated from a sars-cov-1 patient neutralizes both sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 and structural analysis revealed its epitope to be a glycopeptide sequence located on the n343 glycosite notably this is exactly in structurally conserved regions as we predicted for the iiii epitope pair table ii  clearly other epitope pairs predicted in our study are candidate targets to isolate neutralizing antibodies as well it is well known that predicted epitopes of protein antigens may be masked by glycosylation complex datasets and algorithms such as spatial epitope prediction for protein antigens seppa 30 have been developed which are based on training parameters related to interactions of glycans and surrounding amino acids kong et al 2015  however no experimental data are available on the effect of glycosylation sites on epitope surfaces with the recent breakthrough by high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy many glycoproteins can be solved and modeled with glycosylation sites here we directly exploit experimental data of the sars-cov-1 spike protein from high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy and screened epitopes for the sars-cov-2 spike protein by accessible surface area profiling based on homology-modeled structures by this approach we have identified an achilles heel of sars-cov-2 as well as 11 multiple other surface-exposed epitopes within and outside the receptor-binding domain for example in the n-terminal domain ntd domain of the sars-cov-1spike protein mabs specific for linear epitopes have been reported table si greenough et al 2005  mabs specific to other regions of the s1 and s2 subunits of sars-cov spike proteins were also reported miyoshi-akiyama et al 2011 as summarized in table i  promising antibody binding sites within and outside the receptor-binding domain have been identified for sars-cov-2 our future investigations will focus on vaccination studies to validate their function as neutralizing epitopes with preventive and therapeutic effects in virus challenge experiments dense glycosylation of glycoproteins is a well-known strategy used by viruses to conceal surface peptide epitopes that would otherwise elicit antibody responses as exemplified by the env protein of human immunodeficiency virus 1 however after decades of effort mabs which bind to conformational epitopes on the surface of the env protein have been identified garces et al 2015  kong et al 2015  kong et al 2013  most of these antibodies bind to the n-glycan portion neighboring the peptide epitopes whereas some antibodies such as mab 8anc195 have evolved to recognize peptide epitopes with no dependence on glycan binding kong et al 2015  for antibodies specific to spike glycoproteins there are no data available whether their recognition is hindered by the glycosylation of spike however antibodies that bind to both peptide and sugar portions of spike glycopeptides exist such as mab s309 which binds to a glycopeptide epitope on the n343 glycosylation site pinto et al 2020  we propose a snake catching model a snake-like epitope is elusive and difficult for an antibody to catch because of the highly mobile wiggly sugar chains that hide the peptide portion therefore to overcome the sugar barrier a minimum length of peptide portion either conformational or linear continuous must first be clamped by a paratope this clamping effect may either be strengthened by sugars close to the peptide epitope or not hindered by sugar modification clearly surfaceexposed glycopeptide motifs are critical for vaccine design in summary our study clearly identified by ms all of the 22 n-glycosites of the sars-cov-2 spike protein we have identified a list of linear surface-exposed candidate epitopes in the spike proteins of sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 and demonstrated the advantages of studying the effects of glycosylation with real cryogenic electron microscopy data these candidate epitopes are critical for screening for mab therapeutics to treat sars-cov-2 as well as mechanistic studies on vaccine development spike proteins for sars-cov-2genbank accession number mn908947sars-cov-1 ab263618and middle east respiratory syndrome virus km027290 were predicted by netnglyc the sequence identity of the spike proteins between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-1 is as high as 84 which is sufficient to build an accurate homolog model the sequence of mn908947 was submitted to swiss-model and the structural model was built against all available homolog structures as templates one stable conformation of trimer structure models for sars-cov-2 is very close to the spike protein structure from sars-cov-1pdb 5x58 and their root-mean-square deviation of a single protein chain is approximately 132 after the two structures were superimposed and compared in pymol figure 2d and e  s protein was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid solution 61n the protein pellet was subsequently dissolved in 8 m urea in 100mm tris-hcl ph 85 tris2-carboxyethylphosphine 5 mm was added and incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature to reduce the protein and iodoacetamide 10mm was subsequently added and incubated for 15 minutes to alkylate the protein the protein mixture was digested with chymotrypsin wako richmond va at a 1100 ratio at 25c followed by trypsin promega at 150 ratio ww at 37c the reaction was terminated by adding formic acid and the peptide mixture was desalted with a mono-spin c18 column gl sciences the desalted peptide mixture was

described liu et al 2017 by using pglyco 20 version 20190101 httppfindictaccnsoftwarepglycoindexhtml glycopeptide identification and by using byologic v35 for quantification parameters for our database search of intact glycopeptides were as follows mass tolerance for precursors and fragment ions were set as  7 and 20 ppm respectively the enzymes were trypsin and chymotrypsin maximal missed cleavage was 2 fixed modification was carbamidomethylation on all cys residues c 57022 da variable modifications contained oxidation on met m 15995 da the n-glycosylation sequon n-x-st x  p was modified by changing n to j the two shared the same mass the glycan database was extracted from glycome db wwwglycome-dborg all identified spectra could be automatically annotated and displayed by the software tool glabel embedded in pglyco20 which facilitates manual verification parameter settings in byonic were the same as that in pglyco20 except that the built-in nglycan database n-glycan 38 insect glycan was used for database searching the o-glycan database was homemade according to previously reported glycan structures by gaunitz et al lindberg et al 2013  the identified n-glycopeptides were further examined manually to verify the accuracy of identification the glycopeptides were quantified by byologic based on the extracted ion chromatogram area under the curve glycosylation sites were solved and determined from high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy density maps and only n-acetyl-d-glucosamine asn-glcnac was determined to represent a whole glycan due to the glycan flexibility and disorder thesars-cov-1spike protein structure pdb5x58 together with the asn-glcnac sites were applied for molecular interface calculation with pisa httpwwwccp4acukpisa all the amino acids linking or interacting with asn-glcnac were selected and excluded in epitope prediction besides the interaction between asn-glcnac and amino acids the effects of the larger structure of glycans extending from every asn-glcnac may also need to be considered as shown as in figure 2c  although their electron densities are weak the aforementioned molecular interface calculation procedure was applied to calculate the accessible surface area and screen the corresponding antigen epitopes except that the glycosylation effect could not be measured because the structure is not yet available because most glycosylation sites are conserved due to the high similarity between these two spike proteins we could predict the glycosylation site effects in the sars-cov-2 spike structure as well when predicted epitopes coincided with the amino acid residues interacting with asn-glcnac they were removed from the candidates by cross-reference of the sars-cov-1 data  the authors declare no

ic50 based epitope screening in sars cov-2 covid 19 spike protein by immunoinformatic analysis implicating for a suitable vaccine development amrita banerjee dipannita santra smarajit maiti   an outbreak of a novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome cov-2 or sars cov-2 or covid-19 infection is threatening the humanity globally occurring from last week of december 2019 as a result a massive loss of human health status and global economy are becoming unaccountable as of current situation sars cov-2 claimed more than 371166 lives from more than 6057853 infected persons globally 1 the outbreak started from the wuhan province of china and spread at about 216 countries with most adverse effects in china italy iran spain the united states france germany britain and several other countries any type of therapeutic strategies starting from the blocking of viral entry inhibition of spike proteins association with host ace-2 angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 modulations of interfering kinase activity inactivation of viral genome expression-packaging and vaccination against this virus is the demand of the present situation regarding the vaccination strategies it is assumed that frequent mutation results in anomalies in its surfacespike proteins 2 3 mostly resembling the features of sars cov global outbreak 2003 httpswwwwhointcsrsarsen this virus unlikely manifested its extremely high grade of virulence spreading capability and stability across the geographical barrier or specifically colder place aged persons or specific genders yet to be clarified 4 the positive selective pressure could account for the stability and some clinical features of this virus compared with sars and bat sars-like cov 5 stabilizing mutation falling in the endosome-associated-protein-like domain of the nsp2 protein could account for covid-2019 high ability of contagious while the destabilizing mutation in nsp3 proteins could suggest a potential mechanism differentiating covid-2019 from sars cov 5 nevertheless nutritional and immunological statuses are also important factors for the screening of the therapeutic strategies for the affected and sensitive persons possible medications or immunizations from the existing drugs or infusion of convalescent plasma should be conducted with utmost care to the covid 19 patients 6 advanced precautionary steps and therapeutic interventions should be formulated taking into account of several personal and community factors 7 development of a successful and reproducible vaccination protocol and its human trial may take longer time for the issues of mutation and large number glycan shield and epitope masking on the sars cov 2 proteins 8 in a series of medication regimen 1 at1r blockers is used for reducing the severity and mortality from sars-cov-2 virus infections 9 chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are now being prescribed somewhere to fight covid-19 for the time being 10 11 human coronaviruses and other influenza viruses resulted in epidemic in last 2 decade in different parts of the world the anomalies between severity and spreading between the origin site china and the other parts of the world european and north america countries might have some indication common human covs may have annual peaks of circulation in winter months in the us and individual human covs may show variable circulation from year to year 12 colder climate and prior exposure to other human coronaviruses or influenza or flu viruses or possible vaccination against those might develop antibody dependent enhancement ade of immunological responses during recent sars cov-2 exposure ade might have modulated immune response and could elicit sustained inflammation lymphopenia andor cytokine storm 13 14 possibly that could be one of the reasons more history of exposure with covs beside weaker immune system for older people being more affected by the present sars cov-2 moreover both helper t cells and suppressor t cells in patients with covid-19 were below normal levels the novel coronavirus might mainly act on lymphocytes especially t lymphocytes 15 strong inflammatory events could be the initiator of the collapsing environment during covid-19 infection in most of the death cases in covid-19 infections acute respiratory failure is followed by other organs like kidney anomalies in these cases inflammatory outburst might have worsened the infection and post viral-incubation situations 16 17 recent studies in experimentally infected animal strongly suggest a crucial role for virus-induced immune-pathological events in causing fatal pneumonia after human cov infections 18 so combined anti-viral and anti-inflammatory treatment might be beneficial in these cases 19 sars-based available immune-therapeutic and prophylactic modalities revealed poor efficacy to neutralize and protect from infection by targeting the novel spike protein 20 in this background critical screening of the spike sequence and structure from sars cov-2 by energetic and ic50 based immune-informatics analysis may help to develop a suitable vaccine so in the current study we were intended to analyze the spike proteins of sars cov mers cov and sars cov 2 and four other earlier out-breaking human corona virus strains we critically compared sars cov and sars cov 2 spike-proteins domains motifs and screened several epitopes based on their energetics ic50 and antigenicity employing several bioimmuuno-informatics software with regard to their possible glycosylation and mhcparatope binding effects the present work might be helpful for the urgent development of a suitable vaccination regimen the spike glycoprotein sequences of four human coronavirus hku1 nl63 229e and oc43 mars

gene ontology based conserved domain identification was conducted using interpro classification of protein families interactive database 27 conserved epitopes of sars cov-2 spike glycoprotein were identified using svmtrip a tool which predicts linear antigenic epitopes 28 svmtrip predicts the linier antigenic epitopes by feeding support vector machine with the tri-peptide similarity and

docking solutions among them best 10 were analyzed based on docking scores and binding free energy value calculation initially the seven preselected spike glycoprotein sequences including the recent outbreaking strain sars cov-2 covid 19 were subjected to tertiary structure prediction table 1 the ramachandran plot data and structural alignment data suggests that sars cov and sars cov-2 covid-2 has higher degree of alignment table 1 the protein sequences were ranged from 1173 to 1356 amino acids the system generated structures showed sequence identity with the homologous templates like human coronavirus hku1 and oc43 with template 6nzk1a identity 6516  9968 respectively nl63 and 229e with 6u7h1a identity 6522  9910 respectively mers cov with 5w9h1l identity 9969 whereas sars cov  covid 19 with 6acc1a identity 9992  7647 respectively structure quality assessment showed qmean values of two sars strains were  282 and  363 for respective models table 1 according to the ramachandran plot analysis on number of residues in favored regions and in additionally allowed regions were ranged from 983 to 998 ie human coronavirus hku1 985 nl63 992 229e 998 oc43 996 sars cov 998 mers cov 983 and covid 19 994 were found as very good quality structures present structure based prediction was further validated by the multiple sequence alignment of all covs and topology analysis of three spike glycoprotein structures of mers cov sars cov and covid-19 figs 1 2 position specific multiple sequence alignment also showed the highest similarity of covid 19 with the sars cov fig 1 although having sequential diversity all the selected spike glycoproteins showed some stretches of conserved sequences fig 1 the position of n-terminal and c-terminal were found similar between sars cov and covid-19 during topology analysis on the other hand a drastic difference was observed in mers cov in arrangement of secondary structures in the tertiary region fig 2 based on the alignment pattern selected sequences were subjected to analysis different conserved motifs in the protein sequences a total of 7 conserved motifs were analyzed fig 3 most remarkably all the selected spike glycoprotein sequences were shown to have each 7 motif sequences in similar pattern and some of those conserved motif position were represented in fig 3 all the identified conserved motifs were individually subjected to protein blast for functional annotation where motif 1 5 6 and 7 showed similarity with spike protein of human and bat coronavirus origin motif 2 shared similarities with spike structural protein of mouse coronavirus origin motif 3 showed similarity with spike glycoprotein s from sars cov and motif 4 with spike glycoprotein from mers cov table 2 highest percent identity of 9184 was observed for motif 2 functional gene ontology based conserved domain identification within 7 identified motifs were predicted against interpro database ipr002552 coronas2 pf01601 coronas2 domains were found within motif 1 5 and 6 similar domains were also observed in motif 2 3 and 4 with an extra domain of ssf111474 coronavirus s2 glycoprotein no such domains were observed in motif 7 identified domains were predicted with membrane fusion function go0061025 and receptor-mediated virion attachment to host cell go0046813 whereas those were detected as viral envelope go0019031 and integral component of membrane go0016021 the epitope probing was conducted only with the covid 19 spike glycoprotein sequence and structure from the sequence analysis 10 different locations were found which also showed similarity with sars cov and sars covid 2 spike glycoprotein in protein blast fig 4 also the motif positions within the spike glycoprotein monomer were represented in fig 4 epitopes 1 4 and 5 were not represented in covid 19 spike glycoproteins as they were found to be embedded within the virus envelop among the others epitopes 2 3 6 and 7 were found at the interior location of spike glycoprotein monomer but epitopes 8 9 and 10 were found at the surface of the structure the proper type of major histocompatibility complex mhc selection for identified covid 19 epitope was performed and enlisted in table 3 all the epitopes were individually screened against 5 dpa 6 dqa and 662 drb alleles from mhc class ii for best fit analysis as we have analyzed the spike glycoprotein of covid 19 which is an infectious particle transmit from one infected individual to another alleles of mhc class ii were selected for viral epitope specificity analysis where hla-drb10113 was observed to bind with 2b 3b 4b 5b 7b and 8b epitope sequences identified on the basis of ic50 value among them sequence iiaytmslgaensva epitope 8b was shown with lowest ic50 value of 711 on the other hand hla-drb10404 was found for both the sequence of timlccmtsccsclk epitope 5a and siiaytmslgaensv epitope 8a on highest consensus percentile rank basis highest value of 95 was found for motif 5 similarly hla-drb10408 was observed for the sequences vrdpqtleilditpc epitope 9a with highest 950 and vsvitpgtntsnqva epitope 10a with 790 consensus percentile rank value individual mhc class ii molecules were found for others table 3 the threshold value of highest consensus percentile rank was selected as 10 for all as a whole highest consensus percentile rank value of 10 was observed for sequence qqliraaeirasanl epitope 3a and lowest ic50 value of 711 was observed for sequence iiaytmslgaensva epitope 8b the antigenic property of identified target sequences from epitopes was also predicted on the basis of threshold value of 04 below the threshold value the sequence has been considered as non-antigenic and sequences with above value were antigenic in nature a total of 9 antigenic sequences were detected table 3 among them two sequences aaeirasanlaatkm epitope 3b and itpgtntsnqvavly epitope 10b were found with higher threshold value of 07125 and 07193 respectively coronavirus spike protein has a masking of n-acetyl glucosamine nag at different locations comparative analysis between glycosylated and non-glycosylated protein revealed some structural modification at the epitope locations among the identified epitopes 10b with sequence itpgtntsnqvavly 598612 was found with n linked glycosylation at 603 position the structural modification of this epitope was analyzed using non-glycosylated protein structure of covid 19 acc no nc045512221563-25384 and glycosylated covid 19 protein pdb id 6vsb effect of glycosylation on protein structures revealed that glycosylated conformation was more organized fig 5a than non-glycosylated one fig 5b secondary structural comparison between two epitopes showed more organized structure with attached nag residue fig 5d whereas a shorter -sheet structure was observed when nag is removed from the structure fig 5c the peptide interactive site of 10b epitope was blocked due to nag attachment as a result of which antibody binding to the antigen may hamper the nag residue directly binds with n or asn amino acid residue fig 5e so the removal of nag from the spike glycoprotein structure is difficult structural distortion between glycosylated and non-glycosylated epitope 10b at tertiary level indicated that removal of nag may distort the structure of epitope fig 5f again that may hamper the proper antigenantibody binding in this section energetics of epitope attachment with mhc class ii hla-dra drb was determined in presence and absence of nag at the 10b epitope structure through molecular docking fig 6 docking results showed that without nag the binding efficiency of 10b epitope at the epitope binding site of mhc class ii hla-dra drb molecule was very high among the 10 best docking posture 1 2 3 7  10 were found at the desired location with docking score of  355223  347243  343690  276744 and  218581 whereas tertiary structure of epitope 10b with nag revealed less affinity to mhc class ii hla-dra drb molecule only 3 postures 5 7  10 were found at the desired position with docking score of  308538  294973 and  214110 the best docking of posture 1 without nag and posture 5 with nag were represented in fig 6 where amino acid attachment differences were clearly indicated in fig 6b e like the docking score of posture 1 without nag  355223 it also showed the binding free energy of complex  3697 kcalmol whereas docking score of posture 5 with nag  308538 showed binding free energy of complex  3006 that indicated the rigid binding of 10b epitope when it lacks the nag molecule the interactive analysis also revealed that without nag 10b binds with more amino acids of mhc class ii hla-dra drb fig 6c where structural stabilization by hydrogen bond networking was noticed but the bindings were less when nag residue was attached fig 6f this result indicated that the attachment of nag with epitope also made it difficult for mhc class ii molecules to proper representation of epitope though epitope 8 a  b were also present at the surface of the spike glycoprotein but was found to wrapped with a short segment igaehvnnsyecd 651663 carrying a glycosylation at n residue position 657 fig 7a as a result of which antibody accessibility to this epitope may also be difficult whereas surface epitope 9 with sequence vrdpqtleilditpc 576590 showed highest antigenecity of 11285 table 3 and highest consensus percentile rank of 950 and found free of any direct or indirect nag attachment pattern fig 7b on that basis it was further analyzed for mhc ii hla-drb1 pdb id 5jlz binding through molecular docking among the best 10 docking posture 8th was found at the desired position of mhc molecule fig 7c the best position 1 was represented in fig 7d e a rigid interaction with six amino acids and one hydrogen bonded amino acid of mhc molecule was detected for proper representation of epitope 9 an effort was made for epitope based peptide vaccine development by searching mhc-i and ii classes compatible sites and the results yet to come 33 in the current study energetic and inhibition concentration50 based selection of sars cov-2 spike epitope and its possible glycosylation effectstructural-hindrance have been evaluated this may help in urgent vaccination strategies in the current disastrous situation predicted structures were analyzed for quality assessment and according to qmean values of two sars strains  282 and  363 for respective models table 1 good quality was observed qmean values of this indicated the degree of native nature of the predicted structures in an universal scale 23 very good quality structures were indicated with qmean z-score closest to zero qmean indicated the overall z-score of c all atoms solvation and torsion values but according to the ramachandran plot table 1 the quality of all the predicted structures was above 98 indicating good structural prediction the structural alignment between each sets revealed that sars cov-2 was highly similar to sars cov rather than mers from both the sequential and structural point of view higher degree of similarity between sars cov and sars cov-2 might indicate and help in the therapeutic and vaccination strategies with reference to the current global situation however an absolute higher degree of virulence and spreading nature of sars cov-2 is of great concern in the present scenario predicted conserved motifs showed functional similarity with different coronavirus sequences above analysis indicated that identified motifs were specific for coronavirus and they could be used as the markers for common coronavirus infection detection irrespective of covid 19 among all the selected epitopes motifs 8 9 and 10 were found at the surface of the structure which could be used as the immunological targets for the proper diagnosis and treatment of covid 19 the important issue of epitope finalization could be confronted by the factor of possible transition between pre-fusion and post-fusion spike structural distortion specific mutant structure has been designed and tested to be resistant to conformational change after ace2 binding and protease cleavage at the s1s2 site 34 this may be indicative to searching suitable epitope which may remain unhindered from pre- to post- fusion state transition during covid-19 specific epitope designing 10 different sequences were found at different structural location among them the location of 3b was more interior but 10b could be used as potent antigen according to epitope locations fig 4 and antigenic nature other sequences like 8ab 9ab could be the target also coronavirus spike proteins are glycosylated in nature where n-acetyl glucosamine nag is the main component glycan shielding and possible epitope masking of an hcov-nl63 has been observed which may be the barrier for proper immunogenic responses 8 on the other hand glycosylation showed a direct effect on proper structural packaging of viral spike glycoprotein fig 5a whereas non glycosylation or removal of glycosylation may distort the structure as proper mhc class ii binding and representation may hamper among the selected epitopes epitope 9 with sequence vrdpqtleilditpc 576590 showed highest antigenecity of 11285 and consensus percentile rank of 950 table 3 and found any direct or indirect glycosylation pattern fig 7b and epitope 9 was also formed rigid bonds with mhc ii hla-drb1 pdb id 5jlz so this could be a target for covid-19 vaccine development modifications in spike proteins structure during receptor mediated host cell entry and further prediction on post-fusion events may result in success in vaccination strategies or blocking entry host protease processing during viral entry and how different lineage b viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells are the points also to be noted 35 sars cov-2 induced severe and often lethal lung failure is caused due to its inhibition of ace-2 expression 36 so keeping the ace-2 normal functioning but blocking viral entry is the most challenging issue right now possible suitable epitope as screened in the current study may be helpful in this global pandemic situation the history of last two decades outbreak of these types of virus is very much evident the present situation justifies further advanced studies with proper infrastructure and fund-resources facilities at a global scale to eradicate current or any possible future outbreak  dynamical asymmetry exposes 2019-ncov prefusion spike susmita roy  the novel coronavirus 2019-ncov spike protein is a smart molecular machine that instigates the entry of coronavirus to the host cell causing the covid-19 pandemic in this study a structural-topology based model hamiltonian of c3 symmetric trimeric spike is developed to explore its complete conformational energy landscape using molecular dynamic simulations the study finds 2019-ncov to adopt a unique strategy by undertaking a dynamic conformational asymmetry induced by a few unique inter-chain interactions this results in two prevalent asymmetric structures of spike where one or two spike heads lifted up undergoing a dynamic transition likely to enhance rapid recognition of the host-cell receptor turning on its high-infectivity the crucial interactions identified in this study are anticipated to potentially affect the efficacy of therapeutic targets one sentence summary inter-chain-interaction driven rapid symmetry breaking strategy adopted by the prefusion trimeric spike protein likely to make 2019-ncov highly infective we are in the midst of a global catastrophic situation due to coronavirus outbreak where every day the global death toll is biting the past count while history has witnessed past pandemics 1-3 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov trends to outcompete them all by its rapid transmission in a short period to win the crown as the name corona in latin it means crown the accused of the outbreak makes use of a crown-shaped molecular machine the trimeric spike-protein to drive the virus entry into the host cells 2019-ncov is the newest addition of betacoronavirus genus 4 while the sequence and structural similarity to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike sars-cov s repute the identity of 2019-ncov spike as sars-cov-2 s 5 6 a recent study reported that the sars-cov-2 s has 10-20 fold higher affinity to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor than that of sars-cov s 7 the large ectodomain of the s glycoprotein of the coronavirus uses the s1 subunit for receptor binding and the trimeric s2 stalk for host-cell membrane fusion fig 1a 8 9  in sar-cov-2 s glycoprotein the -sheet-rich s1 subunit comprises an n terminal domain ntd and a receptor-binding domain rbd towards its c-terminus ctd fig 1b  so far static structural characterization reported that the rbd of s1 has an intrinsic hinge-like conformational  movement that generates the up and down conformations 7 8 10  other betacoronaviruses like sars-cov mers-cov and distantly related alphacoronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv also have this apparently stochastic rbd movement 11 12  the combination of rbd up-down rearrangement may lead each s1-head of the trimeric prefusion spike protein of coronavirus to adopt different possible conformations i 3down ii 1up-2down iii 2up-1down and iv 3up fig 1c  among them 3down 3up are symmetric conformers and 1up-2down 2up-1down are asymmetric conformers single-particle cryo-electron microscopy cryo-em determined few such symmetric and asymmetric structures referred to as the receptorbinding inactive state and receptor-binding active state respectively 8  the asymmetric structure where one of the rbds rotates up was thought to be less stable for sars-cov s 10  in comparison the recent cryo-em study found three rbds in 1up-2down conformation as a predominant arrangement in the prefusion state of 2019-ncov s trimer 7  this arrangement apparently appears legitimate for sars-cov-2 s in order to explain the higher affinity of 1up-2down for ace2 receptor than that of sars-cov s however we cannot rule out the possibility of 2up-1down conformation as a functional state which may provide even stronger binding with ace2 considering the fact that ace2 is a dimeric receptor 9 13  this hypothesis is consistent with a recent crystallographic study demonstrating that cr3022 a neutralizing antibody isolated from convalescent sars patients targets the rbd when at least two rbd on the trimeric spike protein are in the up conformation 14  assembling all these experimental results it is high time to understand the molecular mechanism of s1-head coordination of trimeric sar-cov-2 s and to identify important interaction in regulating spike up-down conformations a schematic of receptor-bound spike protein including the receptor-binding subunit s1 the membrane-fusion subunit s2 of a coronavirus is shown b side and top views of the homo-trimeric structure of sars-cov-2 spike protein with one rbd of the s1 subunit head rotated in the up conformation c rbd up-down movement expected to lead s1 heads of the trimeric spike protein to attain the following possible conformers i 3 down ii 1up-2down iii 2up-1down and iv 3up these are an analogue demonstration of the spike protein top-view where ntds are represented by colored ovals rbds are represented by flexible sticks and s2 domains are represented by filled circles a major challenge was simulating the gigantic structure of the full-length trimeric spike as it is associated with the largescale conformational transition it is indeed a daunting task to explore the full conformational landscape at an atomic length-scale to overcome this a structure-based coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulation approach has been adopted 15  the simulation started with a full-length homo-trimeric spike protein structure generated from homology modeling which involves the alignment of a target sequence and a template structure pdb 6vsb 7 16  this also helped to build the missing loops the domain-specific residuerange for the full-length trimeric sars-cov-2 s is given in fig 2a  the s1 head coordination of the trimeric spike is programmed by developing a super-symmetric topology-based modeling framework  fig 2b  described in the method pipeline in the supplementary material with this the molecular machine is ready to swing each of its s1 head between its up and down conformations movie s1 s2 a number of cryo-em structures captured the up and down conformations of the rbd domain of spike proteins of other coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 where the s1 subunit undergoes a hinge-like conformational movement prerequisite for receptor binding fig 2c 7 8 10 17  apart from the hinge-responsive rbd-cleft interaction in this study a few inter-chain interactions are found to assist the rbd-up and the rbd-down conformations shown in fig 2d and 2e movie s3 these few interactions are identified to impact the breathing of rbd of sars-cov-2 s this makes the early referred rbd-updown conformations slightly different from the s1-head-updown conformation for trimeric sars-cov-2 s as the former is regulated only by intra-chain interactions while the latter is regulated by both intra and inter-chain interactions fig s1  after identifying all these unique intra and inter-chain contacts 18 19 extracted from the corresponding s1-head-up and s1-head-down conformations a super-symmetric contact map is generated this follows the development of a structure-based model hamiltonian materials and methods in supplementary which is based on the energy landscape theory of protein folding 20 21 22 23 24  this approach not only potentiates the trimeric spike to adopt c3

of the native contact 19 27 corresponding to the inter-chain contacts associated with the s1-head-up and the s1-head-down states a typical trajectory plot of q extracted from the equilibrium

spike protein of sars-cov-2  fig 3b with its all possible conformations the conformations corresponding to the minima of the free energy landscape are shown in fig3c  the temperature dependence of conformational transition indicates that the configurational entropy and enthalpy compensation results in the enhanced population of the asymmetric 1up-2down to 2up-1down conformations  fig s4  while

rbd-ntd domain interaction e in the absence of rbd-ntd inter-chain interaction the hinge motion of rbd is hindered by populating more rbd-down conformations and allows to sample rbd-up conformation only rarely in a stochastic manner in this study sequence and interaction level fig s5 fig s1  comparison has been made over the cryo-em structure of sars-cov-2 s pdb 6vsb sars-cov s pdb5x5b and mers-cov s pdb 5x5f 7 12  this comparison results that sars-cov-2 s has ntd-rbd domain association where a proline residue of chaina forms ch- type interaction with the tyrosine residue 28 and hydrophobic interaction with another proline of chainb fig 4a fig  s1  inter-chain proline-proline distance measurement shows that the corresponding rbd-ntd domains are far away in the case of sars-cov s fig 4b  and further away in the case of mers-covs fig 4c  this measurement involves their respective cryo-em structures despite the relatively high degree of sequence similarity between the sars-cov-2 s and the sars-cov s and also with the spike protein from the bat coronavirus ratg13 a single histidine residue at the relevant rbd-ntd domain interface is found unique in the vase of sars-cov-2 s fig s5 29  the imidazole ring of histidine is pointing towards the hydrophobic assembly of aforesaid proline-tyrosine in the juxtaposition of the rbd-s1 hinge region such inter-chain rbd-ntd connection is thus found to impact the rbd hinge interaction by upregulating more rbd-up conformation fig 4d  in the absence of such interchain interaction the rbd mostly stays in the down conformation allowing rbd to break the symmetry rarely in a stochastic manner fig 4e  the absence of inter-chain rbd-ntd connection also appears to impact the sars-cov rbd hinge interaction here the opening of rbd-s1 cleft is significantly less than that of sars-cov-2 s in their respective s1-head-up state fig s6  the assistance from the inter-chain rbd-s2-stalk related interfacial contacts are also found to modulate the population dynamics of rbd-down conformation fig s7  the influence of this inter-chain rbd-s2-stalk interaction has also been observed in an early cryo-em analyses where two proline mutations at the top of s2 stalk inferring rbd-s2 inter-chain connection helped to stabilize the up conformers of sars-cov s 30  the synergy between internal rbd-hinge interactions and inter-chain interactions allows trimeric sars-cov-2 s to adopt a unique dynamical feature than other corona-virus spikes it appears that the inter-chain interactions driven rapid symmetry breaking strategy potentiates this spike machine to turn on its high-infectivity the energy landscape framework used in this study indeed helps to unify and compare different spike protein interactions present

sars-cov-2 prefusion spike protein coarse-grained structure-based simulations have been performed for full-length trimetric sars-cov-2 spike protein the structure-based hamiltonians for different simulations were derived after processing the recent cryo-em structure pdb6vsb thorough the swiss model to complete missing loops present in the structure 7 16  this generates a homo-trimeric sars-cov-2 spike where this initial structure has important components in terms of intra and inter-chain contacts interaction leading to an s1-head-up and an s1-head-down conformation for each protomer in this prevalent trimeric variant only one monomer adopts s1-head-up and the same of the other two adopts the s1-head-down conformation few characteristic intra-chain contacts cause the receptor-binding domain to perform a hinge-motion resulting rbd-up and rbd- conformations driven by intra c as defined in the pipeline method contact calculation is performed using the shadow criterion 19  interesting components are inter-chain contacts residing at the interface of the dimer now two categories of interactive dimeric interfaces are there asymmetric-dimer interface and symmetricdimer interface chaina s1-head-up and the adjacent chainb s1-head-down represent an asymmetric dimer unit similarly chainb s1-head-down and the adjacent chainc s1-headdown represent a symmetric dimer unit at the asymmetric-dimer interface the rbd-domain of chaina forms a few unique contacts with the ntd domain of the adjacent chainb as shown in has been cycled over all the interfaces making each of interfaces dynamically capable of inducing s1-head movement developing a structure-based hamiltonian of trimeric spike protein simulation a structure-based hamiltonian of

contacts formed in the s1-head-down state is monitored over these temperatures four states emerge as indicated in fig 3b and fig s4  as the temperature increases the population shifts more towards the s1-head-up state at t058t r the population of 1up-2down state appears as a predominant population in the conformational landscape which correlates well with the recent cryo-em data 7  we have performed all our simulations being consistent with this selected temperature the rmsd analyses ensure the correctness of the simulation progress and the emergence of the correct structure fig s3  the population shifts more towards the s1-head-up state conformations as the temperature increases it suggests that the s1-head-up states are more dynamic and entropically stable note that the dynamical transition between 1up-2down and 2up-1down states may tolerate a wide range of temperatures by a population shift mechanism so far we have examined that it tolerates the temperature range from t050t r to t167t r  temperature dependence of rbd hinge motion has also been studied fig s4  population distribution as a function of the fraction of native intra-chain hinge-region contacts formed by the rbd at different temperatures has been monitored a bimodal distribution reflects the population of the rbd-up and rbddown states for any individual chain being in trimeric spike as temperature increases the rbd-up states start to enhance their populations free energy calculation in a system if a state a described by its reaction coordinate x a which in our case is the fraction of native contact is separated from another state b described by its reaction coordinate x b  by a finite barrier the free energy of transition from a to b can be expressed as where   b p x is the probability to find the system in state b at the reaction coordinate q b  the same holds for   a p x  from a finite set of unbiased simulations of trimeric spike protein a complete thermodynamic description is obtained

chainb b inter-chain rbd-s2 domain closure in the s1-head-down state the s2 stalk connection with rbd is mediated by a proline residue of chaina with the formation of a ch- type interaction with

extracted from the cryo-em structure pdb6vsb of trimeric spike low rmsd between these two chains suggests that contact information extracted from any of these chains will be equivalent this supports our contact map generation shown in the method pipeline fig s3  rms deviation of each chain from their initial state during a typical simulation progress a the initial state of chain a in the trimeric spike was in s1-head-up state and chain bc was in s1-head-down state b the lower rmsd for chain a corresponds to chain as head-up state c the lower rmsd for chain b corresponds to chain b s head-down

state as shown in fig s1  four states emerge as shown in fig 3b  as temperature increases the population shifts more towards the s1-head-up state conformations indicating that s1-head-up states are more dynamic and entropically stablenote that the dynamical transition between 1up-2down and 2up-1down states may tolerate a wide range of temperatures by a population shift mechanism b population

opening of rbd-s1 cleft in the s1-head-up state of sars-cov-2 s differs from that of sars-cov s the opening is measured by a characteristic distance between a serine and proline residues at two edges of the cleft for sars-cov-2 s the distance is 243 nm while for sars-cov-s it is 165nm it appears that inter-chain rbd-ntd connection influences the sars-cov s rbd hinge motion significantly where the cleft opening is supported by those inter-chain interactions fig s7  the free energy landscape in the presence and absence of inter-chain rbd-s1 contacts a in the presence of inter-chain rbd-s1

covid-19 in the host cell is driven by the interaction of its spike protein with human ace2 receptor and a serine protease tmprss2 although complex between sars-cov-2 spike protein and ace2 has been structurally resolved the molecular details of the sars-cov-2 and tmprss2 complex are still elusive tmprss2 is responsible for priming of the viral spike protein that entails cleavage of the spike protein at two potential sites arg685ser686 and arg815ser816 the present study aims to investigate the conformational details of complex between tmprss2 and sars-cov-2 spike protein in order to discern the finer details of the priming of viral spike and to point candidate drug targets briefly full length structural model of tmprss2 was developed and docked against the resolved structure of sars-cov-2 spike protein with directional restraints of both cleavage sites the docking simulations showed that tmprss2 interacts with the two different loops of sars-cov-2 spike protein each containing different cleavage sites key functional residues of tmprss2 his296 ser441 and ser460 were found to interact with immediate flanking residues of cleavage sites of sars-cov-2 spike protein compared to the n-terminal cleavage site arg685ser686 tmprss2 region that interact with c-terminal cleavage site arg815ser816 of the sars-cov-2 spike protein was predicted as relatively more druggable in summary the present study provide structural characteristics of molecular complex between human tmprss2 and sars-cov-2 spike protein and points to the candidate drug targets that could further be exploited to direct structure base drug designing  the recent pandemic of covid-19 is the third outbreak of the diseases caused by beta coronavirus in humans following severe acute respiratory

covid-19 situation report-84 genetically etiological agent of covid-19 sars-cov-2 is closely related to sars-cov compared to mers-cov wu et al 2020  similarly like for sars-cov angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ace2 has been identified as the primary receptor for sars-cov-2 spike protein li 2015 lan et al 2020  whereas mers-cov spike protein interacts with the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 as the first site of attachment to the host cell li 2015  spike protein of sars-cov-2 is 1273 amino acid long protein with two functionally distinct regions s1 and s2 involved in the attachment and entry of the virus respectively sars-cov-2 entry in the host cell is mediated by proteolytic cleavage of its spike protein a process dubbed as priming recently human transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 has been shown to carry out the priming of the sars-cov-2 spike protein by generating two distinct fragments of the viral spike protein s1s2 and s2 hoffman et al recently co-crystal structure of sars-cov-2 spike protein complexed with ace2 receptor has been resolved unraveling the finer details of intermolecular interactions lan et al 2020  the however no complex structure of sars-cov-2 spike protein with tmprss2 has been resolved to date moreover the molecular structure of human tmprss2 protein is also not known resultantly structural details of intermolecular interactions between sars-cov-2 and tmprss2 are largely unknown although like many other protease inhibitors zhang et al 2020  tmprss2 inhibitor has been suggested andor shown to antagonize the entry of the virus into the host cells hoffman et al 2020 this study aims to investigate the interaction points between tmprss2 and sars-cov-2 spike protein using an array of bioinformatic tool the findings not only provide

the protein has not been resolved and our xtalpred analysis showed the least possibility for this molecule to be crystalized potentially due to the high percentage of coiled structure isoelectric point and surface hydrophobicity  figure 1b  this may be the reason that therefore we used multiple approaches to develop the full length molecular model of tmprss2 the finally selected refined model of tmprss2 has 9632 residues within the allowed regions of ramachandran plot which is acceptable considering the n-terminal portion of the protein was predicted to be intrinsically disordered secondly it has been demonstrated rather frequently that many of the resolved structures of the proteins such as usp7 pdb id 2f1z have more than 20 of the residues outside the allowed region in ramachandran

two fragments s1s2 and s2 hoffman et al 2020  the precise positioning of the proteolytic cleavage sites have been mapped by sequence comparison and found to be at the junction of arg685ser686 and arg815ser816 the cleavage at the later site results in the production of s1s2 and s2 fragments which is necessary for the viral entry table 1  figure 2d  whereas at the second cleavage site arg815ser816 out of the three residues of catalytic triad his296 and ser441 established hydrogen bond interactions with pro809 lys814 and ser810 of the sars-cov-2 spike protein table 1  figure 3d

2 sarscov2 is probably the biggest threat for mankind today most of the countries as many as 225 countries have become victims of this pandemic viral infection
1
 hitherto more than 247 lacs death have been recorded alongside 35 lacs individuals are infected with covid19 throughout the globe
1
 the first evidence on the recent outbreak of covid19 has been diagnosed for causing pneumonia amongst the infected individuals from wuhan china at the end of 2019
2
 covid19 is considered as a  coronavirus of 2b group and phylogenetic studies revealed that covid19 belongs to the family coronaviridae and order nidovirales
3
 alike other flucausing viruses covid19 is also an rna containing virus having a protein corecapsid surrounding its rna genome comprising a positivesense singlestranded rna
4
 
5
 
6
 the virus transmits from humantohuman via sneeze cough and respiratory droplets
6
 
7

 the actual mechanistic insight of the pathogenesis of sarscov2 is yet unclear this is due to the dearth of knowledge that why the virus has selected human as a principal host and how the virus escapes the human innate immune system especially the interaction between the viral antigens and human tolllike receptors tlrs as well as the mechanistic insights of cytokine storm affecting multiple human organs are particularly unknown however the pathophysiology of covid19 typically involves entry of the virus through respiratory droplets into the respiratory system principally the alveoli of lungs through the airways
8
 the viral glycoprotein on its capsid typically termed as spike protein binds to the angiotensinconverting enzyme2 ace2 receptor and the rna genome enters the host cell mostly the alveolar cells via receptormediated endocytosis
8
 after entering the host cell the viral rna replicase is formed from the messenger rna results in rapid replication of the viral rna and other necessary structural proteins
9
 on the other hand the interaction between the viral antigens and host immune cells results in the induction of proinflammatory responses which trigger vasodilation an increase of vascular permeability and accumulation of humoral factors all these factors cumulatively cause fever and majorly interrupts gaseous exchange to cause breathing difficulty
9
 lack of complete understanding about the pathogenesis and immunological peculiarity of the virus made the situation more alarming to mankind currently no specific drug or vaccine is available to challenge this myriad threat recent studies have suggested a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin or drugs used for conventional antiretroviral therapy remdesivir could be effective for treating patients with covid

 several studies have attempted to present epitopebased vaccine candidates for the speedy emergence of an effective vaccine against covid19

 similarly amino acid sequences of tlr1 accession number aac341371 tlr2 accession number aay856501 tlr4 accession number aai174231 and tlr5 accession number aaz174711 were obtained from ncbi protein database httpwwwncbinlmnihgov 3d structures of each tlr were generated by homology modeling and used in further studies the spike glycoprotein sequences from all the selected organisms were first subjected to multiple sequence alignment using clustalw algorithm using the mega x software suite ver 101 64bit windows thereafter the alignments were used for constructing the phylogenetic tree by neighborjoining method in the mega platform furthermore phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using bootstrapping analyses with 1000 replications to assess the confidence of the developed phylogenetic tree to study spike proteinace interaction homology modeling was used to model the structure of the ace2 receptors using the retrieved amino acid sequences using the software modeller 9 the stereochemical quality of the so built models was evaluated by plotting ramachandran plots using the structural assessment tool provided by the swissmodel web server httpsswissmodelexpasyorg molecular docking approach was employed to perform a comparative evaluation of the binding affinities of spike protein from sarscov2 with its cognate ace2 receptor protein of human as well as other most suspected zoonotic hosts like horseshoe bat and the malayan pangolin the study was conducted for each combination of ace2spike complex while using shape and electrostatic field correlations and was subjected to optimized potentials for liquid simulations minimization postprocessing the docking was performed by employing hex docking software ver 800 which proves to be a very popular software application for docking molecules even of higher molecular weights the resultant complex conformations were visualized by through visual molecular dynamics software suite ver 193 the retrieved sequences of the ace2 receptors of the organisms horseshoe bat malayan pangolin and human were used to determine the hydrophobicity based on kytedoolittle algorithm by using protscale web server httpswebexpasyorgprotscale the server was also employed to construct plots of percent accessible residues for each ace2 receptor protein furthermore the antigenic propensity of the proteins was also predicted and plotted through kolaskar and tongaonkar algorithm antigenic peptides finder tool from the immunomedicine group server httpimedmeducmes vadar volume area dihedral angle reporter server was also used to assess the structural contents of ace2 protein the relative mutability values for spike proteins of sarscov2 sarscov and merscov were determined from their corresponding amino acid sequences employing protscale web server httpswebexpasyorgprotscale the phylogenetic relationship amongst spike protein of sarscov2 and its homologs is described in figure 1a the phylogenetic reconstruction generated an unrooted phylogenetic tree that resembles a close phylogenetic relation between sarscov2 and bat cov ratg13 and were found to share a monophyletic group figure 1a supported by a high bootstrap value bv value of 100 we have also found that spike protein of sarscov does not share the same clade with mers cov and therefore are phylogenetically distantly related viruses figure 1a after studying the phylogenetic distance among the major strains of coronavirus we studied the sequence divergence of ace2 receptor protein the major receptor of sarscov2 herein the phylogenetic relationship revealed that ace2 protein is distinct in character amongst the different genus of the animal kingdom figure 1a for example human and gorilla are closely related mammals with minimum change in the genome and phylogeny of ace2 receptor also supports the same figure 1a since this clade is supported by a low bv 50 it is inferred that the receptor protein in human could have followed a different ancestor than that of the gorilla interestingly ace2 of the bat was found to be comparatively closer to human ace2 while pangolin m javanica was found to be a distantly related one our phylogenetic analysis revealed a close relationship amongst the spike proteins of sarscov2 infecting human and bat coronavirus on the other side the ace2 receptor found to have distinct characteristics we have studied the molecular characteristics of ace2 from human bat and pangolin separately figure 2 analyses of the homology model corresponding to pangolin bat and human ace2 suggested that both human and bat possess similar content 55 of alphahelices in the native structure of ace2 while pangolinace2 contains 53 the proportion of betasheet in the 3d structures ace2 of bat human and pangolin was 7 8 and 9 respectively relative proportions of random coils in the ace2 structures were found to be 23 35 and 37 respectively for ace2 protein from bat human and pangolin origin figure 2a the assumption of any biochemical or biophysical characteristic from the theoretically designed protein structure is dependent on its stereochemical quality herein the ramachandran plot of ace2 for each organism demonstrated that most of the residues are present in the favored region and hence possess good stereochemical stability figure 2b the percentage of accessible residues of human ace2 was found to be close to bat but different from pangolin figure 2c while considering the plots for percentage accessible residues figure 2c it is clear that the ace2 receptor of r sinicus has much more accessible residues near the ligandbinding region as compared to those of the other two hydrophobicity is also considered as an important property of the receptor protein and we have presented the pattern of hydrophobicity of ace2 from the three different organisms we studied figure 2d the pattern of hydrophobicity of ace2 of human was also found to follow a similar trend to that of the bat but not to that of the pangolin in fact the hydrophobicity plot of bat r sinicus showed deeper peaks below the 00 midline as compared with the plots of the other two organisms the current debate on the origin of the pathogenic transformation of coronavirus is the origin of the virus which may have a connection with bat or pangolin to investigate this postulation we conducted molecular docking of the spike protein of sarscov2 with the ace2 receptor of human bat and pangolin figure 3 we have observed different degrees of binding interactions between spike protein and its receptor ace2 from human and two of the most suspected zoonotic hostsreservoirs figure 3 the order of strength of binding was spike proteinbat ace2  spike proteinhuman ace2  spike proteinpangolin ace2 table 1 interaction between spike protein of sarscov2 and bat ace2 was found to be the strongest table 1 the interacting surface between spike protein and ace2 majorly consisting of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction as depicted in table 1 interestingly the interacting surface of ace2 of human was also found to be similar to bat figure 3 and table 1 upon close examination it was observed that the receptorbinding domain of the sarscov2 spike protein majorly comprises leu glu ser asn phe pro and asp while the ligandbinding region of the ace2 receptors of bat and human are consisted of glu pro asn ala and val figure 3 and table 1 the binding potential of spike protein is also supported by the antigenicity of sarscov2 that reveals increasing abundance antigenic peptides in sarscov2 in comparison to the two other strains of coronavirus that is sarscov and merscov table s1 sarscov2 pathogenesis principally involves disruption of physiochemical barriers while the immunopathological consequences in human majorly involve respiratory inflammation

 considering this background we investigated the interaction of the spike protein with the innate immune receptors of human especially the cell surface tlrs molecular docking studies have demonstrated significant binding of the native spike protein of sarscov2 to tlr1 tlr4 and tlr6 with a respective binding energy value of 573 1202 and 684 interestingly tlr4spike protein interaction has been found to display the strongest proteinprotein interaction the extracellular domains of the surface tlrs were found to interact with the spike protein in the docked protein complexes figure 4 the binding interfaces between the tlrs and the spike protein were consisted of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions table 2 interestingly more fine and high valued antigenic peaks found in the antigenicity plot for spike protein were majorly detected at the interacting face of the spike protein that is tlrbinding region figure s1 and table s1 in addition to the aforementioned studies we have analyzed the relative mutability in the ectodomain of the spike protein of three major strains of the coronavirus we have found that the peptide segment corresponding to s1 subunit of sarscov2 possesses greater mutability potential as compared with the equivalent peptides present in merscov and the sarscov this increased mutability of the spike protein in sarscov2 most likely to be involved in enhancing its coevolutionary velocity and thus enabling it to conform to various novel microenvironments encountered by it moreover this property may also promote the prevalence of sarscov2 across wide racial population distributions of human and also letting it penetrate the speciesspecies barrier with greater ease coronavirus has established its name in biology through the three pandemic outbreaks namely merscov sarscov and the sarscov2 out of these the recent outbreak of covid19 pandemic by sarscov2 has proved to be significantly virulent due its tremendous ability of infection transmission and producing fatal outcomes

 there are considerable debates currently going on among the scientific communities regarding the emergence of covid19 in this regard postulations on the emergence of the virus from bat or pangolin possibilities of emergence of covid19 through genetic modifications and adaptive mutations and reemergence of the previously emerged sarscovmers all are open questions to answer in this context a recent wholegenome analysis by zhang et al
16
 revealed that pangolincov and batcov ratg13 are 9055 and 9102 homologous to sarscov2 respectively these experimental evidence indicated that pangolin and bat could be the possible originsource for sarscov2 and covid19 outbreak intriguingly a further report by andersen et al
17
 demonstrated that sarscov2 is not a laboratorymade or intentionally manipulated virus rather it may have originated through natural selection both of these studies have indicated the involvement of zoonotic reservoir in the present study our data suggest that spike protein of sarscov2 is phylogenetically closer to bat sarscov than that of pangolin sarscov but distantly related to mers as described in figure 1 previous studies in this direction indicated that sarscov2 genome rna shares 96 homology with bat coronavirus and 795 with sarscov
18
 the present study is corroborated with this and indicated a close relationship between bat sarscov and human sarscov2 a higher bv of 70 indicated a wellestablished monophyletic group
19
 
20
 moreover the spike protein of sarscov2 contains more antigenic peptides than that of the sarscov and mers supplementary table 1 the present study is therefore suggesting that spike protein expression in the virome of sarscov2 is closely related to that of the bat cov ratg13 and both forms of the virus might have originated from a common ancestor moreover our data also hypothesized that human sarscov2 is a naturally modified version of bat sarscov interestingly we have also observed that the cognate receptor of spike protein that is ace2 is phylogenetically close between human and bat this inference was also verified through determining the relative structural content and binding efficacy of the spike protein to human bat and pangolin ace2 receptor figures 2 and 3 the structural contents hydrophobicity and proportion of accessible residues of ace2 were very close in bat and human while the molecular docking studies revealed that spike protein of sarscov2 binds more strongly to bat and human than pangolin moreover the interaction zone in spike proteinace2 complex of both bat and human was also found comprising similar residues this could be the possible reason behind choosing human as a host for sarscov2 moreover an abundance of human than that of bat might have promoted the pathogenic transformation to select human for speedy transmission we therefore studied the involvement of the human innate immune receptors that is the tlrs to understand the rationale of choosing the human as a host by sarscov2 from an immunological point of view immunopathology of covid infection has been reported to be caused due to the elevated inflammatory response that constitutes an abundant expression of proinflammatory cytokines like interleukin6 and tumor necrosis factoralpha
9
 these two cytokines are the products of the tlr signaling pathway
21
 and therefore we have investigated the role of tlrs in this study since sarscov2 is an rna virus one might ask about the functional role of the tlr3 7 8 and 9 but the immunopathological outcomes are most likely induced at the point of hostvirus interaction that is interaction between spike protein of sarscov2 and immune cells present in the alveoli of human
8
 therefore we examined the possible involvement of the surface tlrs present in the human cells and their interaction with the spike protein of sarscov2 our data indicated that tlr4 possesses a strong binding affinity to spike protein following tlr6 and tlr1 figure 4 and table 2 tlr4 being the most efficient innate immune receptor that induces proinflammatory responses after binding with the pathogenic ligand
22
 therefore the interaction between tlr4 and spike protein could be one the reasons behind the immunopathological manifestation of covid19 this interaction could be useful for developing drugs against the same or using tlr4 antagonists as anticorona therapeutics since we have used the native conformations of spike protein and tlrs we have computed the most likely interactions however actual proteinprotein interaction study using surface plasmon resonance can reveal the actual strength of binding and the binding constant intriguingly we have seen positive energy values for tlr 3 5 and 6 which indicate a complex interaction that needs to be examined in future however a recent study by bhattacharya et al
12
 revealed a vaccine candidate from sarscov2 spike protein that interacts with tlr5 since the vaccine is a peptide with much shorter than the actual protein in length and of helical structure it is much more exposed to the tlr than that of the whole protein complex in its native configuration aimed in this study finally our data on mutability indicated the strongest mutability of sarscov2 than that of sarscov and merscov all these evidence collectively support the earlier studies

 that have indicated the origin of sarscov2 from animals and further strengthen the view on the origin of this viral strain from bat however more experimental validations are particularly needed to establish these inferences the present in silico studies indicated a close relationship between bat sarscov and sarscov2 at the level of phylogeny of the major infective protein that is spike protein and its receptor ace2 as well as proteinprotein interaction between these two zoonotic origin of sarscov2 from bat is therefore supported in this study spike protein of sarscov2 has been found to bind with surface tlrs tlr1 4 and 6 especially strongly with tlr4 therefore selective targeting of tlr4spike protein interaction by designing competitive tlr4antagonists could pave a new way to treat covid19 taken together this study is expected to improve our understanding of the biology of sarscov2 and the findings contribute to the fundamental knowledge which could be useful in adopting an accurate intervention strategy in near future the authors declare that there are no conflict of interests ac performed all the experiments analyzed the data and assisted in manuscript writing sm

prahlad naveen kulkarni abhijit kayal  a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 covid-19 that initially originates from wuhan province in china has emerged as a global pandemic an outbreak that started at the end of 2019 which claims 431192 date 15 th june 2020 httpscovid19whoin life till now since then scientists all over the world are engaged in developing new vaccines antibodies or drug molecules to combat this new threat here in this work we performed an in-silico analysis on the protein-protein interactions between the receptor-binding rbd domain of viral spike protein and human angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 hace2 receptor to highlight the key alteration that happened from sars-cov to sars-cov-2 we analyzed and compared the molecular differences between these two viruses by using various computational approaches such as binding affinity calculations computational alanine and molecular dynamics simulations the binding affinity calculations show sars-cov-2 binds little more firmly to the hace2 receptor than that of sars-cov waals interaction play a major role in stabilizing the protein-protein interface the major finding obtained from molecular dynamics simulations is that the rbd-ace2 interface is populated with water molecules and interacts strongly with both rbd and ace2 interfacial residues during the simulation periods we also emphasize that the interfacial water molecules play a critical role in binding and maintaining the stability of the rbdhace2 complex the water-mediated hydrogen bond by the bridge water molecules is crucial for stabilizing the rbd and ace2 domains the structural and dynamical features presented here may serve as a guide for developing new drug molecules vaccines or antibodies to combat the covid-19 pandemic   3  the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has emerged as a global pandemic by taking more than 431192 date 15 th june 2020 httpscovid19whoin life all over the world the rapid spread and high mortality rate 3 to 5 1 cov and sars-cov-2 use the homotrimer spike glycoprotein comprising of s1 and s2 subunit or spike protein to bind the cellular receptors and induce the dissociation of s1 and s2 subunit this also triggers a cascade of events such as the transition of s2 from a metastable prefusion state to a more stable post-fusion state the fusion between a cell and viral membrane etc 6 7 8  s1 subunit contains the receptor-binding domain rbd that binds to the peptidase domain pd of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 9  the recognition of spike protein with the ace2 enzyme is the first step of the virus lifecycle and entry to the host cell these are the reasons the cov spike protein is a key target for developing new vaccines therapeutic antibodies and new drug molecules recent in vitro studies also indicate that the rbd domain of the s1 subunit plays a key functional role for the binding of sars-cov by ace2 10  the crystal as well as cryo-em structures of the complexes spikehace2 reveal key information about the interactions between the rbds and the hace2 receptor 6 9 11  superposition of rbd domains of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 shows very similar structural fold with a root mean square deviation rmsd of 068  of 139 pairs of c atoms 12  knowing that binding to the ace2 receptor triggers the virial lifecycle it is also important to understand how the binding affinity of sars-cov-2 differs from the sars-cov experimental results reveal that the binding affinity values for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 with hace2 fall in a similar range 12  specifically the equilibrium dissociation constant kd shows a slightly higher value 152 nm of sars-cov-2 than that of sars-cov 15 nm 13  however a recent publication shows a 20-4 fold increased binding affinity between trimeric spike protein with ace2 receptor of sars-cov-2 than that of sars-cov 6  nevertheless it is now well established that sars-cov-2 has a slightly better binding affinity towards hace2 than the sars-cov the high binding affinity suggests that this novel coronavirus is evolved towards being a better binder to the same human ace2 receptor thus a comparison of both the rbd domains of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 is of utmost importance and it migh t give us a clue why sars-cov-2 is so deadlier than sars-cov similar to the experiments several computational studies are performed on the binding affinity of the rbds of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 with hace2 14 15  most of the earlier results are based on the homology modeled structure of the sars-cov-2 where the global fold of the spike protein was correct but the atomic level scoring function for predicting the binding affinity was not accurate thus the earlier results predicted lower binding affinity of sars-cov-2 14 15  this also implies that the side-chain packing of the modeled structure was not accurate enough recent binding free energy calculations performed on the crystal structure of rbdhace2 of sars-cov-2 predicts high binding affinity than sars-cov 16  another study uses rosetta interface analyzer 17 and concludes that both these viruses have a similar binding affinity 18  thus from in-silico perspective it is still not fully understood why sars-cov-2 is better binder than sars-cov-2 and the results are inconclusive hence atomistic-level comparison is needed between these two viruses a recent study found that the hydrogen bonding network and the hydrophobic interactions are major dominating forces that are responsible for enhanced binding in sars-cov-2 19  till now most of the studies focus on the search for new vaccines and drug molecules against covid-19 there is very little attention paid to the atomistic label description and dynamics of the interfacial domain of spike protein with the hace2 receptor the dynamic interactions between the rbd and the hace2 may reveal some crucial points that are not accessible from only the crystal structures in this work we first assess the atomistic level description of rbds of spike protein with hace2 receptor from the crystal structures we identify the key contact residues that are responsible for the binding of the rbd domain and hace2 we also critically analyze the differences in the interfacial residues between the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 further the binding affinity of these two domains of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 next all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of rbd domains of spike protein complexed with the human ace2 5 receptor of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 are performed to extract the dynamics of these complexes we focus our study at the interfacial region of rbds and hace2 and provide an atomistic picture of the interactions the importance of contact residues is also highlighted and a thorough comparison was made between the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 till now most of the in-silico work on spike-ace2 complex is done to design new antibodies or drug molecules whereas little attention is paid to the atomistic level description and the dynamics of the spike-ace2 complex hence our study focuses on the interfacial region of rbd and ace2 domains our simulation results reveal that the interfacial water molecules play an important role regarding the binding of rbds and ace2 domain particularly the bridge water connecting the two domains of spike protein and the hace2 the crystal structure of sars-cov-2 -rbdace2 pdb id 6vw1 and sars-cov-rbdace pdb id 2ajf are taken from the protein database and subjected to md simulations the two protein-protein complexes contain some notable structural elements for which special care was taken while preparing the system like n-glycosylation of various asparagine residues disulfide bridges between various pairs of cysteine presence of zinc finger and other amino acids which require proper protonation states the systems are prepared using the charmm-gui web 6 server 20 and parameter files and equilibration files are taken from the server all the simulations were performed using the software gromacs version 20194 21 22 using the charmm-36 forcefield 23  each system is solvated in tip3p 24 water and kcl salt were added to neutralize the systems to a salt concentration of 150 mm each system is solvated in a rectangular box of dimensions l x 138  l y 138  and l z 138  the distance is appropriate to avoid all finite-size effects due to long-range electrostatic interactions among neighboring simulation boxes simulation for both the complexes is carried out at 310k and 1 atm pressure to treat long-range electrostatic interactions particle mesh ewald pme 25 method is used with a cut-off of 12  and to constrain hydrogen bond the lincs algorithm 26 was applied each system is minimized with 5000 steps of the steepest descent algorithm to eliminate the bad contacts in the system after minimization equilibration simulation is performed for in nvt ensemble at 310 k after nvt simulation npt equilibration is performed for 5 ns at 1 atm pressure and the temperature is maintained at 310 k during the equilibration period the position restrained is applied to the heavy atoms of the protein velocity rescale thermostat and parinnello-rahman barostat 27 are applied to maintain the temperature and the pressure respectively for the protein-protein binding affinity calculations foldx software 28 is used different visualizing and trajectory analysis software packages ucsf chimera 29 and vmd visual molecular dynamics 30 were used and qzyme workbench 31 an in-house enzyme engineering platform was used for all calculations performed and discussed in results earlier published results highlighted the differences between the rbd domains of two spike proteins the spike protein of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 share 75 sequence similarity and their structural fold are almost identical whereas the rbd domains have a sequence similarity of 737 4  figure 1 shows the superposition of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 and in the inset we highlight the key residues that have changed from sars-cov to sars-cov-2 in the crystal structure of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 there are significant protein-protein contacts that can be seen and we identified some of the key residues that are important for the 7 stabilization of spike protein and hace2 receptor in figure s1 of supporting information we displayed the residues that are in the interfacial region of the rbd domain bound to the ace2 domain with a distance cut-off 4  there are 16 residues of rbd that are in contact with 20 residues of ace2 domain a similar analysis of sars-cov-2 shows 18 residues of rbd that are in contact with 21 residues of the ace2 receptor among the 21 ace2 residues that are interacting with two rbds 17 are found to be common residues most of the interacting residues of the ace2 receptor are located near the n-terminal helix the above analysis manifests that the surface area of the interfacial domain of ace2 and rbds is almost the same this also corroborates earlier findings where the surface area is 1687  2 and 1699  2 for sars-cov-2 and sars-cov 32  within this 4  cut-off there are 4 hydrophobic residues leu455 phe456 ala475 and phe486 and 14 hydrophilic ie not hydrophobic residues arg408 thr415 tyr449 tyr453 gly476 asn487 tyr489 gln493 gly496 gln498 thr500 asn501 gly502 and tyr505 are there near the interface of spike protein of sars-cov-2 whereas there are 3 hydrophobic residues leu443 leu472 and ile489 and 13 hydrophilic residues arg426 tyr436 tyr440 tyr442 asn473 tyr475 asn479 gly482 tyr484 thr486 thr487 gly488 tyr491 are present near the interface of spike protein of sars-cov it is interesting to note that the interface of rbd domain is enriched with tyrosine and glycine residues for sars-cov-2 4 tyrosine and 3 glycine out of 14 residues as well as sars-cov 6 tyrosine and 2 glycine out of 16 residues further we counted the residues with a cut-off value of 8  to get an estimation of the buried residues of both the rbd domains we found that 53 and 51 residues are coming in contact with the ace2 domain for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 respectively table s1 supporting information to see the effect of the interfacial residues on the overall binding affinity with hace2 we performed computational alanine scanning on these interfacial residues to see the extent of the impact on the binding affinity due to alanine substitution further the crystal structure of sars-cov-2 has 13 hydrogen bonds between the rbd domain and the ace2 domain however sars-cov has a lesser number of hydrogen bonds between the rbd and the ace2 domain for sars-cov it has only 5 hydrogen bonds between the two domains as there are fewer hydrogen bonds in sars-cov we expect that the rbdace2 complex of sars-cov-2 is more stable than sars-cov further we calculate the binding free energy of the spikehace2 complex from the prodigy web server 33 as well as from foldx software 28  the binding free energy is calculated on the crystal structures of the dimer and the 8 values are -108 and -117 kcalmol for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 respectively while the foldx calculations show binding energy -449 and -987 kcalmol for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 respectively though the values obtained from prodigy and foldx are not in the same range the trend suggests that sars-cov-2 binds more effectively to hace2 and evolved as a better binder to the human receptor as we discussed in the previous section about the interfacial residues of the rbd domain is critical for stabilizing the protein-protein complex we performed computational alanine scanning on the contact residues of the rbd domain to highlight the importance of those residues we mutated the interfacial residues to alanine and then calculate the binding free energy with the ace2 domain alanine scanning is performed to identify the residues that make a significant contribution to the binding affinity with hace2 the result reveals that figure 3 most of the residues lower the binding affinity when mutated with alanine except n501 where a slight increase in binding affinity is observed for sars-cov-2 a decrease in binding affinity suggests that both sars-cov-2 and sars-cov have optimized its rbd domain to bind with the human ace2 receptor from the alanine scanning results we observe that y449 l455  f486 y498 g502 and v503 are found to be critical for stabilizing the overall complex compared to sars-cov-2 the alanine mutation doesnt lower the binding affinity for all the residues of sars-cov this result points to the fact that sars-cov-2 optimized its interfacial residues in such a manner that binding to hace2 is more enhanced in this context we would like to discuss a few changes that happened between the sars-cov to sars-cov-2 few mutations like tyr484gln498 thr487asn501 tyr442leu455 leu443phe456 leu472phe486 asn479gln493 show significant changes in binding affinity when the particular position is mutated with alanine it is to be noted that gln474 and gly485 inserted near the interfacial domain of rbd of sars-cov-2 though these two residues are not directly interacting with the ace2 they form intramolecular hydrogen bonds two give the stability of the loop like gln474 interacts with gly476 and gly484 interacts with cys488 the alanine mutation of these two residues does not change the binding affinity significantly next section we discuss the results obtained from molecular dynamics simulations during 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations both the adducts spikehace2 of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 are found to be stable in figure s2 of from the molecular dynamics simulation trajectories we extracted different components of interaction energy ie electrostatics and van-der-waals vdw interaction terms between the rbd of spike protein and the hace2 receptor in figure 4  the probability of different rbd and the hace2 has significance on the overall binding affinity of the protein-protein interaction 12 a key observation that was made from the simulation trajectories is that the minimum distance between the c atoms of rbd and the ace2 domain varies significantly for sars-cov and sars-cov2 figure 5 a  the minimum c distance gives an idea of the relative separation between the two domains it is observed that the average c distance for sars-cov  it is well known that water-mediated interactions are one of the major driving forces of protein folding and protein-drug recognition processes 34 35 36 37  in the previous section we observed the there is almost a 4-5  gap in between the spikhace2 protein-protein complex there is a possibility that this interfacial domain or the gap region is hydrated with water molecules and those interfacial water molecules might play a significant role in stabilizing spike protein and the hace2 receptor indeed from our simulations we observed that water molecules gradually populate the interfacial domain of spike protein and hace2 receptors during the 100 ns simulation period we observed that the interfacial domain forms a rich hydrogen-bonded network and stabilize the overall protein-protein complex from our simulations we analyze the water molecules that come within the 35  near to the spike protein and hace2 domain the fluctuation in the number of water molecules in the interfacial region of the ace2 domain shows high water content for sars-cov than sars-cov-2 figure 7a  the average water molecules near the ace2 domain are 2142868 and 24271004 for sars-cov-2 and sars-cov respectively though the ace2 interface is almost the same for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 there is a higher number of water molecules near the ace2 interfaces the probability plot  figure 7 b  shows a clear difference in the number of water molecules between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 a similar result can be observed for the rbd domain of spike protein a greater number of water molecules can be seen near the sars-cov spike domain than that of the sars-cov-2 spike domain figure 8a and b  the high occupancy near the interfacial domain of sars-cov can be attributed to the fluctuation of the rbd and the hace2 domain and larger gap in between these two domains finally we calculated the bridge-water molecules that are hydrogen-bonded with both ace2 and rbd domains at the same time we calculate the number of water molecules that are simultaneously forming hydrogen bonds with rbd and the ace2 domain in figure 9 a we display the number of bridge water molecules during 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations and in figure 9 b we show one bridge water molecule that is hydrogen-bonded to rbd gln493 as well as ace2glu35 domain at the same time from the simulation trajectories several multiwater bridge water molecules can be observed in rbd and hace2 domains the bridge water molecules it can be seen that there is a slightly higher number of bridge water molecules 2 for sars-cov-2 than that of sars-cov these bridging water molecules play a significant role in stabilizing the two domains of the complex we expect that these bridge water molecules play a significant role in stabilizing spikeace2 domain here we want to highlight one key point that in the crystal structure sars-cov-2 the gln493 is engaged in a hydrogen bond with the glu35 whereas from md simulation we observed that water molecules enter into the interfacial region and connected these two residues to have an idea about how the rbd and ace2 domains are interacting with water molecules we calculate the water-mediated hydrogen bonds with rbd and hace2 domains in the case of hace2 the interfacial residues are making almost the same number of hydrogen bonds with the water molecules for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 this is expected as the ace2 receptor is the same in both the viruses and small changes can be attributed to the fluctuation of the hace2 domain in figure 10 finally we calculated the interaction energy electrostatic van der waals between the interfacial rbd and ace2 domain with water molecules figure 11ab  we observe that the interaction a b figure 11 total interaction energy coulombic  van der waals between the water molecules and the hace2 and the rbd domains energy between the water molecules and the hace2 domain of both the viruses has almost the same that means the surface topology of hace2 are behaves similarly during the md simulations for both these viruses the difference can be seen between the rbd of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 interaction with water molecules is more preferred with sars-cov than sars-cov-2 as the water molecules make a greater number of hydrogen bonds with the rbd domain enhanced water interaction with the rbd of sars-cov reduces the direct interaction with the hace2 receptor in summary we elucidate the similarities and differences between the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 by using molecular dynamics simulation approaches from the structural point of view the rbd of spike protein shares a significant similarity in terms of the three-dimensional structure and the fold however significant differences are observed in how these two viruses bind to the hace2 receptor we found that improvement in hydrophobic contacts that leads to enhanced van der waals interactions between the rbd and the hace2 receptor affects the high binding affinity for the sars-cov-2 the most important information we found from the study is that involvement of water molecules at the interfacial domain of the rbd and ace2 receptor we observed that for both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 the interfacial domain is spontaneously hydrated and a significant number of water molecules populate the gap in between rbd and ace2 domain it is found that bridge water molecules play a significant role in stabilizing the protein-protein binary complex this kind of water-mediated interaction for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 did not observe in the previous study the present study unravels the many structural and dynamical features of this protein-protein dimer complexes that help us to understand how this virus interacts with the human cell  conformational reorganization of the sars coronavirus spike following receptor binding implications for membrane fusion daniel beniac r shauna devarennes l anton andonov runtao he tim booth f olivier schwartz   viral membrane fusion proteins are responsible both for binding to cellular receptors and the subsequent fusion of viral and cellular membranes the paradigm for class i fusion proteins consists of two heptad repeat regions and a hydrophobic fusion peptide 1 this motif is present in sars-cov 2 and other coronaviruses 3 as well as the hemagglutinin ha of influenza 4 gp21 of human t-cell leukemia virus type 15 gp41 of hiv6 gp2 of ebola virus 7 8 and the fusion protein of paramyxovirus 912 class i viral fusion proteins can also be divided into two sub-types those whose fusion mechanism is low ph-dependent such as influenza ha and those that are ph-independent like the retroviral fusion proteins in retroviruses receptor binding itself can trigger fusion with temperature and redox conditions also influencing the fusion mechanism 13 14 the sars spike appears to be insensitive to redox conditions 15 for sars-cov it is proposed that the virus is internalized in the cell by endocytosis and is then exposed to a low ph environment and it is postulated that proteolytic cleavage between the s1 and s2 domains initiates the membrane fusion process 16 although the factors which trigger fusion endocytosis ph sensitivity single receptor vs primary and co-receptor binding redox change differ amongst diverse virus families all viral fusion proteins are thought to share the same basic fusion mechanism 1 4 1720 a notable feature of the sars spike is its large mass 500 kd per trimer and striking club-shaped appearance from the end-on this appears like a three-bladed propeller with a radius of 90  21 despite the structural differences the sars spike performs the same fundamental task in viral entry to the host cell as other class i viral fusion proteins such as the influenza ha 220 kd per trimer the sars spike can be subdivided into four structural domains from n to c terminus the two large external domains s1 and s2 are largely responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion respectively in many class i viral fusion proteins the analogous peptides are generated by proteolysis of the spike precursor during the maturation process in the host cell resulting in two peptides with the fusion peptide on the n-terminus of s2 in sars-cov the s1s2 assignment is given based on sequence homology to other viral fusion proteins however there is no peptide cleavage during maturation the final two small domains are comprised of a transmembrane domain and a carboxyterminal cytoplasmic domain which principally anchor the spike to the viral envelope the cell-surface molecule ace2 is the receptor for the sars spike protein 22 and is a relatively large macromolecule with a diameter of 70  in comparison the receptor for influenza ha sialic acid is much smaller with a 10  diameter the precise mechanisms by which class i viral fusion proteins gain access to the host cell remain unknown the hypothetical entry process includes several steps that take place in sequence receptor binding fusion core re-arrangement fusion peptide insertion in host cell membrane refolding of heptad repeats membrane fusion and finally viral nucleocapsid transfer 23 the structures of ace2 bound to a fragment of the sars spike containing the receptor-binding domain and the pre- and post-fusion configurations of the fusion core heptad repeats of the spike have been solved to atomic resolution 2 3 2426 in addition the atomic resolution structures of two neutralizing antibodies bound to the sars spike receptor-binding domain have been solved 27 28 showing that blocking of the receptor binding domain preventing attachment of virions to cell-surface ace2 is the likely mechanism of virus neutralization by these antibodies the aim of the present study was to delineate any possible structural changes in the sars spike that accompanied receptor-binding and to precisely localize the receptor binding domains which are only 14 of the total mass of the spike within the overall structure employing cryo-em and image processing of intact virions bound to soluble ace2 we demonstrate the structural dynamics which accompany spike-receptor binding which may be involved in triggering membrane fusion cryo-em coupled with 3d single particle image analysis was employed to investigate the binding of ace2 to the spike of sars-cov although sars-cov is approximately spherical when observed by cryo-em both its size and shape vary slightly and thus it is not amenable to single-particle averaging techniques however individual spikes on the surface envelope of the virus do provide a repetitive structure that is ideal for single particle techniques spikes on the surface of virus particles are readily imaged by cryo-em in the frozen-hydrated state figure 1c three-dimensional image processing was carried out on 11153 selected spike images taken at various defocus levels using routine single-particle image processing 35 36 the resolution of the final 3d structure was evaluated by a fourier shell correlation of 05 to be 185  figure 2 the structure of the unbound spike was compared with that of the spike-ace2 complex figures 1e 1f 3 movie s2 in both cases the spike portion of the 3d structure is fairly similar indicating that ace2 binding does not result in a fundamental structural unfolding of the spike however the overall height of the spike was reduced from 160  to 150  following ace2 binding when viewed from the end-on perspective and the spike undergoes a rotation of 5 following binding movie s2 and the mass at the center of the axis of symmetry on the distal end of the spike redistributes itself from one small central blob to three blobs or nubs figure 3 fj these redistributions of mass can be further identified in difference maps between the two reconstructions figure 3 figure 3 bg show that the unbound spike undergoes a decondensation of mass around the central axis blue upon ace2 binding this region is the putative location of the s2 domain whereas figure 3 di show that the bound spike difference map included both the ace2 component purple and a re-arrangement of the outer edges of the three blades of the s1 domain green the precise location of ace2 binding on the distal end of the spike is centered at 70  from the central axis of the spike with a 30  gap between the axis of symmetry and ace2 one ace2 molecule was bound to each of the three propeller-like blades of the spike making a structure 220  high figure 1f the density of these ace2 molecules is high in the 3d density map indicating a high occupancy of binding sites in addition the structure shows that binding of one ace2 to the spike would not sterically hinder binding of additional ace2 molecules on the other two propeller-blades of each trimer the cryo-em 3d structures of the spike and the spike-ace2 complex were combined with the atomic resolution structures of the sars spike receptor-binding domain- ace2 complex 24 and the heptad repeat pre- and post-fusion cores 2 25 to interpret the cryo-em structure the receptor-binding domain- ace2 data were docked with a correlation score of 0965 using the situs software package figure 4 37 as expected the receptor-binding domain docked to the distal end of the spike with ace2 filling the extra mass on the spike shown by the color violet in figure 4 the empty upper region of the mass is likely composed of the fc component of the chimeric protein although this chimeric molecule is dimeric only one leg of the ace-2 is able to bind to each of the three receptor binding domains of the trimer we anticipate the mass distal to the hinge region to be flexible and therefore components were blurred out in the averaging process leaving only a portion of the additional mass in the 3-d map the c-terminus of the docked ace2 is in a location consistent with this interpretation previously we modeled the putative location of the receptor-binding domain and ace2 in the cryo-em structure of the unbound spike using solely the receptor-binding domain atomic resolution data 21 in the present study we have shown that our previous prediction of the location of the receptor-binding domain was only partially correct the actual location of the receptor binding domain and ace2 are in fact shifted 29  towards the 3-fold axis corresponding to about 40 of the diameter of ace2 the results from the present study will aid in the precise location of future atomic resolution structure fragments of the sars spike as well as in the structural mapping of neutralizing antibody-binding epitopes which are in progress the coordinates of the three dimensional reconstruction of the sars spike emd-1423 and the sars spike-ace2 complex emd-1425 have been deposited in the macromolecular database httpwwwebiacukmsd our cryo-em results demonstrate that there is a structural transition of the spike that occurs upon receptor binding figure 3 movie s2 the overall height of the spike is reduced by 10  due to a shift in the mass in the s1 domain figure 3 di and the three s1 blades of the spike twist 5 along the axis of symmetry on the distal end of the spike a small blob feature is replaced by three small nubs which appear radially figure 3 fj we propose that this structural re-arrangement represents an initial priming of the spike for membrane fusion which brings the cellular and viral membranes 10  closer to each other to facilitate fusion the coronavirus s protein is known to mediate both virion-cell membrane fusion and intercellular membrane fusion 22 3033 and in the present study we have shown that purified inactivated virions are also fusion-competent we show that the addition of sars-cov virions to cultured cells that express ace-2 can induce fusion presumably from the fusion activity of spikes on virions bridging neighboring cells similar observations on the induction of fusion-from-without were made when cells surface-expressing the spike protein were mixed with cells expressing ace-2 35 the trigger that initiates membrane fusion varies amongst class i fusion proteins with some activated by receptor binding others by ph and others by redox conditions in most proposed models of membrane fusion it is postulated that the s1 domain or analogous receptor binding domains dissociate from the spike during the membrane fusion process this dynamic process was demonstrated for influenza ha by kemble et al
38 in their investigation where they engineered intermonomer disulfide bonds between the ha s1 subunits the result of this was that fusion activity was impaired however it could be restored under reducing conditions it is likely that the sars spike shares a similar mechanism and the structural changes that we have detected represent the initial step in this process by analogy with other class i viral fusion proteins we anticipate that the fusion core of the sars spike must undergo similar structural re-arrangements during fusion the receptor-binding domain is localized in a position on the distal end of the molecule closer to the 3-fold axis than anticipated yet still in a position that would not impede these structural re-arrangements putative mechanisms by which class i viral fusion proteins achieve membrane fusion have been proposed 1 4 1719 but complete structural evidence for the role of intermediate structures in these mechanisms has yet to be obtained the structural biology of this process has been best characterized for the influenza hemagglutinin and paramyxovirus fusion f protein for which the pre-fusion and membrane fusion ph structures have been determined by x-ray crystallography 4 11 12 39 40 all of the subsequent models for class i viral fusion proteins are based on the structural data of these two fusion proteins a drawback in all of these models is that they are based on recombinant ectodomains that are not proven to exist as a component in the complete molecule and they lack both membrane-interacting residues and lipids 4 the cryo-em structures presented in this investigation are of intact sars spike bound to native virion lipid envelopes the cryo-em data are very instructive when atomic resolution fragments are docked within the overall molecule especially as the entire sars spike has proven to be a difficult subject for x-ray crystallography and atomic resolution data exist for only a few fragments of the sars spike our cryo-em results show that it is possible for the spike to attach to three ace2 receptors at once this may serve to hold on to the host membrane like a tripod so as to accurately orientate the fusion core in addition the 30  gap between the axis of symmetry and ace2 provides sufficient space for fusion core rearrangement damico et al 14 demonstrated that the kinetics of binding of the rous sarcoma virus envelope protein to its receptor suggested that binding of each spike molecule to multiple receptor monomers occurred it may therefore be possible that other structurally homologous viral envelope proteins can also bind multiple receptors and this may be a general adaptation that provides the correct temporal and spatial arrangement to bring about membrane fusion the observation that the sars spike could bind three soluble ace2 receptors provides three possible binding states with one two or three membrane-bound receptors attached to the spike with one or two receptors bound the spike and virus have a wide range of movement possible whereas in the case of three bound receptors the spike and its fusion core will be arranged perpendicular to the cell surface with minimal movement possible it is interesting to note that binding three receptors is the minimum number of binding events required to achieve this perpendicular orientation in three dimensional space this observation matches up with the conserved trimeric structures of class i fusion proteins which are common amongst enveloped viruses thus indicating a possible conserved structural-functional relationship may exist another line of reasoning is that oligomerisation favors a better chance of successful receptor binding and subsequent insertion of the fusion peptide into the host membrane according to this model oligomeric multiples higher then three would be favored whereas the tripod model of receptor binding favors the conserved trimeric structures of class i viral fusion proteins in figure 3 we have we have presented the ace2sars structures as they were solved in this cryo-em investigation for other fusion proteins like influenza ha1 and hiv gp120 it has been modeled that the re-arrangements upon membrane fusion are dramatic involving a shedding of the above mentioned domains in this investigation we have detected structural movement of s1 upon ace2 binding this could represent the initial phase of this dramatic process that is followed by fusion core re-arrangement fusion peptide insertion in the host cell membrane refolding of heptad repeats and finally membrane fusion analyzing the structure of the spike-receptor complex is essential to understanding how viruses can adapt to utilize receptors from different species and how they may evolve to gain specificity for new receptor types rna viruses have a high rate of mutation and recombination 41 in sars coronaviruses the spike is able to retain specific binding affinity for the ace2 of more than one host species and rapid evolution to gain specificity for novel ace2 species has been demonstrated 42 43 the structure and large size of the spike of coronaviruses appears to be an adaptation related to utilization of large host cell-surface molecules such as ace2 as specific receptors amongst the coronavirus family specific cell surface receptors for the spike protein are all in the range of 60110 kd 44 these large host receptor molecules are in turn functionally constrained and thus conserved across species barriers in utilizing binding to a large receptor molecule it may be important that the spike s1 domain also acts as a spacer arm holding the receptor far enough away from the three-fold axis of symmetry of the spike s2 domain to permit fusion core re-arrangement and subsequent membrane fusion such a property necessitates having a large spike molecule moreover multiple receptor binding may have functional significance enhancing the binding and entry of viruses cross-linking of adjacent host receptor molecules could increase the affinity of the virus for its target cell as well as improving the kinetics of fusion the sars spike-ace2 complex is an ideal model system for the investigation of class i viral fusion protein dynamics utilizing cryo-em to investigate fusion protein binding and structural changes in the native state within virion membranes that are fusogenic the presence of a common cell fusion mechanism shared by diverse virus families holds the prospect of developing broad-spectrum anti-virals that target these conserved mechanisms as well as the potential use of these fusogenic proteins in drug delivery systems sars-cov tor3 strain was inoculated onto vero e6 cells grown in dulbeccos modified eagle medium supplemented with 10 foetal bovine serum 100 uml penicillin

microscopy 2 and 4 days post treatment for the presence of syncytia virus growth was not detected at either dilution of irradiated virus and no cytopathic effect was observed the presence of nucleic acid in syncytia was investigated by propidium iodide staining and observation by fluorescence microscopy the human ace2-fc human igg1 recombinant protein adipogen had an initial concentration of 1

matching approach 36 which incorporated three-fold symmetry into the search function and reconstruction procedure after each refinement cycle the new reference volume was either theresholded or segmented using the floodfill function in the situs software package 37 to select the spike-ace2 structure and minimize the influence of neighbouring spikes in the reference structure that was used in the subsequent iteration of the projection match alignment the initial reference model used in this procedure was the structure of the sars spike that we previously solved by cryo-electron microscopy 21 the population of spike images was composed of both side view projections as well as end-on projections with the latter being easily identified in the images with greater defocus values these high-defocusend-on images were essential to eliminate the missing cone from the reconstruction the resolution of the cryo-em reconstruction was estimated by fourier shell correlation to be 185 using the 05 fsc criteria the structures of the pre-fusion hr2 domain and the ace2-receptor-binding domain were docked into the cryo-em reconstruction using the floodfill and colores functions in the situs software package the resultant docking generated one distinct location for the ace2-receptor-binding domain which placed ace2 in the additional mass that was not present in the reconstruction of the

katarzyna janowska victoria stalls sophie gobeil megan kopp allen hsu mario borgnia rob parks barton haynes f priyamvada acharya   the ongoing global pandemic of the novel sars-cov-2 sars-2 coronavirus presents an urgent need for the development of effective preventative and treatment therapies the viral s-protein is a prime target for such therapies owing to its critical role in the virus lifecycle the s-protein is divided into two regions an n-terminal s1 domain that caps the c-terminal s2 fusion domain binding to host receptor via the receptor binding domain rbd in s1 is followed by proteolytic cleavage of the spike by host proteases1 large conformational changes in the s-protein result in s1 shedding and exposure of the fusion machinery in s2 class i fusion proteins such as the cov-2 s-protein undergo large conformational changes during the fusion process and must by necessity be highly flexible and dynamic indeed cryo-electron microscopy cryo-em structures of sars-2 spike reveal considerable flexibility and dynamics in the s1 domain12 especially around the rbd that exhibits two discrete conformational states  a down state that is shielded from receptor binding and an up state that is receptor-accessible the wealth of structural information for -cov spike proteins including the recently determined cryo-em structures of the sars-2 spike111 has provided a rich source of detailed geometric information from which to begin precise examination of the macromolecular transitions underlying triggering of this fusion machine the transmembrane cov s-protein spike trimer is composed of interwoven protomers that include an n-terminal receptor binding s1 domain and a c-terminal s2 domain that contains the fusion elements figure 1a and b2 the s1 domain is subdivided into the n-terminal domain ntd followed by the receptor binding domain rbd and two structurally conserved subdomains sd1 and sd2 together these domains cap the s2 domain protecting the conserved fusion machinery several structures of soluble ectodomain constructs that retain the complete s1 domain and the surface exposed s2 domain have been determined these include sars-213 sars48 mers49 and other human210 and murine11 -cov spike proteins these structures revealed remarkable conformational heterogeneity in the s-protein spikes especially in the rbd region within a single protomer the rbd could adopt a closed down state figure 1a in which the rbd covers the apical region of the s2 protein near the c-terminus of the first heptad repeat hr1 or an open up state in which the rbd is dissociated from the apical central axis of s2 and the ntd further cryo-em structures strongly suggest a large degree of domain flexibility in both the down and up states in the ntd and rbd while these structures have provided essential information to identify the relative arrangement of these domains the degree to which conformational heterogeneity may be altered via mutation during the natural evolution of the virus and in a vaccine immunogen design context remains to be determined in this study we have quantified the variability in the s1 and s2 geometric arrangements to reveal important regions of flexibility to consider and to target for structure-based immunogen design based on these analyses we have designed mutations that alter the conformational distribution of the domains in the s-protein we visualized the effect of our designs using a structural determination pipeline relying first on single particle analysis by negative stain electron microscopy nsem for rapid and low-cost assessment of the spike ectodomains at low resolution followed by cryo-em for high-resolution information on the changes introduced by these mutations our results reveal a heterogeneous conformational landscape of the sars-cov-2 spike that is highly susceptible to modification by the introduction of mutations at sites of contact between the s1 and s2 domains we also present data on modified sars-2 ectodomain constructs stabilized in conformations that have not yet been seen in the current available structures with great interest and direct application in vaccine design to characterize the unique arrangement of distinct domains in the -cov spike we first aimed to develop a precise quantitative definition of their relative positions examination of available sars and mers s-protein structures revealed 1 the ntd and rbd subdomains and internal s2 domain move as rigid bodies and 2 these domains display a remarkable array of relative shifts between the domains in the s1 region and the s2 regions -sheet motif and connector domain cd figure 1bf in order to quantify these movements we have analyzed the relevant regions of motion and their structural disposition in all available -cov ectodomain spike structures including 15 sars4578 10 mers412 a hku1210 an oc43210 a murine -cov and three sars-21314 structures figures 1ef and 2 each protomer in those structures displaying asymmetric updown rbd states was examined independently yielding a dataset of 76 structural states the ntd was split into a primary n-terminal section and a secondary c-terminal section based upon visual inspection of this region in the various -cov structures figures 1bc and 2 we next analyzed s-protein geometry using a vector-based approach specifically vectors connecting each regions c centroids were generated and used to define the relative dispositions of the domains figure 1c and 2 the vector magnitudes and select angles and dihedrals were used to identify the breadth of differences in domain positioning and compare between strains the results indicated that -cov spike proteins in various strains differ markedly from one another and that considerable variability in the domain arrangements within strains exists especially in the sars ectodomains figures 1ef and 2ah in particular both 1 and 1 figure 2ab describing the angle between the sd2 to sd1 and sd1 to rbd vectors as well as the sd1 to rbd dihedral respectively effectively report on the up and down configurations while indicating substantial differences between sars and mers in both the up and down states the angular disposition of the ntd elements further indicated differences in sars and mers with a particularly marked shift from the examined -cov spikes in the murine structure figure 1e additional s1 differences are observed between vectors involving sd2 the disposition of the s2 domain relative to s1 defined by the dihedral about the vector connecting sd2 to the s2 cd differs markedly between merssars-2 and sars as well with the angle between the vectors connecting the ntd to sd2 and sd2 to the cd demonstrating a shift in sars-2 finally the disposition of the cd to the inner portion of s2 measured as an angle between a vector connected to an interior s2 -sheet motif and the vector connecting the cd to sd2 indicates sars differs from both mers and sars-2 interestingly the mers disposition appears to respond to rbd triggering displaying a bimodal distribution these results demonstrate that while the individual domain architectures and overall arrangements are conserved figure 1d important differences between these domains exists between strains suggesting that subtle differences in inter-domain contacts could play a major role in determining these distributions and thereby alter surface antigenicity and the propensity of the domains to access up and down rbd states based on the observed variability in the geometric analysis of -cov spikes we asked whether the propensity for the rbd to display the down and up states could be modified via mutations without altering exposed antigenic surfaces to this end we identified protomer to protomer interactive sites amenable to modification and down selected mutations at these sites using the schrdinger biologics suite383940 in an effort to eliminate exposure of the receptor binding site of the rbd we examined the potential for disulfide linkages between the rbd and its contact with s2 near the c-terminus of hr1 to prevent rbd exposure we identified a double cysteine mutant s383c and d985c rbd to s2 double mutant rs2d supplemental figure s1 as a candidate for achieving this goal the transition from the down state to the up state involves shifts in the rbd to ntd contacts therefore in an effort to prevent these shifts we identified a site in an rbd groove adjacent to the ntd for which we prepared a triple mutant d398l s514l and e516l rbd to ntd triple mutant rnt supplemental figure s1 as sd1 acts as a hinge point for the rbd updown transitions figures 1ac 2ij we hypothesized that enhanced hydrophobicity at the sd1 to s2 interface might shift the position of sd1 thus influencing the hinge and potentially the propensity for rbd triggering a double mutant n866i and a570l subdomain 1 to s2 double mutant u1s2d supplemental figure s1 as well as quadruple mutant a570l t572i f855y and n856i subdomain 1 to s2 quadruple mutant u1s2q were identified for this purpose finally we asked whether linking sd2 to s2 would alter the conformational distribution of the rbds the double cysteine mutant g669c and t866c subdomain 1 to s2 double mutant u2s2d supplemental figure s1 was identified for this purpose these mutants were prepared in the context of a previously published sars-2 ectodomain construct3 to assess the quality of the purified spike proteins and to obtain low resolution visualization of the structures we performed nsem analysis the micrographs showed a reasonably uniform distribution of particles consistent with the size and shape of the sars-2 spike ectodomain figure 3 2d class averages showed spike populations with well resolved domain features the data were subjected to 3d-classification followed by homogeneous refinement the unmutated construct was resolved into two classes of roughly equal proportions the two classes differed in the position of their rbd domains one class displayed all three rbds in their down positions whereas the other class displayed one rbd in the up position this was consistent with published cryo-em results15 that described a 11 ratio between the down and 1-up states of the sars-2 spike ectodomain the mutant spikes were analyzed using a similar workflow as the unmutated spike all of the mutants displayed well-formed spikes in the micrographs as well as in the 2d class averages following 3d classification for the rs2d construct we observed only the down conformation the 1-rbd up state that was seen for the unmutated spike was not found in this dataset the u1s2q mutant presented another striking finding where we observed a new conformational state with 2 rbds in the up position the 2-rbd up state has been reported before for the mers cov spike ectodomain12 but has not been observed thus far for either the sars or the sars-2 spikes based on the nsem analysis we selected the rs2d and u1s2q constructs for high resolution analysis by cryo-em to visualize the mutations and their effect on the structure of the spike we collected cryo-em datasets for the rs2d and u1s2q constructs figure 47 table 1 supplemental figures s2 and s3 consistent with what was observed in the nsem analysis after multiple rounds of 2d and 3d-classification to remove junk particles and broken andor misfolded spikes we found a population of down state spike in the rs2d dataset through ab initio classification in cryosparc we then implemented additional exhaustive ab initio classifications as well as heterogeneous classifications using low-pass filtered maps of known open conformations of cov spikes to search for open state spikes in the dataset we were unable to find any such states confirming that the sars-2 spike was locked in its down conformation in the rs2d mutant the rs2d disulfide-linked density at the mutation site confirmed disulfide formation in the double mutant rs2d figure 5 comparison of the domain arrangements of this construct with that of the unmutated down closed state structure indicated the protein structure was otherwise unperturbed supplemental figure s4a in contrast to the rs2d design the u1s2q design displayed widespread rearrangement of the s1 domains supplemental figure s1b in the down state structure density in the mutated s2 position remained in the configuration observed in the unmutated construct with the n855i and f856y residue loop in close proximity the s2 residue l966 and s1 residue p589 this suggested these mutations had little impact on the observed shifts however the s2-interactive sd1 displayed a rigid body movement relative to both the rs2d and unmutated constructs with 1 and 3 displacements of 34 and 18 respectively figure 5a and b this resulted in displacement of the a570lt572i containing loop from the unmutated position which resides near the s2 l966 residue figure 5b and supplemental figure s1c the s2 contact disruption is accompanied by an angular shift of the ntd away from the primary trimer axis owing to sd1 to ntd contacts yielding 3 and 3 shifts of 54 and 77 respectively figure 6c the subdomain rearrangement impacts the positioning of the rbd with only a minor shift in the 1 dihedral of 01 indicating the rbd moved with sd1 indicated in the 13 shifts the newly acquired arrangement in both the rbd and ntd was further accompanied by an apparent increase in their flexibility suggesting conformational heterogeneity these down state shifts were observed in both the single rbd up structure and the two rbd up structures figure 6 interestingly the extent to which the sd1 shift differed from that observed in the unmutated construct was context dependent in the 1 rbd up state while the down state rbd in contact with the up state rbd displayed the large shift in position observed in the all down state the down state rbd with its terminal position free displayed an intermediate sd1 configuration the up state rbd in the u1s2q construct resided largely in the position occupied in the unmutated construct this indicated the effect of the mutations was primarily isolated to the down state and suggested these mutations act to destabilize the down state rather than to stabilize the up state these features were largely recapitulated in the u1s2q 2 rbd up state conformation with subdomain 1 retaining the shift in the down state rbd figure 7 the structural details presented here indicate that while locking the down state rbd into its unmutated position had little impact on the overall configuration of s1 altering the disposition of sd1 had wide ranging impacts consistent with the observed strain-to-strain differences in the geometric analysis described in figures 1 and 2 conformational plasticity is a hallmark of enveloped-virus fusion-protein structure owing to the necessity of protecting the conserved viral fusion elements from host immune responses while retaining a sufficiently steep free-energy gradient to enable host cell fusion16 exposed elements are generally well conditioned to be permissive and responsive to mutations through genetic drift and host immune adaptation conformational plasticity however presents an important difficulty in the context of vaccine and drug design indeed lessons learned in the continued effort to produce a broadly protective hiv-1 vaccine have demonstrated the importance of a detailed understanding and control of fusion protein dynamics1728 the novel sars-cov-2 is likely no exception in this regard and indeed the conformational plasticity of the sars-2 s-protein appeared greater than that of the hiv-1 env we aimed to develop a quantitative understanding of -cov structural states between strains and within each rbd down and up state configuration the wide breadth of domain arrangements along with the relatively small contact area between the s1 and s2 subunits observed here suggested that despite a relatively low mutation rate dramatic changes in s-protein structure may occur from few mutations indeed recent evidence for a mutation in the sd2 to s2 contact region suggests a potential fitness gain for acquisition of such interfacial residues29 based upon our results this mutant d614g may indeed alter the conformational landscape of the sars-cov-2 s-protein from the perspective of immunogen development the constructs developed here present an opportunity to examine the ability of differentially stabilized s-protein particles to induce two different yet important antibody responses first the disulfide-linked down state locked double mutant rs2d would presumably eliminate receptor binding site targeting antibodies which make up the majority of observed responses3031 indeed a study of mers responses suggests non-rbd responses particularly ntd and s2 epitopes will play an important role in vaccine induced protection32 from a theoretical perspective the wide control over the rbd updown distribution available to the virus suggests that by analogy to known difficult to neutralize hiv-1 strains conformational blocking of antibody responses would not be unusual although this may result in a fitness cost to the virus it would not necessarily make the virion non-infectious using the double mutant rs2d as an immunogen provides a platform from which to induce such non-rbd responses that may be needed to protect against such an evasion the second area of interest concerns cryptic pocket targeting antibodies which have proven effective in the neutralization of sars these antibodies target an epitope presented only in the up state rbds and appear to require a two rbd up configuration33 the current stabilized ectodomain construct in wide use in sars-cov-2 clinical trials was demonstrated previously and recapitulated here by nsem to display only the down and one rbd up states however the u1s2q sd1s2 targeting design developed here display a prominent two rbd up state distribution compatible with these cryptic-epitope targeting mabs this suggests it is capable of inducing such antibodies while complicating factors such as a potential for vaccine enhancement may favor the use of truncated single domain constructs which may display fewer potentially weakly or non-neutralizing epitopes these along with the designs presented here will allow for a detailed characterization of not only vaccine immunogenicity but also antigenicity paving the way for next generation vaccines for the novel sars-cov-2 and the eventual development of a broadly neutralizing -cov vaccine thus while the previous generation of stabilizing mutations ensure well folded trimer the rational design approach developed here provides a means by which precisely

challenging global health and sanitation concern of the twenty-first
century with 6663304 confirmed cases of infected and 392802 confirmed
fatalities world health organization updated on june 6th 20201 moreover this pandemic has caused a widespread
lockdown affecting more than 1 in 2 individuals in the world the virus responsible for covid-19 sars-cov-2 emerged in late 2019 in the
region of wuhan china2 sars-cov-2 belongs to the family
coronaviridae which is characterized by large
enveloped positive-stranded rna viruses that can potentially cause
gastrointestinal nervous system and respiratory distress3 this family also includes sars-cov and mers-cov4 which despite several similarities present some
interesting differences from sars-cov245 sars-cov-2 mers-cov and sars-cov use an envelope protein termed the spike
s protein to gain access to host cells46 the s protein displays
the highest degree of genetic variability in the virus genome6 additionally the sars-cov-2 s protein exhibits a greater
affinity for the ace2 receptor with respect to analogs in sars-cov and
mers-cov78 the sars-cov-2 s protein shares a 962 sequence
similarity with the bat sars-like ratg13 s protein indicating the natural
origin of the virus59 due to its crucial role in the very first stage of viral infection several
studies71014
point to the s protein as an elective target to develop coronaviruses
therapies and vaccines the s protein is also the main target of
neutralizing antibodies1517 the s protein belongs to the viral fusion class i proteins7
has a trimeric crown-like shape protrudes from the virus envelope and
targets diverse host cell receptors in different species see table 1 in ref
4 both sars and sars-like
mers and sars-cov-2 coronaviruses target the angiotensin-converting-enzyme
2 ace2 present in pneumocytes and enterocytes in the respiratory system
and other susceptible cells eg intestinal mucosal renal tubular
epithelial cerebral neurons and immune cells18 the
s-ace2 interaction occurs at the very first stage of viral entry to initiate
viral fusion with the host cell1920 the hallmark of sars-cov-2 is that
its s protein is optimized for ace2 binding9 the s protein comprises two subunits termed s1 and s2 which are cleaved
during the first stage of viral infection the s1 subunit is responsible for
the interaction of the s protein with the host receptor ace2 while s2
promotes viral fusion21 the receptor binding domain
rbd resides between residues 318 and 51322 in
sars-cov-2 and 318 and 510 in sars-cov13 the development of therapeutics targeting the s-ace2 complex requires a
comprehensive study of this complex interface and its associated
dynamics23 thus investigating the allosteric
nature of the s-ace2 complex will help to understand and quantify the extent
by which the s protein binds to ace2 and therefore the molecular basis of
virus infectivity the identification of allosteric modulation regions amrs allows for the
design and testing of allosteric drugs ie drugs targeting a different
site from the complex interface with enhanced bioactivity with respect to
orthosteric drugs targeting the proteinprotein interaction
interface24 which are often tightly packed and
scarcely accessible the field of allosteric drugs is a rapidly developing
field in drug discovery and may play a crucial role in the therapeutic
strategy for sars-cov-22528 in this study we adopted a multifaceted computational approach to identify
promising druggable allosteric sites of viral s protein we
first applied the method of protein contact networks pcns to the s-ace2
complex in sars-cov-2 and sars-cov in previous studies we adopted this
method to investigate both proteinprotein
interactions2931 and the allosteric nature of
binding3233 in this work the application of pcns clearly highlighted a region in the
sars-cov and sars-cov-2 s protein which acts as the putative
locus for allosteric modulation amr amr was
further investigated in terms of its relevance in the stability of the
complex and ability to transmit modulating signals to the binding site by
means of independent computational approaches specifically we adopted a monomer-based approach34 which
can predict the affinity of the s protein to its ligand in this step the
ensembles for the ground state of the structures have been produced using
the anisotropic network model anm approach35 moreover
we adopted an unsupervised blind procedure to predict possible interaction
sites on s proteins and their affinities for tentative partners using a
softness-based prediction of intersubunits affinity sepas in addition
the dynamical difference in rbd between the s proteins of the two virus
strains suggested that they may have different binding and allosteric
properties we also provided biophysical evidence based on the elastic network modeling
enm approach combined with perturbation-response scanning prs36 that amrs in both viruses acted as a mediator of
intermolecular allostery between the s protein and ace2 the three
methods converged in allosteric character for residues in amr in both
complexes this allowed us to state that residues in amr for sars-cov-2 amr
are more susceptible to allosteric drug targeting than for sars-cov a recent study37 suggested that the many residues in the amr
may be one of the most efficient epitopes for antibody recognition preliminary docking studies individuated some molecules that bind to amr
hepcidin which were independently shown to exhibit strong sequence
similarities with the amr38 purposed software was used to transform the full structural information
in the pdb files into a protein contact network pcn the network
nodes are the amino acid residues represented by -carbons
links between nodes residues exist if the mutual distance of the
residues centered on -carbons were in the range between 4 and
8  thus including only significant 8  noncovalent
4  bonds while discarding obliged
contacts due to proximity along the sequence the adjacency matrix a mathematically represented the pcn in
terms of undirected unweighted network and is defined
as1the topological role of nodes
residues addressed the functional role at the corresponding
residues based on the value of network descriptors the method is
widely discussed elsewhere41 the basic network descriptor was the node degree
ki defined
as2to detect allosteric sites and more
generally the functional regions activating upon binding we adopted
a method based on network spectral clustering4243
spectral clustering was based on the laplacian matrix spectral
decomposition where the laplacian matrix l is defined
as3where d is the degree
matrix ie a diagonal matrix whose diagonal is the degree
vector the spectral clustering was based on the eigenvalue decomposition of
laplacian l the sign of the fiedler vector the
eigenvector corresponding to the second minor eigenvalue was used for
binary partition each network was parted into two clusters which in
turn could be parted into four and so on as outlined in refs
43 and
44 we previously
demonstrated that network clusters group of residues correspond to
functional regions in the protein43 once network nodes again protein residues were parted into the given
number of clusters an independent user-defined parameter for the
clustering software it was possible to define the participation
coefficient
p4where
ksi is the
degree of the ith residue computed in the cluster it
belongs ie accounting only for links with nodes pertaining to the
same cluster this network descriptor has been demonstrated to represent the functional
role of residues in binding and stability33414345 residues with a
high p value are responsible for the communication
between clusters functional regions and are thus addressed via the
role in allosteric communication46 in this study
the participation coefficient maps were projected onto ribbon protein

a prs analysis based on gnm by constructing the inverse laplacian

in response to the application of a perturbation a n-dimensional
force vector f obeys hookes law f

network one residue at a time and f for other
residues not being perturbed equal to zero thus the force exerted

mobile residues that underwent allosteric structural change because the crystallized structure presented one snapshot of the protein
dynamic life at the bottom of a potential well we created a
trajectory of protein dynamics in its ground state by setting the rmsd
cutoff to 5  using the anm3647 approach
implemented in prody49 to predict the most
possible protein binding patches pbps on spike proteins we utilized
ispred to predict the interface residues50 the
ispred-predicted interface residues acted as a seed to create a
possible pbp based on the procedure as previously described34 the predictions of monomer-based affinities based
on the mechanical softness of pbps were performed by utilizing sepas
ver 134 we introduced ala mutations into the
covid-spike using foldx suite51 we computed the general interface properties of the spikeace2 complex
using pisa software52 specifically the interface
area sint and the energy gain upon the
interface formation gint figure 1 reports the cluster
partition 2 clusters of the sars-cov sace2 complex figure 1b the chains are
also shown to highlight which chains participate in the two clusters
figure 1a the interface between the fusion peptide and the ace2 ectodomain was so
strong in terms of number of contacts between viral and host
proteins that the clustering partition algorithm recognized the
fusionace2 region as a single cluster even though it comprised
sequences belonging to different chains the map of the participation coefficient projected onto the ribbon
structure of the sars-covace2 complex figure 1c shows an active region
p  0 in the junction between the fusion
peptide and the trimeric bulk phase of the spike protein active
residues are shown more in greater detail in red in figure 1d as previously demonstrated
the participation coefficient describes the attitude of residues
toward participating in the intercommunication between clusters thus
it was a putative score of the involvement of the residues in
allosteric communication therefore this region was a good candidate
to intervene in the allosteric regulation of complex formation and
there was value in investigating allosteric drugs that target this
portion of the protein figure 2 refers to the analogous
analysis for the sars-cov2 sace2 complex a similar active region appeared at the junction of the fusion peptide to
the body of the spike protein however the active region in the sars
cov sace2 was more compact than that of sars-cov2 sace2 active
regions in both complexes were characterized by two -sheets and
unfolded traits and could thus be targeted to peptides due to
flexibility of the region and absence of a pocket to bind small
organic molecules53 table 1 reports the values of
the participation coefficient p in residues with
p  0 all of which were located in the
chain carrying the fusion peptides of the sars-cov sace2 chain b in
cyan in figure 1a and
sars-cov2 sace2 chain c in magenta in figure 1a complexes the sars cov sace2 and sars-cov2 sace2 complexes accounted for 21 and
22 active residues respectively the average value was similar for
the two distributions 047 for sars cov sace2 048 for sars-cov2
sace2 however the absolute values of higher p
residues 06 were higher for covid19 sace2 indicative of a
corresponding larger reactivity of the active region table 2 reports the properties
of interface sace2 in the two complexes the interface area and the
absolute value of energy of the sars cov sace2 complex were higher
than the corresponding area for the sars-cov-2 sace2 complex
however the specific values for the unit area and single residues
were higher for sars-cov-2 sace2 indicating a more efficient yet
less stable interface this implied an optimized complex formation with the ace2 of sars-cov-2
as observed in ref 9 this
helped to explain the more rapid kinetics of infection mediated by a
faster complex formation with main receptor ace2 the rbds for the two proteins are reported as a wide peptide which
comprised approximately 200 residues for both structures however a
more limited core region termed the receptor binding motif rbm was
claimed to actively participate in the complex formation of the spike
protein with its receptor ace2 we independently identified the
residues in the spike protein for sars-cov and sars-cov2 using the
method of pcns the position and the value of the interchain degree
are reported in table 3 for
both complexes the two residues in the two structures with the
highest value of interface degree were 488g in sars-cov and 502g in
sars-cov-2 respectively these two residues could be considered the hotspots of the ppi interface
in the sace2 complex both are glycine residues likely due to the
high steric adaptability of the small glycine residues in the most
tightly packed region of the s-ace2 interface this confirmed the high
density of the interface and its extremely scarce accessibility to
small molecules targeting the region which also suggested the need to
interfere with the sace2 interface through allosteric regulation in the previous sections the amrs of the sace2 complexes have been
identified for sars-cov-2 and sars-cov using the pcns approach table 1 the amr is
accessible for binding which is at odds with the pbd one critical property of the protein complexes was the intersubunit
affinity therefore besides the sace2 stability we predicted the
affinity between the amr and incoming-designed molecule peptide
molecules which will be designed to affect the function of amr this was a crucial step that will provide an independent proof-of-concept
of both the allosteric features of amr by definition an allosteric
site must sense the microenvironment and the
druggability of the predicted amr we reviewed the need for complete 3d knowledge of the sace2 complex by
means of a recently introduced method to predict the intersubunit
affinity of protein complexes using protein binding patch pbp on a
single subunit by computing the pbp mechanical
softness3454 to alleviate the static presentation of the protein structure in a
crystallized state we created ensembles of protein complexes in their
ground state using the anm approach in the first step we predicted
the affinity of the sars-cov-2 and sars-cov s proteins for ace2 we compared the predicted affinity between the s protein and ace2 when
the s protein was in its monomeric or trimeric state to obtain some
hints about the effect of adjacent subunits on the affinity between
spike and its ligand figure 3 subunits chains are denoted as sa sb and sc to manage the potential states of the spike protein we propose different
forms of pbps on the s proteinthe sa subunit is alone and waiting
for its partner left column figure 3 we suppose
that sa may interact with ace2 using pbps similar to
those in the ensemble of sace2 in its dimeric state
the first row figure 3 or by using pbps similar to
ones sa displays in the trimer spike and ace2
ensemble second row figure 3subunit sa
finds ace2 and binds it directly right column
figure 3 sa binds to ace2 via the pbps that it
displays either when no sb subunit is available
the first row figure 3 or in association with sb
monomers second row figure 3our
computations suggested that sars-cov-2 sa dark blue curves figure 3 was more sensitive
to the presence of the sb subunit than sars-cov sa red curves figure 3 this result
suggested approaches that potentially disrupted the sa-sb association
may provide an efficient therapeutic route we observed a higher affinity between s and ace2 in sars-cov-2 in
sars-cov this observation may explain the higher infectivity of
sars-cov-2 we are interested in predicting the affinities between possible pbps on
spike proteins and tentative protein partners in this case we did
not know the pbps on spike proteins because we did not have the
resolved 3d structures of all possible protein complexes between the
spike protein and other natural or synthesized partners we predicted
the seed interface residues on the spike surface using the ispred
approach50 by expanding the selection radius
for defining the pbp region34 many possible pbps
were generated for both sars-cov-2 and sars-cov spike proteins using
sepas the affinities between the generated pbps and unknown partners
were predicted the affinities averaged over the whole are presented in figure 4a and b for sars-cov-2 and
sars-cov spikes respectively the average affinities mapped on the
surface of the spike proteins are reported in supporting information figures 1 and 2 some of the
predicted regions with an affinity  5 kcalmol resided in
the interface region of the spike subunits there were some residues
in the proposed pbps that belonged to amr indicated as red triangles
in figure 4 this meant that
amr could act as a distinct pbp for some partners suggesting that
targeting amr may be a good choice for drug design thus in considering amr as distinct pbp we were able to1predict the
affinities between amr and unknown drug-like protein
partners simply by using a 3d structure of amr on
the spike subunit in different ensembles monomer

for the effect of ace2 binding on amr affinity for

the condition of a trimer spike and ace2 in terms of
a holo-complex sace2 complex case
abcd in figure
5a these results indicated that the amr of sars-cov-2 spike exhibited a
higher affinity for generic peptides than the amr of sars-cov spike
interestingly the affinity of amr for their partners was increased
upon binding to ace2 which suggested an interplay between the two
distant regions the ace2-binding site of spike and amr this last
result could be considered to be another proof-of-concept of the
allosteric character of the amr to further investigate the effect of the induced structural perturbation
in amr on the binding affinity of the spike protein to ace2 we
introduced two sets of ala mutations in amr in one set the amr
residues that play a major role in allosteric modulation
p  05 in table 1 were mutated to ala and in the other
set all residues of amr on sars-cov-2 sa were mutated to ala to simulate an sa perturbation we used the ensemble of structures
generated using the anm approach after setting the rmsd cutoff to 8
 for selecting normal mode states such global perturbation only
distorts the ace2-binding site of sa to less than 15  in figure 5b we reported that
wild-type sa exhibits a shoulder in its affinity density curve at a
high affinity region our observations suggested that the structural
perturbation of amr due to the ala mutation of native residues
decreased the affinity of sa for ace2 this was further confirmation
of the allosteric properties of the amr in order to explore amr druggability we started by recognizing the
strict structural similarity of the amr region with hepcidin a
crucial protein for iron regulation moreover a recent preprint
reported a distant albeit relevant sequence similarity between
hepcidin and the sars-cov-2 spike protein38 it has
been established that there was some proof of the similarity between
the hydrophobicity spectra of ligandreceptor pairs which
fostered the observed sequence similarity between hepcidin and the
sars-cov-2 s-protein5556 moreover hepcidin is strictly involved in interleukin 6 il-6
regulation57 given that il-6 is the main
actor associated with the cytokine storm that is
linked to fatalities provoked by sars-cov-2 infection58 a preliminary docking analysis showed a perfect
fit between hepcidin and the amr region however this now must only
be considered as a first step with which to prioritize different
peptides as allosteric effectors in addition to the characterization of the sace2 interface a comparison
of rbd dynamics between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 was also important to
understand the functional mechanism of the sace2 interaction to this
aim the overlapping values between the slowest anm modes
eigenvectors were calculated to compare the intrinsic dynamics of
rbds in both s proteins eq 8
in materials and methods in figure 6a the dot products overlap
values were plotted in the map for the rbds in sars-cov versus
sars-cov-2 for the first 10 anm modes in this map the upper limit of
1 indicated a perfect overlap red correspondent to a perfectly
shared dynamics while 0 indicated no overlap blue indicating that
they showed independent dynamics although rbds in the two complexes
showed very high structural similarity with an rmsd of 068 
the overlap between the first 10 anm modes of two rbds exhibited some
differences overlap values with 06 for the first three modes
indicated a weaker dynamical overlap even at the lowest frequencies
which were those endowed with most important functional meaning to further understand the relative motions and dynamics of the interface
structures the anm motions of the first mode for two rbds are shown
in figure 6b and c in anm 1
most of the interfacial residues were very stable blue while the
peripheral loop exhibited the highest fluctuation red the most
relevant dynamical difference between the two systems referred to this
loop motion for sars-cov rbd the highest fluctuations point to
residues 463d and 465 k while the sars-cov-2 rbd displayed higher
flexibilities at 476g to 479p orange beads this loop was found to
be located at the c terminal of the 1 helix of the rbd
interacting with ace2 through van der waals forces hereinafter
referred to as an interfacial c loop we suppose that
the difference in the dynamics of such an interfacial c loop may be
caused by the amino acid mutations in their respective interfaces with
ace2 ie 442y to 455l 443l to f 460f to 473y and 479n to 493q
from sars-cov-rbd to sars-cov-2-rbd59 thus we
further mapped these interfacial mutations onto the structures yellow
beads thus the lower fluctuations of these mutations in
sars-cov-2-rbd may account for the higher affinity of such
interface accordingly despite the overall structural similarity rbds in the two s
proteins showed different dynamics especially for the s-ace2
interfaces these differences in dynamics may also indicate that these
two s-ace2 interfaces achieved their activities including substrate
binding and allosteric regulation we performed perturbation response scanning prs based on gnm to
quantify the allosteric properties of amrs and identify the key
residues for which perturbation provokes structural dynamical changes
at a long distance first the prs map provided information regarding
the sensitivity and effectiveness of a given residue in transmitting
signals the column of the matrix corresponding to a single residue
eg for r313v described how well-connected that residue was within
the amr region and its likely relevance in transmitting allosteric
signals to distal parts of the s-ace2 complex here we adapted this method to probe the allosteric response of the amr
region upon perturbation on residues with p  05
from the pcn prediction table 1 for the sace2 complex in sars-cov the dynamical changes of the other
residues in amr red arrows in figure 7a have been caught due to their close
distance in space in addition all amr residues have allosteric
effects on the interfacial c loop with high fluctuation because the
effectiveness of the three residues with p  05
was almost identical we only reported in figure
7a for the case of the
perturbation of 568s that had the highest p value
064 it is appreciated that three residues 313v 529n and 568s
displayed long-range allosteric effects on some particular regions in
ace2 through the sace interface the residues relative to the amr in
sars-cov-2 could be classified into three types according to their
allosteric character the first class included most residues including 320q 321p 322t 323e
539n 548t and 578p upon perturbation these residues exerted a
moderate dynamical effect on other amr residues and a relatively weak
but sensible intramolecular allosteric effect on residues of the
sace2 interface especially on the highly flexible c loop the
perturbation of these amr residues largely affected the dynamics of
ace2 through stronger long-range allosteric communications the perturbation of the second type of 531n and 532l residues provokes
a large intermolecular allosteric effect in the rbd including some
peaks at the interfacial c loop figure 7c in addition the perturbation
weakened the intermolecular communications from amr to ace2 the last type only included 580t which exhibited similar dynamical
effects on three regions amr rbd and ace2 via long-range
communications accordingly our prs analysis provided important insight into amr
allostery among other findings 3 residues in sars-cov amr and 10
residues in sars-cov-2 amr were predicted to have wide-ranging
allosteric effects on the ace2 protein this result in conjunction
with the statistically significant higher effectiveness of the
sars-cov-2 amr perturbation si figure 3
suggested that its allosteric character was stronger than that of amr
in sars-cov notably in both complexes the interfacial c loop formed
a bridge to transmit the signal from amr to ace2 the reported
rbd-ace2 interfacial mutations from sars-cov to sars-cov-2 were close
to the interfacial c loop therefore we propose that the different
allosteric properties of amr residues were due to mutations in the
s-ace2 interface in figure s3 the box plot shows that amr in
sars-cov-2 had a statistically higher effectiveness than that of
sars-cov under the p-value of 74 
105 by wilcoxon signed-ranked test the application of pcns sepas affinity by flexibility and prs based on
elastic network modes to two complexes of the spike protein with its
receptor ace2 generated highly consistent results the integrated
computational approach disclosed active zones in the sars-cov and sars-cov2
complexes with the ace2 ectodomain these active zones as demonstrated in
previous studies416061 and in the present
research by the convergence among different approaches have an extremely
high probability of acting as allosteric sites which can modulate
spikeace2 protein binding these regions are worthy of further investigation from the perspective of drug
or vaccine development as indicated by a preliminary docking simulation
from a methodological perspective our results highlighted the need to
identify convergence of different simulation methods arising from
independent theoretical premises in order to obtain a reliable picture of
the associated biomolecular systems  analysis of therapeutic targets for sars-cov-2 and discovery of potential drugs by computational methods canrong wu yang liu yueying yang peng zhang wu zhong yali wang qiqi wang yang xu mingxue li xingzhou li mengzhu zheng lixia chen hua li   coronaviruses covs have caused a major outbreak of human fatal pneumonia since the beginning of the 21st century severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov broke out and spread to five continents in 2003 with a lethal rate of 101

2 the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov broke out in the arabian peninsula in 2012 with a fatality rate of 353

4 both sars-cov and mers-cov are zoonotic viruses and their hosts are batcivet and dromedary respectively5

6 to date no specific therapeutic drug or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of human coronavirus therefore covs are considered to be a kind of viruses of which the outbreak poses a huge threat to humans because wuhan viral pneumonia cases were discovered at the end of 2019 the coronavirus was named as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-ncov by the world health organization who on january 12 20207

8 since 2019-ncov is highly homologous with sars-cov it is considered a close relative of sars-cov the international virus classification commission ictv classified 2019-ncov as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 on february 11 2020 at the same time who named the disease caused by 2019-ncov as covid-19 common symptoms of a person infected with coronavirus include respiratory symptoms fever cough shortness of breath and dyspnea in more severe cases infection can cause pneumonia severe acute respiratory syndrome kidney failure and even death there is currently no specific medicine or treatment for diseases caused by sars-cov-29 covs are enveloped viruses with a positive rna genome belonging to the coronaviridae family of the order nidovirales which are divided into four genera    and  the sars-cov-2 belongs to the  genus covs contain at least four structural proteins spike s protein envelope e protein membrane m protein and nucleocapsid n protein10 among them spike promotes host attachment and viruscell membrane fusion during virus infection therefore spike determines to some extent the host range potential anti-coronavirus therapies can be divided into two categories depending on the target one is acting on the human immune system or human cells and the other is on coronavirus itself in terms of the human immune system the innate immune system response plays an important role in controlling the replication and infection of coronavirus and interferon is expected to enhance the immune response11 blocking the signal pathways of human cells required for virus replication may show a certain anti-viral effect in addition viruses often bind to receptor proteins on the surface of cells in order to entering human cells for example the sars virus binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor12 13 14 and the mers binds to the dpp4 receptor15

16 the therapies acting on the coronavirus itself include preventing the synthesis of viral rna through acting on the genetic material of the virus inhibiting virus replication through acting on critical enzymes of virus and blocking the virus binding to human cell receptors or inhibiting the viruss self-assembly process through acting on some structural proteins in the fight against coronavirus scientists have come up with three strategies for developing new drugs17 the first strategy is to test existing broad-spectrum anti-virals18 interferons ribavirin and cyclophilin inhibitors used to treat coronavirus pneumonia fall into this category the advantages of these therapies are that their metabolic characteristics dosages used potential efficacy and side effects are clear as they have been approved for treating viral infections but the disadvantage is that these therapies are too broad-spectrum and cannot kill coronaviruses in a targeted manner and their side effects should not be underestimated the second strategy is to use existing molecular databases to screen for molecules that may have therapeutic effect on coronavirus19

20 high-throughput screening makes this strategy possible and new functions of many drug molecules can be found through this strategy for example the discovery of anti-hiv infection drug lopinavirritonavir the third strategy is directly based on the genomic information and pathological characteristics of different coronaviruses to develop new targeted drugs from scratch theoretically the drugs found through these therapies would exhibit better anti-coronavirus effects but the research procedure of new drug might cost several years or even more than 10 years11 for the development of medicines treating sars-cov-2 the fastest way is to find potential molecules from the marketed drugs once the efficacy is determined it can be approved by the green channel or approved by the hospital ethics committee for rapid clinical treatment of patients herein bioinformatics analysis on the proteins encoded by the novel coronavirus genes was systematically conducted and the proteins of sars-cov-2 were compared with other coronaviruses such as sars-cov and mers-cov we conducted homology modeling to build all possible protein structures including viral papain like protease plpro main protease 3clpro also named 3-chymotrypsin-like protease rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp helicase spike etc further we used these proteins and human relative proteins human ace2 and type-ii

wuhan-hu-1 was aligned with whole database using blastn to search for homology viral genomes after phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignment of 23 coronaviruses from various species we found three coronaviruses from bat 96 88 and 88 for bat-cov ratg13 bat-sl-covzxc12 and bat-sl-covzc45 respectively have the highest genome sequence identity to sars-cov-2 fig 1
a moreover as shown in fig 1b bat-cov ratg13 exhibited the closest linkage with sars-cov-2 these phylogenetic evidences suggest that sars-cov-2 may be evolved from bat covs especially ratg13 among all coronaviruses from human sars-cov 80 exhibited the highest genome sequence identity to sars-cov-2 and mersisolate nl13845 also has 50 identity with sars-cov-2 sars-cov is the most clearly studied one among all these viruses according to previous literatures structure and function of its most genome encoded proteins have been elucidated in recent years in this study because of high genome identity between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov the structure and function prediction of sars-cov-2 genome encoded protein were mainly based on those researches on homology protein in sars-cov sars-cov-2 genome has 10 open reading frames fig 2
a orf1ab encodes replicase polyprotein 1ab after cleaved by two proteases replicase proteins showed multifunction involved in transcription and replication of viral rnas orf2-10 encodes viral structural proteins such as s m n and e proteins and other auxiliary proteins the s m e proteins are involved in the formation of the viral coat and the n protein is involved in the packaging of the rna genome fig 2c by aligning with the amino acid sequence of sars pp1ab and analyzing the characteristics of restriction cleavage sites recognized by 3clpro and plpro we speculated 14 specific proteolytic sites of 3clpro and plpro in sars-cov-2 pp1ab fig 2b plpro cleaves three sites at 181182 818819 and 27632764 at the n-terminus and 3clpro cuts at the other 11 sites at the c-terminus and forming 15 non-structural proteins among them nsp3 contains multiple domains including a segment of sars unique domain and a deubiquitination and proteolytic enzyme plpro nsp5 is 3clpro nsp12 is an rdrp and nsp13 is helicase as a new coronavirus structure biology study about these proteins still at early stage until now only one crystal structure of 3clpro has been deposited in pdb pdb code 6lu7 in order to acquire more three-dimensional structure information of proteins about these new coronaviruses for subsequent drug screening we aligned all protein sequences from sars-cov-2 with all sequences in pdb1018 database in fold  function assignment system supporting information figs s19s34 fortunately most of these proteins have found their high homology proteins that have three-dimensional structure with homology between 7299 supporting information table s1 those pdb codes were labeled below the corresponding sequences in fig 2b unsurprisingly all these proteins with the highest homology are from sars nevertheless there are some proteins still have not high homologous in the database after the prediction of transmembrane helices in these proteins carried out in tmhmm server as expected we found that all these proteins are transmembrane proteins except for nsp2 supporting information figs s35s41 so far we have found as much structural information of this viral proteins as possible which provides the basis for subsequent homology modeling and drug screening before homology modeling all these proteins sequences were aligned with model sequences derived from sars-cov and predicted secondary structure as the same time fig 3
a and table s1 interestingly as shown in fig 3a important anti-virus drug target protein like 3clpro plpro and rdrp are highly conserved between those two human coronaviruses especially in functional region as shown in table s1 all these potential drug target proteins have been homologously modeled and all generated protein models were provided as the pdb files in supporting information all other coordinates of target-screening hit complexes can be provided upon request in order to verify the accuracy of homologous modeling we aligned the computational structure of the sars-cov-2 3clpro that modeled from the sars-cov 3clpro with its crystal structure of sars-cov-2 3clpro 6lu7 just solved and released during this manuscript was being prepared the computational model of sars-cov-2 3clpro showed a c rmsd of 0471  on the overall structure compared to the sars-cov-2 3clpro structure fig 3b whats more the c rmsd between their substrate binding regions is only 0126  showing very subtle difference ace2 molecule was known as a human entry receptor for spike which facilitates its cross-species transmission sequence alignment results show that the homology of the spike-receptor binding domain rbd sequence between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov is 76 fig 3c recent researches speculated that sars-cov-2 could also bind to ace2 and this was verified by computational docking and elisa measurement24

25 moreover homology of the spike-rbd sequence between sars-cov-2 and bat-cov ratg13 is as high as 95 despite the high homology of ratg13 and sars-cov-2 in spike sequence our analysis found that four among the five most important amino acids l465 l495 y502 d510 and h514 that bind to ace212 in bat-cov ratg13 differ from sars-cov-2 fig 3c and there is no related research literature about whether bat-cov ratg13 can infect human yet we also performed homology modeling on the bat-cov ratg13 spike rbd supporting information fig s1 three spike rbd structures have been docked with human ace2 among them for the conformations which most resemble the crystal structure of sars rbdace2 complex26 the binding free energy between sars-cov-2 spike rbd and human ace2 was 3372 kcalmol supporting information fig s2 that between sars-cov spike rbd and ace2 was 4922 kcalmol supporting information fig s3 and that between bat-cov ratg13 spike rbd and ace2 was 3106 kcalmol supporting information fig s4 plpro is responsible for the cleavages of n-terminus of the replicase poly-protein to release nsp1 nsp2 and nsp3 which is essential for correcting virus replication27 plpro was also confirmed to be significant to antagonize the hosts innate immunity28 29 30 as an indispensable enzyme in the process of coronavirus replication and infection of the host plpro has been a popular target for coronavirus inhibitors it is very valuable for targeting plpro to treat coronavirus infections but no inhibitor has been approved by the fda for marketing the screening results table 1

a and b the strong hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction between ribavirin with the enzyme imply it may be a potent plpro inhibitor the 3clpro also known as nsp5 is first automatically cleaved from poly-proteins to produce mature enzymes and then further cleaves downstream nsps at 11 sites to release nsp4nsp1631 3clpro directly mediates the maturation of nsps which is essential in the life cycle of the virus the detailed investigation on the structure and catalytic mechanism of 3clpro makes 3clpro an attractive target for anti-coronavirus drug development inhibitors targeting at sars-cov 3clpro mainly include peptide inhibitors and small-molecule inhibitors

 3clpro monomer has three domains domain i residues 8101 domain ii residues 102184 and domain iii residues 201303 and a long loop residues 185200 connects domains ii and iii the active site of 3clpro is located in the gap between domains i and ii and has a cyshis catalytic dyad cys145 and his4133 as shown in table 3
and supporting excel file 3clproxlsx anti-bacterial drugs lymecycline demeclocycline doxycycline and oxytetracycline anti-hypertensive drugs nicardipine and telmisartan and conivaptan treating hyponatremia show highest binding affinity to 3clpro several natural compounds and derivatives with anti-virus and anti-inflammatory effects also exhibited high binding affinity to 3clpro table 4

a montelukast was well fitted into the active pocket of 3clpro in which lots of hydrophobic amino acids just like thr24 leu27 his41 phe140 cys145 his163 met165 pro168 and his172 compose a relatively hydrophobic environment to contain the compound and stabilize its conformation hydrogen bonding was predicted between asn142 and the carbonyl group of the compound fig 5b nsp12 a conserved protein in coronavirus is an rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp and the vital enzyme of coronavirus replicationtranscription complex the rdrp domain of polymerase is located at the c-terminus and has a conserved ser-asp-asp motif34 nsp8 can de novo synthesize up to 6 nucleotides in length which can be used as a primer for nsp12-rdrp rna synthesis further the nsp7nsp8 complex increases the binding of nsp12 to rna and enhances the rdrps enzyme activity of nsp1235 in the research of sars-cov and mers-cov inhibitors nsp12-rdrp has been used as a very important drug target in principle targeted inhibition of nsp12-rdrp could not cause significant toxicity and side effects on host cells but no specific inhibitors have been found until now36 virtual screening results of rdrp demonstrated some drugs might be potential inhibitors with mfscores lower than 110 such as several anti-fungal drug itraconazole anti-bacterial drug novobiocin gallstone-dissolving drug chenodeoxycholic acid anti-allergic drug cortisone anti-tumor drug idarubicin hepatoprotective drug silybin muscle relaxant drug pancuronium bromide and chronic enteritis anti-coagulant drug dabigatran etexilate table 5

39 based on structure modeling of helicase protein anti-bacterial drugs lymecycline cefsulodine and rolitetracycline anti-fungal drug itraconazole anti-human immunodeficiency virus-1 hiv-1 drug saquinavir anti-coagulant drug dabigatran and diuretic drug canrenoic acid were predicted to be helicase inhibitors with high mfscores through virtual ligand screening the natural products such as many flavanoids from different sources -glucosyl hesperidin hesperidin rutin quercetagetin 6-o--d-glucopyranoside and homovitexin xanthones 35-dimethoxy-1-6-o--d-xylopyranosyl--d-glucopyranosyloxy-9h-xanthen-9-one kouitchenside h kouitchenside a 82-dihydroxy-345-trimethoxy-1-6-o--d-xylopyranosyl--d-glucopyranosyloxy-9h-xanthen-9-one kouitchenside d 1-hydroxy-26-dimethoxy-8-6-o--d-xylopyranosyl--d-glucopyranosyloxy-9h-xanthen-9-one and triptexanthoside d from swertia genus phyllaemblicin b and phyllaemblinol from phyllanthus emblica showed high binding affinity to this target besides the above targets some non-structural proteins including nsp3b nsp3e nsp7nsp8 complex nsp9 nsp10 nsp14 nsp15 and nsp16 also play an important role in the virus rna synthesis and replication suggesting these proteins may be useful targets for the anti-viral drug discovery the virtual screening results showed many anti-bacterial anti-viral or anti-inflammatory drugs from zinc drug database and our in-house natural productsderivatives database displayed potential good affinity to these targets and the detailed information of virtual screening results is shown in supporting excel files for zdd screening results file names as targetxlsx for natural products screening results file names as targetnpxlsx spike is the main structural protein of coronavirus and assembles into a special corolla structure on the surface of the virus as a trimer spike is a main protein that interacts with the host by binding to host cell receptors to mediate virus invasion and determine viral tissue or host tropism40 spike is cleaved into s1 and s2 by the host cell protease like tmprss2 etc the main function of s1 is to bind with host cell surface receptors and the s2 subunit mediates viruscell and cellcell membrane fusion spike structural integrity and cleavage activation play a key role in virus invasion and virulence41 therapeutic strategies to block coronavirus from entering host cells by targeting spike proteins or specific receptors on the host surface are valuable for the development of anti-viral drugs on the basis of virtual screening results of small-molecule compounds against spike protein some drugs showed high binding affinity mfscore150 or score35 such as anti-hypertensive drugs rescinnamine iloprost and prazosin anti-fungal drugs posaconazole and itraconazole anti-bacterial drug sulfasalazine azlocillin penicillin and cefsulodin and anti-coagulant drug dabigatran etexilate some natural flavanoids licoflavonol from glycyrrhiza uralensis cosmosiinfrom scutellaria baicalensis neohesperidin from citrus aurantium mangostinfrom garcinia mangostana kouitchenside d from swertia kouitchensis excoecariatoxin from excoecaria agallocha phyllaemblicin g7 from phyllanthus emblica and piceatannol from vitis vinifera exhibited high binding affinity the detailed virtual screening results are shown in supporting excel files however most of above compounds were not predicted to bind with the binding interface of the spikeace2 complex the only compound that could target the binding interface between spike and ace2 was hesperidin as shown in fig 6
a hesperidin was predicted to lie on the middle shallow pit of the surface of rbd of spike where the dihydroflavone part of the compound went parallel with the -6 sheet of rbd and the sugar part was inserted into the shallow pit in the direction away from ace2 where a few hydrophobic amino acids including tyr436 try440 leu442 phe443 phe476 try475 try481 and tyr49 form a relatively hydrophobic shallow pocket to contain the compound fig 6b hydrogen bonding was predicted between tyr440 and the compound by superimposing the ace2rbd complex to the hesperidinrbd complex a distinct overlap of hesperidin with the interface of ace2 could be observed fig 6c suggesting hesperidin may disrupt the interaction of ace2 with rbd except for spike protein e protein e-channel possesses important biological functions for the structural integrity of coronavirus and host virulence nrbd and crbd of coronavirus n protein are needed for n proteins in host cells to bind with coronavirus rna efficiently therefore e protein or n protein nrbd and crbd domains can be used as targets for the discovery of anti-viral drugs through virtual screening many anti-bacterial anti-viral anti-tumor anti-asthmatic and anti-inflammatory drugs etc from zinc database and our in-house natural productsderivatives database were found to display relatively good affinity to these targets and the detailed results of virtual screening are given in supplementary excel files there are three coronavirus virulence factors nsp1 nsp3c and orf7a related to interfering hosts innate immunity and assisting coronavirus immune escape nsp1 interacts with host 40s ribosomal subunit that induces specifically host mrna degradation42 and also inhibits type-i interferon production43 nsp3c has ability to bind with hosts adp-ribose to help coronavirus resist host innate immunity44 bone marrow matrix antigen 2 bst-2 can inhibit the release of newly-assembled coronavirus from host cells sars-cov orf7a directly binds to bst-2 and inhibits its activity by blocking the glycosylation of bst-245 these evidences suggest that nsp1 nsp3c and orf7a may be potential targets for anti-viral drug discovery the detailed screening results of nsp1 nsp3c and orf7a showed that a series of clinical drugs and natural products with anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory effects exhibited relatively high binding affinity to these three target proteins such as piperacillin cefpiramide streptomycin lymecycline tetracycline platycodin d from platycodon grandifloras wogonoside from scutellaria baicalensis vitexin from vitex negundo andrographolide derivatives and xanthones from swertia genus the detailed results of virtual screening are shown in supporting excel files the host ace2 has been proved by many studies to be the specific receptor for the spike rbd of sars-cov12 the latest research shows that the host receptor of sars-cov-2 is consistent with sars-cov exhibiting that the spike rbd sequence of sars-cov-2 is similar to sars-cov rbd and there are important interactions between several key amino acid residues of rbd receptor-binding motif and ace224 based on the current research progress ace2 is considered as a host target for the treatment of coronavirus infection to block sars-cov-2 from entering host cells based on the virtual screening results of ace2 protein anti-diabetes drug troglitazone anti-hypertensive drug losartan analgesia drug ergotamine anti-bacterial drug cefmenoxime and hepatoprotective drug silybin etc were predicted to bind with ace2 with low energy the natural products such as phyllaemblicin g7 from phyllanthus emblica xanthones from the plants of swertiagenus neohesperidin and hesperidin from citrus aurantium exhibited potentially high binding affinity to ace2 protein however none of above ace2 binding compounds was predicted to target the ace2rbd interface in addition tmprss2 was known to cut the spike to trigger the infection of sars-cov and mers-cov studies have shown that inhibiting the enzyme activity of tmprss2 can prevent some coronaviruses from entering host cells46 as a possible target for anti-viral drug discovery the virtual screen results shown in supporting excel files predicted many anti-bacterial drugs pivampicillin hetacillin cefoperazone and clindamycin and anti-virus natural compounds phyllaemblicin g7 neoandrographolide kouitchenside i etc to be potential tmprss2 inhibitors in order to further verify the screening results of zinc drug database and utilize the current resource of anti-viral drugs immediately we constructed a database of 78 anti-viral drugs for deep calculation including compounds already on the market and currently undergoing clinical trials to treat sars-cov-2 infections the compounds were docked with 19 constructed targets of sars-cov-2 and 2 human targets to predict their possible targets and also to search possible binding partners of certain important targets special attentions were paid to the drugs currently in clinical trials all results of calculated docking scores were listed in the supporting excel file anti-viralsvstargetsscores significant scores score32 mfscore110 were highlighted in brighten yellow remdesivir gs-5734 a nucleoside analogue is an rdrp inhibitor it can inhibit virus by inhibiting synthesis of viral nucleic acid and has not yet been approved for marketing in any country on january 31 of this year the new england journal of medicine reported the diagnosis and treatment of the first sars-cov-2 patient in the united states47 remdesivir showed some potential in the treatment of the first patient with novel coronavirus infection on vero e6 cells the ec50 of remdesivir for sars-cov-2 is 077 moll and the selection index si is greater than 12948 remdesivir is currently undergoing a randomized double-blind controlled phase iii clinical study in china our molecular docking results show that the potential targets of remdesivir is nsp3b score365 rdrp mfscores1128 e-channel mfscore1251 and tmprss2 score3623 mfscores1094 for rdrp from generated docking model remdesivir could bind to the rna-binding channel of the sars-cov-2 rdrp and the binding mode and site were highly similar to that of coxsackievirus b3 cvb3 rdrp inhibitor gpc-n11449the binding pocket of remdesivir was in the bottom of the rna template channel which position was for the acceptor template nucleotide fig 7
a and b the compound was well fitted with the shape of the pocket where it formed three hydrogen bonds with asn497 arg569 and asp684 in addition hydrophobic interactions with leu576 ala685 and tyr687 may further direct the favorite conformation of remdesivir fig 7c interestingly remdesivir was predicted to bind with the target tmprss2 with low binding energy for both score and mfscore as shown in fig 8
a remdesivir was bound in a relatively positively-charged allosteric pocket which is far away from the enzyme active center asn84 and arg405 formed two hydrogen bonds with the phosphate groups of the compound weak hydrophobic interaction between the pyrrolotriazine ring of remdesivir with tyr131 and try401 and side chains of some polar amino acids may further stabilize the compound conformation fig 8b lopinavir and ritonavir have been marketed in china and are mainly used to treat hiv-1 infection in adults and children over 2 years of age in vitro studies have shown that lopinavir and ritonavir can inhibit the replication of mers-cov and sars-cov to exert anti-viral effects the drug is listed as a recommended drug in the anti-viral drugs section of the new coronavirus infected pneumonia diagnosis and treatment program the molecular docking results showed that ritonavirs possible target is nsp3c or e-channel with the mfscores of 152100 and 277769 respectively lopinavirs possible target is nsp3b nsp3c helicase nrbd or e-channel with the mfscores of 158050 189140 114018 171127 and 221785 respectively arbidol is a broad-spectrum anti-viral drug mainly for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections caused by influenza a and b viruses etc in recent years many studies have proven its effectiveness against both sars-cov and mers-cov arbidol hydrochloride can block virus replication by inhibiting the fusion of the lipid membrane of the virus with the host cells compared with the untreated control group arbidol can effectively inhibit coronavirus up to 60 times at a concentration of 1030 moll and significantly inhibit the viruss pathological effects on cells the docking results of arbidol with the possible drug targets of the new coronavirus showed that it may interact with nsp7nsp8 complex nsp14 nsp15 e-channel or spike with the mfscores of 136087 118253 118253 117879 and 145125 respectively darunavir is an hiv-1 protease inhibitor that selectively inhibits the cleavage of hiv-encoded gag-pol polyprotein in virally infected cells thereby preventing the formation of mature infectious virus particles at a concentration of 300 moll darunavir can significantly inhibit virus replication and the inhibition efficiency is 280 times compared with the untreated group our docking results showed that the possible targets of darunavir are nsp3c plpro e-channel or spike proteins with the mfscores of 126149 110759 157184 and 111865 respectively favipiravir a broad-spectrum anti-viral drug is used to treat flu the shenzhen health commission has now initiated clinical studies on the use of favipiravir to treat sars-cov-2 infections while the scores of favipiravir docking with the targets in our virtual screening are relatively low chloroquine phosphate has been used in the treatment of malaria since the 1940s and later in rheumatoid arthritis chloroquine has been reported in some earlier studies to have direct anti-viral effects such as inhibiting flavivirus retrovirus such as hiv and many coronaviruses recent study showed that with ec50 of 113 moll and si greater than 88 chloroquine can effectively inhibit sars-cov-2 in the cell level its efficiency in the human body for sars-cov-2 infection has not yet been clinically proven chloroquine phosphate was turned into chloroquine in the body to play therapeutic effect our docking results showed that the possible target of chloroquine is nsp3b or e-channel with the docking mfscores of 130355 and 107889 respectively we also performed the longitudinal analysis on the drugs against 21 targets and the results showed that only tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and beclabuvir may bind to nsp1 fewer compounds were predicted to act on some targets such as nsp1 nsp3e nsp9 nsp10 nsp16 nrbd crbd orf7a and tmprss2 showing that these selected anti-viral drugs are unlikely to acting on the above targets of the new coronavirus which provides a meaningful reference for our future research for other targets such as nsp3b nsp3c nsp7nsp8 complex nsp14 nsp15 plpro 3clpro rdrp helicase e-channel spike and ace2 more anti-viral drugs were predicted to bind with them especially e-channel rdrp 3clpro and plpro indicating that these targets are more likely to be useful for the discovery of sars-cov-2 therapeutic drugs from known anti-virals and should be the focus of our subsequent research the ongoing sars-cov-2 epidemic makes us painfully realize that our current options for treating life-threatening zoonotic coronavirus infections are very limited although the outbreaks of sars in 2003 and mers-cov in 2012 triggered extensive research efforts there are currently no drugs that can treat any zoonotic coronavirus the transient nature of this epidemic is one of the major reasons why no prototype coronavirus inhibitor has progressed to the early preclinical stage to date as with the sars virus 17 years ago and the current sars-cov-2 emerging coronaviruses in the future may continue to pose a threat to global public health therefore finding broad-spectrum inhibitors that may reduce the effects of human coronavirus infection remains a challenging research focus given the time-consuming nature of anti-viral drug development and registration existing treatments for other diseases may be the only fastest treatment option for emerging infectious diseases for most of these drugs that have been prepared the medication has sufficient experience and dosage and their safety and adme situation are well known in this study based on the results of bioinformatics analysis 20 homology structures of 18 sars-cov-2 proteins and 1 human protein were built plus human ace2 structure totally 21 targets were setup for high throughput virtual ligand screening the special double scoring system icm-pro soft allowed us to evaluate the docking results more accurately the score of icm software is calculated by the overall empirical function of predicted physical interaction whiles the mfscore mean force score is computed by the knowledge-based potential functions derived from statistics of ligandreceptor complex in pdb50

51 from proteinprotein docking results we can deduce that sars-cov-2 spike protein have strong binding affinity to human ace2 although weaker than that of sars-cov spike protein unexpectedly bat-cov ratg13 spike protein only has slightly weaker binding affinity with ace2 compared to sars-cov-2 it is speculated that the virus may be capable of infecting humans directly or it is close if sars-cov-2 evolved from bat-cov ratg13 there may be no more than one or two host evolutions involved but there are no published articles that directly related to intermediate hosts yet according to the most recent research paper on the clinical characteristics of sars-cov-2 infection52 sars-cov-2 can spread rapidly by human-to-human transmission this was consistent with observed proteinprotein docking results of sars-cov-2 spike rbd and human ace2 for both of ours and previous prediction25 however the fast growing incidents of sars-cov-2 pneumonia and related deaths implied the weaker binding of sars-cov-2 spike with human ace2 compared to sars spike may not fully explained the current situation of this epidemic there must have some other receptors of sars-cov-2 or infection facilitating mechanisms in the human host or sars-cov-2 spike-rbd may take other lower energy binding conformation different from current sars-cov spike-rbd conformation found in the crystal structure probably by induce fitting these need to be further investigated to search potential coronavirus therapeutic drugs as soon as possible we first screened potential compounds from a zinc drug database 2924 compounds and a small in-house database of natural products about 1066 compounds a series of clinical drugs and natural products with anti-viral anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory effects exhibited high binding affinity to different target proteins indicating their potential utility for treating sars-cov-2 we have identified a number of compounds that might have anti-viral activity from the approved drugs library such as anti-virus drugs ribavirin valganciclovir and thymidine anti-bacterial drugs cefpiramide sulfasalazine phenethicillin lymecycline demeclocycline doxycycline oxytetracycline and tigecycline anti-asthmatic drugs montelukast fenoterol and reproterol and hepatoprotective drug silybin the original pharmacological actions of these drugs could be helpful for the therapy of viral infection pneumonia the natural products such as flavanoids like neohesperidin hesperidin baicalin kaempferol 3-o-rutinoside and rutin from different sources andrographolide neoandrographolide and 14-deoxy-1112-didehydroandrographolide from andrographis paniculata and a series of xanthones from the plants of swertia genus with anti-virus anti-bacteria and anti-inflammation activity could effectively interact with these targets of sars-cov-2 therefore the herbal medicines containing these compounds as major components might be meaningful for the treatment of sars-cov-2 infections for ace2 target although several compounds could bind with ace2 through virtual screening in our studies no compound was found to bind with the contact surface of ace2spike complex suggesting that these compounds are only the inhibitors of ace2 enzyme activities rather than inhibitors of ace2 driven virus infections just like what described in recently published research53 most of selected compounds are also unable to bind with the contact surface of ace2spike complex actually these potential ace2 inhibitors may not be suitable to use as drugs for treating sars-cov-2 infection because the poor prognosis would be induced by the inhibition of ace2 enzyme activities for ace2 was considered as a protective factor of lung injury54 for those targets which are difficult to find direct inhibitors or non-druggable targets just like nsp1 nsp3b nsp3c and e-channel etc currently popular protac technology may be a good strategy to degrade these proteins and then inhibit the virus the potential binding compounds found in this study for these targets might be a good start point for spike protein we found only one compound natural hesperidin was targeting the binding between spike rbd and human ace2 however not like the ace2 binding compounds non-interface binding compound may still meaningful applications considering that the fusion of covs membrane with host cell membrane need the big conformational change of remained spike part after rbd removal55 any small molecule bound to spike at this time may interfere the re-folding of spike therefore inhibits the viral infection process furthermore small molecule that can target any part of spike protein may be a good start point to design protac based therapy also we dock existing anti-viral drugs with our targets analyze the possible targets of each anti-viral drug horizontally and analyze the drugs that may interact with 21 targets vertically we analyzed 21 targets based on the docking results and found that nsp3b nsp3c nsp7nsp8 complex nsp14 nsp15 plpro 3clpro rdrp helicase e-channel spike and ace2 are more likely to be therapeutic targets of anti-viral drugs the three targets nsp3b nsp3c and e-channel are screened more anti-viral drugs this may be due to the model problem because of flexible small protein nsp3b and nsp3c or partial model e-channel whether the screened anti-viral drugs really work on these targets needs further verification we also do not recommend the application of new coronavirus pneumonia to compounds for which no target has been predicted the triphosphate nucleotide product of remdesivir remdesivir-tp competes with rdrp for substrate atp so it can interfere with viral rna synthesis our docking results show that remdesivir-tp binds to sars-cov-2 rdrp with a score of 1128 and the docking results are consistent with its original anti-viral mechanism so we think remdesivir may be good in treating sars-cov-2 pneumonia in addition remdesivir also predicted to bind with the human tmprss2 a protein facilitating the virus infection this is a new discovery and provides ideas for subsequent research chloroquine phosphate has shown better anti-sars-cov-2 effects in recent studies but this drug has no clear target of action in our docking results chloroquine phosphate is predicted to possibly combine with nsp3b and e-channel but we need to do further experiments to verify this conclusion in response to the recently reported anti-aids drugs lopinavir and ritonavir tablets which have a poor effect on the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia and have toxic side effects we analyzed it in conjunction with the docking results the molecular docking results show that ritonavirs possible target is nsp3c or e-channel lopinavirs possible target is nsp3b nsp3c helicase nrbd or e-channel some of these targets such as nsp3b nsp3c e-channel may be false positives due to the model inaccuracy for small flexible protein or partial model for both lopinavir and ritonavir we did not observe possible binding to major targets like 3clpro plpro rdrp and so on this docking result implies lopinavir and ritonavir tablets may not be suitable for treatment of sars-cov-2 infections the results of the entire article are based on computer virtual screening we have not conduct further in vivo and in vitro anti-viral experiments yet because we want to share our results with scientists in anti-sars-cov-2 research as soon as possible our subsequent research will try to solve the three-dimensional structures of all 24 proteins of sars-cov-2 and their drug complexes providing more target information for drug intervention and long-term drug design perform in vivo and in vitro evaluations for candidate drugs

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 can cause coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 disease this emergent variant adds to the additional coronavirus strains that can infect humans including human coronavirus oc43 hcov-oc43 human coronavirus hku1 hcov-hku1 sars-cov human coronavirus 229e hcov-229e human coronavirus nl63 hcov-nl63 and human coronavirus nl63 hcov-nl63 123456 coronaviruses

24910111213 although the mortality of mers-cov sars-cov and sars-cov-2 is substantial there are no preventative vaccines or drugs available to treat patients infected with the virus 91112 the current public health emergency of international concern pheic by the world health organization who has declared sars-cov-2 covid-19 a novel cov as a pandemic threat the data obtained from who 08may2020 suggest that the virus has caused 3759967 infections 259474 deaths and it has affected over 200 countries the open reading frame 1ab orf1ab of sars-cov-2 encodes for three proteins that are broadly recognized as drug targets since they are key components for infections and disease progression the sars-cov-2 protease 1415 the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp 141617 and the sars-cov-2 spike s glycoprotein 15181920 the sars-cov-2 protease processes the polyproteins that are translated from the viral rna and it has been heavily studied using small molecules inhibitors 15 to penetrate the host the sars-cov-2 makes use of homotrimeric class i glycosylated fusion spike protein 182122 fusion of the viral and host cell membranes is facilitated by the spike glycoprotein which undergoes a significant conformational change upon fusion 182122 sars-cov-2 studies suggest 182324 that the spike glycoprotein functions as a homotrimer the recognition and subsequent fusion of the viral and cellular membranes are triggered by the s1 subunit of the spike protein which binds the host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ace2 1625262728293031 several insights from structural biology are consistent with the role for this domain in affecting the infection rate of the virus this hostvirus interaction is mediated by the receptor binding domain rbd domain from s1 subunit of sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein that forms a hinge-like conformation 1832 ie down and up states that represents the host cell receptor-inaccessible and receptor-accessible 18 this receptor-accessible up conformation exists in a highly fluctuating state 33343536 binding to the host target destabilizes the pre-fusion homotrimer which sheds off the s1 subunit and allows for the transition of the s2 subunit to a highly stable postfusion conformation 18 interestingly protein-mediated cellcell fusion assays suggest that sars-cov-2 spike protein displays an elevated plasma membrane fusion capacity when compared to that of sars-cov 3237 several studies have aimed to define the mechanism of binding of sars-cov-2 to the host cell receptor 38 molecular dynamics simulations of the spike rbd-ace2 complex over 10 ns indicated that spikerbd-ace2 binding free energy for sars-cov-2 is better than for the sars-cov 39 similarly other studies have shown that the sars-cov-2 spike protein has a better binding affinity to ace2 at two different up angles of the rbd domain than the sars-cov 40 structural features at the spike-ace2 interface suggest that residues q493 and p499 from the spike rbd domain are responsible for maintaining proteinprotein stability 41 using a virtual high-throughput screening approach small-molecules have been identified that can interact with the rbd domain of sars-cov-2 spike protein 42 natural compounds present in curcuma sp citrus sp alpiniagalanga and caesalpiniasappan could also target the rbd domain of the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein the protease domain pd from ace2 and the sars-cov-2 protease 20 a set of b cell and t cell epitopes derived from the spike and nucleocapsid proteins that map identically to sars-cov-2 proteins were identified as potential vaccine candidates 23 applying an integrative antiviral drug repurposing methodology the interplay between the covhost interactome and drug targets in the human proteinprotein interaction network have been defined 43 bioinformatics methodologies were used to identify neutralizing antibodies that might interact with interfaces formed by the spike glycoprotein and the ace2 host cell receptor 24 by targeting the rbd domain of the spike protein using docking experiments kanishka et al identified small molecule inhibitors 44 in the majority of studies the most common strategy is focused on targeting the interface formed by sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein and the ace2 host cell receptor ie spikerbd-ace2 currently there are no robust drugs for wide-spread dissemination available against coronaviruses including the sars-cov-2 virus due to the relatively rapid spread in the current outbreak and the relatively high mortality rate 35 more rapid development of new or repurposed antiviral drugs is of high value although the majority of drug discovery programs target classically druggable enzymes encoded by the virus such as the viral rna polymerase inhibited by remdesivir 131745 there is a paucity of information concerning the other regions of spike glycoprotein outwith the ace2-binding domains especially the domains interacting with the viral membrane the sars-cov-2 spike protein is a homotrimer composed of three monomers chains a b and c figure 1a each monomeric protein contains an n-terminal ace2 binding domain receptor binding domain rbd a central helixheptad repeat and a c-terminal region that interacts with the plasma membrane 18 homotrimer spike protein assembly from monomeric forms can be rate limiting in cells suggesting a possible space for intervention on the viral life cycle 46 our current study focuses on understanding the variability of the trimer spike glycoprotein in sars-cov-2 with respect to the genomes from other coronavirus strains and identifying the changes in the molecular properties due to conformational flexibility in the spike protein the analysis suggests that residues in the s2 subunit are less variable compared to the other regions in addition the molecular dynamics simulations mds identified that residues from the rbd domain obtained substantial flexibility which may be an obstacle in finding active hits by contrast residues in the s2 subunit trimer cavity showed the least flexibility representing a novel binding region for ligands this information was used to identify potentially novel drug pockets or the active site regions specifically in the oligomeric sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein we performed md simulations on the monomeric and trimeric form of the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein and developed a virtual screening using a food and drug administration fda approved chemical library we identified and focused on an apparent cavity formed by three subunits the homotrimer that our simulations suggest can mediate dynamic movements that mimic a bouncing spring or a sarrus linkage converting a circular motion to a linear motion or vice versa when interacting with the ace2 host cell receptor this motion might be important in the fusion of the virion and the host cell membrane we hypothesized that such a cavity formed by three monomers or subunits of the spike protein ie chains a b and c might form an acceptor for small molecules and we asked whether small molecules could be identified with a relatively high binding energy we identified several known compounds with predicted binding energy of gbviwsa dg generalized-born volume integralweighted surface area from 35 to 71 kcalmol some of which are already proposed for clinical trials including an mtor mammalian target of rapamycin pathway inhibitor sirolimus rapamycin a macrolide type nct03901001 not yet recruiting 474849 and ritonavir open-label trial in hospitalized adults with severe covid-19 48505152 a recent study that screened hundreds of approved molecules in a sars-cov-2 assay using artificial intelligence-enabled phenomic assays 53 also identified sirolimus rapamycin as a promising candidate in addition to the macrolides one of the top hits we have identified chitosan has a recently reported derivative inhibiting sars-cov-2 coronavirus replication in cell lines 5455 a previous study has also shown that the chitosan derivatives can interact with the spike protein and block its interaction with the host receptor 56 our data suggest a mechanism whereby chitosan and possibly its derivatives as well as macrolide type molecules might bind to a pocket formed by the spike protein trimer and provide a novel domain to focus on for future drug discovery projects a total of 791 viral genome sequences were downloaded from the global initiative on sharing all influenza data platform gisaid 57 in order to define the evolutionary variability in different domains of the spike glycoprotein only genomes with high coverage and complete sequences were selected further filtering was applied to obtain complete sequences on the targeted domains which reduced the total number of strains to 768 total protein sequences were acquired from 3 frame translation using the transeq tool from emboss european molecular biology open software suite package version 657 european bioinformatics institute embl-ebi hinxton cambridge uk 58 the amino acid chains from the spike glycoprotein were aligned to the reference protein pdb id 6vsb 1859 using muscle 60 variations in the amino acid or the residue changes were scanned on the entire spike protein sequence along with two areas of interest in the multiple alignment file focusing on a subset of the s2 subunit hr1 ch and cd domains and the rbd domain figure 1 and tables s1s3

materials file s1 the gromacs 465 65 program gromacs groningen machine for chemical simulations university of groningen groningen the netherlands was used to perform md calculations assigning the charmm27 forcefield 66 we performed 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations on two systems i the monomeric form and ii the homotrimer form of the spike protein in our analysis of the md simulations the dynamics of the monomeric form of the spike protein serves as control to the homotrimer which is the functional unit initially the model systems were energy minimized which provides a base-line model

was evaluated using the gbviwsa g scoring function 76 the compounds showing best energies with the spike protein were selected for further analysis gbviwsa g is a forcefield based scoring function which determines the free energy of binding of the ligand from a given position 75 in addition we have also selected the compounds that showed comparatively stable interactions with the homotrimer spike protein applying the triangle matcherplacement method receptorligand docking was performed defining the receptor as rigid and ligands as flexible 7475 we were interested to define the evolutionary variance in the sars-cov-2 spike protein understanding regions of high and low variance can identify domains that may be functionally conserved and potentially important to the virus life cycle or those under positive evolutionary pressure whose selection might avoid the immune system examining the variability of the spike protein in sars-cov-2 and its different domains a total of 791 genome viral sequences were retrieved from gisaid 57 a global view of the mutation space of the virus is presented in figure 2a which represents the amino acid substitutions in bins of 10 aminoacids across the spike glycoprotein these hotspots of variation are mostly confined to the ntd and the rbd domains figure 1b and figure 2b we investigated the variability in the entire sequence of the spike protein focusing on the regions that showed low-variability in the structure figure 2 by investigating the variations in the residue changes across the entire spike protein sequence or all the regions of lower variability figure 2a and table s1 the s2 subunit exhibited the lowest sequence variability residue range 8161141 figure 1b and figure 2c moreover previous studies have identified that the active site region for this spike protein is located in the rbd domain which interacts with the ace2 host cell receptor 1820263839404244 comparing the variability of the rbd domain and s2 subunit domains the rbd domain was shown to contain more mutations in its region compared to the s2 subunit hr1 ch and cd domains figure 2bc and tables s1s4 these data suggest that during mutation by natural selection the viral-host arms race might operate more frequently on the rbd domain by contrast the s2 subunit conservation is suggestive of an important core function where mutations cannot be tolerated these findings prompted our focus on the s2 subunit as an important region to investigate for identifying potentially novel druggable pockets we next traced the dynamics of different domains in the spike protein using md simulations figure 1b the simulated model systems of the spike protein in the monomer and the homotrimer forms were first processed to check the stability of the protein stability of the simulated spike protein in both forms in the solvent environment was traced by rmsds root mean square deviation a time dependent change in the non-hydrogen atoms figure 3a the rmsd plots figure 3a suggest that the trimer form of the spike protein is more stable compared to the monomer form in addition chain a in trimer has a higher rmsd 2  compared to the other two chains which is a consequence of the fact that the up or ace2-active conformation 18 induces flexibility since the monomer form has a higher rmsds compared to the trimer figure 3a we performed independent triplicates mds was repeated three times of md simulation for the monomer form figure s1 the findings from these replicates indicate that the monomer form has a higher rmsd compared to the trimer spike protein figure 3a and figure s1 the root mean square fluctuations rmsf were computed on the c atoms of each residue from the spike protein in order to trace their flexibility and thereby define the motions of different domains figure 3b the rmsf findings in both forms monomer and trimer indicated that the amino acids in the rbd domain residue range 329521 were highly fluctuating figure 1b and figure 3b in addition the triplicate md simulations of the monomer form also suggests that the rbd domain has a higher rmsf in all three simulation replicates figure s1 these analyses correlate with previous studies 3334353639 particularly amino acids ranging from 470490 responsible for interacting with the ace2 that were highly fluctuating furthermore examining other regions of the spike protein suggests that the s2 subunit domains residue range 8501141 hr1 ch and cd showed the least fluctuations within the entire protein sequence figure 3b this correlates with the cryo-em studies performed on the spike protein that the s2 subunit is more stable 18 compared to the rbd domain and that this subunit is responsible for a highly stable postfusion conformation of the spike protein 1832 from the perspective of designing drugs the more stable or less flexible a region is within a protein the more accurately we can trace a better hit molecule in the case of the spike protein the rmsf findings guided us towards focusing on the s2 subunit figure 3b moreover by tracing the residues involved in the h-bond interactions between two monomers ie chains a-b a-c or b-c of the homotrimer we observed that the rbd domain residues were also involved in intermolecular interactions with each other and with high occupancy  this suggests that intermolecular interactions between chains in the homotrimer might equilibrate the spike protein and might stimulate conversion from a down to up conformation of the rbd domain that interacts with the ace2 receptor figure s2 and table s5 the structural dynamics over the time course for spike protein in the monomer and the homotrimer form was monitored during md simulations figure 3cd the monomeric spike protein in the solvent environment exhibited a movement from the up active state towards the down inactive state for the rbd domain figure 1c figure 3c and movie s1 these correlate with the previous findings that the rbd domain can form two different conformations ie down and up states which represents the host cell receptor-inaccessible and receptor-accessible respectively 33343536 the sars-cov-2 spike protein has a better binding affinity to the ace2 receptor at two different up angles of the rbd domain compared to the sars-cov 40 figure 3c and movie s1 describes the conformational change in other regions of the spike protein when the rbd domain moves towards an up to down state in the monomeric form figure 3d and movie s2 represents the dynamics of the homotrimer spike protein suggesting that the rbd domain of chain a opens more widely in its up state domains hr1 ch and cd close to the viral transmembrane exhibited the least movement figure 3d during md simulations in addition exploration of the structural orientation of these s2 subunit domains figure 3d and movie s2 suggests that they form a large pocket or cavity using three chains or monomers from a homotrimer spike protein the slight movement observed in homotrimer during md simulation of this cavity movies s1 and s2 and the structural orientation suggest that it could work as bouncing spring or sarrus linkage one may postulate that when the spike protein interacts with the ace2 receptor this bouncing spring or sarrus linkage movement may be important in the fusion of the virion with the host membrane additionally this cavity from the spike protein could work as a platform for the design or development of new drug leads against this protein figure 3d such molecules might alter the trimer stability upon viral entry or upon viral coat assembly there have been several studies performed to design drugs specific for the sars-cov-2 spike protein 203839404244 however most of them are focused on the rbd domain in addition from our md simulation and variability analysis figure 2 and figure 3 the rbd domain is highly flexible and variable therefore drugging this variable site may be an obstacle in finding active hit molecules by targeting the less variable s2 region such as the cavity formed by the homotrimer figure 2 and figure 3d we suggest that this might be a novel approach to develop small molecule drug leads we next investigated the targetability of the trimer cavity formed by the s2 subunit hr1 ch and cd domains in the spike protein figure 2 and figure 3 using the moe chemical computing group inc package 7475 before using it for high-throughput virtual screening or sbvs using a library of fda approved drugs the alpha shapes construction 7577 geometric method was used to compute the possible residues that can be considered for ligand docking from this trimer cavity in the spike protein figure 4a high-throughput virtual screening is a powerful computational approach that is increasingly being used in the drug discovery process through the in silico identification of novel hits from large compound databases 78 we applied the sbvs approach to dock the molecules to the trimer cavity and to check its feasibility as a target ligand binding to this cavity might reduce or increase the bouncing spring movement in the spike protein as observed in md simulations figure 3 movies s1 and s2 this perturbation might affect its interactions with the host cell receptor or the hinge movement of the rbd domain the compounds that exhibit a relatively high binding affinity towards the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein trimer cavity with a binding affinity 35 to 71 kcalmol gbviwsa dg were recorded from the list of ligands showing best binding the compounds that were already validated or suggested to becan be active against the sars-cov-2 virus includes chitosan 545556 rapamycin 474849 everolimus rad001 49 paclitaxel 79 ritonavir 48505152 selameerin selamectin 80 and danoprevir 52 table 1 among these molecules rapamycin and everolimus drugs were previously identified as mtor pathway inhibitors 4750818283 the antibacterial or antiparasitic drugs from the list are chitosan 84 or selameerin selamectin 85 respectively paclitaxel has been found to be previously target bcl-2 and microtubule associated functions 8687 in addition the fda approved drugs that target the protease are ritonavir 88 and danoprevir itmn-191 89 by docking known drugs within the trimer cavity of spike protein the relative selectivity of the cavity suggests that the majority of higher-affinity drugs will have a molecular weight mw  700 gmol table 1 and figure s3 however this is with the certainty that compounds with high mw can form more interactions with the spike protein in addition our finding highlights the possibility that the trimer cavity can occupy large ligands deep inside the binding pocket figure 4a particularly a specific class of ligands mostly macrolide type were found to exhibit a better fit to the trimer cavity figure 4a for example rapamycin 474849 everolimus rad001 49 paclitaxel 79 and selameerin selamectin 80 figure 4a the intermolecular interactions between the spike protein and the compounds suggest that residues from all three monomers chains a b and c are actively involved in binding to the drugs in addition placement of the compounds inside the trimer cavity suggests that they make use of the pocket space forming different conformation to form stable interactions with the spike protein figure 4a in order to check the selectivity of these ligands to the trimer cavity we docked this same subset table 1 with the rbd domain of the viral spike protein figure 4b pdb id 6lzg 90 the rbd domain is involved in interacting with the ace2 host cell receptor 16263038394041429091 the docking suggests that all compounds from table 1 have better binding affinity to the trimer cavity compared to that of the rbd domain in addition chitosan 54555684 a linear polysaccharide 3729 kcalmol could form a linear conformation in its structure when binding tothe rbd domain figure 4b and table 1 whilst the same ligand due to its molecular structural nature can form a slightly folded shape as shown in 2d-diagram figure 4a within the trimer cavity by contrast everolimus 49 a macrolide type exhibits high affinity for the trimer pocket and very little selectivity for the rbd domain table 1 moreover ligands figure 4b that interact with the rbd domain overlap with the region bound by cr3022 a neutralizing antibody isolated from a convalescent sars patient that interacts with the receptor binding domain of the sars-cov-2 spike protein 92 the sars-cov-2 virus causing covid-19 disease uses the fusion spike glycoprotein to penetrate into the host cell and therefore a detailed understanding of this protein forms a critical intervention point in the viral life-cycle we interrogated the spike protein with a diversity of computational approaches first the variability in spike protein from 791 different viral genome sequences was evaluated residues in the s2 subunit residue range 8161141 hr1 ch and cd domains were found to be less evolutionarily variable compared to other regions or domains by contrast residues h49y q239k v367f v483a s943p k986p and v987p were found to be the most common amino acid substitutions in the spike protein from related viruses secondly md simulations revealed that residues in rbd domain residue range 329521 were more flexible compared to residues in the s2 subunit making it more complicated for drug design strategies an examination of less variable regions revealed that the hr1 ch and cd domains s2 subunit located close to the viral transmembrane formed a large cavity or pocket that is formed from three spike monomers the md simulation traced an up active state and a down inactive state of the spike protein in its monomer form slight movement of the trimer cavity within this structural orientation suggests that it could work as bouncing spring or sarrus linkage when interacting with the host cell receptor the conversion between up and down states in the monomer form of spike protein using the in silico methods is defined by the md field to be relatively fast nevertheless there are different structural isoforms that have been identified on the spike protein using different experimental methods or virus strains this indicates that although conversion may be quick there are structural endpoints which are stable using the recent cryo-em structure of the sars-cov-2 spike protein 18 an asymmetric hinge-like movement was observed in only one of the three rbd domains in the s1 subunit which was also observed in mers-cov and sars-cov 3334 however there are also other structures where all three rbd domains are in the up or down conformation 1831333440 these data suggest a physiological relevance due to heterogeneous protein conformational dynamics for example asymmetric conformational flexibility might have a functional role perhaps in evading the exposure of b-cell epitopes only one rbd domain is in the up conformation andor optimized interaction with the ace2 receptor depending on virus strain in addition because of the bouncing spring mechanism communication between the trimer pocket and the rbd domain conformation it is possible that these different spike protein conformational isoforms provide another avenue to develop drug discovery programs that exploit andor circumvent these dynamics our investigation into the genomic variation within virus strains as well as our findings from the md simulations identified a conserved trimer cavity or pocket formed by the s2 subunit in the spike protein these findings suggest that a novel target the trimer cavity formed by spike protein oligomerization may be suitable to manipulate viruses of this class targeting the trimer pocket might identify a new functional class of drugs against this protein applying the sbvs approach we docked drug libraries against the trimer cavity with the hypothesis that such a ligand might perturb the predicted bouncing spring movement and the homotrimer formation proteinligand docking identified severalhits that have already been published or proposed to inhibit the sars-cov-2 virus in cell systems for example our studies suggest an action mechanism for molecules such as chitosan and macrolide types eg rapamycin based on the sequence variability of the coronavirus including our findings from md simulations of the spike protein a conserved trimer cavity hr1 ch and cd domains is a feature of the spike protein in most coronaviruses consistent with this previous work has shown that the molecule ek1 exhibited potent inhibitory activity against all human coronaviruses hcovs tested through binding to the c-terminal hr1 domain 37 additionally the up and down conformations of rbd domain observed during md simulations supports that concept that the spike protein can also be a target of a possible igg therapeutic 92 from the list of the top compounds identified that dock into the trimer cavity some of them have already been validated or suggested as sars-cov-2 virus inhibitors in cells including a chitosan derivative 545556 rapamycin 474849 everolimus rad001 49 paclitaxel 79 ritonavir 48505152 selameerin selamectin 80 and danoprevir 52 among these a modified polymeric version of the chitosan drug a top hit in our analysis was recently shown to inhibit cov replication with evidence that the molecule inhibits the binding of the viral spike protein to the host ace2 receptor 545556 the proteinprotein interaction map or the network-based methodologies 1443 suggest that sirolimus rapamycin emerges as a common potential drug lead for repurposing against covid-19 this rapamycin mtor inhibitor drug was found previously to disrupt larp1 la-related protein 1 and mtorc1 mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 binding and has been shown to reduce mers infection by 60 in vitro 47 the postulated geroprotectors such as sirolimus rapamycin and its close derivative the rapalog everolimus rad001 decreased infection rates in a small sample of elderly patients 49 moreover the drugs sirolimus rapamycin and ritonavir are currently in clinical trials for repurposing against covid-19 485051 sirolimus rapamycin is registered in a clinical trial nct03901001 not yet recruiting designed to evaluate adjunctive use of sirolimus rapamycin and oseltamivir in patients hospitalized with influenza 4748 ritonavir a hiv protease inhibitor is in an open-label trial in hospitalized adults with severe covid-19 4851 the data from this small-sample clinical study showed that danoprevir boosted by ritonavir is safe and well tolerated in all patients 52 selamectin is a potential drug for treating covid-2019 found active against the pangolin coronavirus gxp2v a workable model for sars-cov-2 research 80 the antitumor drug paclitaxel increases cellular methylglyoxal to virucidal levels providing a rationale for repurposing doxorubicin and paclitaxel for covid-19 treatment 79 nevertheless whether the hit molecules we have identified that dock into the trimer cavity and impact on the virus life cycle requires orthogonal validation we hope the findings of our study can help to understand the function of the highly conserved spike protein trimer cavity in the sars-cov-2 viral life cycle as well as provide a novel approach to target this class of infectious disease by the examination of spike protein trimer stability andor assembly  structural analysis of sars-cov-2 and predictions of the human interactome andrea vandelli michele monti edoardo milanetti jakob rupert elsa zacco elias bechara riccardo ponti delli gian gaetano tartaglia  specific elements of viral genomes regulate interactions within host cells here we calculated the secondary structure content of 2500 coronaviruses and computed 100000 human protein interactions with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 we found that the 3 and 5 are the most structured elements in the viral genome and the 5 has the strongest propensity to associate with human proteins the domain encompassing nucleotides 23000 -24000 is highly conserved both at the sequence and structural level while the region upstream varies significantly these two sequences code for a domain of the viral protein spike s that interacts with the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 and has the potential to bind sialic acids our predictions indicate that the first 1000 nucleotides in the 5 can interact with proteins 2 involved in viral rna processing such as double-stranded rna specific editases and atpdependent rna-helicases in addition to other high-confidence candidate partners these interactions previously reported to be also implicated in hiv reveal important information on hostvirus interactions the list of transcriptional and post-transcriptional elements recruited by sars-cov-2 genome provides clues on the biological pathways associated with gene expression changes in human cells  a disease named covid-19 by the world health organization and caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has been recognized as responsible for the pneumonia outbreak that started in december 2019 in wuhan city hubei china 1 and spread in february to milan lombardy italy 2 becoming pandemic as of april 2020 the virus infected 2000000 people in 200 countries sars-cov-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded rna virus that shares similarities with other betacoronavirus such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 3  bats have been identified as the primary host for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 45 but the intermediate host linking sars-cov-2 to humans is still unknown although a recent report indicates that pangolins could be involved 6  coronaviruses use species-specific proteins to mediate the entry in the host cell and the spike s protein activates the infection in human respiratory epithelial cells in sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 7  spike s is assembled as a trimer and contains around 1300 amino acids within each unit 8 9  the receptor binding domain rbd of spike s which contains around 300 amino acids mediates the binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme ace2 attacking respiratory cells another region upstream of the rbd present in mers-cov but not in sars-cov is involved in the adhesion to sialic acid and could play a key role in regulating viral infection 7 10  at present very few molecular details are available on sars-cov-2 and its interactions with the human host which are mediated by specific rna elements 11  to study the rna structural content we used cross 12 that was previously developed to investigate large transcripts such as the human immunodeficiency virus hiv-1 13  cross predicts the structural profile of rna molecules single- and double-stranded state at single-nucleotide resolution using sequence information only here we performed sequence and structural alignments among 62 sars-cov-2 strains and identified the conservation of specific elements in the spike s region which provides clues on the evolution of domains involved in the binding to ace2 and sialic acid as highly structured regions of rna molecules have strong propensity to form stable contacts with proteins 14 and promote assembly of specific complexes 15 16  sars-cov-2 domains enriched in double-stranded content are expected to establish interactions within host cells that are important to replicate the virus 17  to investigate the interactions of sars-cov-2 rna with human proteins we employed catrapid 18 19  catrapid 20 estimates the binding potential of a specific protein for an rna molecule through van der waals hydrogen bonding and secondary structure propensities allowing identification of interaction partners with high confidence 21  the unbiased analysis of more than 100000 protein interactions with sars-cov-2 rna reveals that the 5 of sars-cov-2 has strong propensity to bind to human proteins involved in viral infection and especially reported to be associated with hiv infection a comparison between sars-cov and hiv reveals indeed similarities 22  but the relationship between sars-cov-2 and hiv is still unexplored interestingly hiv and sars-cov-2 but not sars-cov nor mers-cov have a furin-cleavage site occurring in the spike s protein which could explain the spread velocity of sars-cov-2 compared to sars-cov and mers-cov 23 24  yet many processes related to sars-cov-2 replication are unknown and our study aims to suggest relevant protein interactions for further investigation we hope that our large-scale calculations of structural properties and binding partners of sars-cov-2 will be useful to identify the mechanisms of virus replication within the human host structured elements within rna molecules attract proteins 14 and reveal regions important for interactions with the host 25  indeed each gene expressed from sars-cov-2 is preceded by conserved transcription-regulating sequences that act as signal for the transcription complex during the synthesis of the rna minus strand to promote a strand transfer to the leader region to resume the synthesis this process is named discontinuous extension of the minus strand and is a variant of similarity-assisted template switching that operates during viral rna recombination 17  to analyze sars-cov-2 structure reference wuhan strain mn9089473 we employed cross 12 to predict the double-and single-stranded content of rna genomes such as hiv-1 13  we found the highest density of double-stranded regions in the 5 nucleotides 1-253 membrane m protein nucleotides 26523-27191 spike s protein nucleotides 23000-24000 and nucleocapsid n protein nucleotides 2874-29533 fig 1  26  the lowest density of double-stranded regions were observed at nucleotides 6000-6250 and 20000-21500 and correspond to the regions between the nonstructural proteins nsp14 and nsp15 and the upstream region of the spike surface protein s fig 1  26  in addition to the maximum corresponding to nucleotides 23000-24000 the structural content of spike s protein shows minima at around nucleotides 20500 and 24500 fig 1  we used the vienna method 27 to further investigate the rna secondary structure of specific regions identified with cross 13  employing a 100 nucleotide window centered around cross maxima and minima we found good match between cross scores and vienna free energies  fig   1  strong agreement is also observed between cross and vienna positional entropy indicating that regions with the highest structural content have also the lowest structural diversity our analysis suggests the presence of structural elements in sars-cov-2 that have evolved to interact with specific human proteins 11  our observation is based on the assumption that structured regions have an intrinsic propensity to recruit proteins 14  which is supported by the fact that structured transcripts act as scaffolds for protein assembly 15 16  we employed crossalign 13 to study the structural conservation of sars-cov-2 in different strains materials and methods in our analysis we compared the wuhan strain mn9089473 with around 2800 other coronaviruses data from ncbi with human  fig 2 or other hosts supp fig 1  when comparing sars-cov-2 with human coronaviruses 1387 strains including sars-cov and mers-cov we found that the most conserved region falls inside the spike s genomic locus fig 2  more precisely the conserved region is between nucleotides 23000 -24000 and exhibits an intricate and stable to better investigate the sequence conservation of sars-cov-2 we compared 62 strains isolated from different countries during the pandemic including china usa japan taiwan india brazil sweden and australia data from ncbi and in vipr wwwviprbrcorg materials and methods our analysis aims to determine the relationship between structural content and sequence conservation using clustal w for multiple sequence alignments 28  we observed general conservation of the coding regions fig 3a  the 5 and 3 show high variability due to experimental procedures of the sequencing and are discarded in this analysis 29  one highly conserved region is between nucleotides 23000 -24000 in the spike s genomic locus while sequences up-and downstream are variable red bars in fig 3a  we then used crossalign 13 to compare the structural content materials and methods high variability of structure is observed for both the 5 and 3 and for nucleotides between 21000 -22000 as well as 24000 -25000 associated with the s region red bars in fig 3a  the rest of the regions are significantly conserved at a structural level p-value  00001 fishers test we then compared protein sequences coded by the spike s genomic locus ncbi reference qhd43416 and found that both sequence fig 3a and structure fig 2 of nucleotides 23000 -24000 are highly conserved the region corresponds to amino acids 330-500 that contact the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 30 promoting infection and provoking lung injury 24 31  by contrast the region upstream of the binding site receptor ace2 and located in correspondence to the minimum of the structural profile at around nucleotides 22500-23000  fig 1  is highly variable 32  as indicated by t-coffee multiple sequence alignments 32 fig 3a  this part of the spike s region corresponds to amino acids 243-302 that in mers-cov binds to sialic acids regulating infection through cell-cell membrane fusion  fig 3b  see related manuscript by e milanetti et al 10 33 34  our analysis suggests that the structural region between nucleotides 23000 and 24000 of spike s region is conserved among coronaviruses fig 2 and that the binding site for ace2 has poor variation in human sars-cov-2 strains fig 3b  by contrast the region upstream which has propensity to bind sialic acids 10 33 34  showed poor structural content and high variability fig 3b  in order to obtain insights on how the virus replicates in human cells we predicted sars-cov-2 interactions with the whole rna-binding human proteome following a protocol to study structural conservation in viruses 13  we first divided the wuhan sequence in 30 fragments of 1000 nucleotides each moving from the 5 to 3 and then calculated the protein-rna interactions of each fragment with catrapid omics 3340 canonical and putative rna-binding proteins or rbps for a total 102000 interactions 18  proteins such as polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 ptbp1 uniprot p26599 showed the highest interaction propensity or z-score materials and methods at the 5 while others such as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein q hnrnpq o60506 showed the highest interaction propensity at the 3 in agreement with previous studies on coronaviruses  fig   4a  35  for each fragment we predicted the most significant interactions by filtering according to the z score we used three different thresholds in ascending order of stringency z  150 175 and 2 respectively and we removed from the list the proteins that were predicted to interact promiscuously with more than one fragment fragment 1 corresponds to the 5 and is the most contacted by rbps around 120 with z2 high-confidence interactions fig 4b  which is in agreement with the observation that highly structured regions attract a large number of proteins 14  indeed the 5 contains multiple stem loop structures that control rna replication and transcription 36 37  by contrast the 3 and fragment 23 spike s which are still structured but to a lesser extent attract fewer proteins 10 and 5 respectively while fragment 20 between orf1ab and spike s that is predicted to be unstructured does not have binding partners the interactome of each fragment was then analysed using clevergo a tool for gene ontology go enrichment analysis 38  proteins interacting with fragments 1 2 and 29 were associated with annotations related to viral processes  fig 4c  supp table 1  considering the three thresholds applied materials and methods we found 22 viral proteins for fragment 1 2 proteins for fragment 2 and 11 proteins for fragment 29 fig 4d  among the high-confidence interactors of fragment 1 we discovered rbps involved in positive regulation of viral processes and viral genome replication such as double-stranded rna-specific editase 1 adarb1 uniprot p78563 39  2-5-oligoadenylate synthase 2 oas2 p29728 and 2-5adependent ribonuclease rnasel q05823 interestingly 2-5-oligoadenylate synthase 2 oas2 has been reported to be upregulated in human alveolar adenocarcinoma a549 cells infected with sars-cov-2 log fold change of 42 p-value of 10 -9 and q-value of 10 -6  40  while double-stranded rna-specific adenosine deaminase adar p55265 is absent in our library due to its length that does not meet catrapid omics requirements 18  the omixcore extension of the algorithm specifically developed for large molecules 41 attributes the same binding propensity to both adarb1 and adar thus indicating that the interactions might occur materials and methods moreover experimental works indicate that the family of adar deaminases is active in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids derived from sars-cov-2 patients 42 and is upregulated in a549 cells infected with sars-cov-2 log fold change of 058 p-value of 10 -8 and q-value of 10 -5  40  we also identified proteins related to the establishment of integrated proviral latency including xray repair cross-complementing protein 5 xrcc5 p13010 and x-ray repair cross-complementing protein 6 xrcc6 p12956 fig 4b and 4e in accordance with our calculations comparison of a549 cells responses to sars-cov-2 and respiratory syncytial virus indicates upregulation of xrrc6 in sars-cov-2 log fold-change of 092 p-value of 0006 and q-value of 023 40  nucleolin ncl p19338 a protein known to be involved in coronavirus processing was also predicted to bind tightly to the 5 supp table 1 43  importantly we found proteins related to defence response to viruses such as atp-dependent rna helicase ddx1 q92499 that are involved in negative regulation of viral genome replication some dna-binding proteins such as cyclin-t1 ccnt1 o60563 zinc finger protein 175 znf175 q9y473 and prospero homeobox protein 1 prox1 q92786 were included because they could have potential rna-binding ability fig 4e 44  as for fragment 2 we found two canonical rbps more than simple scaffold elements gag proteins are versatile elements that bind to viral and host proteins as they traffic to the cell membrane supp table 1  45  analysis of functional annotations carried out with genemania 46 revealed that proteins interacting with the 5 of sars-cov-2 rna are associated with regulatory pathways involving notch2 myc and max that have been previously connected to viral infection processes  fig 4e 47 48  interestingly some proteins including ddx1 ccnt1 and znf175 for fragment 1 and trim32 for fragment 2 have been shown to be necessary for hiv functions and replication inside the cell  recently gordon et al reported a list of human proteins binding to open reading frames orfs translated from sars-cov-2 58  identified through affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry quantification 332 proteins from hek-293t cells interact with viral orf peptides by selecting 274 proteins binding at the 5 with z score 15 supp  table 1  of which 140 are exclusively interacting with fragment 1 fig 4b  we found that 8 are also reported in the list by gordon et al 58  which indicates significant enrichment representation factor of 25 p-value of 002 hypergeometric test with human proteome in background the fact that our list of protein- rna binding partners contains elements identified also in the protein-protein network analysis is not surprising as ribonucleoprotein complexes evolve together 14 and their components sustain each other through different types of interactions 16  we note that out of 332 interactions 60 are rbps as reported in uniprot 39  which represents a considerable fraction ie 20 considering that there are around 1500 rbps in the human proteome ie 6 and fully justified by the fact that they involve association with viral rna comparing the rbps present in gordon et al 58 table 2  interestingly srp72 larp7 and larp4b proteins assemble in stress granules 61 62 63 that are the targeted by rna viruses 53  we speculate that sequestration of these elements is orchestrated by a viral program aiming to recruit host genes 49 protein kinase a radixin rdx p35241 in addition to those mentioned above supp table 2  in the list of 274 proteins binding to the 5 fragment 1 with z score 15 we found 10 hits associated with hiv supp table 3 q06787 and rna polymerase-associated protein rtf1 homologue q92541 supp table 3  by contrast no significant enrichments were found for other viruses such as for instance ebola 65  among other targets in addition hvb-related targets are nuclear receptor subfamily 5 group a member 2 nr5a2 chembl3544 interferon-induced double-stranded rna-activated protein kinase eif2ak2 chembl5785 and srsf protein kinase 1 srpk1 chembl4375 we hope that this list can be the starting point for further pharmaceutical studies a number of proteins identified in our catrapid calculations have been previously reported to coalesce in large ribonucleoprotein assemblies such as stress granules among these proteins we found double-stranded rna-activated protein kinase eif2ak2 p19525 nucleolin ncl p19338 atp-dependent rna helicase ddx1 q92499 cyclin-t1 ccnt1 o60563 signal recognition particle subunit srp72 o76094 larp7 q4g0j3 and la-related protein 4b heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein q hnrnpq o60506 63  to further investigate the propensity of these proteins to phase separate in stress granules we used the catgranule algorithm materials and methods 66  we found that the 274 proteins binding to the 5 fragment 1 with z score 15 are highly prone to accumulate in stress-granules 274 proteins with the lowest z score are used in the comparison p-value00001 kolmogorov-smirnoff fig 4g  supp table   4  this finding is particularly relevant because rna viruses are known to antagonize stress granules formation 53  indeed the role of stress granules and processing bodies in translation suppression and rna decay have impact on virus replication 67  spreading using advanced computational approaches we investigated the structural content of sars-cov-2 rna and predicted human proteins that bind to it we employed cross 13 68 to compare the structural properties of 2800 coronaviruses and identified elements conserved in sars-cov-2 strains the regions containing the highest amount of structure are the 5 as well as glycoproteins spike s and membrane m we found that the spike s protein domain encompassing amino acids 330-500 is highly conserved across sars-cov-2 strains this result suggests that spike s must have evolved to specifically interact with its host partner ace2 30 and mutations increasing the binding affinity are highly infrequent as the nucleic acids encoding for this region are enriched in double-stranded content we speculate that the structure might attract host regulatory elements thus further constraining the variability the fact that the spike s region is highly conserved among all the analysed sars-cov-2 strains suggests that a specific drug can be designed against it to prevent interactions within the host by contrast the highly variable region at amino acids 243-302 in spike s protein corresponds to the binding site of sialic acids in mers-cov see manuscript by e milanetti et al 7 10 34 and could play a role in infection 33  the fact that the binding region changes in the different strains might indicate a variety of binding affinities for sialic acids which could provide clues on the specific responses in the human population interestingly the sialic acid binding site is absent in sars-cov but present in mers-cov which represents an important difference between the diseases both our sequence and structural analyses of spike s protein indicate high conservation among coronaviruses and suggest that human engineering of sars-cov-2 is highly unlikely using catrapid 18 19 we computed 100000 protein interactions with sars-cov-2 and found previously reported interactions such as polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 ptbp1 heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein q hnrnpq and nucleolin ncl 43  in addition we discovered that the highly structured region at the 5 has the largest number of protein partners including atp-dependent rna helicase ddx1 that was previously reported to be essential for hiv-1 and coronavirus ibv replication 5455  and the double-stranded rna-specific editases adar and adarb1 that catalyse the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine to inosine 49  other predicted interactions are xrcc5 and xrcc6 members of the hdp-rnp complex associating with atp-dependent rna helicase dhx9 69 as well as and 2-5a-dependent ribonuclease rnasel and 2-5-oligoadenylate synthase 2 oas2 that control viral rna degradation 70 71  interestingly ddx1 xrcc6 and oas2 are upregulated in human alveolar adenocarcinoma cells infected with sars-cov-2 40  in agreement with our predictions recent experimental work indicates that the family of adar deaminases is active in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids derived from sars-cov-2 patients 42  a significant overlap exists with the list of protein interactions reported by gordon et al 58  and among the candidate partners we identified akap8l involved as a deadh-box rna helicase binding protein involved in hiv infection 59  in general proteins associated with retroviral replication are expected to play different roles in sars-cov-2 as sars-cov-2 massively represses host gene expression 49  we hypothesize that the virus hijacks host pathways by recruiting transcriptional and post-transcriptional elements interacting with polymerase ii genes and splicing factors such as for instance a-kinase anchor protein 8-like akap8l and la-related protein 7 larp7 that is upregulated in human alveolar adenocarcinoma cells infected with sars-cov-2 40  the link to proteins previously studied in the context of hiv and other viruses if further confirmed fro is particularly relevant for the repurposing of existing drugs 65  the idea that sars-cov-2 sequesters different elements of the transcriptional machinery is particularly intriguing and is supported by the fact that a large number of proteins identified in our screening are found in stress granules 63  indeed stress granules protect the host innate immunity and are hijacked by viruses to favour their own replication 67  moreover as coronaviruses transcription uses discontinuous rna synthesis that involves high-frequency recombination 43  it is possible that pieces of the viruses resulting from a mechanism called defective interfering rnas 72 could act as scaffold to attract host proteins 14 15  we predicted the secondary structure of transcripts using cross computational recognition of secondary structure 13 68  cross was developed to perform high-throughput rna profiling the algorithm predicts the structural profile single-and double-stranded state at single-nucleotide resolution using sequence information only and without sequence length restrictions scores  0 indicate double stranded regions we used the vienna method 27 to further investigate the rna secondary structure of minima and maxima identified with cross 13  we used crossalign 1368 an algorithm based on dynamic time warping dtw to check and evaluate the structural conservation between different viral genomes 13  crossalign was previously employed to study the structural conservation of 5000 hiv genomes sars-cov-2 fragments 1000 nt not overlapping were searched inside other complete genomes using the obe open begin and end module in order to search a small profile inside a larger one the lower the structural distance the higher the structural similarities with a minimum of 0 for almost identical secondary structure profiles the significance is assessed as in the original publication 13  the fasta sequences of the complete genomes of sars-cov-2 were downloaded from virus pathogen resource vipr wwwviprbrcorg for a total of 62 strains regarding the overall coronaviruses the sequences were downloaded from ncbi selecting only complete genomes for a total of 2862 genomes the reference wuhan sequence with available annotation epiisl402119 was downloaded from global initiative on sharing all influenza data gisaid httpswwwgisaidorg interactions between each fragment of target sequence and the human proteome were predicted using catrapid omics 18 19  an algorithm that estimates the binding propensity of protein-rna pairs by combining secondary structure hydrogen bonding and van der waals contributions as  we used clustal w 28 for 62 sars-cov-2 strains alignments and t-coffee 32 for spike s proteins alignments the variability in the spike s region was measured by computing shannon entropy on translated rna sequences the shannon entropy is computed as follows sa  -sumi pai log pai where a correspond to the amino acid at the position i and pai is the frequency of a certain amino-acid a at position i of the sequence low entropy indicates poorly variability if pax  1 for one a and 0 for the rest then sx 0 by contrast if the frequencies of all amino acids are equally distributed the entropy reaches its maximum possible value catgranule 66 was employed to identify proteins assembling into biological condensates scores  0 indicate that a protein is prone to phase separate structural disorder nucleic acid binding propensity and amino acid patterns such as arginine-glycine and phenylalanine-glycine are key features combined in this computational approach 66  fig 1   cryo-em structures of hku2 and sads-cov spike glycoproteins provide insights into coronavirus evolution jinfang yu shuyuan qiao runyu guo xinquan wang   coronaviruses categorized into the order nidovirales family coronaviridae and subfamily coronavirinae are a large group of viral pathogens with a wide host range1 their infections in humans other mammals and birds can cause respiratory hepatic enteric and neurological diseases with varying severity2 the zoonotic transmission of novel coronaviruses into humans poses severe threats to the global health evidenced by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and the sars-cov-2 that is causing the ongoing pandemic covid-19 in the world136 in the meantime coronaviruses infecting domestic animals also bring substantial economic losses7 for example the swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus sads-cov also known as seacov and peav isolated in 2017 caused outbreaks of severe watery diarrhea of suckling piglets with a mortality up to 90 in several commercial pig farms in guangdong province of china813 sads-cov is an -coronavirus and other representative members in the -genus are porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus tgev porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv and human nl63 and 229e coronaviruses hcov-nl63 and hcov-229e1 representative members in other three genera include mouse hepatitis coronavirus mhv bovine coronavirus bcov sars-cov sars-cov-2 mers-cov hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 in the -genus avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv in the -genus and porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov in the -genus1 cross-species transmission promoted by genetic recombination andor mutations underlies the host range expansion of coronaviruses31416 bats are the natural reservoir of more than 30 different - and -coronaviruses that have great potential for interspecies transmission by recombination andor mutation151719 data on genetic evolution receptor binding and pathogenesis have demonstrated that human sars-cov and mers-cov most likely originate from bats1 palm civets and dromedary camels are the intermediate hosts of sars-cov and mers-cov from bats to humans respectively1 the newly identified porcine sads-cov isolates are also found to share 95 sequence identity with rhinolophus bat coronavirus hku2 and this further stressed the severe results of coronavirus spillover from bats to domestic animals813 however the molecular mechanisms underlying the transmission of sads-cov from bats to pigs are still unknown and need to be further explored recently it was shown that sads-cov is able to infect cells from a broad range of species including mouse chicken pig monkey and human indicating a high potential of the sads-cov for interspecies transmission20 the spike glycoprotein of coronaviruses mediates viral entry by binding host receptor with the s1 subunit and fusing viral and cellular membranes with the s2 subunit thereby determining viral host range and tissue tropism2122 as a class i viral fusion protein the spike exists on the envelope of virion as a homotrimer and each monomer contains more than 1000 amino acid residues that can be cleaved into s1 and s2 subunits21 for most coronaviruses the n-terminal domain ntd of the s1 subunit recognizes cell-surface carbohydrates while the c-terminal domain ctd specifically binds to cellular protein receptors2123 sars-cov sars-cov-2 and hcov-nl63 utilize ctd to bind human receptor ace22430 mers-cov utilizes ctd to bind human receptor dpp43132 and tgev prcv and 229e utilize ctd to bind receptor apn3335 hcov-oc43 utilizes ntd to recognize glycans36 and one exception is mhv which utilizes the ntd to bind mouse receptor ceacam1a3738 therefore the s1 subunit especially its ntd and ctd is the most variable region of the spike and is responsible for different tropisms of coronaviruses in comparison the s2 subunit containing the fusion peptide fp and heptad repeats hr1 and hr2 for membrane fusion are more conserved in both sequence and structure2122 for the sads-cov receptor analysis indicated that none of the known coronavirus protein receptors including ace2 dpp4 and apn are essential for cell entry1020 there are also no reports regarding the recognition of glycans by the ntd of sads-cov structural studies of the spike and its binding with glycans and protein receptors have provided important insights into the origin evolution and interspecies transmission of coronaviruses cryo-em structures of spike trimer from all four coronavirus genera have been reported the -coronavirus spike structures are determined for hcov-nl6339 hcov-229e34 pedv40 and fipv41 the -coronavirus spike structures are determined for mhv384243 hcov-hku144 hcov-oc4336 sars-cov244547 mers-cov454849 and sars-cov-25051 and the -coronavirus spike structure is determined for ibv52 and the -coronavirus spike structure is determined for pdcov5354 the cryo-em structures of bat coronavirus spike trimers have not been reported and only crystal structures of the ctd from hku455 hku556 and hku957 were determined the spikes of sads-cov 1130 amino acid residues and hku2 1128 amino acid residues are among the shortest coronavirus spike glycoproteins58 and their amino acid identities to other known coronavirus spikes are lower than 28 indicating the spikes of hku2 and sads-cov are unique81359 in this study we report the cryo-em structures of the sads-cov and hku2 spike trimers at 283 and 238  resolution respectively the hku2 spike trimer structure is the first one from bat coronavirus we analyze the hku2 and sads-cov trimer structures and also compare the ntd ctd sd1 and sd2 domains of the s1 subunit and the s2 subunit of hku2 with other spikes from - - - and -coronaviruses our results strongly support that hku2 and sads-cov preserve primitive structural features in their spikes that have a close evolutionary relationship with -coronavirus spikes and provide insights into the evolution and cross-species transmission of coronaviruses the cdnas encoding hku2 spike yp001552236 and sads-cov spike avm415691 were synthesized with codons optimized for insect cell expression hku2 ectodomains residues 11066 and sads-cov ectodomains residues 11068 were separately cloned into pfastbac-dual vector invitrogen with c-terminal foldon tag and strep tag after expression in hi5 insect cells and purification to homogeneity the cryo-em images on these two spike ectodomains were recorded using fei titan krios microscope operating at 300 kv with a gatan k2 summit direct electron detector supplementary fig 1 about 1400000 particles for hku2 spike and 900000 particles for sads-cov spike were subjected to 2d classification and a total of 421490 particles of hku2 spike and 152334 particles of sads-cov spike were selected and subjected to 3d refinement with c3 symmetry to generate density maps supplementary fig 2 the overall density maps were solved to 238  for hku2 spike and 283  for sads-cov spike gold-standard fourier shell correlation fsc  0143 supplementary figs 13 the atomic-resolution density map enabled us to build nearly all residues of hku2 spike ectodomains residues 17995 except for a few breaks residues 129141 and 203205 as well as 48 n-linked glycans and 71 water molecules supplementary figs 3a 4a and 5a the final refined model of sads-cov spike contains residues 19998 with some short breaks residues 8283 134143 and 488490 and 45 n-linked glycans supplementary figs 3b 4b and 5b data collection and refinement statistics for these two structures are listed in table 1 the overall structures of hku2 and sads-cov spikes we determined here resemble the previously reported prefusion structures of coronaviruses spikes both spike trimers have a mushroom-like shape 150  in height and 115  in width fig 1a consisting of a cap mainly formed by -sheets of the s1 subunit a central stalk mainly formed by -helices of the s2 subunit and a root formed by twisted -sheets and loops of the s2 subunit fig 1a in each trimer there is a c3 axis along the central stalk fig 1a the amino acid identity between hku2 and sads-cov spikes is 86 and these two spike structures are quite similar with the root mean square deviation rmsd being 053  for 962 aligned c atoms of the monomer and 056  for 2886 aligned c atoms of the trimer due to the high structural similarity we will use the hku2 structure to present the features of both spikes in the subsequent description whereas significant differences between them will be pointed out only when necessary the s1 subunit of the hku2 spike comprises two major domains ntd and ctd which are followed by two subdomains 1 and 2 sd1 and sd2 connecting them to the s2 subunit fig 1b c the s1 subunits from three monomers form the cap of the spike in which the three ctds in the inner part are at the apex sitting on top of the central stalk and the three ntds are located outside the ctds surrounding the central stalk fig 1a the ntd ctd sd1 and sd2 of the s1 subunit are all mainly composed of  strands fig 1c in contrast the upstream helix uh fp connecting region cr heptad repeat 1 hr1 and central helix ch of the s2 subunit are mainly composed of helices whereas the -hairpin bh and subdomain 3 sd3 at the bottom part of the s2 subunit mainly consist of  strands and loops fig 1c moreover the residues after the sd3 which contain the heptad repeat 2 hr2 are not resolved in the hku2 and sads-cov spike structures as well as in all other reported coronavirus spike structures in the prefusion state the sd1 and sd2 of the s1 subunit and the s2 subunit are highly similar in amino acid sequence 85 84 and 95 identities and structure c rmsd less than 05  between hku2 and sads-cov spikes supplementary fig 6 the ntd has the lowest sequence identity of 70 among all domains structural superimposition also gave a higher c rmsd value of 12  between these two ntds the core -sheet structure is structurally conserved and conformational variations reside in the loops supplementary fig 6a the ctd sequence identity between hku2 and sads-cov spikes is 82 and the c rmsd between these two ctds is 11  also indicating more structural variations in the ctd in comparison with the highly conserved sd1 sd2 and s2 subunit the ntd and ctd of the s1 subunit are commonly utilized by coronaviruses for binding cell-surface carbohydrates or protein receptors for cell attachment23 therefore the sequence andor structural variations indicate that hku2 and sads-cov would also bind different host receptors by ntd andor ctd of the s1 subunit although their receptors in bat and pig are unknown and the receptor-binding sites on spike have not been defined the ntd of hku2 has three layers of antiparallel -sheet with the top one consisting of six strands the middle one consisting of five strands and the bottom one consisting of three strands below the bottom sheet is a short -helix fig 2a the top and middle -sheets form a galectin-like -sandwich fold which is inserted between two strands of the bottom sheet fig 2a to supplement three disulfide bonds are detected in the hku2 ntd structure c17c56 connecting the n-terminus of the ntd to its upper loop c124c149 connecting 6 and 7 strands in the top sheet and c234c244 connecting the bottom helix to the bottom sheet fig 2a although the ntds of all coronaviruses adopt a similar overall architecture the ntd of hku2 has the highest structural similarity with the ntd1 named domain 0 in previous reports of -coronavirus hcov-nl63 with an rmsd of 27  for 186 aligned c atoms fig 2b and supplementary fig 8d the ntd1 of -coronavirus pedv is not completely modeled in the spike trimer structure however the partial model still fits well with the ntd of hku2 with an rmsd of 23  for 73 aligned c atoms both hcov-nl63 and pedv have a second ntd ntd2 also named domain a in previous reports and the ntd of hku2 is structurally less similar to the ntd2 with an rmsd of 43  against hcov-nl63 ntd2 and of 41  against pedv ntd2 fig 2b and supplementary fig 8d recent structural determination showed that another -coronavirus hcov-229e also has one ntd which is more structurally similar to the ntd2 c rmsd of 20  than the ntd1 c rmsd of 37  of hcov-nl63 fig 2c all above comparisons indicate that there are two subtypes of ntd in the -coronaviruses the subtype i is represented by the ntds of hku2 sads-cov the ntd1s of hcov-nl63 and pedv and the subtype ii is represented by the ntd of hcov-229e the ntd2s of hcov-nl63 and pedv fig 2b c although sharing an overall architecture these two ntd subtypes have a structural difference in the galectin-like -sandwich fold containing the top and middle sheets stacked together through hydrophobic interactions these two -sheets are well aligned in the galectin-like domain of subtype i whereas there is an alignment shift in the galectin-like domain of subtype ii fig 2b the other notable difference is the distribution of signature disulfide bonds a signature disulfide bond c124c149 numbered in hku2 and connecting 6 and 7 strands in the top sheet is conserved in all subtype i ntds fig 2b and the subtype ii ntds have two signature disulfide bonds the first one c145c168 numbered in hcov-229e connecting 5 and 6 strands and the second one c81c105 numbered in hcov-229e connecting 2 and neighbor loop fig 2c besides c234c244 numbered in hku2 and connecting the bottom helix to the bottom sheet is conserved in both subtype i and subtype ii ntds fig 2b c the ntds of -coronaviruses including bcov hcov-hku1 hcov-oc43 mers-cov sars-cov and mhv resemble the subtype i rather than the subtype ii ntd in the topology and distribution of the disulfide bonds fig 2d these -coronavirus ntds have additional loops in the n-terminus between 1 and 2 strands and between 6 and 7 strands numbered in hku2 structure forming an extensive ceiling-like structure on top of the galectin-like fold fig 2d it has been found that the evolvement of this ceiling-like structure has functional outcomes such as immune evasion or receptor binding52 the ntd of -coronavirus ibv also resemble the subtype i ntd in the topology although its disulfide bond positions are not conserved as in the subtype i ntd fig 2e of note the ntd of -coronavirus pdcov resemble the subtype ii ntd in the topology and distribution of the disulfide bonds fig 2f both ibv and pdcov ntds also have additional insertions including loops and short helices in the galectin-like fold compared with the two subtypes of ntd in -coronaviruses fig 2e f the ctd of hku2 has a twisted five-stranded antiparallel -sheet as the core with connecting loops between the strands fig 3a it contains four disulfide bonds c277c300 and c285c290 at the n-terminus c341c397 at the c-terminus and the last one c331c369 connecting the 2 and 5 strands in the core -sheet fig 3a interestingly the ctd core of hku2 is of high structural similarity with the conserved ctd core of -coronaviruses and the disulfide bonds in the ctd of hku2 except for c285c290 are also detected in all -coronavirus ctds fig 3b these ctds have the core of one twisted -sheet and here we name them as one-layer ctd subtype fig 3a b the -coronavirus ctds always have an insertion consisting of loops andor strands between the 5 and 6 strands of the core fig 3b sars-cov26 sars-cov-22730 mers-cov3132 hku455 and hku556 have receptor-binding motif rbm in this insertion region responsible for binding their respective protein receptors in the ctd of hku2 there is only one short loop between the 5 and 6 strands of the core twisted -sheet fig 3a although as members in the -genus hku2 and sads-cov ctd structures are significantly different from those of other -coronaviruses hcov-nl63 hcov-229e pedv tgev and prcv that contain two layers of -sheets fig 3c and we named these ctds as two-layer ctd subtype all available two-layer ctd structures can be well aligned with c rmsd in the range of 1034  these two-layer ctds contain two highly conserved disulfide bonds c540c586 and c569c596 numbered in pedv ctd fig 3c the c569c596 is conserved among all coronaviruses whereas the c540c586 is conserved in all -coronaviruses except for hku2 and sads and -coronavirus pdcov fig 3c the ctd of -coronavirus pdcov has a core of two -sheets belonging to the two-layer ctd subtype fig 3c as for the -coronavirus ibv the core of its ctd is also similar to the typical two-layer ctd fig 3c however several  strands are replaced by loops and the disulfide bonds are in different positions from the two-layer ctd fig 3c ibv ctd also has an extra region of loops reminiscent of the extra domain in the ctds of -coronaviruses fig 3c the sd1 and sd2 are two subdomains following the ctd in the s1 subunit linking the ctd to the s2 subunit the hku2 sd1 is a partial  barrel consisting of five  strands and a disulfide bond c409c458 connecting its c-terminus to the 1 strand fig 4a this five-stranded  barrel and the linking disulfide bond are conserved among all four genera of coronavirus fig 4a the hku2 sd2 has a structure of two layers of -sheet with an additional short -helix over the top sheet fig 4b the additional -helix and the top sheet is linked by a disulfide bond c482c509 and another disulfide bond c524c533 links the c-terminal loop to the bottom sheet fig 4b the two-layer core structure and the second disulfide bond are conserved among all genera of coronavirus however the additional -helix and the first linking disulfide bond is a distinct feature of -coronaviruses plus -coronavirus hku2 and sads-cov fig 4b this additional helix appears to be an insertion between the 2 and 3 strands of the sd2 and is retained during evolution of -coronaviruses it has been observed that coronaviruses have two types of quaternary packing mode of the s1 subunits in the trimer intrasubunit packing and cross-subunit packing52 actually this is mainly caused by different positioning and interaction between ntd and ctd in the spike monomer the hku2 s1 subunit similar to those in -coronaviruses hcov-nl63 hcov-229e and pedv and -coronavirus pdcov has an inward ctd that contacts with the ntd fig 5a the three structural ntdctd modules in the cap region of these spikes are composed of ntd and ctd from the same monomer forming the intrasubunit packing in the spike trimer fig 5a the s1 subunits of other coronaviruses in the - and -genera including mhv sars-cov mers-cov hcov-oc43 and ibv have an outward ctd that is far away from the ntd fig 5b therefore the three structural ntdctd modules in the cap region of these spikes have the ntd from one monomer and the ctd from the adjacent monomer forming the cross-subunit packing in the spike trimer fig 5b interestingly we found that the outward ctds always have an insertion in the core structure such as -coronavirus ctds and -coronavirus ibv ctd fig 5b in contrast all inward ctds only have the one-layer or two-layer core structure without obvious inserted region sequence analysis suggested that the s1s2 protease cleavage site at the boundary between the s1 and s2 subunits is r544-m545 in hku2 spike and r546-m547 in sads-cov spike81159 compared with the s1 subunit the topology and structure of s2 subunit are highly conserved in all coronavirus spikes the hku2 s2 subunit contains a 3-helix uh residues 589639 an fp helix residues 672684 a cr residues 689747 a 4-helix hr1 residues 748836 a ch residues 837887 a twisted bh residues 888929 and a -sandwich like sd3 residues 930995 figs 1b and 6a like in other coronavirus spikes in the prefusion state the model of hr2 after sd3 was not built in the structure due to poor density five disulfide bonds in s2 are detected two of them c590c612 and c595c601 stabilize the folded helices of uh c696c706 bends the cr c884c895 links the ch and the bh and c934c943 is within the sd3 fig 6a the first four disulfide bonds are conserved in all coronaviruses and the last one in the sd3 has different positions in different spikes specifically it links the 2 and 3 strands of sd3 in the spikes of hku2 sads-cov and mers-cov numbered in mers-cov and in other coronavirus spikes it links the 2 strand to the c-terminal loop of sd3 numbered in mers-cov supplementary fig 7 all coronavirus spikes have the s2 protease site upstream from the fp in the s2 subunit which is essential for proteolytic fusion activation of the spike receptor binding and cleavage at the s2 site promote large-scale conformational changes of the fp cr hr1 and hr2 allowing the insertion of fp into host cell membrane and the formation of six-helix bundle the fp and cr which are often not well and totally resolved in other coronavirus spike structures can be clearly modeled in the hku2 spike due to the atomic resolution of the map supplementary fig 5 the typical cr in the s2 subunit contains three helices and one short strand with a disulfide bond bending the first and second helix to form a turn fig 6b in hku2 the second helix is replaced by a short strand 713716 and the third helix is replaced by a loop 721741 therefore there are two short strands and only one helix in hku2 cr fig 6c the conserved disulfide bond c696c706 makes the first helix of cr in hku2 spike turn upside down the s2 cleavage site between r671 and s672 is then covered by the reversed cr helix and loops and r671 interacts with e723 in the loop and k697 and k698 in helix 1 fig 6c in other coronaviruses taking the mhv s2 for example the helix 1 does not cover the s2 site between r869 and s870 and r869 only loosely interacts with t929 in helix 3 fig 6b after the dissociation of the s1 subunit triggered by receptor binding the exposure of the s2 site for cleavage is a prerequisite for the proteolytic activation of the coronavirus spike to mediate membrane fusion the buried s2 site indicates that hku2 spike compared with other coronavirus spikes would require more conformational changes around the s2 site for the exposure a porcine coronavirus sads-cov also named seacov and peav in other reports was recently identified from suckling piglets with diarrhea in southern china and its genome sequence was most identical 95 identity to that of rhinolophus bat -coronavirus hku2813 the sads-cov and hku2 are phylogenetically located in a sublineage closely related to the proposed -coronavirus group-1b lineage at the complete genome level813 however phylogenetic analysis based on the spike glycoprotein indicated that they are members of a separate lineage clustered within -coronavirus supplementary fig 8a suggesting that hku2 and sads-cov probably resulted from recombination of an -coronavirus with an unrecognized -coronavirus s gene813 these results together with the lower than 28 amino acid identities to other known coronavirus glycoproteins strongly indicate that the spike glycoproteins of hku2 and sads-cov are unique813 in this study we determined the cryo-em structures of hku2 and sads-cov spike glycoproteins at atomic resolutions pairwise comparisons demonstrated nearly identical overall structures and differences mainly locate in the loops of ntd and ctd of the s1 subunit between the spikes of hku2 and sads-cov supplementary fig 6 a series of structural analysis and comparisons were also performed at the domain level between hku2 spike with other coronavirus spikes with determined structures our results show that hku2 and sads-cov spikes maintain primitive structural features especially in the ntd and ctd and provide more insights into the evolution of coronaviruses the hku2 and sads-cov have one ntd in the s1 subunit and their structures are more similar to the ntd1 than the ntd2 of -coronaviruses hcov-nl63 and pedv whereas the only ntd of hcov-229e is structurally more similar to the ntd2 than the ntd1 fig 2 therefore we suggest that -coronaviruses have two subtypes of ntd the evolution relationship between them are not clear yet it was once suggested that the presence of two ntds in hcov-nl63 is a result of gene duplication39 however the sequence identity between these two ntds is only 157 in hcov-nl63 and 129 in pedv considering that hku2 sads-cov and hcov-229e have one ntd belonging to either subtype i or subtype ii a more plausible evolution way of the ntd in -coronaviruses is the recombination of two separate primitive domains into the genome resulting in the presence of two ntds in the s1 subunit of -coronaviruses including hcov-nl63 and pedv of note these two ntd subtypes may represent primitive structures that could be the evolutionary ancestors of ntds of other genera coronaviruses for example in the current available spike structures the ntds of -coronavirus are similar to the hku2 ntd representing the subtype i in both architecture and disulfide bond positions these -coronavirus ntds also have additional loop ceiling over the top sheet functionally facilitating immune evasion or protein receptor binding such as in mhv3738 the ntd of -coronavirus ibv is also architecturally similar to the subtype i although the disulfide bond positions are not conserved fig 2e in contrast the -coronavirus pdcov ntd is similar to the hcov-229e ntd representing the subtype ii in both architecture and disulfide bond positions fig 2f a previous study of the ibv spike proposed that -coronavirus ntds are probably the most ancestral and the ntds of the four genera form an evolutionary spectrum in the order of - - - and -genus52 our proposal here is similar to the previous one in the point that two ntd subtypes in -coronaviruses may represent primitive structures that could be the evolutionary ancestors of ntds however we argue that the evolution pathways may not be in the order of - - - and -genus a more plausible pathway is that the - - and -coronavirus ntds may evolve independently and parallelly from subtype i - and -coronavirus ntds or subtype ii -coronavirus ntds supplementary fig 8b the hku2 and sads-cov ctd structure has a one-layer core consisting of a twisted five-stranded antiparallel -sheet interestingly -coronavirus ctds also have the similar one-layer core structure and three strictly conserved disulfide bonds are also present in the core of hku2 ctd currently all identified rbm of -coronavirus ctds are within an inserted domain between two strands of the core sheet and this insertion responsible for receptor binding of -coronaviruses is replaced by a short loop in hku2 ctd this result firstly indicates hku2 ctd represent a primitive structure in the one-layer ctd family while the inserted domain in -coronaviruses results from a recombinant event during evolution supplementary fig 8c the second indication is that hku2 and sads-cov may not utilize the ctd to bind protein receptors that have not been identified yet and their different receptor usage may be determined by the ntd that harbors almost 50 of residue difference between them of note the ctds from other -coronaviruses -coronavirus ibv and -coronavirus pdcov all belong to the two-layer subtype consisting of two layers -sheets although with structural variations in different viruses these results further confirmed the previous phylogenetic analysis suggesting that hku2 and sads-cov probably resulted from a recombination of an -coronavirus genomic backbone with an unrecognized -coronavirus spike gene81159 in contrast with the ntd and ctd having unique structural features the sd1 and sd2 of the s1 subunit and the s2 subunits of hku2 and sads-cov are structurally conserved as those of other coronaviruses in the evolutionary aspect it is not surprising because this region either connects the ctd to the s2 subunit sd1 and sd2 or mediates the membrane fusion s2 subunits whereas the ntd and ctd are key factors determining tissue tropism and host range of coronaviruses23 even highly conserved in overall structure the s2 subunit in hku2 and sads-cov still have a secondary structure arrangement in the cr after the fp resulting in a more buried s2 cleavage site fig 6c it indicates that although the membrane fusion mechanism is highly conserved the dynamic fusion procedures of hku2 and sads-cov may still have their unique features that need to be addressed in the future the ongoing covid-19 pandemic caused by sars-cov-2 has raised worldwide alert46 we compared the domain structures of hku2 and sars-cov-2 s proteins supplementary fig 9 the ntd of sars-cov-2 has the two conserved disulfide bonds in subtype i the ctd core of sars-cov-2 has one layer of -sheets the sd1 and sd2 of sars-cov-2 have the same disulfide bonds with hku2 although the additional helix of sd2 is not built in the sars-cov-2 s model owing to poor density in this region sars-cov-2 has the typical -coronavirus structural features in each domain and the inserted rbm in the ctd could be the major impetus for cross-species transmission from bats to human in comparing the structures of hku2 and sads-cov spikes with other coronavirus spikes we observed that additional ntds could be recombined ceiling loops could be inserted into ntd core and extra domain containing rbm could be inserted into the ctd core structure these phenomena indicate the subdomains are gradually recruited into the s1 subunit during evolution and the recruitments are required for cross-species transmission adapting to different host range and responding to the updating of host immune system which provides a vivid example for the co-evolution of virus and host the cdnas encoding hku2 spike yp001552236

linked to this article  role of changes in sars-cov-2 spike protein in the interaction with the human ace2 receptor an in silico analysis joseph ortega thomas maria serrano luisa flor pujol helene hector rangel rafael   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov middle eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and the recently identified novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 belong to the coronaviridae family genus betacoronavirus that has been related to important epidemiological outbreaks these are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-strand rna of around 32 kb the viral particles contain four main structural proteins the spike membrane envelope protein and nucleocapsid the spike protein protrudes from the envelope of the virion and plays a pivotal role in the receptor host selectivity and cellular attachment strong scientific evidence showed that sars and sars-cov-2 spike proteins interact with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 chen et al 20202 wan et al 202016 also other cellular receptors play a secondary role in the viral attachment as the c-type lectin cd209l and dc-sign binds to sars-cov however ace2 appears to be the key functional receptor for the sars-cov coutard et al 20203 satija and lal 200712 and probably for sars-cov-2 walls et al 202015 the interaction between the viral protein and its cell membrane receptor is a critical step in the replication cycle furthermore the efficiency of viral infection is strongly dependent on this process several physicochemical factors are associated with protein-protein interactions these factors are determined by the nature of residues and the type of chemical interactions occurring between ligand and receptor thus the presence of residues that produce an energetically favored interaction lower free energy may drive binding kinetics and finally lead to the fusion event based on that this study aimed to evaluate the energetic profile of the interaction between the sars-cov-2 spike protein and the human cell receptor ace2 sequences analyzed were individually retrieved from genbank accession numbers are shown in the phylogenetic tree see figure 1fig 1 the sequence used for the modeling process and construct the spike protein model of sars-cov2 were obtained from the protein database and correspond to 6acc sars spike protein and 6acd bat-spike protein homology structural models of viral spike protein from sars-cov-2 qho621121 and bat-cov aaz670521 were built by using the tools of the swiss-model modeling server and the deepviewswiss-pdbviewer 401 software arnold et al 20061 several models were obtained and the quality of each structure was evaluated the best model for sars-cov-2 spike was obtained using the crystal structure of sars-cov spike protein pdb code 6acc on the other hand for bat-cov the best model was obtained using as template the crystal structure pdb code 6acd these models were subjected to further protein structure optimization hydrogen atoms were added and the partial charges were assigned for energy refinement the protein model was embedded in a 100  water box then energy minimization was performed while applying constraints to the protein backbone to preserve global folding and optimizing the relative position of the water molecules and protein the obtained systems underwent md simulations using namd as described by ortega et al 20198 all md simulations described in this study were performed with namd 212 phillips et al 200510 vega zz 31021 pedretti et al 20049 charmm force field vanommeslaeghe et al 201014 and gasteiger charges were used the obtained structures represent the lowest energy frame of the md simulations the quality of the models was established with prosa wiederstein and sippl 200717 and procheck programs laskowski et al 19934 crystal structure for sars-cov spike pdb code 6ack and ace2 pdb code 1r42 were downloaded from the protein data bank also the homology model for sars-cov-2 spike was assayed protein preparation was carried out as described above then binding patterns and affinity estimations for the interaction between the viral spike and ace2 receptor were performed using molecular docking this process was performed through two steps first a blind docking between ligand spike protein and receptor ace2 was performed using z-dock software pierce et al 201411 then the resulting docking data were processed and analyzed by using the tools of prodigy software xue et al 201619 finally results were clustered and analyzed considering binding energies and main interacting residues in each complex phylogenetic analysis of the spike protein sequences of sars-cov-2 and bat-covs sars-cov is shown in figure 1fig 1 the results are in agreement with recent reports of an independent introduction of sars-cov-2 from a bat-cov different from the spillover which led to the introduction of sars-cov being the bat-cov of rhinolophus affinis the probable ancestor of this new virus wong et al 202018 indeed the sequences of the whole spike of this bat-cov and of sars-cov-2 share 977  identity figure 1fig 1 more divergence is found however in the s1 subunit particularly in the receptor binding domain rbd of the different spike proteins sars-cov and bat-cov from rhinolophus sinicus originally signaled as the most closely related virus to sars-cov-2 exhibit several amino acid substitutions and deletions in the rbd compared to sars-cov-2 the rbd of bat-cov from rhinolophus affinis although more closely related to the one of sas-cov-2 also displayed several amino acid substitutions figure 2fig 2 the crystal structures of the spike protein of sars-cov and homology models of bat-cov accession number mg772933 bat-cov of rhinolophus sinicus and sars-cov-2 interacting with the putative binding domain site in human ace2 were analyzed the interaction pattern between the three viral spikes is quite similar the main region of interaction with the putative cellular receptor counter-part is formed by fifteen residues ordered into a beta-sheet conformation surrounded by two capping loops figure 3fig 3 and supplementary figure 1 interestingly sequence comparison between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov revealed that the residues present in the receptor-interacting motive are highly conserved with 70  identity sharing nine residues between both viruses in the sars-cov rbd are present residues that allowed the interspecies infection known as y442 l472 n479 d480 and t487 lu et al 20156 however in sars-cov-2 slight modification of some residues could improve the interaction with the human cellular receptor l455 f486 q493 and n501 in sars-cov two main residues 479 and 487 have been associated to the recognition of the human ace2 receptor lu et al 20156 these residues suffered a punctual mutation from civet to human k479n and s487t li 20135 in the sars-cov-2 the residues corresponding to n479 correspond to q493 and t487 to n501 these changes in the sars-cov-2 represent energetically favorable changes for the interaction with the receptor the local environment present in the ace2 receptor allows these mutations to produce a significant number of electrostatic stabilizing interactions table 1tab 1 furthermore as mentioned previously the presence of the two capping loops in the binding domain is likely producing a stabilization effect over the interaction with the cellular receptor our models showed that these capping loops appear in both human-infecting viruses but are absent in the bat virus the data showed here strongly suggest that these capping loops produce an increase in the electrostatic interactions between the spike protein and the cellular receptor in sars-cov the residues present in these capping loops showing direct interaction with the receptor are r426 s432 t433 y436 p462 d463 s472 and n473 and in sars-cov-2 are v445 y449 y473 q474 a475 e484 g485 f486 and n487 the counter-pairs located in the ace2 receptor are shown in table 1tab 1 altogether the higher number of protein-protein contacts table 2tab 2 and the longer capping loops could explain the increase in binding affinities in sars-cov-2 -157 kcalmol in comparison with sars-cov -141 kcalmol table 3tab 3 thus these loops could play an important role together with the punctual mutations being an interesting clue to determine the host receptor specificity for the viral spike protein several amino acid substitutions in rbd were identified in the sars-cov-2 rbd compared to bat-sars-covs and sars-cov mutations in the spike protein could change the tropism of a virus including new hosts or increasing viral pathogenesis shang et al 202013 hiv infection is a good model of change in viral tropism by mutations in the envelope proteins these mutations switch co-receptor use ccr5 to cxcr4 increasing the viral pathogenesis mosier 20097 interestingly our data showed that these changes are not only related to the ability of interaction with the human ace2 receptor but also for improving this receptor recognition the presence of two loops around the rbd of sars-cov-2 might be promoting the interaction with the ace2 receptor improving the binding to this receptor by increasing the number of atoms involved tables 1tab 1 and 2tab 2 the amino acid substitutions and the longer capping loops could explain the increase in binding affinities in sars-cov-2 compared to sars-cov table 1tab 1 higher affinity values might be related to the dynamic of infection and the rapid spread observed for this virus the origin of the sars-cov-2 has been not fully elucidated while this study was in course another study of wong et al 202018 showed a high similarity at protein level in the rbd among the coronaviruses isolated from the recent outbreak sars-cov-2 those isolated from pangolin and rhinolophus affinis ratg13 the authors also suggest that pangolin might be the intermediate host with a 98  identity with the human virus at the receptor binding motif between the bat and human the spike model of ratg13 is quite similar to that obtained from sars-cov and sars-cov-2 and the loops in the rbd are also present data not shown the protein sequence of the receptor binding motif has 5 important amino acids when comparing the sequence of sars-cov-2 with that of the isolated viruses of pangolin and rhinolophus affinis 1 and 4 differences are observed respectively in the amino acids considered key for the union with ace2 yan et al 202020 wong et al 202018 these differences should mean slightly less favorable binding energies between these viruses with ace2 compared to the sars-cov-2 shown in this study thus the loops observed in the spike protein of sars-cov-2 could play an important role together with the amino acid substitutions being an interesting clue to determine the host receptor specificity for the viral spike protein altogether structural changes and residues composition in the viral spike protein could be associated with increased infection kinetics and viral spreading comparative studies to determine the impact in vitro of the mutation and loops in rbd of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 are required in order to predict possible zoonotic event in the future  exploring the genomic and proteomic variations of sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein a computational biology approach syed lokman mohammad md

2020 who world health organization 2020 the virus causing covid-19 is named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 based on the phylogenetic studies the sars-cov-2 is categorized as a member of the genus betacoronavirus the same lineage that includes sars coronavirus sars-cov gorbalenya 2020 that caused sars severe acute respiratory syndrome in china during 2002 ksiazek et al 2003 recent studies showed that sars-cov-2 has a close relationship with bat sars-like covs li et al 2005 zhou et al 2020 though the intermediate hosts for zoonotic transmission of sars-cov-2 from bats to humans remain undiscovered sars-cov-2 has been identified as an enveloped single-stranded positive-sense rna virus with a genome size of approximately 299 kb encoding 27 proteins from 14 orfs including 15 non-structural 8 accessory and 4 major structural proteins two-thirds of the viral rna harbours the first orf orf1ab dedicated for translating polyprotein 1a pp1a and polyprotein 1ab pp1ab which later undergo proteolytic cleavage to form 15 non-structural proteins spike glycoprotein s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n are the four major structural proteins of sars-cov-2 wu et al 2020a wu et al 2020b interestingly s glycoprotein is characterized as the critical determinant for viral entry into host cells which consists of two functional subunits namely s1 and s2 the s1 subunit recognizes and binds to the host receptor through the receptor-binding domain rbd whereas s2 is responsible for fusion with the host cell membrane wrapp et al 2020 walls et al 2020 chen et al 2020 mers-cov uses dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp4 as entry receptor raj et al 2013 whereas sars-cov and sars-cov-2 utilize ace-2 angiotensin converting enzyme-2 li et al 2003 abundantly available in lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes suggesting s glycoprotein as a potential drug target to halt the entry of sars-cov-2 letko et al 2020 according to recent reports neutralizing antibodies are generated in response to the entry and fusion of surface-exposed s protein mainly rbd domain which is predicted to be an important target for vaccine candidates chen et al

spike protein a 1273 amino acid long glycoprotein having multiple domains possibly plays a major role in sars-cov-2 pathogenesis viral entry to the host cell is initiated by the receptor-binding

 only one variant was found out of only one available sequence in the repository from sweden australia south korea and peru interestingly all sequences are unique among countries from the sequence reported except d614g which was found in the us and peru fig 5 moreover we have also analyzed sequences from brazil italy nepal pakistan spain taiwan and vietnam but there is no variation in the s glycoprotein sequence was found when compared to refseq yp009724390 covid 19 is one of the most contagious pandemics the world has ever had with 1250000 confirmed cases to date april 4 2020 and the cases have increased as high as 5 times in less than a month who world health organization 2020 phylogenetic analysis showed that the sars-cov-2 is a unique coronavirus presumably related to bat coronavirus bm4831 hp-betacoronavirus during this study we investigated the available genomes of sars-cov-2 and found variations in 483 positions resulting in 130 synonymous and 228 non-synonymous variants out of them 25 non-synonymous variants were observed in the spike protein of sars-cov-2 viral spike protein is thought to have a crucial role in drug and vaccine development as reported previously in managing the viruses like sars-cov and mers-cov tian et al nd kapadia et al 2005 elshabrawy et al 2012 du et al 2013 likewise a number of studies targeting sars-cov-2 spike protein have been undertaken for the therapeutic measures xia et al 2020 but the unique structural and functional details of sars-cov-2 spike protein are still under scrutiny we also found a variant r408i at receptor binding domain rbd that mutated from positively charged arginine residue to neutral and smaller sized isoleucine residue fig 4 i this change might alter the interaction of viral rbd with the host receptor because the r408 residue of sars-cov-2 is known to interact with the ace2 receptor for viral entry ortega et al 2020 similarly alterations of rbd g476s v483a h519q and a520s also could affect the interaction of sars-cov-2 spike protein with other molecules which require further investigations qia98583 and qis30615 variants were found to have an alteration of alanine to valine a930v and aspartic acid to tyrosine d936y respectively in the alpha helix of the hr1 domain previous reports have indicated that hr1 domain plays a significant role in viral fusion and entry by forming helical bundles with hr2 and mutations including alanine substitution by valine a1168v in hr1 region are predominantly responsible for conferring resistance to mouse hepatitis coronaviruses against hr2 derived peptide entry inhibitors bosch et al 2008 this study hypothesizes the mutation a930v found in that of sars-cov-2 might also have a role in the emergence of drug-resistance virus strains also the mutation d1168h found in the heptad repeat 2 hr sars-cov-2 could play a vital role in viral pathogenesis moreover we found that 20 variants including one deletion out of 26 were located within s1 especially within ntd and rbd region of glycoprotein s fig 4a which region is responsible for the preliminary interaction with the host cell receptor ace2 this indicates that the ntd and rbd are very prone to mutations however the ntd and rbd portions harbour potential epitopes that might serve as potential peptide vaccine candidates against sars-cov-2 as reported in different studies bhattacharya et al 2020 rasheed et al 2020 rahman et al 2020 the reason behind choosing the sequences from s protein domain ntd and rbd is they are situated in the outer surface of the virus that could be more accessible for the immune system fig 3c so the variations reported herein within the outer domains of s glycoprotein could help to design effective epitope-based vaccines or antivirals the sars-cov-2 s protein contains additional furin protease cleavage site prrars in s1s2 domain which is conserved among all 320 sequences as revealed during this study supplementary fig 3 this unique signature is thought to make the sars-cov-2 more virulent than sars-cov and regarded as novel features of the viral pathogenesis walls et al 2020 according to previous reports the more the host cell protease can process the coronavirus s can accelerate viral tropism accordingly in influenza virus walls et al 2020 klenk and garten 1994 steinhauer 1999 millet and whittaker 2015 apart from that this could also promote viruses to escape antiviral therapies targeting transmembrane protease tmprss2 clinicaltrialsgov nct04321096 which is well reported protease to cleave at s1s2 of s glycoprotein fehr and perlman 2015 comparative analyses between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein showed 77 similarity between them where the most diverse region was the n-terminal domain and receptor binding domain the insertion of 17 additional amino acid residues in the n-terminal domain of sars-cov-2 and its high sequence diversity suggests that it may have a role in binding with other cell receptors in humans this is because the n-terminal domain could function as the receptor-binding domain of various coronaviruses receptor recognition mechanisms of coronaviruses a decade of structural studies 2020 yuan et al 2017 a similar phenomenon has been observed in mouse hepatitis coronavirus mhv and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus tgev where the n-terminal domain is reported to be attached with the host entry receptor williams et al 1991 delmas et al 1992 the spatial distribution of variations in amino acid sequences of s glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 showed that 17 variations out of 26 found among the sequences deposited from the us but there are 7 unique variations found among sequences from 5 countries from 4 continents namely australia europe latin america and asia out of 6 sequences available during the study period fig 5 although the number of sequences analyzed herein is too small to speculate the exact trend of s glycoprotein evolution these variants might play a vital role in adaptation to a new geospatial environment the variation analyses in amino acids indicated the structural features of different domains of the sars-cov-2 spike proteins the variations have multiple effects on the structure resulting in change in stability favoring various interactions and conformational diversity an augmented infection kinetics and viral spreading may have association with the structural changes and composition of residues in the viral spike protein however to identify the actual role of involvement of s glycoprotein a larger dataset regarding genomics and proteomics of sars-cov-2 is required as this protein is vital to understand the viral pathogenicity evolution and development of therapeutics further analyses of all the s glycoprotein and sars-cov-2 genomes with different epidemiological aspects is warranted to get the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 syed mohammad lokman draft writing visualization formal analysis data curation writing

peptide inhibitor of sars-cov-2 targeting its entry into the host cells mirza baig s manikandan alagumuthu sajjan rajpoot uzma saqib    the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 outbreak has posed a great challenge to human health during the past 2 decades we have encountered the outbreak of many deadly viruses such as ebola 1 zika 2 and nipah 3 4 as well as the evolution of various strains of coronaviruses cov mainly sars-cov 5 and mers-cov 6 which resulted in high morbidity and mortality after almost 100 years of the deadly influenza virus h1n1 or spanish flu pandemic with millions of deaths worldwide approximately 40 million 7 8 the recent outbreak of a novel cov or sars-cov-2 has left the entire world in helplessness and misery the clinical spectrum of covid-19 ranges from mild fever cough and shortness of breath to severe clinical conditions characterized by respiratory failure 9 10 old age together with pre-existing conditions such as lung or heart disease diabetes or a compromised immune system expedite the infection time and severity 11 12 multiple recent reviews 13 14 could brief-up the statistical dynamics of covid-19 cases worldwide structurally the cov has the largest known rna genome 2632 kb among other known viruses characterized by non-segmented positive-sense single-stranded rna this genome encodes four major structural proteins of the virus including the nucleocapsid n envelope e membrane m and spike s proteins 15 16 the membrane and envelope proteins are associated with virus assembly while the spike protein plays the main role in facilitating virus entry via mediating its interaction with the transmembrane surface receptor on the host cells 15 17 the spike protein directly interacts with the peptidase domain pd of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor 18 19 which technically marks the virus entry inside the cells 20 the sars-cov-2 shares around 80 sequence identity with the sars-cov genome suggesting similarity in their host interacting functions 21 22 like sars-cov the spike protein of sars-cov-2 contains s1 and s2 subunits which are jointly responsible for fusion and entry of the virus 2325 inside the host cells the receptor-binding domain rbd in the s1 subunit initiates direct binding with the ace2 pd whereas the s2 subunit contains basic elements needed for the membrane fusion 19 20 23 24 ace2 a single-pass type i transmembrane metallocarboxypeptidase enzyme is primarily involved in the maturation of peptide hormone angiotensin ang which in turn regulates the vasoconstriction and blood pressure 19 26 27 ace2 is primarily expressed in alveolar epithelial type ii cells and serves as a viral receptor 28 29 besides alveolar epithelial type ii cells it is also expressed in several extrapulmonary tissues including the heart kidney and intestine 26 30 the full-length structure of ace2 consists of two main domainsthe n-terminal pd and the collectrin-like domain cld at the c-terminal end 19 3032 in fact the spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 binds to the homodimer of ace2 which facilitates virus entry into the host cells 19 33 in addition to this studies have been conducted in association with ace2 and the amino acid transporter b0at1 or slc6a19 and how sars-cov-2 may bind to the ace2-b0at1 complex 19 34 ace2 interaction with b0at1 could aid in producing antivirals or a vaccine that can block cov infection by targeting ace2 3538 with the current epidemiology of sars-cov-2 a vaccine might be considered a highly anticipated therapy however given that vaccine development and production is a highly challenging and time-consuming task the need of the hour is to develop potent therapeutic agents that could effectively curb the infection in the early stages several approaches such as decoy-soluble ace2 proteins antibodies from the serum of infected patients epitope-based vaccines repurposing of drugs and designing blocking peptides are underway 3946 peptides possess several attractive features when compared with small molecules and protein therapeutics including high structural compatibility with target proteins the ability to disrupt proteinprotein interfaces etc computational tools ease the way to reach a therapeutic solution for covid-19 currently the computational analysis of structural differences in human ace2 impact its binding to the sarscov2 spike protein which thereby lays a foundation for the design and development of ace2-based peptide inhibitors of sars-cov-2 4749 in the current study we used computational biology tools to develop a therapeutic strategy utilizing a novel peptide by exploiting the sars-cov-2ace2 interaction the protein sequence of sars-cov-2 was retrieved from the rcsb protein data bank pdb id 6m17 for peptide design and development initially a stretch of 23 amino acid residues glu23 to leu45 was taken from ace pd pdb 6m17 and saved as pdb using the build structure module in discovery studio visualizer biovia ds 2019 50 this sequence was further optimized for geometry using the minimize functionality in the ucsf chimera software 51 we performed alanine scanning to better understand the individual roles of the residues within the 23-amino acid peptide in binding with sars-cov-2 alanine substitution of each residue was performed using biovia discovery studio 2020 software 50 each peptide was then modeled and energy minimized using ucsf chimera software 51 we also truncated five residues from the n-terminal end of the 23-amino acid 23aa peptide to get a shorter 18-amino acids peptide phe28 to leu45 this peptide was further energy minimized using the method described above the crystal structure of the sars-cov-2 spike protein-ace2 pdb id 6m17 complex was retrieved from the protein data bank httpswwwrcsborg and used as the starting point for the docking studies molecular docking was performed using pydock httpslifebscespidpydockweb 52 haddock 24 53 and zdock 54 servers to validate the results for each program which in turn should be mutually correlated the docking results were analyzed using the chimera 51 and ds visualizer programs 50 the results obtained were analyzed for binding energies and peptide conformations in the sars-cov-2 spike protein binding interface molecular dynamics md simulations were performed at 50 ns for the modeled protein the coordinates of the structure were stored and examined utilizing the analytical tool in the gromacs 455 package 55 the toxicity and other relevant molecular mechanistic values of the peptides such as electrostatics desolation and van der waals vdw force were predicted using the toxinpred server httpscrddosddnetraghavatoxinpred 56 toxinpred is an in-silico method that has been developed to predict and design toxicnon-toxic peptides the main dataset used in this method consists of 1805 toxic peptides  35 residues the physiochemical characteristics of the peptide sequences were determined using the protparam tool httpswebexpasyorgprotparam of the expasy database server 57 fig 1 the crystal structure of the sars-cov-2 spike protein with the ace2 pd domain pdb id 6m17 was retrieved from the protein data bank httpswwwrcsborg the interface residues between the sars-cov-2 spike protein and the ace2 pd domain were visualized and interpreted using ucsf chimera software 51 after a detailed analysis of interface residues a small stretch of the ace2 pd n-terminal region 23-amino acids glu23 to leu45 was found to be interacting majorly with the sars-cov-2 spike protein fig 2 and table 1
 furthermore we evaluated whether the 23-amino acid chain alone and without the remainder of the ace2 pd domain could bind to the sars-cov-2 spike protein hence the 23aa sequence was taken from the ace2 pd domain and docked to the sars-cov-2 spike protein 6m17 using the pydock program 52 to perform a non-biased analysis we performed a blind docking run whereby we did not specify the binding site during the docking simulations the obtained results were clustered and analyzed by comparing the binding energies and docked conformations of the peptide within the sars-cov-2 spike protein table 2 interestingly we found that the peptide binds to the sars-cov-2 spike protein at exactly the same place where the original ace2 pd domain interacts which shows that the 23-amino acid sequence independently has the potential to inhibit the interaction of the sars-cov-2 spike protein and ace2 complex after the docking analysis the sars-cov-2ace2 peptide interface was determined and the critical interacting amino acids were identified in the ace2 pd domain-derived peptide involved in binding to the sars-cov-2 spike protein table 2 computational alanine a scanning was performed to identify the critically important amino acids of the 23aa peptide inhibitor involved in binding to the sars-cov-2 spike protein the approach of alanine scanning contributes to estimating the binding energy of each residue to the total binding energy of the original peptide 58 the process involves the substitution of the amino acid with alanine and records the resulting binding energy changes by molecular docking of the substituted three-dimensional structure of the peptide if substitution by alanine results in a significant drop in overall free binding energy those residues are considered the critically important residues for binding 59 hence we performed alanine scanning of the 23aa peptide to determine the significance of each residue having the inhibitory potential of independently interacting with the ace2 binding region of the sras-cov-2 spike protein all amino acids in the peptide were independently mutated to alanine using biovia discovery studio 2020 software 50 alanine-substituted peptides were then modeled and minimized using the ucsf chimera program 51 next we performed docking studies of each mutated peptide and analyzed their binding energies and three-dimensional conformations in the ace2 binding interface of the sars-cov-2 spike protein as seen in fig 3 we observed that the mutated residues e23a q24a a25a k26a t27a l29a d30a k31a n33a e35a a36a e37a d38a l39a q42a s43a and s44a have no substantial effect on complex stability in terms of the change in total binding energy the total binding energy of the 23aa peptide with the sars-cov-2 spike protein  55873 kcalmol is comparable to the binding energy of the mutated residues e23a q24a a25a k26a t27a l29a d30a k31a n33a e35a a36a e37a d38a l39a q42a s43a s44a ranging from  56 to  53 kcalmol fig 3 however the mutated residues f28a f32a h34a f40a y41a and l45a were found to be critically important for binding and stabilizing the peptide-sars-cov-2 spike protein complex fig 3 we observed the change from  55873 kcalmol to  42996 drop in the total binding score fig 3 furthermore we deleted the non-significant identified through alanine scanning residues and found the deletion of any residue from f28 to l45 would make an unstable structure hence we removed five residues e23 q24 a25 k26 t27 from the n-terminal region of the peptide and retained residues from f28 to l45 resulting in the final 18aa peptide in addition to the molecular mechanistic values such as electrostatics and desolation we also calculated the van der waals vdw of all individual peptides electronic supplementary table 1 vdw is usually a weak force a type of intermolecular force enhancing the attraction and binding of a ligand to its receptor vdw forces are involved in the maintenance and stabilization of a drug-receptor complex replacing the respective amino acids f28 f32 h34 f40 y41 l45 with alanine significantly reduces the binding score either by directly losing the interaction or by changing the peptide conformation which becomes less compatible with the sars-cov-2 spike protein hence based on the results of alanine scanning the peptide was shortened from the extreme n-terminus due to its dispensability in sars-cov-2 binding the final peptide derivative f28 l29 d30 k31 f32 n33 h34 e35 a36 e37 d38 l39 f40 y41 q42 s43 s44 l45 was further docked and analyzed to validate its binding efficiency we utilized three state-of-the-art programs pydock 37 zdock 39 and haddock 24 38 to validate our docking studies the top poses retrieved from each software package resulted in conformations very close to the original 23-amino acid peptide thereby validating its efficacy as a potent sars-cov-2 inhibitor fig 4 the final 18aa peptide with a molecular weight of 220339 has an amino acid composition of ala a 56 asn n 56 asp d 111 gln q 56 glu e 111 his h 56 leu l 167 lys k 56 phe f 167 ser s 111 and tyr y 56 the total number of negatively charged residues was four asp and glu and the total number of positively charged residues was two lys and his the extinction coefficient calculated in units of m1 cm1 at 280 nm measured in water was found to be 1490  10 it is useful to have an estimation of this coefficient for spectrophotometrically following a protein when purifying it the half-life is a prediction of the time it takes for half of the amount of protein in a cell to disappear after its synthesis in the cell the presently used expasy tool protparam relies on the n-end rule which relates the half-life of a protein to the identity of its n-terminal residue the prediction is given for three model organisms human yeast and escherichia coli considering the n-terminal of the sequence considered is f phe the estimated half-life is 11 h mammalian reticulocytes in vitro the instability index ii is computed to be 6865 which classifies the protein as unstable the physical stability of peptides is influenced by both intrinsic and external factors prediction of peptide stability suggests precautionary steps be taken to make the therapeutically potent unstable peptides stable through certain biochemical analysis the predicted aliphatic index of the peptide was found to be 7056 with a grand average of hydropathicity gravy of  0522 toxinpred was used to predict the toxicity of the 18aa peptide with desired toxicity by mutating the minimum number of amino acids 40 the toxinpred tool allows us to submit query peptide in the fasta format and to optimize the peptide sequence to obtain the maximumminimumdesired toxicity based on the quantitative matrix-based position-specific scores by comparing them with the toxicnon-toxic data set the in-silico predicted toxinpred toxicity results of the 18aa peptide indicate that it is non-toxic compared with the mutated peptides the respective docked complexes of the 23aa and 18aa peptides with target protein were subjected to md simulation studies for analysing their stability in terms of root mean square deviation rsmd and potential interactions at 50 ns the stability of these two proteinpeptide complexes was analyzed using the rmsd of backbone atoms the calculated average rmsd of these complexes was in the range of 094148 nm and 02408 nm for the 23aa and 18aa peptide complexes respectively fig 5 by the end of the 50 ns time-scale simulation both of the proteinpeptide complexes attained their stable conformations fig 5 the lower rmsd values obtained after comparing the initial and final peptide complex conformations fig 5b revealed that the docked complexes were stable and hence there was not much difference in their conformations during the course of dynamics simulation several advantages of peptides including ease of synthesis and modifications low toxicity and high target specificity and selectivity led us to design a potential therapeutic candidate against covid-19 the present in-silico study is the first step towards designing inhibitory peptides to block sars-cov-2 entry into the host cell the peptide could inhibit binding of the sars-cov-2 spike protein with the ace2 pd domain which is the earliest stage of sars-cov-2 infection the findings of this study suggest that a peptide of 18-amino acids could be considered as a selective therapeutic candidate for covid-19 the study conducted by han and kral shows similar aspects towards designing a peptide inhibitor 49 the identification of 15 interacting residues of an ace2 pd with an rbd of the sars-cov-2 spike protein at a 3  region in the crystal structure pdb 6m17 is in agreement with the findings of han and kral 49 however in comparison with our structurally stable 18aa peptide inhibitor comprising the ace2 pd residues ranging from positions 2845 their inhibitor 1 peptide comprising residues 2155 is structurally unstable and non-specific hence they made multiple modifications to it which thereby changes its properties as well as its similarity to our peptide out of a total of 15 interacting residues of ace2 pd 10 residues are in the stretch of q24 to l45 utilizing this fact in our study each residue in the 2345 stretch 23aa peptide of the ace2 pd was estimated for functional significance and structural stability based on their binding energy and conformational stability in contrast to inhibitor 1 we obtained a stable 18aa peptide inhibitor where non-significant residues were truncated and the non-interacting residues within the 18aa peptide at the interfacial site were found important both for binding and stability of the peptide hence inhibitor 1 from han and kral differs in structural stability composition and specificity due to the presence of non-significant residues leading to deformity in its helical structure provision of experimental investigations of the desired synthesized peptide in combination with our computational studies will be needed to confirm and complete this study it is recommended to compare our computational results with the designed peptides in vitro and in vivo and eventually to clinical studies  in-silico evidence for two receptors based strategy of sars-cov-2 edoardo milanetti mattia miotto lorenzo rienzo di michele monti giorgio gosti giancarlo ruocco  we propose a novel numerical method able to determine efficiently and effectively the relationship of complementarity between portions of protein surfaces this innovative and general procedure based on the representation of the molecular iso-electron density surface in terms of 2d zernike polynomials allows the rapid and quantitative assessment of the geometrical shape complementarity between interacting proteins that was unfeasible with previous methods we first tested the method with a large dataset of known protein complexes obtaining an overall area under the roc curve of 076 in the blind recognition of binding sites and then applied it to investigate the features of the interaction between the spike protein of sars-cov-2 and human cellular receptors our results indicate that sars-cov-2 uses a dual strategy its spike protein could also interact with sialic acid receptors of the cells in the upper airways in addition to the known interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  at the time of writing the new coronavirus also known as sars-cov-2 which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome 1 2  has caused approximately the death of approximately 17000 and the infection of 390000 people the covid-19 outbreak represents a serious threat to public health 3  and the world health organization officially declared it a pandemic to date 7 coronavirus strains are known to infect humans and no approved therapies or vaccine against them are available 3  in the past two decades in addition to sars-cov-2 two other -coronavirus have caused three of the most severe epidemics worldwide sars-cov 4 5 and mers-cov 6 which respectively cause the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers the characteristics of the interactions between these viruses and the human cell receptors are being carefully studied to shed light on both diffusion speed and mortality rate differences between sars-cov-2 and the others with special regard to sars-cov indeed sars-cov spread across 26 countries in six continents and caused a total of 8096 cases and 774 deaths 96 7  with an incubation period of 1 to 4 days 8  on the other side it has been demonstrated that the latency of sars-cov-2 varies from 3-7 days on average up to 14 days 2  thus the average latency of sars-cov-2 is slightly longer than that of sars-cov 7  moreover it is estimated from epidemiological data that individuals infected with sars-cov-2 are conta-  the authors contributed equally to the present work  corresponding author edoardomilanettiuniroma1it gious from the beginning of the incubation period and that between the incubation period and the end of the infection each infected individual transmits the infection to about 377 other people 9  sars-cov-2 similarly to sars-cov and mers-cov attacks the lower respiratory system thus causing viral pneumonia however this infection can also affect the gastrointestinal system heart kidney liver and central nervous system 2 10 11  to face the emergency of this epidemic it is essential to shed light on the interaction mechanisms between the virus and the human cell receptors it is well characterized how sars-cov infection is mediated by the high-affinity interactions between the receptor-binding domain rbd of the spike s glycoprotein and the human-host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor 12 13 14  the spike protein is located on the virus envelope and promotes the attachment to the host cell and the fusion between the virus and the cellular membrane 15 16  recently it has also been proven that several critical residues in sars-cov-2s rbd provide favorable interactions with human ace2 consistent with sars-cov-2s capability to infect the cell 17 18  on the experimental side it has also been confirmed by in vivo experiments that sars-cov-2s entry is mediated by lung cell ace2 receptors 19  more importantly the structure of the spike-ace2 receptor complex has been recently determined by crio-em 20  in conclusion it is now understood that sars-cov-2 binds to the ace2 receptor to infect the host cell using its spike proteins rbd even if it had most likely evolved from sars-cov independently 21  since the ace2 molecule is known to be a human entry receptor the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of interaction between the ace2 receptor and the spike protein of the virus can be a key factor designing new drug compounds with this aim computational methods based on both sequence and structure studies of proteins represent a powerful tool 22  indeed the development of effective computational methods for predicting the binding sites of proteins can improve the understanding of many molecular mechanisms 23 24 25  several methods to analyze protein interaction have used protein surface information 26 27 28 29  a very promising strategy to study molecular interaction is to determine using deep learning methods chemico-physical features of the molecular surface 25  this method allows to efficiently detect binding sites but it unfortunately has the drawbacks of any other deep learning approach it requires the definition and training of several parameters and the creation of a sufficiently large training and test database this method also requires the analysis of all possible orientations and relative positions of the binding sites in this work we present a new and general method to efficiently describe the shape of molecular surfaces and apply it to study the interactions between spike proteins and the corresponding receptors involved in the sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 infection mechanisms the method proposed here for the first time describes regions of a molecular surface with the 2d zernike formalism indeed each local patch of a 3d protein molecule can be represented as a surface on a 2d square grid while retaining both distance and angular information with respect to a specific reference system applying the zernike expansion we compute -completely unsupervised -numerical descriptors that summarize the patch geometry and we use them to compute the structural similarity between any two patches the zernike descriptors are rotationally invariant ensuring to the method an high efficiency and a low computational cost since it avoids the necessity of any preliminary structure orientation overall these operations substantially reduce the search space dimensionality thus allowing our method to be able to explore several more protein regions compared to previous methods we first apply the method to a large dataset of proteinprotein complexes protein-protein dataset where we test the ability of our method to detect interacting regions from non-interacting regions with the use of our definition of complementarity our method recognizes interactions in the large protein-protein database with good precision furthermore thanks to the low computational cost of building an invariant description we can blindly sample the entire surfaces of 2 interacting proteins and retrieve their binding sites then we use our formalism to study the interaction between the spike protein and its membrane receptors comparing sars-cov-2 with both sars-cov and mers we demonstrate that the actual region of binding between spike protein and ace2 human -both in sars-cov and sars-cov-2 -have a higher complementarity with respect to other randomly sampled exposed receptor regions furthermore we also analyze in detail the structural properties of the mers spike protein which like several other proteins belonging to coronaviruses family can interact with sialic acids 30  among other coronaviruses the bovine coronavirus bcov and the two human coronaviruses oc43 and hku1 employ sialoglycanbased receptors with 9-o-acetylated sialic acid 9-o-ac-sia as key component 31  these viruses bind to cell surface components containing n-acetyl-9-oacetylneuraminic acid and this interaction is essential for the initiation of an infection 32  in particular we propose here a possible alternative mechanism of sars-cov-2 cellular infection through spike protein interaction with sialic acid receptors of the upper airways similarly to what has been shown for the mers spike protein 33  we indeed highlight that a surface region in the nterminal domain of sars-cov-2 spike is very similar to the mers spike sialic acid-binding region and present a compatible charge these observations suggest that these two pockets potentially share an analogous function this second infection mechanism for sars-cov-2 could explain its high diffusion speed in the last decade the 3d zernike formalism has been widely applied for the characterization of molecular interactions 29 34 35 36  in this work we adopted a new representation based on the 2d zernike polynomials which allows the quantitative characterization of protein surface regions as shown in fig1  our computational protocol associates to each molecular patch an ordered set of numbers the expansion coefficients that describes its shapes through this compact description it is possible to both analyze the similarity between 2 different regions -suggesting for example a similar ligand for 2 binding regions -and to study the complementarity between 2 interacting surfaces to validate this method we firstly collected a large structural dataset of protein-protein complexes and we characterize their binding sites through 2d zernike we test the method ability to recognize the higher complementarity observed between pairs of interacting surfaces compared to the lower complementarity found when the 2 surfaces are non-interacting we thus analyze in detail the interactions of the sars-cov-2 spike protein with its membrane receptors comparing sars-cov-2 properties with sars-cov and mers-cov we selected a structural dataset composed of about 4500 experimentally determined protein-protein com- b the selected patch points are fitted with a plane and reoriented in such a way that the z-axis passes through the centroid of the points and is orthogonal to the plane a point c along the z-axis is defined such as that the largest angle between the perpendicular axis and the secant connecting c to a surface point is equal to 45 o  finally to each point its distance r with point c is evaluated c each point of the surface is projected on the fit plane which is binned with a square grid to each pixel the average of the r values of the points inside the pixel is associated d the resulting 2d projection of the patch can be represented by a set of 2d zernike invariant descriptors e-f  given a protein-protein complex pdb code 3b0f in this example for each surface vertex we select a patch centered on it and compute its zernike descriptors to blindly identify the two binding sites each sampled patch is compared with all the patches of the molecular partner and each vertex is associated with the minimum distance between its patch and all the patches of the molecular partner is associated with g a smoothing process of the surface point values is applied to highlight the signal in the regions characterized mostly by low distance values high shape complementarity plexes from a recent paper that presented a state of the art patch recognition computational method 25  for each complex we have selected the interacting regions and we have characterized them with the 2d zernike invariant descriptors therefore each binding site is associated with a one-dimensional vector allowing us to easily compare the shape of protein regions with the euclidean distance between their zernike descriptors two regions are complementary when they are characterized by a low distance between their corresponding zernike vectors 34  to test the ability of the method to recognize two interacting regions we have compared how much the distance between the zernike descriptors see methods of a pair of interacting binding sites is smaller than the distances between random patches in particular we define the random patch set as the set of 2000 patches randomly extracted from the 20 biggest protein of the dataset 100 patches for each protein for each protein-protein complex we define the real distance as the distance between the interacting surfaces while the random ones are the values observed in the comparisons between the binding site of one protein and the random patch set our unsupervised method has an excellent ability in recognizing the binding regions with respect to random patches with an area under the roc curve of 076 note that the state of art supervised method described in 25  when only shape descriptors are considered achieves an auc of 068 with patches of comparable sizes meaning that our approach clearly overcome such performances in shape complementarity recognition furthermore the much lower computational time needed for the calculation of the 2d zernike descriptors allows an extensive sampling of the surfaces of a pair of proteins in complex centering on each surface point a molecular patch we generate for each protein a very high number of zernike descriptors comparing all the patches of the two proteins we label each surface point with the binding propensity which is the maximum complementarity recorded between the zernike descriptors of the patch and all the others belonging to the molecular partner surface the real binding region is expected to be demarcated and mostly composed of elements with high complementarity to make the binding region high complementarity more evident we smooth the signal by attributing to each vertex of the surface the average value of the vertices closer than 6 to it see method as an example in fig1 we report the result of this method for a specific case pdb code 3b0f where this procedure clearly identifies the binding regions of the two proteins for a subset of 20 protein-protein complexesthe smallest in terms of the number of surface vertices - we perform a blind search of the interacting regions the results are very promising since the average value of the auc of the corresponding roc is 065 with fourteen out of forty proteins having an auc higher than 070 comparison between the complementarity of the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 spike protein with the human ace2 receptor the excellent and very promising results found in the large dataset encouraged us to investigate the pressing problem of the coronavirus interaction with the host cell we first analyzed the shape complementarity between the spike proteins of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 in complex with human ace2 receptor 12 20  it is interesting to notice that the contact between spike and ace2 receptor both for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 occurs in two separate interacting regions see fig 2  meaning that we need to investigate the two interacting regions separately when comparing the two raw distances we found that ace2-sars-cov distance is smaller than the ace2-sars-cov-2 one even if for both complexes the complementarity is much higher than the one would find in other random regions of the complexes see figure 2  note that for an appropriate comparison we need to de-fine a suitable ensemble of random patches indeed the random regions are sampled from the molecular surface of the spike protein imposing that the center of the two patches has the same distance as the binding region observed in the experimental complex then both the real spike binding region and the ensemble of 1000 sampled regions are compared with the receptor binding sites the results of this analysis are shown in fig 2  we show the distance distribution of the random regions and we report the distance between the real binding regions both for the ace2-sars-cov and ace2-sars-cov-2 complex as the method works in recognizing interacting patches real binding regions show a higher complementarity lower distance than the randomly sampled regions furthermore this analysis shows that the ace2 receptor has a slightly higher shape complementarity with sars-cov than with sars-cov-2 spike protein however the results are quite comparable among them in accordance with experimental data 3  although it is currently known that the spike protein of sars-cov-2 binds to the ace2 receptor of host cells 18 37  the investigation of possible other infection mechanism is a key factor in the study of this disease specifically in this work 19 the authors underline the necessity to elucidate whether sars-cov-2 spike protein could have acquired the ability to bind with sialic acid as mers-cov does it has been recently shown that besides the usual receptor dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 receptor mers-cov spike protein interacts with sialic acid molecules 33 using a well-identified pocket in the nterminal region of the protein this makes the virus able to interact with high airways and then reach the low airway cells 38  the recognition between spike and sialic acids occurs via a conserved groove which plays a key role for s mers-cov-mediated attachment to sialosides and entry into human airway epithelial cells 33  since the interaction of mers-cov spike and the sialic acids is caused mainly by hydrogen bonds and shape complementarity 39  our method is particularly suitable to find on the sars-cov-2 spike surface a region similar to the one involved in binding of the sialic acid in mers-cov spike using the experimental structure of mers-cov spike and sialic acid molecules complexes 33  we extract its binding region and we describe it through zernike descriptors then we sample the corresponding domains of both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 spike building a molecular patch on each surface point and characterizing it with its corresponding zernike descriptors each region sampled from the spike proteins of these 2 viruses is then compared with the mers-cov spike binding re- gion looking for a similar region that can mediate interaction with a similar ligand in fig 3  we show the results of this analysis in particular selecting the region most similar to the mers-cov binding site we identified one region for both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 spike protein interestingly the best region of sars-cov-2 spike exhibits a higher similarity than the pocket selected by the sars-cov spike we moreover calculate the electrostatic potential of the involved surfaces with ef-surf webserver 40  as shown in fig 3  in cartoon representation the region found in the molecular surface of the sars-cov-2 spike is very similar to the mers spike region interacting with sialic acid both in terms of shape and electrostatic similarity differently the region identified in the sars-cov spike exhibit an electrostatic clearly dissimilar from the sialic binding site in the mers-cov spike making very unlikely the interaction with sialic acid in that region in addition in fig4  we propose a multiple sequence alignment -with software clustal omega 41 -between the three spike proteins importantly the proposed sars-cov-2 binding site besides being structurally in a surface region bordering the corresponding mers pocket is composed of a set of consecutive residues sequence number 73-76 constituting an insertion in respect to sars-cov spike sequence thus this insertion in the a-domain of the spike protein could confer to sars-cov-2 the capability of infecting human cells in a dual strategy making possible the high diffusion speed of this virus a blind prediction of the interaction regions between molecules is still an open challenge despite the great steps that have been made however the need for fast and reliable theoretical and computational tools capable to guide and speed-up experiments becomes especially important when we face emergencies like the present one emergency caused by the novel sars-cov-2 human infection is spreading with an impressive rate such that the world health organization officially declared it a pandemic indeed the last few months have seen extensive studies about the virus-host interactions focusing in particular on the various stages of the cell internalization mechanism recent works found that in analogy with the case of sars-cov sars-cov-2 uses too its spike protein to bind to ace2 receptors mostly associated in the lower respiratory ways further experimental investigations highlighted a comparable receptor binding affinity between the novel coronavirus and the older sars-cov even if the binding regions display a certain degree of variability 21  the modest difference in binding affinity seems insufficient to explain the higher human-human transmission rate with respect to sars-cov and the overall sequence variability suggest that sars-cov-2 may have optimized in other directions such as in acquiring the ability of binding to other receptors 19  in this work we present a new fast computational method that compactly summarizes the morphological properties of a surface region of a protein testing the unsupervised method on a large dataset of protein-protein interactions we proved its excellent ability to correctly recognize the high shape complementarity occurring between interacting surfaces analyzing the newly available experimental structures of sars-cov-2 spike protein in complex with human ace2 we found that the binding region presents indeed a comparable slightly slower shape complementarity with the analogous complex of sars-cov such a minimal difference enforces the hypothesis that the apparent higher fitness of sars-cov-2 should lie elsewhere in particular looking at other members of the large coronavirus family one finds that many members developed the ability to bind to two distinct receptors with one binding site in the c-terminal domain of the s-protein that generally binds protein-like receptors like ace2 for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 and the other situated in the n-terminal region usually able to bind to sugar-like receptors in particular mers-cov has been found able to bind to sialic acid receptors both in camel human and bat cells applying our method to the sialic acid-binding region which has been recently determined experimentally in mers-cov we have found an exceptionally similar region in the corresponding region of the sars-cov-2 spike this region similar in structure to the mers-cov correspondent one and absent in sars-cov see figure 4  could be able to mediate a low-affinity but high-avidity interaction with sialic acid interestingly the sequence variability of the spike protein recently studied considering sars-cov-2 sequences belonging to 62 different strains 42  shows a high conservation level of the ace2 binding site while the highest variability is located in the region that we indicate here to be potentially involved in sialic acid biding this evidence confirm the importance of this region in regulating host-cell infection 43  in conclusion we propose that this dual cell entry mechanism can explain the high diffusion speed this virus exhibits and we strongly encourage a more accurate investigation of this observation a dataset of protein-protein complexes experimentally solved in x-ray crystallography is taken from 25  we

representation of the sars-cov spike protein with highlighted the binding site c same as b but for sars-cov spike protein given a molecular surface described as a set of point in a three-dimensional cartesian space and a region of interest on this surface we define a surface patch  as the intersection of the region of interest and the surface in principle the region of interest can have an arbitrary shape in this work we chose to use a spherical region having radius r s  6 and one point of the surface as the center see figure 1a  once the patch is selected we fit a plane that passes through the points in  and we reorient the patch in such a way to have the z-axis perpendicular to the plane and going through the center of the plane then given a point c on the z-axis we define the angle  as the largest angle between the perpendicular axis and a secant connecting c to any point of the surface  c is then set in order that   45   r is the distance between c and a surface point we then build a square grid and we associate each pixel with the mean r of the points inside it this 2d function can be zernike invariant descriptors which are invariant under rotation in the space in the next section we provide a brief summary of the main features of the zernike basis there are several good reviews like 47 that offer more detailed discussions a schematic representation of the procedure is shown in figure 1b -d given a function f r  polar coordinates defined inside the region r  1 unitary circle it is possible to represent the function in the zernike basis as with being the expansion coefficients the zernike polynomials are complex functions composed by a radial and an angular part where the radial part for a certain couple of indexes n and m is given by in general for each couple of polynomials one finds that z nm z n m   n  1  nn  mm 5 which ensures that the polynomials can form a basis and knowing the set of complex coefficients c nm  allows for a univocal reconstruction of the original image with a resolution that depends on the order of expansion n  maxn we found that n  20 which corresponds to a number of coefficients of 121 allows for a good visual reconstruction of the original image by taking the modulus of each coefficient z nm  c nm  a set of descriptors can be obtained which have the remarkable feature of being invariant for rotations around the origin of the unitary circle the shape similarity between two patches can then be assessed by comparing the zernike invariants of their associated 2d projections in particular the similarity between patch i and j is measured as the euclidean dis-tance between the invariant vectors ie when comparing patches the relative orientation of the patches before the projection in the unitary circle must be evaluated intuitively if we search for similar regions we must compare patches that have the same orientation once projected in the 2d plane ie the solventexposed part of the surface must be oriented in the same direction for both patches for example as the positive z-axis if instead we want to assess the complementarity between two patches we must orient the patches contrariwise ie one patch with the solvent-exposed part toward the positive z-axis up and the other toward the negative z-axis down the velocity of the procedure that from a patch in the 3d surface produces the set of invariant descriptors al-lows for a vast screening of couples of surfaces to look for both similar and also complementary regions in order to identify the binding region given a couple of proteins we can associate to each point of one surface a vector of zernike invariants associate to the up patch having that point as center and another set of invariants to each point of the other surface  with down orientation then for each point i of say protein 1 we can compute the euclidean distance with all the points of the other surface associated with protein 2 and associate to point i the minimum found distance and vice-versa for protein 2 see figure 1e -f a smoothing process of the surface point values is applied in order to highlight the signal in the regions characterized mostly by low distance values high shape complementarity  in-silico evidence for two receptors based strategy of sars-cov-2 edoardo milanetti mattia miotto lorenzo rienzo di michele monti giorgio gosti giancarlo ruocco  we propose a novel numerical method able to determine efficiently and effectively the relationship of complementarity between portions of proteins surfaces this innovative and general procedure based on the representation of the molecular iso-electron density surface in terms of 2d zernike polynomials allows the rapid and quantitative assessment of the geometrical shape complementarity between interacting proteins that was unfeasible with previous methods we first tested the method with a large dataset of known protein complexes obtaining an overall area under the roc curve of 069 in the blind recognition of binding sites and then applied it to investigate the features of the interaction between the spike protein of sars-cov-2 and human cellular receptors our results indicate that sars-cov-2 uses a dual strategy its spike protein could also interact with sialic acid receptors of the cells in the upper airways in addition to the known interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  at the time of writing the new coronavirus also known as sars-cov-2 which causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome 1 2  has caused approximately the death of approximately 17000 and the infection of 390000 people the covid-19 outbreak represents a serious threat to public health 3  and the world health organization officially declared it a pandemic to date 7 coronavirus strains are known to infect humans and no approved therapies or vaccine against them are available 3  in the past two decades in addition to sars-cov-2 two other -coronavirus have caused three of the most severe epidemics worldwide sars-cov 4 5 and mers-cov 6 which respectively cause the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers the characteristics of the interactions between these viruses and the human cell receptors are being carefully studied in order to shed light on both diffusion speed and mortality rate differences between sars-cov-2 and the others with a special regard to sars-cov indeed sars-cov spread across 26 countries in six continents and caused a total of 8096 cases and 774 deaths 96 7  with an incubation period of 1 to 4 days 8  on the other side it has been demonstrated that the latency of sars-cov-2 varies from 3-7 days on average up to 14 days 2  thus the average latency of sars-cov-2 is slightly longer than that of sars-cov 7  moreover it is estimated from epidemiological data that individuals infected with sars-cov-2 are conta-gious from the beginning of the incubation period and that between the incubation period and the end of the infection each infected individual transmits the infection to about 377 other people 9  sars-cov-2 similarly to sars-cov and mers-cov attacks the lower respiratory system thus causing viral pneumonia however this infection can also affect the gastrointestinal system heart kidney liver and central nervous system 2 10 11  to face the emergency of this epidemic it is essential to shed light on the interaction mechanisms between the virus and the human cell receptors it is well characterised how sars-cov infection is mediated by the high-affinity interactions between the receptor-binding domain rbd of the spike s glycoprotein and the human-host angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor 12 13 14  the spike protein is located on the virus envelope and promotes the attachment to the host cell and the fusion between the viral and cellular membrane 15 16  recently it has also been proven that several critical residues in sars-cov-2s rbd provide favorable interactions with human ace2 consistent with sars-cov-2s capability to infect the cell 17 18  on the experimental side it has also been confirmed by in vivo experiments that sars-cov-2s entry is mediated by lung cell ace2 receptors 19  more importantly the structure of the spike-ace2 receptor complex has been recentely determined by crio-em 20  in conclusion it is now understood that sars-cov-2 binds to the ace2 receptor to infect the host cell using its spike proteins rbd even if it had most likely evolved from sars-cov independently 21  since the ace2 molecule is known to be a human entry receptor the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of interaction between the ace2 receptor and the spike protein of the virus can be a key factor designing new drug compounds with this aim computational methods based on both sequence and structure studies of proteins represent a powerful tool 22  indeed the development of effective computational methods for predicting the binding sites of proteins can improve the understanding of many molecular mechanisms 23 24 25  several methods to analyze protein interaction have used protein surface information 26 27 28 29  a very promising strategy to study molecular interaction is to determine using deep learning methods chemico-physical features of the molecular surface 25  this method allows to efficiently detect binding sites but it unfortunately has the drawbacks of any other deep learning approach it requires the definition and training of several parameters and the creation of a sufficiently large training and test database these method also requires the analysis of all possible orientations and relative position of the binding sites in this work we present a new and general method to efficiently describe the shape of molecular surfaces and apply it to study the interactions between spike proteins and the corresponding receptors involved in the sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 infection mechanisms the method proposed here for the first time describes regions of molecular surface with the 2d zernike formalism indeed each local patch of a 3d protein molecule can be represented as a surface on a 2d square grid while retaining both distance and angular information with respect to a specific reference system applying the zernike expansion we compute -completely unsupervised -numerical descriptors that summarize the patch geometry and we use them to compute the structural similarity between any two patches the zernike descriptors are rotationally invariant ensuring to the method an high efficiency and a low computational cost since it avoids the necessity of any preliminary structure orientation overall these operation substantially reduces the search space dimensionality thus allowing our method to be able to explore several more protein regions compered to previous methods we firstly apply the method to a large dataset of protein-protein complexes protein-protein dataset where we test the ability of our method to detect interacting regions from non-interacting regions with the use of our definition of complementarity our method recognize interactions in the large protein-protein database with a good precision furthermore thanks to the low computational cost of building an invariant description we can blindly sample the entire surfaces of 2 interacting proteins and retrieve their binding sites then we use our formalism to study the interaction between the spike protein and its membrane receptors comparing sars-cov-2 with both sars-cov and mers we demonstrate that the actual region of binding between spike protein and ace2 human -both in sars-cov an sars-cov-2 -have an higher complementarity with respect to other randomly sampled exposed receptor region furthermore we also analize in detail the structural properties of the mers spike protein which like several other proteins belonging to coronaviruses family is able to interact with sialic acids 30  among other coronaviruses the bovine coronavirus bcov and the two human coronaviruses oc43 and hku1 employ sialoglycan-based receptors with 9-o-acetylated sialic acid 9-o-ac-sia as key component 31  these viruses bind to cell surface components containing n-acetyl-9-oacetylneuraminic acid and this interaction is essential for initiation of an infection 32  in particular we propose here a possible alternative mechanism of sars-cov-2 cellular infection through spike protein interaction with sialic acid receptors of the upper airways similarly to what has been shown for the mers spike protein 33  we indeed highlights that a surface region in the nterminal domain of sars-cov-2 spike is very similar to the mers spike sialic acid binding region and present a compatible charge these observations suggest that these two pockets potentially share a analogous function this second infection mechanism for sars-cov-2 could explain its high diffusion speed in the last decade the 3d zernike formalism has been widely applied for the characterization of molecular interactions 29 34 35 36  in this work we adopted a new representation based on the 2d zernike polynomials which allows the quantitative characterization of protein surface regions as shown in fig1  our computational protocol associates to each molecular patch an ordered set of numbers the expansion coefficients that describes its shapes through this compact description it is possible to both analyze the similarity between 2 different regions -suggesting for example a similar ligand for 2 binding regions -and to study the complementarity between 2 interacting surfaces to validate this method we firstly collected a large structural dataset of protein-protein complexes and we characterize their binding sites through 2d zernike we test the method ability to recognize the higher complementarity observed between pairs of interacting surfaces compared to the lower complementarity found when the 2 surfaces are non-interacting we thus analyze in detail the interactions of the sars-cov-2 spike protein with its membrane receptors comparing sars-cov-2 properties with sars-cov and mers-cov we selected a structural dataset composed of about 4500 experimentally determined protein-protein com- b the selected patch points are fitted with a plane and reoriented in such a way that the z-axis passes through the centroid of the points and is orthogonal to the plane a point c along the z-axis is defined such as that the largest angle between the perpendicular axis and the secant connecting c to a surface point is equal to 45 o  finally to each point its distance r with the point c is evaluated c each point of the surface is projected on the fit plane which is binned with a square grid to each pixel the average of the r values of the points inside the pixel is associated d the resulting 2d projection of the patch can be represented by a set of 2d zernike invariant descriptors e-f  given a protein-protein complex pdb code 3b0f in this example for each surface vertex we select a patch centered on it and compute its zernike descriptors to blindly identify the two binding sites each sampled patch is compared with all the patches of the molecular partner and each vertex is associated with the minimum distance between its patch and all the patches of the molecular partner is associated with g a smoothing process of the surface point values is applied in order to highlight the signal in the regions characterized mostly by low distance values high shape complementarity plexes from a recent paper that presented a state of the art patch recognition computational method 25  for each complex we have selected the interacting regions and we have characterized them with the 2d zernike invariant descriptors therefore each binding site is associated with a one dimensional vector allowing us to easily compare the shape of protein regions with the euclidean distance between their zernike descriptors two regions are complementary when they are characterized by a low distance between their corresponding zernike vectors 34  to test the ability of the method to recognize two interacting regions we have compared how much the distances between the zernike descriptors see methods of a pair of interacting binding sites is smaller than the distances between 2 random patches in particular for each protein-protein complex we define the real distance as the distance between the interacting surfaces while the random set is formed by the comparison between the binding site of one protein and the binding sites extracted from the other complexes of the dataset our unsupervised method has a good ability to recognize the true pair of binding regions with respect to random patches with an auc of the roc of 069 comparing patches of r s  9  note that the state of art supervised method described in 25 achieves an auc of 068 when are considered only shape descriptors with similar patches of 9  12 of geodedic lenght furthermore the much lower computational time needed for the calculation of the 2d zernike descriptors allows an extensive sampling of the surfaces of a pair of proteins in complex centering on each surface point a molecular patch we generate for each protein a very high number of zernike descriptors comparing all the patches of the two proteins we label each surface point with the binding propensity that is the maximum complementarity recorded between the zernike descriptors of the patch and all the others belonging to the molecular partner surface the real binding region is expected to be demarcated and mostly composed of elements with high complementarity to make the binding region high complementarity more evident we smooth the signal by attributing to each vertex of the surface the average value of the vertices closer than 6 to it see method as an example in fig1 we report the result of this method for a specific case pdb code 3b0f where this procedure clearly identify the binding regions of the two proteins for a subset of 20 protein-protein complexesthe smallest in terms of number of surface vertices - we perform a blind search of the interacting regions the results are very promising since the average value of the auc of the corresponding roc is 065 with fourteen out of forty proteins having an auc higher than 070 comparison between the complementarity of the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 spike protein with the human ace2 receptor the excellent and very promising results found in the large dataset encouraged us to investigate the pressing problem of the coronavirus interaction with the host cell we first analyzed the shape complementarity between the spike proteins of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 in complex with human ace2 receptor 12 20  it is interesting to notice that the contact between spike and ace2 receptor both for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 occurs in two separate interacting regions see fig 2  meaning that we need to investigate the two interacting regions separately when comparing the two raw distances we found that ace2-sars-cov distance is smaller than the ace2-sars-cov-2 one even if for both complexes the complementarity is much higher than the one would find in other random regions of the complexes see figure 2  note that for an appropriate comparison we need to define a suitable ensemble of random patches indeed the random regions are sampled from the molecular surface of the spike protein imposing that the center of the two patches have the same distance as the binding region observed in the experimental complex then both the real spike binding region and the ensemble of 1000 sampled regions are compared with the receptor binding sites the results of this analysis are shown in fig 2  we show the distances distribution of the random regions and we report the distance between the real binding regions both for the ace2-sars-cov and ace2-sars-cov-2 complex as the method works in recognizing interacting patches real binding regions show an higher complementarity lower distance than the randomly sampled regions furthermore this analysis shows that ace2 receptor has a slightly higher shape complementarity with sars-cov than with sars-cov-2 spike protein however the results are quite comparable among them in accordance with experimental data 3  although it is currently known that the spike protein of sars-cov-2 binds to the ace2 receptor of host cells 18 37  the

intuitively if we search for similar regions we must compare patches that have the same orientation once projected in the 2d plane ie the solvent exposed part of the surface must be oriented in the same direction for both patches for example as the positive z-axis if instead we want to assess the complementarity between two patches we must orient the patches contrariwise ie one patch with the solvent-exposed part toward the positive z-axis up and the other toward the negative z-axis down the velocity of the procedure that from a patch in the 3d surface produces the set of invariant descriptors allows for a vast screening of couples of surfaces in order to look for both similar and also complementary regions in order to identify the binding region given a couple of proteins we can associate to each point of one surface a vector of zernike invariants associate to the up patch having that point as center and another set of invariants to each point of the other surface  with down orientation then for each point i of say protein 1 we can compute the euclidean distance with all the points of the other surface associated to protein 2 and associate to point i the minimum found distance and viceversa for protein 2 see figure 1e -f a smoothing process of the surface point values is applied in order to highlight the signal in the regions characterized mostly by low distance values high shape complementarity  molecular structure analyses suggest strategies to therapeutically target sars-cov-2 yi zhang tatiana kutateladze g   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has emerged as a novel rapidly spreading human pathogen that causes severe respiratory distress and pneumoniacoronavirus disease 2019 covid-191 this is the third outbreak in recent years caused by emerging coronaviruses after spread of sars-cov in 2002 and mers-cov in 2012 sars-cov-2 and sars-cov are closely related and have similar genomes and mechanisms for entry into host cells the coronavirus spike glycoprotein s protein which protrudes from the virion surface plays a pivotal role in initiating the viral infection facilitating coronavirus attachment to the host cell surface receptor and fusion of viral and host cell membranes the spike protein consists of two functional subunits s1 and s2 fig 1a and the receptor-binding domain rbd resides within the s1 subunit the rbd of the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 spike protein binds to the peptidase domain of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 initiating virus attachment to the host cell surface the s2 subunit mediates virus-host membrane fusion which requires s protein proteolytic cleavage between the s1 and s2 subunits and additionally at another a so called s2 site by host proteases owing to its crucial role in viral infection the spike protein has been a major target for antibody-mediated neutralization of sars-cov despite high-sequence similarity between the spike proteins of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 new studies with recovered sars and covid-19 patients sera show limited cross-neutralization23 implying that recovery from one infection may not protect against another3 and that the development of vaccines and therapeutics specific to covid-19 is needed to combat this disease in that regard a number of approaches have already been taken and some show promising results these include the design of new drugs and evaluation of existing therapeutics used individually or in combination production of antibodies against the sars-cov-2 spike protein particularly its rbd and targeting other viral and host cell proteins essential for survival and replication of the virus recently published structural studies of the sars-cov-2 spike protein shed light on the molecular mechanism by which its rbd recognizes human ace2 and provide an invaluable knowledge in guiding the development of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry247 wrapp et al and walls et al report cryo-em structures of the homotrimeric sars-cov-2 spike protein in a prefusion state24 fig 1b the data from walls et al show that the spike protein exists in two conformations which is also observed in the other coronaviruses4 in the closed conformation all three rbds are buried at the interface between three protomers whereas in the open conformation one of rbds rotates up and therefore is primed for binding to ace2 in addition wrapp et al demonstrate that the open conformation represents a predominant state of the spike protein trimer2 how does rbd of the sars-cov-2 spike protein binds to the human receptor ace2 the studies by shang et al lan et al and yan et al illuminate the atomic-resolution details of this interaction57 fig 1c of note ace2 normally functions to promote the maturation of angiotensin hormone which controls blood pressure aberrant ace2 levels have been linked to cardiovascular diseases8 and may play a role in disease severity observed in covid-19 patients with comorbid conditions such as heart blood and lung diseases and diabetes yan et al describe a cryo-em structure of the complex of full length human ace2 with rbd from the sars-cov-2 spike protein and suggest that two spike protein trimers can simultaneously bind to an ace2 dimer7 the precise binding interface of the sars-cov-2 spike rbd and ace2 can be dissected from the crystal structures of the complex determined by shang et al and lan et al56 fig 1d analyzing the structure shang et al uncovered several hotspots that distinguish binding of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov5 the authors found that overall the rbd-ace2 interface in the sars-cov-2 complex is larger than the binding interface in the sars-cov complex rbd of sars-cov-2 forms more contacts with ace2 including three additional intermolecular salt bridges involving q493 and g496 of rbd and k31 e35 and k353 of ace2 dashed lines in fig 1d the receptor-binding ridge of rbd in the sars-cov-2 complex adopts a more compact conformation allowing an adjacent loop to move closer to ace2 and f486 of rbd to insert in the hydrophobic pocket of ace2 these structural differences could account for the 4- to 20-fold increase in binding affinity of the sars-cov-2 spike rbd toward ace2 compared to that of sars-cov which was observed independently by several groups246 analysis of the crystal structures of rbd from the sars-cov spike protein in complex with established sars-cov neutralizing human m396 and 80r antibodies reveals that the antibodies are bound in the same binding site as ace2910 implying that their neutralizing mechanism is a direct blockage of receptor binding lan et al estimate that 7 out of 21 epitope residues for m396 and 16 out of 25 epitope residues for 80r are not conserved in rbd sequences of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 which may explain the lack of appreciable cross-reactivity for these antibodies6 interestingly a recent structure of rbd from the sars-cov-2 spike protein bound to another antibody isolated from a sars patient cr3022 determined by yuan et al shows that cr3022 targets an epitope distal from the ace2-binding site which may provide some cross-reactivity that needs to be thoroughly evaluated11 what are other therapeutic targets beyond the receptor-binding domain of the sars-cov-2 spike protein proteolytic cleavage of the sars-cov-2 spike protein by the human serine protease tmprss2 is a critical step in the virus entry through the plasma membrane fusion mechanism fig 2 as shown by hoffmann et al12 the authors demonstrate that camostat mesylate a clinically proven serine protease inhibitor that halts tmprss2 activity blocks sars-cov-2 infection of lung cells12 following binding to ace2 and disassociation of the ace2-bound s1 subunit the s2 subunit of the spike proteinstill attached to the virus envelope through its c-terminal transmembrane domain and additionally cleaved at the s2 siteinserts the cleaved terminus into the host cell plasma membrane and thus physically links both viral and cell membranes this allows the heptad repeats hr1 and hr2 of the s2 subunit to interact and assemble into a six-helix bundle which is needed to bring the membranes closer to each other for final fusion xia et al now show that ek1c4 a lipopeptide that targets heptad repeats is a potent inhibitor of sars-cov-2 fusion in cellular assays and in a mouse model13 by using human clinical-grade recombinant soluble ace2 monteil et al reduced sars-cov-2 viral growth by over 103-fold in vero cells and suppressed infection in engineered human blood vessel organoids and kidney organoids14 in addition to targeting components of the viral attachment and the membrane fusion machinery other strategies to eliminate sars-cov-2 include impeding virus entry into the host cell through the endosomal pathway and disrupting activities of viral proteins ou et al found that sars-cov-2 pseudo-virions enter cells mainly through endocytosis and that inhibition of the proteins essential in the endosomal signaling such as pikfyve tpc2 or cathepsin l by apilimod tetrandrine or sid 26681509 respectively reduces host cell entry3 once inside the host cell viral rna uses the host ribosomal machinery to produce important for its own life cycle proteins that also serve as attractive targets for the development of anti-sars-cov-2 therapeutics one of such proteins is the sars-cov-2 main protease mpro which is required for processing the polyproteins translated from the viral rna inhibition of the mpro activity impedes viral replication and the crystal structure of the sars-cov-2 mpro in complex with the -ketoamide inhibitor provides the mechanistic details necessary to advance in this direction15 the speed by which structural information on the sars-cov-2 virus has been collected is astonishing structural approaches will likely contribute to drug discoveries and validation and aid in the development of vaccines to reduce and eventually eliminate the ongoing public health emergency  energetics based epitope screening in sars cov-2 covid 19 spike glycoprotein by immuno-informatic analysis aiming to a suitable vaccine development amrita banerjee dipannita santra smarajit maiti  the recent outbreak by sars-cov-2 has generated a chaos in global health and economy and claimedinfected a large number of lives closely resembling with sars cov the present strain has manifested exceptionally higher degree of spreadability virulence and stability possibly due to some unidentified mutations the viral spike glycoprotein is very likely to interact with host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 and transmits its genetic materials and hijacks host machinery with extreme fidelity for self propagation few attempts have been made to develop a suitable vaccine or ace2 blocker or virus-receptor inhibitor within this short period of time here attempt was taken to develop some therapeutic and vaccination strategies with a comparison of spike glycoproteins among sars-cov mers-cov and the sars-cov-2 we verified their structure quality swiss-model phyre2 pymol topology profunc motifs meme suite glam2scan gene ontology based conserved domain interpro database and screened several epitopes svmtrip of sars cov-2 based on their energetics ic50 and antigenicity with regard to their possible glycosylation and mhcparatopic binding vaxigen v20 hawkdock zdock server effects we screened here few pairs of spike protein epitopic regions and selected their energetic ic50 mhc ii reactivity and found some of those to be very good target for vaccination a possible role of glycosylation on epitopic region showed profound effects on epitopic recognition the present work might be helpful for the urgent development of a suitable vaccination regimen against sars cov-2  an outbreak of a novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome cov-2 or sars cov-2 or covid- 19 infection is threatening the humanity globally occurring from last week of december 2019 as a result a massive loss of human health status and global economy are becoming unaccountable as of current situation sars cov-2 claimed more than 40000 lives from more than 800000 infected persons globally 1  the outbreak started from the wuhan province of china and spread more than 195 countries with most adverse effects in china italy iran spain the united states france germany britain and several other countries any type of therapeutic strategies starting from the blocking of viral entry inhibition of spike proteins association with host ace-2 angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 modulations of interfering kinase activity inactivation of viral genome expression-packaging and vaccination against this virus is the demand of the present situation regarding the vaccination strategies it is assumed that frequent mutation results in anomalies in its surface spike proteins 2 3  mostly resembling the features of sars cov global outbreak 2003 httpswwwwhointcsrsarsen  this virus unlikely manifested its extremely high grade of virulence spreading capability and stability across the geographical barrier or specifically colder place aged persons or specific genders yet to be clarified 4  the positive selective pressure could account for the stability and some clinical features of this virus compared with sars and bat sars-like cov 5  stabilizing mutation falling in the endosome-associated-protein-like domain of the nsp2 protein could account for covid-2019 high ability of contagious while the destabilizing mutation in nsp3 proteins could suggest a potential mechanism differentiating covid-2019 from sars cov 5  nevertheless nutritional and immunological statuses are also important factors for the screening of the therapeutic strategies for the affected and sensitive persons possible medications or immunizations from the existing drugs or infusion of convalescent plasma should be conducted with utmost care to the covid 19 patients 6  advanced precautionary steps and therapeutic interventions should be formulated taking into account of several personal and community factors 7  development of a successful and reproducible vaccination protocol and its human trial may take longer time for the issues of mutation and large number glycan shield and epitope masking on the sars cov 2 proteins 8  in a series of medication regimen 1 at1r blockers is used for reducing the severity and mortality from sars-cov-2 virus infections 9  chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are now being prescribed somewhere to fight covid-19 for the time being 10 11  human coronaviruses and other influenza viruses resulted in epidemic in last 2 decade in different parts of the world the anomalies between severity and spreading between the origin site china and the other parts of the world european and north america countries might have some indication common human covs may have annual peaks of circulation in winter months in the us and individual human covs may show variable circulation from year to year 12 colder climate and prior exposure to other human coronaviruses or influenza or flu viruses or possible vaccination against those might develop antibody dependent enhancement ade of immunological responses during recent sars cov-2 exposure ade might have modulated immune response and could elicit sustained inflammation lymphopenia andor cytokine storm 13 14  possibly that could be one of the reasons more history of exposure with covs beside weaker immune system for older people being more affected by the present sars cov-2 moreover both helper t cells and suppressor t cells in patients with covid-19 were below normal levels the novel coronavirus might mainly act on lymphocytes especially t lymphocytes 15  strong inflammatory events could be the initiator of the collapsing environment during covid-19 infection in most of the death cases in covid-19 infections acute respiratory failure is followed by other organs like kidney anomalies in these cases inflammatory outburst might have worsened the infection and post viral-incubation situations 16 17  recent studies in experimentally infected animal strongly suggest a crucial role for virus-induced immunopathological events in causing fatal pneumonia after human cov infections 18  so combined anti-viral and anti-inflammatory treatment might be beneficial in these cases 19  sars-based available immune-therapeutic and prophylactic modalities revealed poor efficacy to neutralize and protect from infection by targeting the novel spike protein 20  in this background critical screening of the spike sequence and structure from sars cov-2 by energetic and ic50 based immunoinfrmatics analysis may help to develop a suitable vaccine so in the current study we were intended to analyze the spike proteins of sars cov mers cov and sars cov 2 and four other earlier out-breaking human corona virus strains we critically compared sars cov and sars cov 2 spike-proteins domains motifs and screened several epitopes based on their energetics ic50 and antigenicity employing several bioimmuuno -informatics software with regard to their possible glycosylation and mhcparatopic binding effects the present work might be helpful for the urgent development of a suitable vaccination regimen  tertiary structures of selected coronavirus cov spike

with five fold cross-validation for epitope prediction 20 amino acid lengths was selected the major histocompatibility complex mhc binding efficiency of predicted epitops was performed using immune epitope database iedb and analysis resource 29  a total of 5 dpa 6 dqa and 662 drb alleles from mhc class ii were screened for the detection of best interactive alleles on the basis of highest consensus percentile rank and lowest ic50 value all the analyses were performed on human class ii allele using frequently occurring alleles frequency  1 peptide length of 9mers was selected consensus

hla-dra drb molecule pdb id 2q6w 5jlz and fully glycosylated covid 19 spike protein structure pdb id 6svb was retrieved from protein data bank pdb and docking was performed using hawkdock 31 and zdock 32 server generating 100 docking solutions among them best 10 were analyzed based on docking scores and binding free energy value calculation the higher degree of similarity between sars cov and sars cov-2 might indicate and help in the therapeutic and vaccination strategies with reference to the current global situation however an absolute higher degree of virulence and spreading nature of sars cov-2 is of great concern in the present scenario  based on the alignment pattern selected sequences were subjected to analysis different conserved motifs in the protein sequences a total of 7 conserved motifs were analyzed   the epitope designing was conducted only with the covid 19 spike glycoprotein sequence and structure from the sequence analysis 10 different locations were found which also showed similarity with sars cov and sars covid 2 spike glycoprotein in protein blast figure 4  also the motif positions within the spike glycoprotein monomer were represented in figure 4  epitopes 1 4 and 5 were not represented in covid 19 spike glycoproteins as they were found to be embedded within the virus envelop among the others motifs 2 3 6 and 7 were found at the interior location of spike glycoprotein monomer but motifs 8 9 and 10 were found at the surface of the structure which could be used as the immunological targets for the proper diagnosis and treatment of covid 19 the important issue of epitope finalization could be confronted by the factor of possible transition between pre-fusion and postfusion spike structural distortion specific mutant structure has been designed and tested to be resistant to conformational change after ace2 binding and protease cleavage at the s1s2 site 34  this may be indicative to searching suitable epitope which may remain unhindered from pre-to post-fusion state transition the proper type of major histocompatibility complex mhc selection for identified covid 19 epitope was performed and enlisted in table 3  the threshold value of highest consensus percentile rank was selected as 10 for all as a whole highest consensus percentile rank value of 10 was observed for sequence qqliraaeirasanl epitope 3a and lowest ic50 value of 711 was observed for sequence iiaytmslgaensva epitope 8b the antigenic property of identified target sequences from epitopes was also predicted on the basis of threshold value of 04 below the threshold value the sequence has been considered as non-antigenic and sequences with above value were antigenic in nature a total of 9 antigenic sequences were detected table 3  among them two sequences aaeirasanlaatkm epitope 3b and itpgtntsnqvavly epitope 10b were found with higher threshold value of 07125 and 07193 respectively as the location of 3b was more interior 10b could be used as potent antigen according to epitope locations  figure 4  and antigenic nature other sequences like 8ab 9ab could be the target also coronavirus spike proteins are glycosylated in nature where n-acetyl glucosamine nag is the main component glycan shielding and possible epitope masking of an hcov-nl63 has been observed which may be the barrier for proper immunogenic responses 8  comparative analysis between glycosylated and non-glycosylated protein revealed some structural modification at the epitope locations among the identified epitopes 10b with sequence itpgtntsnqvavly 598-612 was found with n linked glycosylation at 603 position the structural modification of this epitope was analyzed using non-glycosylated protein structure of covid 19 acc no nc045512221563-25384 and gltcosylated covid 19 protein pdb id 6vsb effect of glycosylation on protein structures revealed that glycosylated conformation was more organised figure 5a  than non-glycosylated one figure 5b  secondary structural comparison between two epitopes showed more organised structure with attached nag residue figure 5d  whereas a shorter -sheet structure was observed when nag is removed from the structure figure 5c  the peptide interactive site of 10b epitope was blocked due to nag attachment as a result of which antibody binding to the antigen may hamper the nag residue directly binds with n or asn amino acid residue figure 5e  so the removal of nag from the spike glycoprotein structure is difficult structural distortion between glycosylated and non-glycosylated epitope 10b at tertiary level indicated that removal of nag may distort the structure of epitope figure 5f  again that may hamper the proper antigenantibody binding in this section energetics of epitope attachment with mhc class ii hla-dra drb was determined in presence and absence of nag at the 10b epitope structure through molecular docking  figure 6  docking results showed that without nag the binding efficiency of 10b though epitope 8 a  b were also present at the surface of the spike glycoprotein but was found to wrapped with a short segment igaehvnnsyecd 651-663 carrying a glycosylation at n residue position 657 figure 7a  as a result of which antibody accessibility to this epitope may also be difficult whereas surface epitope 9 with sequence vrdpqtleilditpc 576-590 showed highest antigenecity of 11285 table 3 can recombine to gain entry into human cells are the points also to be noted 35  sars cov-2 induced severe and often lethal lung failure is caused due to its inhibition of ace-2 expression 36  so keeping the ace-2 normal functioning but blocking viral entry is the most challenging issue right now possible suitable epitope as screened in the current study may be helpful in this global pandemic situation the history of last two decades outbreak of these types of virus is very much evident the present situation justifies further advanced studies with proper infrastructure and fund-resources facilities at a global scale to eradicate current or any possible future outbreak position of epitope 9 in covid 19 spike protein with no direct or indirect nag attachment pdb id 6svb b

pattern e  molecular investigation of sarscov-2 proteins and their interactions with antiviral drugs paolo calligari sara bobone giorgio ricci alessio bocedi   in early december 2019 a sudden and dramatic outbreak of a new coronavirus strain named sarscov-2 emerged in the continental chinese area of wuhan and quickly diffused throughout the country to date several cases of viruses were reported in europe and in the us the sarscov-2 is strongly infectious with more than 81000 infected people and around 3000 deaths reported within three months from the virus appearance update on 14th of april more than 19 milion of confirmed cases and about 120 thousands deaths reported the rapid spread of the new virus reveals that the mechanism of diffusion is somehow different from that of filoviridae ie ebolavirus 1 the viral pathogenesis results in symptoms like fever acute pneumonia and eventually respiratory failure the death rate the long time needed for a full recovery and the co-morbidity associated with viral infection ie in advanced age or particular life stages such as pregnancy result in a major threat to global health 2 in this scenario the need for a cure appears to be extremely urgent the main strategy against the diffusion of viruses is represented by the development of specific vaccines however the complexity of viruses and their ability to mutate and adapt to new host organisms belonging to other species has also led to different therapeutic approaches aimed to interfere with the viral life cycle or with processes essential for membrane fusion or replication 34 furthermore computational chemistry represents a fundamental tool in the screening of applicable drugs 5 the computational approach can also represent a tool for physicians and healthcare professionals to operate a first decision on the best therapy to administrate at first instance coronaviruses are single-stranded rna enveloped viruses 67 whose genes encode among others for a trimeric structural spike protein a homodimeric cysteine proteinase 8 an rna polymerase and several nonstructural proteins httpswwwncbinlmnihgovnuccorenc045512 9 from a phylogenetic point of view the genetic similarities shared by sarscov-2 and the 2002 sars coronavirus strain sarscov they both belong to the so-called beta cov group and other bat-isolated coronaviruses strains have already been underlined with more than 96 gene identity 71011 the alignment of spike protein and protease showed an analogy in primary sequences of more than 75 610 and 96 respectively 612 proteases and spike proteins are targets of choice for inhibition of sars and mers 13141516 and several efforts have been made to develop inhibitors of their activities by using both virtual screening or experimental methods 515 in this work we present the results obtained for sarscov-2 spike protein and 3c-like protease by molecular docking of several inhibitors originally developed for antiviral therapy against other viruses such as the hepatitis c virus hcv and the human immunodeficiency virus hiv thirteen proteinase inhibitors from anti-hiv and anti-hcv drugs were investigated along with three different compounds for spike protein inhibition despite the different viral strains for which these drugs were originally developed we aim to investigate whether they could also have an affinity for the sarscov-2 the use of antivirals that are already available in the therapy against the new virus would be a huge advantage in the fight of this battle and a first step can eventually arise from bioinformatic analysis which could provide information about their potential effectiveness indeed our in silico data suggest that an effective interaction occurs for some of the tested molecules these results represent a promising starting point for antiviral therapies that are alternative or coadjuvant to the vaccination strategy protein sequences were obtained from the curated genomic sequence deposited at the gene database with id number nc045512 and were verified against sarscov id nc0047183 17 the 3c-like protease id yp0097253011 the envelope spike protein id yp0097243901 the rna-dependent rna-polymerase id yp0097253071 and the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein id yp0097243972 were selected  the set of antiviral drugs was taken from the influenza research database fludborg potential inhibitors of sars-cov-2 protease were identified among all the anti-protease drugs in the mentioned database asunaprevir db11586 nelfinavir db00220 simeprevir db06290 faldaprevir db11808 indinavir db00224 ritonavir db00503 amprenavir db00701 tipranavir db00932 atazanavir db01072 saquinavir db01232 darunavir db01264 fosamprenavir db01319 lopinavir db01601 furthermore three molecules were chosen for the spike protein umifenovir db13609 enfuvirtide db00109 and pleconaril db05105 the software openbabel 18 was used to convert the smiles code of each molecule into a 3d structural file the three-dimensional structure of enfuvirtide was taken from the available crystallographic structure pdb id 3h00 chain a  the homology model was performed with the itasser server giving as input the sequences obtained from the sarscov-2 genomic sequence model structures were energy minimized before the docking protocol by performing a short in vacuum 500 step steepest-descent optimization of the potential energy using gromacs tools 19  autodock vina 20 was used to perform molecular docking of the antiviral drugs onto sarscov-2 protease and envelope protein regarding the protease residues 41 46 140 142 145 163 166 168 189 were set as flexibles during the binding mode search 21 about 3c-like protease the binding box was centered on the coordinates of residue met165 and its volume fully encompassed the whole binding pocket for the spike envelope glycoprotein the box used for the search of binding modes was centered on the position of the center of mass of val503 side-chain and restrained to the area above the extracellular head of the trimeric protein in the pre-fusion conformation the 3c-like protein is the main protease of sars-cov-2 it plays a fundamental role in rna translation and thus as already underlined is essential for viral replication 12 in the mature form it is found as a dimer each monomer is formed by three structural pseudo-domains domain i residues 8101 domain ii residues 102184 which share an antiparallel -barrel structure and domain iii residues 201303 which contains a five-fold antiparallel -helix cluster 2223 the binding site for substrates is located in a cleft region between domains i and ii and the catalytic region is formed by the dyad his41-cys145 that is highly conserved among the coronavirus proteases and is also reminiscent of the trypsin-like serine proteases 22  importantly 3cpro-19 from sarscov-2 shares a high similarity with its sarscov homolog 24 and only very few residues are substituted with respect to the sars counterpart thr35val ala46ser ser94ala lys180asn ala267ser thr285ala most of these residues are distant from the protease active site and are unlikely related to selectivity against this protease figure 1a nonetheless two of these mutations lys180asn and ala46ser are located in the deep hydrophobic pocket below the active site and in the loop region flanking the entrance of the active site although in the available crystallographic structure lys180asn results to be located too far to directly contribute to ligand binding its presence extends the hydrophobic inner region conversely the ser46 seems to be relatively distant from the his41 active site 11  and may have a role in ligand recruitment figure 1b  although a crystallographic structure of 3clike protease of sars-cov-2 in complex with a peptide-like inhibitor pdb id 6lu7 was made very recently available in the protein data bank this structure clearly shows a closed binding pocket around the inhibitor while very useful to identify the residues involved in the inhibitory action this configuration is not very well suited for molecular docking as it may limit the effectiveness of the pose searching methods for this reason we preferred to model the three-dimensional structure of the protease using a homology modeling protocol excluding the complexed covid-19 protease among the target structures the structure obtained from the itasser server showed a very good alignment score tm-score 0993 against the apo structure of sarscov main protease pdb id 5b6o interestingly the root-mean-squared deviation rmsd of the model structure from the available crystallographic structure sarscov-2 protease is as low as 13  and it is mostly due to differences in the binding pocket and loop conformations the main results obtained from the docking protocol are shown in table 1 protease drug recognitions are usually driven by hydrophobic interactions 2425 and figure 2 clearly shows how all the four best scoring ligands indeed thoroughly fill the hydrophobic pockets that flank the catalytic dyad surprisingly the well-known hcv ns34a protease inhibitor simeprevir 26 was identified as the best scoring drug with a significant difference with respect to some of the most promising inhibitors of sarscov-2 protease identified such as lopinavir 27 and nelfinavir 28  simeprevir fully fills two hydrophobic pockets flanking the catalytic dyad his41-cys145 the macrocyclic compound fits in the pocket formed by residues in the range phe181phe185 while the acyl sulfonamide cyclopropyl moiety points towards the region encompassing leu27 pro39 and val42 this pose induces the opening of the catalytic dyad indeed his41-cys145 changes from 3  in the apo configuration to 73  in the inhibited form simeprevir binding to sarscov-2 protease is also sustained by three hydrogen bonds that anchor the ligand to the binding pocket two of them link the amide backbone of glu166 and gly143 to the carbonyl o in the macrocycle and to the acyl sulfonamide cyclopropyl moiety respectively a third hydrogen bond is formed between the n of the asn142 side chain and the ether group a detailed structural representation of the interacting residues is shown in figure 3a these findings may appear rather surprising as the hcv main protease shares very low similarity with the sarscov-2 homolog 75 nonetheless the two proteases share a very similar topology of the active site except for the hydrophobic loop phe181phe185 which is structurally absent in the hcv protease figure 3b  several experimentally obtained structures for the multimeric conformation of sarscov spike protein are available pdb 5wrg 5  58 5xlr homology model structure of sarscov-2 spike protein was obtained from the itasser server global pairwise sequence alignment indicated that sarscov-2 spike protein shares about 76 of its primary sequence with its sarscov homolog with an overall similarity of 87 these few differences project into a slightly different negativepositive residue ratio 11599 in sarscov and 110103 in sarscov-2 and a slightly less acidic pi 56 for sarscov 62 for sarscov-2  interestingly while this work was in progress the electron microscopy structure of the sarscov-2 spike protein in its oligomeric pre-fusion inactive structure with a single receptor-binding domain up was made available by another group pdb id 6vsb 29 unfortunately a thorough direct comparison of our model structure with these experimental data is impaired by the different global configuration of the two trimeric structures down-inactive vs up-active conformations however as the experimental structure shows only one monomer in the up-state a comparison can be performed in a monomer-based manner the rmsd between down-state monomers in the two structures is as low as 117  for residues with the same secondary structure assignments and 6  overall it is worth noting here that in the pre-fusion state the down inactive conformation is significantly more stable than the up-conformations 303132 these findings confirm the quality of the homology model and its suitability for docking studies visual inspection of the electrostatic potential of the down-inactive conformation of sarscov-2 spike protein figure 4ab shows that while the inner part of the protein that is proximal to the viral envelope is negatively charged the protein head is clearly characterized by a positive electrostatic potential this picture is rather different from one from sarscov figure 4cd and thus it suggests an important property to which tailor future inhibitors the docking of three different inhibitors was performed on the spike protein as the inhibitors are expected to block the membrane binding we limited the docking search region to the area around the protein head in its pre-fusion down configuration moreover due to the large size of the protein and to limit the computational cost we performed a rigid docking of the inhibitors against the target multimeric protein  autodock vina was used to identify the best binding pose of three different drugs umifenovir db13609 enfuvirtide db00109 and pleconaril db05105 the results are shown in table 2  interestingly upon binding enfuvirtide interacts with spike protein whose cap is mainly positively charged through its negatively charged amino acids several glutamate residues  as opposed to enfuvirtide figure 5a which inhibits the viral spike protein action upon host membrane by interposing itself and avoiding contact between the protein and the cellular membrane the other two drugs docked at the entrance of the central channel pore formed by the trimeric structure figure 5bc global pairwise sequence between sarscov-2 rdrp and its sarscov counterpart shows a large sequence identity shared by the two proteins 94 with also a very high similarity 96 the analysis of rdrp and rna primer complex displays that the rna-interacting residues are conserved between sarscov and sarscov-2 in red in figure 6a the viral nucleocapsid protein n protein interacts with the viral genome and forms the ribonucleoprotein core it is now well-known that this protein plays different roles in the viral infection as it is involved in the synthesis of viral rna in the transcription of genomic rna and in the translation of viral proteins 34 coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins share a general structural pattern composed of three distinct domains an n-terminal domain 130 residues which is suggested to bind rna a central domain 120 residues which is also predicted to recognize rna and finally the c-terminal domain which drives the protein dimerization although a complete structure of the nucleocapsid protein is not available for sarscov a local structural comparison can be performed by structure superposition of sarscov-2 model structure with n-terminal and central domain in the sars counterparts figure 7 sequence pairwise alignment of sarscov-2 n protein against its sarscov homolog shows a very high identity in primary structure 91 with an overall similarity of 94 the modeling and superimposition of protease structure with the homologous sars virus protease show very little differences although pivotal for the function the few residues different in sarscov-2 protease assimilate the protein to a sort of site-directed mutant of sars protease figure 1 the spike protein structure shows an upper trimeric cap supported by a stem domain with remarkable differences in terms of charge with a mainly positive ectodomain and a strongly negative stem domain figure 4  in this respect stimulated by the important results in clinical trials of patients treated with antiretroviral agents 3536 we extended the investigation by a computational inspection of many different drugs and we chose a selection of most common antiviral drugs to display the probable molecular reasons of their efficacy in combined antiviral therapy the drugs examined include the hiv-1 protease inhibitors mostly used in combination with other antiviral drugs in the treatment of hiv in both adults and children moreover other antiviral drugs included in our screening show activity against the hepatitis c virus and good oral bioavailability one of the antiviral drugs tested against sars-cov-2 envelope protein is enfuvirtide an hiv fusion inhibitor used in combination therapy for the treatment of hiv-1 infection 37 the second molecule tested is umifenovir an antiviral agent with activity against influenza a- and b-viruses 38 the last one is pleconaril 39 used for prevention of asthma exacerbations and common cold symptoms in asthmatic subjects exposed to respiratory infections pleconaril is orally bioavailable and active against picornaviridae viruses the docking shows that 5 out of the 13 protease inhibitors are reported with a high-score in thermodynamic terms of a proteindrug complex 20 table 1 and may be selected as the future core of new antiviral drugs specific for sarscov-2 protease  intriguingly the docking of the spike protein shows interesting results for all the three drugs tested notably enfuvirtide is placed at the interface of two monomers in this position the molecule could impair the transition between closed and open state figure 4  finally it is worth mentioning that currently some of the drugs reported in table 1 are used with satisfying results in therapies for the treatment of sarscov-2 the rna-dependent rna-polymerase rdrp is one of the most important proteins involved in the genetic information replication and transmission of the coronavirus family viruses the function is accomplished by a multimeric complex of rdrp with non-structural proteins favoring a sort of wrapping-and-scrolling of the viral genome the rdrp is very similar to the homologous of sars figure 6 the n-protein promotes the package of viral genome into a helical ribonucleocapsid and virion assembly also interacting with membrane protein consequently n-protein plays an important role in viral rna transcription as well as viral replication the dimerization domains of sarscov and sarscov-2 share a high similarity figure 7 the differences at protein structure level with the sars the closest phylogenetic virus are intriguing and contribute to characterize the peculiarity of sars-cov-2 from coronavirus and influenza virus belonging to an old-scenario of virology taxonomy it is worth mentioning that several other groups are working on antiviral-based strategies to fight the new big threat represented by sarscov2 in some cases patients were treated with some of the molecules chosen for our studies ie ritonavir lopinavir umifenovir 27404142 these data strongly support and corroborate the results of our work until now the exacerbation of covid-19 diffusion has stimulated the researchers and medical personnel to find a solution for the treatment compatible with the arsenal of antiviral drugs currently available at the same time in which we are closing the present manuscript the numbers are more than 81000 confirmed cases around 3000 deaths and a sensible increase of recovered people 30000 according to the coronavirus covid-19 global cases by johns hopkins csse interactive map updated on 14th of april with more than 19 milion of confirmed cases and about 120 thousands deaths reported the first line strategy of isolation dramatic quarantine measurements and clinical treatments may be a reasonable positive warrant to limit the spread of the virus  the four proteins taken into account are interesting molecular targets for the medicinal chemistry mainly the protease and the envelope or spike protein  the antiviral drug therapy is an effective first-stage approach for treating covid-19 infections and the present work could contribute to suggest to physicians the choice of the combination of antivirals to administer to patients alongside the hospitalization obviously our knowledge in terms of the general organization of the structure of the virus particle is limited now but proteins like protease and spike are the primary molecular targets for drug discovery and development in the near future the availability of x-ray crystal structures of the majority of proteins will allow a more exhaustive docking calculation on different classes of drugs eg antiparasitic drugs peptides the structural and computational studies and analysis are not subordinate but helpful for the comprehension of virus molecular elements and the right way to help the scientific community during the long process leading to developing a vaccine  morphology genome organization replication and pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 shailendra saxena k swatantra kumar rajni nyodu vimal maurya k shailendra saxena k   coronaviruses covs are enveloped single-stranded positive sense rna viruses that belong to

been found to originate from bats and then transmitted into intermediate mammalian host civets in the case of sars-cov and camels in the case of mers-cov and eventually infected humans song et al 2019 sars-cov-2 has been declared as a pandemic with 1844683 confirmed cases and 117021 deaths globally by 14th april 2020 world health organization 2020 to characterize the novel coronavirus bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and throat swabs were collected from nine patients who had visited the wuhan seafood market during the initial outbreak special pathogen-free human airway epithelial hae cells were used for virus isolation the collected samples were inoculated into the hae cells through the apical surfaces hae cells were monitored for cytopathic effects and supernatant was collected to perform rt-pcr assays apical samples were collected for next generation sequencing after three passages the whole-genome sequences of sars-cov-2 were generated by a combination of sanger illumina and oxford nanopore sequencing lu et al 2020 phylogenetic analysis has revealed that bats might be at the source of sars-cov-2 andersen et al 2020 additionally some studies have suggested that the origin of sars-cov-2 is associated with pangolins li et al 2020 shereen et al 2020 to decipher the mechanism of replication and development of effective preventive and therapeutic strategies understanding the structure of sars-cov-2 genome organization and replication is crucial therefore this chapter focuses on the morphology and structure genomic organization and replication cycle of sars-cov-2 sars-cov-2 isolated from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples were inoculated on the vero cells in order to identify sars-cov-2 inoculated cells were prefixed using 2 paraformaldehyde and 25 glutaraldehyde and transmission electron microscopy was performed the structure of sars-cov-2 observed by examining infected cells after 3 days post infection electron microscopy revealed the coronavirus-specific morphology of sars-cov-2 with virus particle sizes ranging from 70 to 90 nm observed under a wide variety of intracellular organelles most specifically in vesicles park et al 2020 due to high sequence similarity the structure of sars-cov-2 is speculated to be the same as sars-cov kumar et al 2020 the surface viral protein spike membrane and envelope of coronavirus are embedded in host membrane-derived lipid bilayer encapsulating the helical nucleocapsid comprising viral rna fig 31 finlay et al 2004 the structure of spike yan et al 2020 and protease of sars-cov-2 zhang et al 2020 has been resolved which provides an opportunity to develop a newer class of drugs for treatment of covid-19
 the size of coronavirus genome is in the range of 26 to 32 kb and comprise 611 open reading frames orfs encoding 9680 amino acid polyproteins guo et al 2020 the first orf comprises approximately 67 of the genome that encodes 16 nonstructural proteins nsps whereas the remaining orfs encode for accessory and structural proteins the genome of sars-cov-2 lacks the hemagglutinin-esterase gene however it comprises two flanking untranslated regions utrs at 5 end of 265 and 3 end of 358 nucleotides sequence variation among sars-cov-2 and sars-cov revealed no significant difference in orfs and nsps the nsps includes two viral cysteine proteases including papain-like protease nsp3 chymotrypsin-like 3c-like or main protease nsp5 rna-dependent rna polymerase nsp12 helicase nsp13 and others likely to be involved in the transcription and replication of sars-cov-2 chan et al 2020 in addition to nsps four major structural proteins are spike surface glycoprotein s membrane nucleocapsid protein n envelope e and accessory proteins encoded by orfs n-terminal glycosylated ectodomain is present at the n-terminal end of m protein that comprises of three transmembrane domains tm and a long c-terminal ct domain fig 32
 the m and e proteins are required for virus morphogenesis assembly and budding whereas s glycoprotein is a fusion viral protein comprising two subunits s1 and s2 the s1 subunit which shares 70 sequence identity with bat sars-like covs and human sars-cov comprises signal peptide n-terminal domain ntd and receptor-binding domain rbd walls et al 2020 most of the differences were found in the external subdomain that is primarily responsible for interaction of spike with the ace2 receptor the ectodomain of spike protein 11208 amino acid residues was cloned expressed and crystallize to solve the spike glycoprotein structure of sars-cov-2 the structure of spike glycoprotein structure of sars-cov-2 resembles the spike protein of sars-cov with an rmsd of 38  the study also reveals that the receptor-binding region rbd exhibited the highest structural divergence wrapp et al 2020 the s2 subunit that shares 99 sequence identity with bat sars-like covs and human sars-cov comprises two heptad repeat regions known as hr-n and hr-c which form the coiled-coil structures surrounded by the protein ectodomain the s protein has been found to exhibit a furin cleavage site prrarsv at the interface between s1 and s2 subunits that is processed during the biogenesis coutard et al 2020 entry of coronaviruses into host target cells depends on the binding of spike glycoprotein to the cellular receptor and priming of s protein by host cell proteases like sars-cov sars-cov-2 uses the ace2 receptor for internalization and tmprss2 serine proteases for s protein priming hoffmann et al 2020 similar to sars-cov the extrapulmonary spread of sars-cov-2 may be seen due to the widespread tissue expression of the ace2 receptor in addition studies revealed that the spike protein of sars-cov-2 exhibits 1020 times higher affinity as compared to that of sars-cov wrapp et al 2020 binding of spike protein to the ace2 receptor results in conformational changes in spike protein that leads to the fusion of viral envelop protein with host cell membrane following entry via endosomal pathway coutard et al 2020 matsuyama and taguchi 2009 this event is followed by the release of viral rna into the host cytoplasm that undergoes translation and generates replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1b that further cleaved by virus encoded proteinases into small proteins the replication of coronavirus involves ribosomal frame shifting during the translation process and generates both genomic and multiple copies of subgenomic rna species by discontinuous transcription that encodes for relevant viral proteins assembly of virion takes place via interaction of viral rna and protein at endoplasmic reticulum er and golgi complex these virions are subsequently released out of the cells via vesicles fig 33 hoffmann et al 2020
 the pathological findings of sars-cov-2 infected patients highly resemble that of sars-cov and mers-cov infected patients flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood samples showed significant reduction of cd4 and cd8 t cell counts and their status was found to be hyperactivated as higher proportion of dual positive hla-dr and cd38 was seen rapid progression of pneumonia was seen in chest x-ray images with some differences between the right and left lung histopathological investigation of lung liver and heart tissue was performed lung biopsy showed cellular fibromyxoid exudates with bilateral diffuse alveolar damage the right lung showed prominent desquamation of pneumocytes and formation of hyaline membrane indicating signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards whereas the left lung showed pulmonary edema with formation of hyaline membrane xu et al 2020 in addition both lungs were found to exhibit interstitial mononuclear patchy inflammatory infiltrates dominated specifically by lymphocytes tian et al 2020 the intra-alveolar spaces were characterized by multinucleated syncytial cells with atypical enlarged pneumocytes showing virus-induced cytopathic effect liver biopsy of patients infected with sars-cov-2 showed moderate microvesicular steatosis and mild portal and lobular activity suggesting that injury might have been caused by the virus or drug induced a few interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates were observed in the heart tissue these pathological changes may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of pneumonia induced by sars-cov-2 that may help clinicians to effectively deal with covid-19 patients phylogenetic analysis revealed that sars-cov-2 might have originated from bats or pangolins structural investigations of virus-infected cells reveal the coronavirus-specific morphology of sars-cov-2 and the size of the virus 7090 nm the size of sars-cov-2 genome ranges from 26 to 32 kb and comprises 611 orfs which lacks hemagglutinin-esterase gene however it comprises of 5 and 3 flanking untranslated regions utrs the spike glycoprotein structure of sars-cov-2 resembles the spike protein of sars-cov with an rmsd of 38  like sars-cov sars-cov-2 uses the ace2 receptor for internalization and tmprss2 serine proteases for s protein priming histopathological investigation of tissues from sars-cov-2 infected patients showed virus-induced cytopathic effect with signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome in lung cells sars-cov-2 has recently emerged and has been declared as a pandemic by the world health organization based on the genomic sequences submitted to ncbi database the scientific community has analyzed the samples and suggested preventive and therapeutic strategies therefore investigation of genomic diversity in the collected specimens from around the globe needs to be conducted in order to design common effective therapies and vaccines in addition genomic characterization helps us accurately identify the origin and evolution of the virus deciphering the mechanism of sars-cov-2 replication in various cell-based models may help us understand the pathogenesis and identify specific targets to develop effective antiviral drugs  rapid in silico design of antibodies targeting sars-cov-2 using machine learning and supercomputing 1 thomas desautels adam zemla edmond lau magdalena franco daniel faissol  rapidly responding to novel pathogens such as sars-cov-2 represents an extremely challenging and complex endeavor numerous promising therapeutic and vaccine research efforts to mitigate the catastrophic effects of covid-19 pandemic are underway yet an efficacious countermeasure is still not available to support these global research efforts we have used a novel computational pipeline combining machine learning bioinformatics and supercomputing to predict antibody structures capable of targeting the sars-cov-2 receptor binding domain rbd in 22 days using just the sars-cov-2 sequence and previously published neutralizing antibody structures for sars-cov-1 we generated 20 initial antibody sequences predicted to target the sars-cov-2 rbd as a first step in this process we predicted and publicly released structures of the sars-cov-2 spike protein using homology-based structural modeling the predicted structures proved to be accurate within the targeted rbd region when compared to experimentally derived structures published weeks later next we used our in silico design platform to iteratively propose mutations to sars-cov-1 neutralizing antibodies known not to bind sars-cov-2 to enable and optimize binding within the rbd of sars-cov-2 starting from a calculated baseline free energy of -481 kcalmol  83 our 20 selected first round antibody structures are predicted to have improved interaction with the sars-cov-2 rbd with free energies as low as -820 kcalmole the baseline sars-cov-1 antibody in complex with the sars-cov-1 rbd has a calculated interaction energy of -522 kcalmole and neutralizes the virus by preventing it from binding and entering the human ace2 receptor these results suggest that our predicted antibody mutants may bind the sars-cov-2 rbd and potentially neutralize the virus additionally our selected antibody mutants score well according to multiple antibody developability metrics these antibody designs are being expressed and experimentally tested for binding to covid-19 viral proteins which will provide invaluable feedback to further improve the machine learning-driven designs this technical report is a high-level description of that effort the supplementary materials includes the homology-based structural models we developed and 178856 in silico free energy calculations for 89263 mutant antibodies derived from known sars-cov-1 neutralizing antibodies  numerous promising therapeutic 1 2 or vaccine 3 4 research efforts are underway for covid-19 yet a therapeutic or vaccine is not currently available traditional drug and biologic development are experiment-driven typically executed via large-scale screening in vitro and in vivo while traditional approaches have led to many effective and safe therapeutics they require years to complete and therefore cannot alone be relied upon to support a rapid response to novel pathogens 5 6 7  data-driven machine learning methods are increasingly being explored for rapid therapeutic development 8 9  potentially offering the promise of a very rapid design phase however a purely data-driven machine learning system would be limited in rapid response scenarios due to the inevitable insufficiency of available data on novel or emerging pathogens theory-driven computational methods such as molecular dynamics simulations can provide virtually limitless amounts of data for target systems but still require experimental validation lawrence livermore national laboratory llnl and glaxosmithkline gsk vaccines research have developed a combined computational-experimental platform for vaccine antigen design over the last two years this combined platform combines experiment-driven data-driven and theory-driven approaches to leverage the strength of each approach while mitigating their limitations the initial predictions from this platform are driven by a computational component based on integrating existing experimental data structural biologybioinformatic modeling and molecular dynamics simulations on high-performance computing systems an active machine learning model aims to optimize binding behavior by iteratively proposing mutations to the amino acid sequence of an initial antigen proposed mutant antigens are evaluated with existing computational binding estimation tools using known or estimated antibody-antigen structures the platform leverages a feature representation of the three-dimensional antigenantibody interface and a bayesian optimization algorithm to propose computational evaluation of mutants with high predicted performance and mutants that improve the machine learning model itself the computational platform further improves its predictions by proposing designs that are evaluated with a high throughput experimental evaluation component the results of which are incorporated into the machine learning model in a feedback loop this combined computational-experimental antigen design platform and results generated by it will be described in greater detail in a future joint publication with gsk including details of the machine learning model in response to the covid-19 pandemic we modified and used our computational components of the antigen design platform to propose mutations to sars-cov-1 neutralizing antibodies to achieve and optimize binding to the receptor binding domain rbd of the sars-cov-2 spike protein this approach is motivated and enabled by knowledge of existing antibodies specific to the rbd of the sars-cov-1 spike protein that prevent sars-cov-1 from binding the human ace2 receptor and entering the cell thus neutralizing the virus 10 11  the high similarity of sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 including the rbd 12  suggest that such an approach could produce efficacious therapeutic antibodies in 22 days 123-2132020 we demonstrated that our platform could generate antibody designs using only sars-cov-2 sequence information with support from antibodyantigen structures that had previously been experimentally determined for sars-cov-1 we executed this entire workflow by constructing a homologybased structural model before any experimentally determined structures of the sars-cov-2 sprotein were available in the absence of a known sars-cov-2 spike protein structure we characterized the sars-cov-2 surface glycoprotein sequence yp0097243901 13 by constructing a homology-based structural model using the as2ts protein modeling system 14  the structures of the spike proteins from sars-cov-1 protein data bank pdb entries 5x58 15  6nb6 10  2dd8 11  and 3bgf 16  were identified as the closest and most complete pdb structural templates to use for modeling with resolutions 32 42 23 and 30  respectively of the four templates the last three provide experimentally solved complexes with three antibodies s230 m396 and f26g19 as our main focus in constructed homology models was to achieve the highest possible accuracy in the rbd-fab antigen-binding fragment interfaces we used additional pdb templates to refine models in corresponding regions for example pdb template 2ghw 17 was used to improve accuracy in the modeled interface between rbd and fab of neutralizing antibody 80r a cryoem-derived structure of the sars-cov-2 spike protein became available on feb 19 2020 and was publicly released feb 26 2020

developability of 139 selected antibody sequences using the 5 developability metrics from the therapeutic antibody profiler 25   we used the machine learning module of our computational design platform to iteratively propose mutations to the original antibody m396 and run foldx 21 calculations on llnl hpc to estimate free energies to the sars-cov-2 spike protein homology model foldx binding calculations estimate the change in free energy ddg of the antibody-antigen protein complex resulting from the proposed mutations to m396 we used this calculation as part of an objective function to drive the antibody optimization via the machine learning model we evaluated 89263 mutants with foldx during the course of our search for improved antibodies with estimated ddg values ranging from -101 to 192 kcalmole figure 3 plots improvements in the foldx-estimated ddg values over the course of the machine learning-driven optimization process these results indicate that the machine learning model was effective in searching the combinatorial space of possible antibody mutants to perform design optimization and identify increasingly improved predicted antibody designs we then selected a subset of these antibody mutants for additional calculations using rosetta 22  statium 24  and molecular dynamics calculations 23  as well as antibody developability estimates via the therapeutic antibody

sars-cov-1 spike protein yield -522 kcalmole 72 m396 is known not to bind to the sars-cov-2 spike protein 18 and yields -48  with sars-cov-1 these results suggest that these m396-derived antibody mutants potentially bind and neutralize sars-cov-2 starting on jan 23 2020 we used two high-performance computers at llnl over the course of 22 days to support over 200000 cpu hours and 20000 gpu hours performing 178856 in silico free energy calculations of candidate antibodies in complex with the sars-cov-2 rbd we performed this work using just the sars-cov-2 sequence and previously published neutralizing antibody structures for sars-cov-1 our predicted structures of sars-cov-2 proved to be accurate within the targeted rbd region when compared to experimentally derived structures published weeks later with our predicted sars-cov-2 structures we used our in silico design platform to evaluate 89263 mutant antibodies by iteratively proposing mutations to sars-cov-1 neutralizing antibodies to optimize binding within the sars-cov-2 rbd we selected 20 initial antibody sequences predicted to target the sars-cov-2 rbd starting from a baseline free energy of -481 kcalmol  83 our 20 selected first round antibody structures are predicted to have improved interaction with the sars-cov-2 rbd with free energies ranging as low as -820 kcalmole the baseline sars-cov-1 antibody in complex with the sars-cov-1 rbd has a calculated free energy of -522 kcalmole and neutralizes the virus by preventing it from binding and entering the human ace2 receptor these results suggest that our predicted antibody mutants may bind the sars-cov-2 rbd and therefore potentially neutralize the virus additionally our antibody mutants score well according to multiple antibody developability metrics via the therapeutic antibody profiler these 20 antibody designs are now being expressed and experimentally tested for binding to sars-cov-2 spike protein which will provide invaluable feedback to further improve the machine learning-driven designs we are also continually improving our platform and performing additional in silico calculations which will be included in future updates to this document in

developed of sars-cov-2 in complex with sars-cov-1 neutralizing antibodies and 2 all antibody mutant sequences and in silico free energy calculations performed for 89263 mutant antibodies derived from the m396 sars-cov-1 neutralizing antibody which we used to select a first round of 20 candidate antibodies for experimental evaluation in the absence of a known sars-cov-2 spike protein structure we characterized the surface glycoprotein sequence yp0097243901 13 by constructing a homology-based structural model using the as2ts system 14 and sars-cov-1 to assess regions of sequencestructure conservation or variability between sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 sequence similarity71 we created a set of initial structural models using available templates the comparative analysis between constructed models and all available templates from pdb was performed using the stralsv algorithm 28  which identifies protein fragments that exhibit structural similarities despite low primary amino acid sequence similarity and regions where some structure conformation uncertainties can be observed we used results from these searches for modeling missing loop regions and assessment of possible structure conformation diversity in preliminary models in the constructed final models the conformation of sidechain atoms was predicted using scwrl 29 when residue-residue correspondences did not match residues that were identical between the template and the sars-cov-2 spike protein were copied from the templates onto the models the structural and stereochemical quality of the models was checked using a contact-dot algorithm in the molprobity software package 30  and the final constructed models were finished with relaxation using ucsf chimera 31  figures 4 and 5 show two of our constructed structural models of the sars-cov-2 spike protein in complex with a fab s230 and m396 in figs 3 and 4 respectively of a sars-cov-1 neutralizing antibody a set of all provided models was constructed to help assessment of possible different conformations in the spike-antibody complexes for our ddg foldx calculations of 89263 mutant antibodies in complex with the rbd we started with structure minimization using the minimize structure procedure available in ucsf chimera 31  this process was followed by up to 50 iterations of the repairpdb function in foldx we performed ddg calculations on the defined list of mutations using the buildmodel procedure which estimates stability dg defined by the free energy of a protein we used up to 46 runs in this procedure to check if calculated rotamers of specified mutations converged to the optimal or trapped solution a first set of our ddg estimates was calculated as a difference in free energy dg between the mutant and wild-type labeled foldx ddg average in supplementary materials additional ddg estimates were calculated using the analysecomplex algorithm for which we used the wild-type and mutated models to calculate ddg based on energy changes in interface only within rbd-fab complexes labeled foldx ddg interface in supplementary materials to estimate ddg values using rosetta we started from structure minimization using the relax procedure for each s protein-fab complex model we made 10 relaxed structures from which we chose the representative model with the lowest free energy in these structures we calculated ddg estimates as change of stability using the ddgmonomer algorithm with 50 iterations and settings as described in 32 labeled rosetta ddg total energy in supplementary materials additional ddg estimates were calculated using the flexddg protocol 33  which evaluates energy changes by focusing on interfaces within rbd-fab complexes only labeled rosetta ddg flex in supplementary

interaction free energies 19  mmgbsa uses fully solvated molecular dynamics for conformational sampling of the protein complex but estimates free energy by a computationally cheaper implicit solvent model gbsa all molecular dynamics simulations were performed with openmm 34  a toolkit for molecular simulation using the amber force field 35  positional constraints 1 kcalmole 2  were place on the backbone atoms c n and ca during heating of the system the system was heated in 50 k increments for 100 ps at each temperature once the system was at 310 k all constraints were removed and equilibration was performed for 9 ns ten individual 5 ns dynamics simulations were performed from the equilibrated system for conformational sampling the last 1 ns of the dynamics in 50 ps increments from each of the simulations was used for the mmgbsa calculation 200 total structures the mmgbsa calculations were performed using mmpbsapy that is part of the amber suite of programs as a bioinformatic heuristic we computed the number of mutations that are considered to be unlikely labeled number of unconventional mutations in the dataset provided in the supplementary materials for each mutant antibody considered this heuristic describes mutations that are low probability under a mutational probability distribution derived from the blosum62 substitution matrix 36  this mutational probability distribution gives some substitutions higher probabilities eg a-s 01168 and some lower eg a-w 000594 where the total of the probabilities of the 19 destination amino acids is 10 if a given point mutation is given a probability of  0052 ie less than 119th the mutation is declared unconventional and this count is incremented by one for example for alanine a 11 of 19 mutations are unconventional with this heuristic  differential antibody recognition by novel sars-cov-2 and sars-cov spike protein receptor binding domains mechanistic insights and implications for the design of diagnostics and therapeutics ilda daposannessa filippo marchetti giorgio colombo  the appearance of the novel betacoronavirus sars-cov-2 represents a major threat to human health and its diffusion around the world is causing dramatic consequences the knowledge of the 3d structures of sars-cov-2 proteins can facilitate the development of therapeutic and diagnostic molecules specifically comparative analyses of the structures of sars-cov-2 proteins and homologous proteins from previously characterized viruses such as sars-cov can reveal the common andor distinctive traits that underlie the mechanisms of recognition of cell receptors and of molecules of the immune system herein we apply our recently developed energy-based methods for the prediction of antibodybinding epitopes and protein-protein interaction regions to the receptor binding domain rbd of the spike proteins from sars-cov-2 and sars-cov our analysis focusses only on the study of the structure of rbds in isolation without making use of any previous knowledge of binding properties importantly our results highlight structural and sequence differences among the regions that are predicted to be immunoreactive and bindelicit antibodies these results provide a rational basis to the observation that several sars-cov rdb-specific monoclonal antibodies fail to appreciably bind the sars-cov-2 counterpart furthermore we correctly identify the region of sars-cov-2 rbd that is engaged by the cell receptor ace2 during viral entry into host cells the data sequences and structures we present here can be useful for the development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic interventions  the outbreak of the new betacoronavirus 2019-ncov formally named sars-cov-2 represents a world-wide epidemic threat that has been causing major disruptions in societies and economies 1-2  for these reasons the new virus has been internationally declared a public health emergency in this context structural knowledge of the proteins of the virus can provide important information to develop strategies against the infection ranging from diagnosis to therapy in general coronaviruses use this protein localized on the envelope to bind their cell receptors after binding a series of molecular events lead to the fusion of the viral membrane with that of the host cell eventually leading to virus entry and invasion one of the necessary steps in this mechanism is the binding of the spike protein receptor binding domain rbd to the cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 indeed knock out of ace2 in hela cells was shown to prevent infection for these reasons the development of antibodies that target the spike rbd of coronaviruses and block their interaction with ace2 disrupting a fundamental infection mechanism represent attractive therapeutic solutions monoclonal antibodies with high affinities had been previously developed against the spike rbd of sars-cov however despite the correlations between the two viruses no rbd-targeted sars-cov monoclonal antibodies have shown the ability to bind and neutralize 2019-ncov the recent publication of the cryo-em structure of the 2019-ncov spike trimer at 35  resolution can provide a useful basis to link these observations to molecular causes guide the design of sars-cov-2 specific antibodies and possibly suggest the basis for molecules able to block cell viral entry here we carry out a comparative analysis of the spike protein rbds from sars-cov-2 and sars-cov to reveal the key properties of their surfaces that can be reconnected to observed differences in antibody ab and receptor binding starting from the atomic resolution information available from the solved structures of the two proteins the mlce matrix of low coupling energies method is applied to identify the subsets of surface residues that can be defined as interacting mlce analysis of protein energetics accounts for the interactions that each residue establishes with all other residues of the protein it belongs to the correlation of this parameter with the structural properties of the protein thus highlights which substructures are preorganized to interact with a potential partner a cell receptor or an antibody mlce analyzes the interaction energies of all of the amino acids in a protein in particular it computes the nonbonded part of the potential van der waals electrostatic interactions solvent effects via an mmgbsa calculation obtaining for a protein composed by n residues an n  n symmetric interaction matrix mij eigenvalue decomposition of the matrix highlights the regions of strongest and weakest couplings the fragments that are on the surface contiguous in space and weakly coupled to the protein core define the potential interaction regions in other words the putative interacting patches are assumed to be characterized by frustrated intramolecular interactions the actual interaction with a partner will actually occur if favorable interactions determine a lower free energy for the bound than the unbound state 3 4  indeed minimal energetic coupling with the rest of the protein allows these substructures to undergo conformational changes to be recognized by a binding partner antibodies receptors all these properties are hallmarks of antibody binding epitopes and ppi substructures the mlce method for the prediction of protein-protein interaction regions and antibody binding epitopes has been validated in several previous studies 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14  here we took advantage of the recent publication of the structures of sars-cov-2 spike protein in its pre-fusion state doiorg101126scienceabb2507 and of known structure of the sars-cov spike protein to comparatively apply our interaction epitope prediction method mlce the application of mlce to the receptor binding domain rbd aa 319-591 of the sars-cov-2 spike protein pdb code 6vsb doi 102210pdb6vsbpdb 15 and of the sars-cov spike protein pdb code 5x58 doi 102210pdb5x58pdb  figure 1  shows that the two protein regions that contain potential interaction regionsab-binding epitopes share the same topological localization at the two opposite ends of the 3d structures  figure 1  however this trait appears to be the only common one the linear sequences that correspond to the predicted interacting epitope regions are reported in table 1  importantly the predicted epitopes for sars-cov spike rbd show a good degree of overlap with the epitopes mapped for neutralizing ab 80r 16  s230 17 and m396 18  providing a relevant validation of our approach however in spite of the high degree of structural similarity between the two spike proteins these mabs failed to bind sars-cov-2 rbd probably due to the low degree of sequence conservation in the regions contacted by these antibodies the fact that most of the sars-covdirected mabs are not reactive against the novel betacoronavirus once more highlights the need to discover specific epitopes in sars-cov-2 actually except for the common topological localization the predicted ab-binding epitopes differ between the two proteins both in their sequence and 3d structural organization table 1  2 and figure 1  in some cases linear sequences spanning distant segments of the primary structure come together in the three-dimensional structure to form extended substructures potentially preorganized for binding this is particularly true for the conformational epitope at the n-and cterminal region of sars-cov-2 rbd the interacting region spans a large part of a well-defined betasheet subdomain table 1  2 and figure 2  it is tempting to suggest that the expression of such subdomain in isolation could give rise to a highly immunoreactive molecule 19 20 21  in sars-cov-2 rbd the knowledge of substructures representing potential conformational epitopes may be helpful in guiding the development of peptide-based immunogens able to elicit antibodies that specifically target the cognate protein to which the predicted epitopes belong figure 2  simply speaking the termini of the linear segments making up the conformational epitopes could be aptly bridged with a number of gly residues sufficient to approximate the distance in the experimental structure table 3  antibodies raised against these molecules which recapitulate the main determinants of immunoreactivity of the full protein could have useful applications in a therapeutic setting 19 20 21  furthermore information on potentially specific sars-cov-2 spike rbd-specific epitopes the specific sars-cov-2 rbd epitope sequences and structures identified here can thus be used to design new molecular probes immunoprobes with facile synthetic accessibility and the potential to function both as antigen-mimicking baits to target virus-specific antibodies in patients fluids and as immunogens to generate new abs able to detect relevant antigens 22 23  importantly after we ran our predictions on the sars-cov-2 rbd crystal structures of this domain in complex with the cellular receptor protein ace2 was reported by lan et al aa 480-488 24 and by yan et al 25  of note one predicted interaction region almost completely overlaps with the substructure of spike protein rdb engaged in binding with ace2 478 tpcngvegf 486 synthetic mimicry of this sequence could aptly generate high priority candidates aimed at disrupting ppis between sars-cov-2 rbd and its cell receptor ace2 such molecules could be used to block viral entry into cells similarly our approach also predicts a patch on sars-cov spike rbd which is partly involved in binding ace2 see 26  overall while the two rbd proteins likely evolved from a common ancestor and share a common fold they are characterized by different sequences the physico-chemical properties determined by such sequence differences efficaciously unveiled by mlce reverberate in the modulation of the networks of intraprotein interactions that underlie the preorganization of regions for potential recognition of binding partners cell receptors or antibodies these results represent to the best of our knowledge one of the first molecular physical-chemistry based rationalization of the reasons why some of the tested sars-cov rbd monoclonal abs do not have appreciable cross-reactivity to sars-cov-2 rbd 15  despite the fact that the two domains were recently reported to display the same affinity for the ace2 with kd values of 152 nm and 15 nm for sars-cov-2 and sars-cov respectively 27  in this complex scenario our predictions can help disentangle some of the issues related to betacoronavirues infectivity and immunological response acknowledgement we acknowledge funding by regione lombardia project ready regional network for developing diagnostic methods in rapid response to emerging epidemics and bio-emergencies the coordinates of the proteins analyzed through the text were downloaded from the pdb with the missing residues belonging to highly flexible loops not solved in the structure of the spike protein were modeled by homology using the swissmodel web server httpsswissmodelexpasyorg that retrieved the structure of the sars-cov 5x58 as the best template the structures were used as input for epitope prediction using the matrix of local coupling energies method mlce which combines the analysis of structural determinants of a given protein with its energetic properties 3 4  this approach allows to identify nonoptimized low-intensity energetic interaction-networks corresponding to those substructures that can be more prone to establish interactions with antibodies and be suitably recognized by binding partners briefly the contiguous where  is the a-th eigenvalue and   is the i-th component of the corresponding eigenvector the eigenvector with the most negative correspondent eigenvalue contains most of the interaction information for the stabilizing interaction of the system an approximated interaction matrix   is thus given by if the structure of the protein is known one can estimate a contact matrix  by assuming two amino acids in contact if the distance between two of their heavy atoms is smaller than a threshold the hadamard product of the two matrices gives us the matrix of the local coupling energies       we will select as possible interacting zones sets of close by residues that show weak or frustrated interactions the analysis of the energetic properties of the surface residues is based on the mlce method basically we perform a mmgbsa analysis of the structure in a force field obtaining a symmetric per-residue interaction matrix  keeping only non-bonded interaction ie electrostatic van der waals and solvation contributions we diagonalize the matrix obtaining a set of eigenvectors  sorted following the increasing value of their eigenvectors  where is the number of amino acids in the sequence we thus can write the original matrix  as ij   7  k 7   7   it has been shown that the first eigenvector alone can be used to build an approximate interaction matrix  ij         which recapitulates the interactions most relevant for the stabilization of a certain conformation of a defined protein or protein substructure the mmgbsa is made with amber 14 software with the ff14sb forcefield tables 1 and 2 are highlighted with colors figure 2  the space filling regions indicate possible conformational epitopes for sars-cov-2 formed by the juxtapositions of the sequences reports in table 1  the region binding to ace2 and correctly predicted is also highlighted  an insertion unique to sars-cov-2 exhibits superantigenic character strengthened by recent mutations mary cheng hongying she zhang rebecca porritt a moshe arditi ivet bahar   we first examined whether sars-cov-2 s could bind to the tcr to this aim we constructed a sars-cov-2 s structural model based on the cryo-em structure resolved for the spike glycoprotein 18 and we used the x-ray structure of tcr resolved in a ternary complex with seh and mhcii 17 and generated a series of structural models for possible sars-cov-2 s glycoprotein - tcr complex formation using cluspro 19 our simulations led to the binding pose presented in fig 1a as one of the most probable mechanisms of complex formation as described in detail in supplemental information si and supplementary fig s1 therein the tcr binds at the interface between the s1 and s2 subunits of the spike protein near the s1s2 cleavage site a closeup view of the interface between the spike and tcrv domain fig 1b reveals several strong interatomic interactions involving residues s680-r683 on the spike and r70-e74 and q52 d56 on the respective cdrs 3 and 2 on v we note that the tcrv-binding epitope on sars-cov-2 s is centered around a sequence motif p681rra684 or shortly prra hereafter and its sequential and spatial neighbors comparison of sars-cov-2 s to other beta-coronavirus spike protein sequences showed 20 that sars-cov-2 is distinguished by the existence of this four-residue insertion prra preceding the furin cleavage site r685-s686 peptide bond between the subunits s1 and s2 of each protomer fig 2a structural comparison of the trimeric s proteins between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 further shows their close structural similarity in general except for the rbd which is engaged in specific interfacial interactions 18 but the two spikes significantly differ near the prrars motif unique to sars-cov-2 which is exposed to the extracellular medium fig 2b the insertion prra together with the sequentially preceding seven amino acids and succeeding arg fully conserved among -coronaviruses have been pointed out to form a motif y674qtqtnsprrar685 homologous to that of neurotoxins from ophiophagus cobra and bungarus genera as well as neurotoxin-like regions from three rabv strains 21 fig 2c we further noticed that the same segment bears close similarity to hiv-1 glycoprotein gp120 superantigenic motif f164-v164 this close sequence similarity to both bacterial and viral sags in support of the potential superantigenic character of the amino acid stretch y674-r685 of sars-cov-2 s directed us to further analyze its local sequence and structural properties our analysis led to an interesting sequence similarity between the partially overlapping fragment t678-q690 of the spike and the seb superantigenic peptide y150nkkkatvqeld161 fig 3a this dodecapeptide sequence within the seb shows strong conservation among a broad range of staphylococcal and streptococcal sags 23 24 we note that the sequentially aligned segment of sars1 s664-k672 bears minimal similarity to the seb sag fig 3a
left what is even more interesting is that sars-cov-2 motif showed a palindromic behavior with respect to the superantigenic seb sequence in the sense that a broader stretch from e661 to r685 could be aligned to the superantigen peptide in the reverse direction as well fig 3a
right this brings to our attention the versatility and high propensity of the sars-cov-2 s tcrv-binding site residues to potentially act as a superantigenic fragment significantly the structures of the two peptides exhibit a remarkable similarity fig 3bc including a salt bridge stabilizing each structural motif e159-k152 in seb and e661-r685 in sars-cov-2 s the relative orientations of three positively charged residues k152-k153-k154 in seb and r682-r683-r685 in sars-cov-2 s a -hairpin which apparently serves as a scaffold and may be further supported in sars coronavirus by a potential disulfide bond between c662-c671 the former two features are absent in sars1 spike fig 3d this analysis overall indicates that the segment t678nsprrar685 forms a putatively superantigenic core consistently aligned against various bacterial or viral sags figs 2c and 3ac with or without the participation of the adjoining amino acids however combined broader sequence and structure analysis in fig 3 panels a right and bc reveals an even more compelling feature this putative sag core is structurally consolidated by spatial proximity to a conserved acidic segment e661cd663 which forms a highly stable salt bridge with the polybasic segment prrar of sars-cov-2 s much in the same way as to the salt bridge observed in seb but not in sars1 s we note that the seb superantigen peptide y150nkkkatvqeld161 has been reported to bind cd28 23 a t cell receptor that provides co-stimulatory signals required for t cell activation and survival cd28 and tcrv domains share the same immunoglobulin fold fig 3e and the binding mechanism shown in fig 1b is likely to be adopted with minor rearrangements for enabling the binding of seb to cd28 finally because of the homologous superantigenic segment of seb binding cd28 we also tested the potential binding of sars2 spike e661-r685 onto cd28 considering the possibility that the target of sars2 spike superantigenic segment might be cd28 our simulations indicated that the same segment can equally bind to cd28 further supporting the strong propensity of the fragment to stimulate t cell activation the existence of potential superantigenic toxic or intercellular-adhesion molecule icam-like sequence fragments in sars1 was thoroughly examined by li et al following the 2003 pandemic 26 this led to the identification of the nine sequence stretches including three botulinum neurotoxin type d or g precursors and two motifs that have a high similarity with the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 icam-1 comparative analysis with sars-cov-2 spike sequence revealed that seven of these sequence motifs are conserved between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 supplementary fig s2 among them we note that y279nengtitdavdcaldplsetkc301 an icam-1 cd54-like motif also participates in the association between the sars-cov-2 spike and the bound tcr see fig 4 note that icam-1 involvement is critical to mediating immune and inflammatory responses the observed interaction of the icam-1-like motif of sars-cov-2 s with tcrv in tandem with the interaction of the above discussed putative sag motif around the insert prra with tcrv is likely to further strengthen the association of the virus with the t cell and the ensuing activation precisely n280-e281-n282 and t286 belonging to the icam-like fragment closely interact with the tcrv cdrs mainly t286 spike makes close contacts with s94 cdr3 e281 spike forms a hydrogen bond with t51 cdr2 and n280 and n282 spike closely associate with r69 fig 4d interestingly the sars-cov-2 spike binding region harbors three residues that have been recently reported to have mutated in new strains from europe and usa 27 28 d614g a831v and d839yne the former two may potentially interact with mhcii while the latter d839 european strain is located close to tcrv and strongly interacts with n30 fig 4a and c and supplementary figs s3 and s4a its substitution by glutamate in the mutant d839e increases the strength of the intermolecular and thereby virus-t cell association supplementary fig s4c even stronger interactions between spike and tcrv are observed upon replacing d839 with a tyrosine as illustrated in supplementary fig s4d the interfacial interactions in this case are further stabilized by a hydrogen bond between y839 and d32 an aromatic polar- interaction between y839 and n30 as well as possible electrostatic interactions with k73 and s97 quantitative evaluation of the change in binding affinity between the spike and tcr upon mutating d839 to y e and n yields gdy  22kcal mol1 gde  21kcal mol1 and gdn  13kcal mol1 respectively see supplementary table s1 for details thus the d839yne mutations would be expected to strengthensupport the above described association between the superantigenic prra-containing segment and the tcrv an understanding of the immunopathology leading to severe manifestations of covid-19 in both adults and children is of critical importance for effective management and treatment of the disease mis-c shows remarkable similarity to pediatric tss 59 using in silico modeling and analysis we found that sars-cov-2 encodes a superantigen motif near its s1s2 cleavage site this region is highly similar in structure to the seb sag motif that interacts with both the tcr and cd28 23 and mediates tss seb enables large-scale t cell activation and proliferation 13 resulting in massive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including ifn tnf and il-2 from t cells as well as il-1 and tnf from apcs 13 this cytokine storm leads to multi-organ tissue damage similar to what is now observed in mis-c we therefore propose that mis-c observed in covid-19 patients may be mediated by superantigen activity of the sars-cov-2 s protein to date mis-c is mostly observed in europe and east coast of north america and has not been described in asia despite sizeable out-breaks of covid-19 57 cdc and ecdc we show that a mutation at d839 found in a european strain of sars-cov-2 enhances the binding affinity of the sag motif to the tcr this could at least partly explain the geographical skewing of mis-c to areas where the european strain is endemic and identification of other strain-specific mutations may help predict where future outbreak of mis-c may occur our findings raise the exciting possibility that immunomodulatory therapeutic options used for tss may also be effective for mis-c including ivig and steroids indeed initial published and unpublished reports suggest that mis-c patients respond well to ivig with or without steroids 57 ivig recognizes seb epitopes 29 and thus may function in part by neutralization of a superantigen given structural similarities between seb and the s protein sag motif there is potential for cross-reactivity of these immunoglobins explaining at least in part the response of mis-c cases to ivig other fda-approved anti-inflammatory drugs tested in models of seb tss may also be effective including ctla4-ig which can inhibit cd28 co-stimulation 30 and the mtor inhibitor rapamycin 31 which is already in use for covid-19 in addition humanized monoclonal anti-seb abs have been described 32 that could also be of potential therapeutic benefit in mis-c patients notably it has been shown in the mouse model of tss that lethal seb superantigen challenge can be prevented by short peptide mimetics of its superantigen motif 23 it would be interesting to examine whether short peptide mimetics of sars-cov-2 spike superantigen region might be employed to preventattenuate inflammatory cytokine gene induction and toxic shock in mis-c patients at present the majority of antibody therapies under investigation are designed to target the sars-cov-2 receptor binding domains rbds 33 34 and our simulations also indicated that rbd might potentially interact with tcrs however compared with rbds relatively fewer mutations are found in the sag region of sars-cov-2 notably the prra insert is unique to sars-cov-2 and retained among all of its isolates sequenced to date 27 28 it might be constructive to design antibodies or drugs targeting this sag region to not only block the cleavage essential to enabling viral entry 1 20 but also modulate the sag-induced inflammatory cytokine gene induction 13 fortunately severe respiratory manifestations of covid-19 in children as well as development of mis-c are rare this may be due to trained immunity 2 or cross-viral immunity to other coronavirus strains 35 t and b cells play an important role in the anti-viral response cd4 and cd8 t cells from convalescent covid-19 patients can recognize a range of sars2 epitopes and the s protein represents a major target 35 interestingly t cells from unexposed individuals can also respond to s protein epitopes from sars-cov-2 which supports the hypothesis of cross-viral immunity from other coronavirus strains 35 however why only a fraction of infected children develop mis-c is unclear it is possible that a poor initial antibody response to the virus fails to neutralize sag leading to immune enhancement following re exposure or that certain hla types are more permissive of binding sag and indeed hla has been shown to play a role in covid susceptibility 36 of the nine cases initially reported in the uk six were of afro-caribbean descent which also suggests a potential genetic component to susceptibility 5 it is interesting to note that approximately a third or fewer of mis-c patients tested positive for the sars-cov-2 but the majority but not all have serologic evidence of infection or a history of exposure to covid-19 57 this may suggest that the sars-cov-2 sag causes a delayed hyperinflammation response in certain children sags have been implicated in autoimmunity by triggering self-reactive t cells 12 antibody-mediated enhancement upon re-exposure to the virus may also contribute to uncontrolled infection and inflammation 37 it is also possible that despite a negative nasopharyngeal pcr test the virus may still be present in the gastrointestinal tract 38 mis-c patients demonstrate unusually severe gi symptoms abdominal pain vomiting and diarrhea in addition to severe myocardial dysfunction and cardiac shock 57 and such severe gi symptoms are also frequently associated with the sag 9 in summary we made three major observations a prrar and sequential neighbors interact with tcrv residues d56 r70 and e74 at the cdrs and this association closely resembles that of seb sag with tcrv b nearby d839 participates in this interaction and its mutation to tyrosine would further strengthen the association with tcrv and c a sequence motif n280-t286 typical of icam-1 further interacts with the tcrv further stabilizingenhancing the association between the viral spike and host cell tcr so the binding pose of tcr with respect to the spike allows simultaneously for all three associations the first is the most important the 2nd is significant because it is the european strain the 3rd may be imparting a stronger host-virus adhesion therefore strategies used for the treatment of seb-mediated toxic shock or approaches to block the interaction of s protein with the tcr may reduce hyperinflammatory manifestations of covid-19 in both adults and children sars-cov-2 p0dtc2 and sars-cov cvhsap59594 spike

impact to millions of peoples health and global economy 1 httpswwwcdcgovcoronavirus2019-ncov to date more than 126212 deaths and nearly two million confirmed positive cases have been reported globally making sars-cov-2 a urgent public health concern along the side of using using neutralizing antibodies targeting spike glycoproteins which is involved in host cell adhesion 2 several antiviral drugs

a is also been screening against sars-cov-2 6 however the drug target of viral protein and the mechanism of action of arbidol over sars-cov-2 is elusive which is essential to understand drug action mechanism to develop better therapeutics considering the current public health crisis we aimed to unravel the potential drug target molecular interactions and address the mechanism of action of arbidol on sars-cov-2 foremost it was interesting for us to know that arbidol is the known drug for influenza 17 thats binds haemagglutinin ha protein this raises an intriguing question that are there any sequence or structural similarities between sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein and influenza virus h3n2 ha protein which could have resulted in the positive drug effect the comparative protein sequence analysis shows that a short region of sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein trimerization domain s2 aa947  aa1027 resembles to that of h3n2 ha fig s1a the outer membrane spike glycosylation protein of sars-cov-2 is essential for host cell adhesion via human ace2 and cd26 receptors 28 and its trimerization is imperative for host membrane fusion this raises the intriguing question whether the arbidol could also bind similar way to that of ha in sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein finding the potential arbidol antiviral drug binding target and structural studies to unravel the mechanism of interaction has great implications and essential at the current global public health emergency which could open the arena in developing new potential therapeutics to this end we performed molecular dynamics and structure-guided drug binding analysis to screen the arbidol binding sites in sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein though two independent servers i haddock22 httpshaddockscienceuunl and ii swissdock httpswissdockchdocking for reliability using sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein trimer pdb 6vsb 2 both servers predictions were consistent and provide six possible positions where a arbidol could potentially interact with the spike glycoprotein fig s1b and s1c among the obtained six clusters of arbidol binding sites we notice a single false positive c1 a single true site c2 and four unimportantsurface binding regions c3-6 clusters which is assessed and corroborated based on the solvent accessibility surface area sasa c-score confidence score and z- score clash score of binding location and exposed residues of sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein further refinement was completed using coot wwwmrc-imbcamuk to ensure appropriate docking and no clashes in the side chain residues binding free energies were taken into consideration for selecting the best possible docked site the final model with aribidol docked in the homotrimer structure of sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein fig 1b was visualised in pymol to unravel the arbidol binding mode and mechanism of action we first looked at the most possible amino acid residues of spike glycoprotein involved in establishing the interaction with arbidol we found that k776 e780 k947 e1017 r1019 s1021 n1023 l1024 t1027 of the s2 trimerization domain makes interaction with arbidol either via van der waals forces or hydrogen bonding fig 1d and fig s1e specifically arbidol is sandwiched between the trimerization helices of two protomers k776 r1019 n1023 l1024 t1027 chain a and e780 k947 e1017 s1021 l1024 chain b fig 1c and 1d where the total buried interface of 9002 for three arbidol binding regions 3002arbidol as calculated from the pisa server httpswwwebiacukpdbepisa we next looked at how arbidol interacts in h3n2 ha protein pdb 5t6n 7 interestingly we noticed that arbidol interaction in influenza ha protein is also mediated via arg lys leu and glu as the key interacting residues r54 e57 k58 l90 e97 l98 l99 fig 1e and 1f furthermore the arbidol is sandwiched between the two trimerization helices of two protomers chain a and b fig 1f furthermore we found that the position of h3n2 ha binding residues e57 r54 e97 l98 l99 k307 t59 k58 were similar with that of sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein residues k776  780 e1017 r1019 l1024 y1027 furthermore to compare the exact structural similarities between the sars-cov-2 and h3n2 trimerization domains involved in abridol binding we superimposed the arbidol binding regions of sars-cov-2 and h3n2 which superimposes with rmsd 082 for c atoms this also suggests possible structural similarities in the drug binding region of spike glycoprotein in influenza virus and sars-cov-2 which accentuates how an influenza virus drug could be a potential drug for sars-cov-2 infections the sequence and structural similarities between the binding sites of arbidol both solved and simulated seems promising and suggests arbidol efficacy in combating the sars-cov-2 based on the molecular dynamics and structural studies corroborate that spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 is the drug target for the arbidol this incites the drug binding mode with its key interacting residues and its mechanism where arbidol can effectively block or impede the trimerization of spike glycoprotein which is essential for cell adherence and entry 9 blocking the trimerization of spike glycoprotein also leads in the formation of naked or unmatured virus which are least infectious although this study has significant implications repurposing and knowing the drug target and in understanding the mechanism of viral inhibition the efficacy and safety of arbidol against sars-cov-2 still requires clinical investigation as current drug options are more focused on inhibitors for ace2 and viral rna polymerase potential drugs to impede the viral spike protein trimerization is also equally essential as the combination of drugs have a profound effect in combating the viral infection this study also accenture in the development of new therapeutics for sars-cov-2 based on arbidol using structure-guided drug designing no  composition and divergence of coronavirus spike proteins and host ace2 receptors predict potential intermediate hosts of sarscov2 zhixin liu xiao xiao xiuli wei jian li jing yang huabing tan jianyong zhu qiwei zhang jianguo wu long liu   severe

7
 merscov was first identified in the middle east in 2012 a report confirmed 1791 merscov infection cases including at least 640 deaths in 27 countries as of july 2016
8
 because of the confirmed humantohuman transmission route up to 18 february 2020 a total of 72 533 patients of covid19 caused by sarscov2 including 1872 deaths were reported in china http2019ncovchinacdccn2019-ncovindexhtml in addition 505 covid19 cases have now been transmitted across other 24 countries http2019ncovchinacdccn2019-ncovglobalhtml a part of them because of contact or residence history with wuhan confirmation of intermediate hosts is essential to prevent further spread of the epidemic this study focuses on comparisons of the spike sequences between sarscov2 with sarscov bat sarslike cov and other coronaviruses which are helpful for evolutionary analysis and finding the possible virus reservoirs in addition analysis of the ace2 structures and binding motif alignment facilitates obtaining clues to differentiate the potential hosts fulllength protein sequences of spike glycoprotein and ace2 were downloaded from the ncbi genbank database including sarscov2 spike proteins accession number qhu79173 qhr84449 qhq71963 qho62107 qho60594 qhn73795 qhd43416 and bbw89517 sarscov spike proteins accession number acu31051 acu31032 np828851 abf65836 aar91586 and aap37017 bat sarslike cov ratg13 avp788042 avp78031 ato98231 agz48828 akz19087 and aid16716 the bat sarslike cov ratg13 sequence was downloaded from the gisaid httpwwwgisaidorg the pangolin metagenome was downloaded from the ncbi bioproject database prjna5732983 and the coronavirus genomes sequences were analyzed by virmap

 alignment of spike protein sequences from different sources and residue comparison of ace2 among different species were accomplished by mgeax version 1005 the phylogenetic analysis was accomplished through multiple comparisons using the neighborjoining algorithm in the mgeax version 1005 multiple comparisons were done by clustalw multiple sequence alignment the neighborjoining phylogenies were estimated and the number of bootstraps was 1000 the poisson correction model and gammadistributed pattern were used the fulllength structure of sarscov2 spike glycoprotein was simulated by the itasser server online tool
10
 the spikeace2 binding model was predicted using prism 20
11
 the spike protein and ace2 structure files were analyzed using pymol software pymol v10 sarscov2 encodes at least 27 proteins including 15 nonstructural proteins 4 structural proteins and 8 auxiliary proteins
12
 spike glycoprotein s a structural protein located on the outer envelope of the virion binds to the hostreceptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 the s glycoprotein of sarscov merscov and sarscov2 has 1104 to 1273 amino acids and contains an amino nterminal s1 subunit and a carboxyl cterminal s2 subunit
13
 figure 1 in the s1 subunit the receptorbinding domain rbd spanning about 200 residues consists of two subdomains the core and external subdomains
14
 
15
 the rbd core subdomain is responsible for the formation of s trimer particles
16
 the external subdomain contains two exposed loops on the surface which bind with ace2
17
 investigating the evolutionary relationship of the rbd sequence in spike protein is helpful for understanding the virus origin trends phylogenetic reconstruction determines the evolutionary relationship and host selection between spike glycoproteins in the humanclose beta coronaviruses to better understand the host selection of beta coronaviruses the relationship of spike glycoprotein between sarscov2 and other closely related beta coronaviruses has been analyzed the result showed that bat sarslike cov ratg13 with 962 overall genome sequence identity
18
 is an inner joint neighbor of sarscov2 figure 2 in october 2019 it was reported that sendai virus and coronavirus were the dominant viruses in the virome data of malayan pangolins
19
 it is noteworthy that sarscov was the most widely distributed coronavirus in the pangolin samples we blasted the sarscov2 reads and found that the spike protein sequence was present in pangolin sarslike cov numbered srr10168377 here the s protein in pangolin sarslike cov srr10168377 marked as red star possesses only 75 similarity with sarscov2 partly because there were more than 220 residues in the s2 subunit that had not been read in the virome data removing the lost sequences there was still 88 similarity with sarscov2 data not shown the fulllength sequence of spike protein between pangolin sarslike cov and sarscov2 seems to be a little different the temporal tree showed that the divergence time of spike sequence between bat sarslike ratg13 and sarscov2 is 018 while it is 150 in bat sarslike ratg13 to sarscov2 cluster figure s1 global expansion and deep sequencing work have led to an increased amount of the sarscov2 genotype studying selective stress may be helpful for assessing the variability and potential for host changes of sarscov2 based on a report
20
 the selective pressure analysis showed that genes orf10 and orf7a have a greater selective pressure and spike has an average pressure relative to the whole genome figure s2 the spike rbdreceptor interaction is a key factor determining the host range of coronaviruses the rbd sequences of spike protein from sarscov bat or pangolin sarslike cov and sarscov2 were aligned figure 3 there are some deletions from 473 to 490 residues in bat sarslike cov which are located in the external subdomain and it seems that these viruses do not infect humans naturally given that there is no direct evidence showing that bat sarslike cov has ever infected humans interestingly the sarscov2 rbd sequence from 329 to 521 possesses 93 identity with pangolin sarslike cov srr10168377 which has higher than 89 similarity with bat sarslike cov ratg13 figure 3 pangolin sarslike cov srr10168377 has only 85 similarity with bat sarslike cov ratg13 indicating that if focusing on only the spike rbd pangolin sarslike cov srr10168377 has a higher probability to cross host barriers and infect humans sarscov enters the respiratory tract by the receptor ace2
14
 it was reported that sarscov2 uses the same cell entry receptor
18
 to understand the possibility of sarscov2 rbd binding with ace2 the structure of spike protein of sarscov2 was simulated figure 4a the difference in the whole structure of spike protein between sarscov2 red and sarscov green was alimented the coverage of the threading alignment was 083 the number of aligned residues divided by the fulllength protein and the normalized z score of the threading alignment was 627 1 means a good alignment the external subdomain in rbd has also been identified the interaction model of sarscov2 with human ace2 was then calculated by the prism 20 database figure 4b which was generally similar to the structure of sarscov s protein binding with human receptor ace2 figure 4c based on our results and two recent reports
21
 
22
 we noticed that sarscov2 numbering s protein may bind to ace2 through leu455 phe486 gln493 asn501 and tyr505 only quartier is same as sarscov in the external subdomain of sarscov residues l472 n479 and t487 sarscov numbering are the main interfacing positions mutations of these sites support s adaptation for binding to the human ace2 better than civet ace2
23
 at the residue position of 82 in the mouse receptor asparagine of bat rhinolophus pearsonii ace2 may disrupt the interaction with leu472 of sarscov rbd by steric interference hydrophobic contact while met82 in human receptor may interact with position 472 of rbd residues k479 and s487 in civet sarscov can effectively recognize civet ace2 but bind with human ace2 much less efficiently
23
 the residue thr487 in rbd binds to tyr41 and lys353 in human ace2 by van der waals contacts
25
 and threonine at position 487 enhanced the affinity of most rbds for civet and human ace2
24
 residues in positions 479 and 487 in sarscov correspond to the sites 493 and 501 in sarscov2 respectively residues tyr493 and asp501 in bat sarslike cov ratg13 were replaced with gln493 and asn501 in sarscov2 respectively same as pangolin sarslike cov srr10168377 consistent with sarscov binding to human ace2 the residues 31 41 82 353 355 and 357 on the receptor locate in the interface when interacting with sarscov2 spike protein figure 4bc more than five substitutions were observed in turtle chrysemys picta bellii chelonia mydas and pelodiscus sinensis pangolin manis javanica and bat both rhinolophus sinicus and r pearsonii receptors in contrast to the theoretical infectionpermissive species such as human gorilla and macaca table 1 mouse and dog also have multiple 5 substitutions while cat and hamster only contain three mutations in the region it was showed that lys31 tyr41 and lys353 mutations substantially interfere with the s1ig association
24
 it is noteworthy that at position 41 all maintain tyrosine in all observed species expect bats both r sinicus and r pearsonii substituted by histidine at position 353 all contain lysine expect mouse which contains his353 the turtle receptor at position 31 contains glutamine or glutamic acid and mouse receptor contains asparagine other observed species all contain lysine same as humans substitution of his353 with lys353 in mouse ace2 allows sarscov to infect murine cells
14
 indicating the importance of residue lys353 binding with receptor in addition considering the function of position 41 in the interaction with receptor tyrosine may possess higher affinity with asn501 of rbd than histidine from this perspective of asn501 in rbd domain with the sites 41 and 353 of ace2 receptor it seems that turtles and pangolins are closer to humans than bat indicating that turtles and pangolins may be the potential expanded hosts of sarscov2 the structural basis underlying this observed difference remains to be illustrated knowing the structural binding mechanism will support finding the accurate virus reservoirs and facilitate prevention countermeasure development the crystallization of spike protein of sarscov2 was urgently analyzed by cryoelectron microscopy
13
 it helps to verify the interfacing sites in the interaction between sarscov2 spike rbd and human ace2 or other hosts receptors it has been reported that the binding capacity of sarscov2 s protein to ace2 is much stronger than that of sarscov
13
 which indicates that there are more intermediate hosts for sarscov2 pangolin sarslike cov srr10168377 seems to point to the host range of sarscov2 expanded from pangolin it is currently known that turtle also acts as a virus reservoir carrying more than dozens of viruses including ranavirus rv nidovirus nv papillomavirus pv softshelled turtle iridovirus stiv softshelled turtle systemic septicemia spherical virus stsssv tortoise picornavirus topv and trionyx sinensis hemorrhagic syndrome virus tshsv

30
 it does not exclude that bat sarslike cov ratg13 or other sarslike cov infect turtle and expand to humans after evolution from sarscov and merscov to sarscov2 all point to bats as the natural host of coronaviruses but the intermediate hosts are all different previous findings suggested that the snake is a probable wildlife animal reservoir for sarscov2 based on its relative synonymous codon usage bias resembling snake compared with other animals
31
 civets and dromedary as the intermediate hosts of zoonotic sarscov and merscov live in different time and space environments they nevertheless transmitted the coronaviruses to humans which makes it difficult to find the intermediate hosts of sarscov2 in the short term analysis of the viral receptorbinding sequences and host receptors helps to quickly target the possible intermediate hosts of sarscov2 compared with the illegally traded pangolins turtles in the markets are more common and popular this study provides information and possibilities that like snakes and pangolins turtles c picta bellii c mydas and p sinensis may also act as the potential intermediate hosts transmitting sarscov2 to human although much more needs to be confirmed the authors declare that there are no

proteins in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sairaj satarker madhavan nampoothiri  what began with a sign of pneumonia-related respiratory disorders in china has now become a pandemic named by who as covid-19 known to be caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 the sars-cov-2 are newly emerged  coronaviruses belonging to the coronaviridae family sars-cov-2 has a positive viral rna genome expressing open reading frames that code for structural and non-structural proteins the spike nucleocapsid membrane and arch med res e20649 2 envelope proteins are structural proteins the s1 subunit of spike protein facilitates ace2 mediated virus attachment and s2 subunit for membrane fusion the presence of glutamine asparagine leucine phenylalanine and serine amino in sars-cov-2 enhanced ace2 binding the n protein is composed of a serine-rich linker region sandwiched between n terminal ntd and c terminal ctd these terminals play a role in viral entry and its processing post entry the ntd of sars-cov-2 n protein forms orthorhombic crystals and binds to the viral genome the linker region contains phosphorylation sites that regulate its functioning the ctd promotes nucleocapsid formation envelope proteins contain an ntd hydrophobic domain and c terminal which form viroporins needed for viral assembly membrane proteins hydrophilic c terminal and amphipathic n terminal its long-form promotes spike incorporations and interaction with e facilitate virion production as each protein is essential in viral functioning this review describes the insights of sars-cov-2 structural proteins that would help in developing therapeutic strategies by targeting each protein to curb the rapidly growing pandemic  s-e-m-n -3 flanked by untranslated regions on both the ends the rep gene codes for the nonstructural protein membrane and envelope protein that are essential in viral assembly and nucleocapsid protein is important for rna synthesis 15  the spike protein is responsible for the attachment of the virus to the host cell and its subsequent entry into it 6 15 16  recently mutations in the orf1 orf8 n region of sars-cov-2 were observed 17  the mutations in non-structural proteins nsp 2 and nsp 3 could be the reasons for its unique mechanism of action as compared to sars the presence of glutamine serine and proline at various positions in the sequence of sars-cov-2 is believed to affect its properties as shown in table 1  table 2 and table 3 18  only 38  variability was seen in the genome sequence of sars-cov-2 and the strain of coronavirus obtained from bats ie ratg13 thereby indicating 962  similarity between the two these genomes of sars-cov-2 were seen to be expressed in two types of strains of cov namely l and s type recently genomes of 103 patients infected with sars-cov-2 were analysed where-in 101 of them showed a linkage in polymorphism for single nucleotide among these 72 of them expressed l type which is named due to involvement of leucine codon and 29 strains showed s type named due to involvement of serine codon this change was observed at the site of 8728 and 28144 of the sequence 19 similar studies of sars-cov-2 genome analysis showed type i and type ii sars-cov-2 genotypes that differed at sites 8750 29063 and 28112 20 as shown in figure 5 and sars-cov-2 genome types a ancestral genome b obtained by mutations at c28144t and t8782c in type a and c obtained by mutation at g26144t in type b 21  full genome sequencing of various sars-cov-2 isolates have shown multiple variations in different orfs corresponding to the sequence of sars-cov-2 obtained from bat ratg13 which shows that as the virus having spread globally has evolved with numerous mutations 22 as shown in supplementary table 1 that could place the medical fraternity at an even more alarming situation structural proteins of sars-cov-2 the envelope of corona-virion contains protruding projections from its surface called the large surface glycoproteins or spike proteins responsible for recognizing the hosts receptor followed by its binding to it and fusing with its membrane 23  due to the crown-shaped appearance of these projections it has been named coronavirus corona-a crown latin 24 the amino acid sequence of the sars-cov-2 spike protein has  75  homology with sars-cov spike protein 25  other findings have reported a 70 similarity of s1 subunit and 99 similarity of s2 subunit of sars-cov-2 with sars-cov 11  its molecular weight is about 141178 kda and contains 1273 amino acids 26  generally a coronavirus particle may contain about 50-100 timers of spikes 27  the spike protein consists of an ectodomain element transmembrane moiety and a short intracellular c fragment the viral ectodomain inherits two subunits namely s1 that facilitates receptor binding and s2 that facilitates membrane fusion it is structured like a clove built from three s1 subunits and s2 stem formed of a trimer 10 as shown in figure 6a  the genomic sequence of spike with its amino acids is shown in figure 6b  the functional components of spike protein were mapped according to the amino acid positions as shown in table 4  spike proteins also help in promoting adhesion of infected cells with adjacent non-infected cells that enhance the spreading of the virus 29  the additional 12 nucleotides towards the arginine cleaving site correlate to a cleavage site similar to furin and this site is known to be cleaved during virus activation 24  the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 and type ii transmembrane serine protease tmprss2 are co-expressed in type ii pneumocytes tmprss2 initiates cleavage followed by activation of spike protein that promotes membrane fusion and viral entry into the cells and also the transmission of infection to neighbouring cells specifically in the conditions of low ph 30  the spike protein of sars-cov-2 undergoes a structural transformation for the binding of the viral membrane to the host membrane to occur a receptor binding domain rbd is present in the s1 subunit that recognizes and binds to the human ace2 with 10-20 times more affinity than the sars-cov domain 31 possibly due to polymorphism at 501t thus enhancing the receptor spike interactions and promoting infectivity 32  a unique feature is seen in the s1 ad s2 sites of sars-cov-2 where both these sites form a prolonged loop which lies towards the outer end of the trimer thus rendering sars-cov-2 to more proteolytic interaction by the proteases of host cells 4 the s1 subunit occurs in the prefusion trimer phase however upon binding to the host cell receptor it destabilizes and sheds itself and causes the s2 subunit to transform into a stable postfusion state this spike protein can display itself in an upward phase available for a receptor or downward phase unavailable for a receptorin the downward phase of n-cov the rbd lies near the trimers central pocket 31  the s2 subunit comprises a single fusion peptide fp an additional proteolytic site with an internal fusion peptide and just prior to the transmembrane domain a two heptad-repeat 24  recent analysis has suggested four novel inserts in the spike protein that are unique to sars-cov2 in the s1 subunit the insert i hints about the n terminal domain while the c terminal domain has been implicated by the insert ii and insert iii at the junction of the subdomain 1 and subdomain 2 of the s1 subunit lies the insert iv interestingly the inserts i ii and iii have shown remarkable homology with the hiv-1 gp120 while insert iv to gag proteins 33  another study revealed the characteristic features of certain amino acid in s protein that has rendered sars-cov-2 with high affinity to ace receptor the presence of glutamine 493 asparagine 501 leucine 455 phenylalanine 486 and serine 494 amino acids have shown to provide a boost in ace2 binding 32  therefore the s protein plays a crucial role in viral entry into the host cells and the structural abilities in this newly discovered sars-cov-2 boost its intended actions the fact that these protruding spikes are the first point of contact with host receptors therapeutic strategies can be applied to prevent its binding to target receptors and prevent further actions the n protein is the most abundant viral protein and is expressed in host samples during the early stages of infection it is known to bind to viral rna to form a core of a ribonucleoprotein which helps in its host cell entry and interaction with cellular processes following the fusion of virus 34  the sequence of sars-cov-2 n protein shows 90  similarity with the n protein of sars-cov 25  the rtc ie the replication transcription complexes formed by the non-structural proteins nsp play an essential part in viral genome synthesis 35  a linker region is sandwiched between an n terminal domain ntd and a c terminal domain ctd as shown in figure 7  the n protein in sars-cov caused activation of cyclooxygenase-2 cox-2 enhancer further causing the expression of cox-2 that causes inflammation in the lungs 37  it is also involved in the inhibition of phosphorylation of b23 phosphoprotein that is essential in the progression of the cell cycle during the duplication of centrosome 38  the n protein interacts with the p42 proteasome subunit which is known to degrade the viral proteins 39  it also showed to inhibit type i interferon ifn causing restrictions in immune responses generated by the body due to viral infections 40  cell line studies showed that due to the inhibitory action of n protein on the cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase complex c-cdk the progression of s-phase was reduced 41 another cell line study showed reduced proliferation of cells due to inhibition of cytokinesis and protein translation due to n protein-induced aggregation of a translation factor named as human elongation factor 1  hef1  42  the viral rna synthesis is known to increase when n protein is seen to interact with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein hnrnpa1 43  the structural elucidation sars-cov-2 n protein ntd showed that a single asymmetric confirmation of four n protein ntd depicted a structural alignment of an orthorhombic crystal basically it looks like a wrist made up of acidic moieties with a palm of basic components and the core of  sheet extending like fingers 36  the ntd of n protein is known to bind to the rna genome where the sequencing of different ordered and disordered regions of n protein showed that rna binding occurs at the n45-181 region that exists as a monomer 44  it was also reported that the presence of amino acids arginine at position 94 and tyrosine at 122 might be essential for the binding of sars-cov rna 45  but further studies proved that the combination of the linker region and the ntd and even the ctd of n protein was essential in enhanced binding capacity to the viral rna where the latter showed about 6-8 times more binding performance than the earlier as ctd is dimeric in nature with 2 disordered regions around it as compared to the single disordered region around ntd 46  the central linker region is rich in serine and arginine residues sr region possessing essential phosphorylation sites that may regulate the n protein functioning 47  this site forms the major phosphorylation site that enhances the interactions in proteins localization of linker proteins within the cell and mediates the desired activity higher the alanine substitutions reduced the amount of n protein phosphorylation 48 in the linker region the interactions of sr moieties with the central region lead to the formation of dimers of n proteins essential for activity 49 the ctd is hydrophobic in nature rich in helix and is also known as the domain where dimerization occurs the reason for this is that it contains residues that form homodimers by self-association of itself 45  structurally every single asymmetric moiety of ctd consists of four individual homodimers joined to form an octamer the arrangement of these moieties appears in the shape of the letter x that forms symmetric fold structures one being perpendicular and another perpendicular to the midpoint of the structure due to the positive charges in this region the n terminus appears to be basic that could hint it to be a site for the binding of nucleic acid 50 the domain components possess large forces of repulsion that prevents interactions within the domains this provides an electrostatically larger binding surface and prevents oligomer and nucleocapsid formation therefore when nucleic acid binds to it causes neutralization of the charges causing accumulation of protein molecules to come closer and oligomerize thus forming nucleocapsids 46  the n protein showcases various activities essential in the functioning and proliferation of the virus and thus is another essential component after spike proteins along with s the n shows a promising area in the field of developing effective therapeutics to prevent the proliferation of viral progenies the e protein is a tiny integral membrane protein composed of an ntd hydrophobic domain and a chain at c terminal 51 having 76-109 amino acids 52 and 8-12 kda in size 53 the n terminal stretches from 1 st -9 th amino acids the hydrophobic region ranges from 10 th -37 th position and c terminal from 38 th -76 th position in the structural sequence 54  the amino acids in the 1-11 position are present in virion while the hydrophobic tail is towards the cytoplasm55 the hydrophobic region forms oligomers to form an ionic pore across the membranes structural elucidation of this protein shows its pentameric form containing 35 -helical regions and 40 looped regions both these structures showed randomized movements that modulated the normal activity of the ion channels thus enhancing the viral pathogenicity 56  in contrast interactions within the c terminal domain may affect this pentameric conformation 57  a novel feature is seen in the 69 th position of the e protein sequence of sars-cov-2 where arginine has been replaced by alanine glutamine and

mediated glycosylation at aspartate amino acid but may not be necessary for virus like particles vlp formation 59  this protein form viroporins that are proteins of hydrophobic nature and small in architecture these viroporins are essential for viral assembly along with its release they also mediate pathogenic processes and induce cytotoxicity 60  the interactions of nsp2 and nsp3 heterotypically essential in inducing the desired curvature in the endoplasmic reticulum er membrane and m and e coexpression facilitates the production of spherical virulent particles 29  the tail of sars-cov e protein that lies in cytoplasm targets cis-golgi complex region with the help of proline residues incorporated in it the n terminal of e protein also contains additional golgi complex associating elements due to which mutations in the tail region do not affect the golgi complex targeting process 61  the ionic gradient may be dissipated in the ergic and golgi compartment by the e that may lead to the exit of virion 52 the final four amino acids present in the c terminal of e protein hosts a motif named as postsynaptic density proteindisc largezonula occludans-1 pdz binding motif pdm therefore e protein may facilitate disruption of the epithelium of the lungs due to binding of protein associated with caenorhabditis elegans lin-7 protein 1 pals1 to the pdm 62 the m protein is present in a high amount out of all proteins in coronaviruses 63  its length spans to about 220-260 amino acids with a short length n terminal domain attached to triple transmembrane domains that are further connected to a carboxyl-terminal domain and belong to the n-linked glycosylated proteins and conserved domain of 12 amino acids 64  structural analysis of this protein shows that it exists in two forms namely long and compact form these two forms are originally homodimers of n terminal ectodomain and c terminal endodomain that are different in conformation the endodomain may undergo elongation or compression due to which it is named as a long and compact form spike protein can be seen over these both forms but predominantly at the long-form that may suggest this form

carried towards the golgi complex where they interact with e proteins to generate virions out of the three tdm the first one is capable enough to encourage self-association of m proteins improved membrane affinity and retention in golgi 66   proline is expected to create a steric bulk and rigorousness due to which the structure of sars-cov-2 may undergo a change in its conformation 18 x-x running title sars-cov-2 structural proteins  the distal polybasic cleavage sites of sars-cov-2 spike protein enhance spike protein-ace2 binding baofu qiao monica olvera de la cruz  the receptor-binding domain rbd of the sars-cov-2 spike protein plays a crucial role in binding the human cell receptor ace2 that is required for viral entry many studies have been conducted to target the structures of rbd-ace2 binding and to design rbd-targeting vaccines and drugs nevertheless mutations distal from the sars-cov-2 rbd also impact its transmissibility and antibody can target non-rbd regions suggesting the incomplete role of the rbd region in the spike protein-ace2 binding here in order to elucidate distant binding mechanisms we analyze complexes of ace2 with the wild type spike protein and with key mutants via large-scale all-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations we find that though distributed approximately 10 nm away from the rbd the sars-cov-2 polybasic cleavage sites enhance via electrostatic interactions and hydration the rbd-ace2 binding affinity a negatively charged tetrapeptide glugluleuglu is then designed to neutralize the positively charged arginine on the polybasic cleavage sites we find that the tetrapeptide glugluleuglu binds to one of the three polybasic cleavage sites of the sars-cov-2 spike protein lessening by 34 the rbd-ace2 binding strength this significant binding energy reduction demonstrates the feasibility to neutralize rbd-ace2 binding by targeting this specific polybasic cleavage site our work enhances understanding of the binding mechanism of sars-cov-2 to ace2 which may aid the design of therapeutics for covid-19 infection the sars-cov-2 spike protein-ace2 complex showing the polybasic cleavage sites  the outbreak of the sars-cov-2 related disease covid-19 has caused more than 6 million infections and over 03 million deaths globally the sars-cov-2 spike protein exhibits two notable features its receptor-binding domain rbd is optimized to bind the human cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 and each subunit of the spike protein trimer has a polybasic cleavage site 1 given the structural similarity between the spike proteins of the sars-cov-2 and its close relative sars-cov 2003  the rbd of the sars-cov-2 has been quickly recognized in targeting the ace2 receptor 2 3 4 which is required for subsequent viral entry the atomic structures of the contact region between the sars-cov-2 rbd and ace2 have been experimentally obtained by different groups 5 6 7 owing to the crucial role of the sars-cov-2 rbd numerous vaccine and drug candidates have been proposed to target the rbd to inhibit the rbd-ace2 binding 8 9 10 however more research is beginning to show that mutations distal from the rbd non-rbd mutations of sars-cov-2 also influence its transmissibility for instance walls et al 2 found that by mutating the t678nsprrar685 residues which are distributed around 10 nm from the sars-cov-2 rbd to a variant with t678--il--r685 the transduction efficiency decreased in human ace2-expressing baby hamster kidney cells the mutant d614g a single change in the genetic code d  aspartic acid g  glycine of the sars-cov-2 spike protein which began spreading in europe in february displayed stronger transmissibility 11 the d614 and g614 residues are located about 7 -10 nm from the sars-cov-2 rbd surprisingly yuan et al 12 found that the antibody cr3022 isolated from a recovered sars-cov patient targeted a highly conserved epitope of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov which is also distal from their rbds that is the antibody cr3022 does not directly bind the spike protein rbd all these works support the significance of non-rbd mutations and non-rbd-targeting in vaccine and drug design which remains elusive thus far in the present work large scale all-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics md simulations reveal that the spike protein polybasic cleavage sites which are distributed approximately 10 nm away from the rbd can enhance the binding affinity between the sars-cov-2 rbd and ace2 this information is used to design a negatively charged tetrapeptide glugluleuglu that targets the polybasic cleavage sites the negatively charged glutamic acids glu are introduced to charge neutralize the polybasic cleavage sites and the nonpolar leucine leu is included to increase the hydrophobicity of the tetrapeptide which favors binding to the polybasic cleavage site the tetrapeptide glugluleuglu is found to bind to one specific polybasic cleavage site resulting in a remarkable weakening 34 of the spike protein-ace2 binding energy our work provides guidelines to design therapeutic peptides to inhibit sars-cov-2 rbd-ace2 binding  each subunit of the sars-cov-2 trimeric spike protein has one polybasic cleavage site r 682rar685 1 the polybasic cleavage sites r 682rar685 have not been reported for sars-cov or any other lineage b coronaviruses and therefore they are thought to be unique to sars-cov-2 2 13 14 in comparison to the extensive studies carried out on the sars-cov-2 rbd the polybasic cleavage sites have thus far not been widely investigated and their function remains elusive they are believed to be related to the viral transmissibility of sars-cov-2 2 14 moreover they have been found to be essential for spike protein-driven viral entry into lung cells 15  to elucidate the influence of the polybasic cleavage sites the wild type wt spike protein-ace2 complex was investigated along with two mutants figure 1  the sars-cov-2 spike protein-ace2 complex was downloaded from the zhang-server 16 which contains the full length of the wild type sars-cov-2 spike protein bound to the ace2 receptor the spike protein-ace2 complex was solvated in a water box with a length of 161824 nm 3  where 015 m nacl was included all-atom md simulation was conducted to equilibrate the system using the charmm 36m force field 17 to preserve the spike protein-ace2 binding structure the non-hydrogen atoms of the spike protein trimer and ace2 were restrained which were removed in the following simulations the wt spike protein was subsequently mutated for mutant 1 the n679sprra684 residues were removed for all the three subunits of the spike protein trimer this mutant is similar to the variant experimentally investigated t678--il--r685 2  in the case of mutant 2 the r682r683 residues were changed to e 682e683 for all three subunits of the trimeric spike protein where e stands for negatively charged glutamic acid for each of the three systems wt and mutants 1 and 2 all-atom explicit solvent simulations were performed for a duration of 100 ns and five parallel runs were carried out based on the simulation configurations at 20 40 60 80 and 100 ns see the methods section the five parallel simulations were employed to calculate the binding energy table s2 in the supporting information and intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the sars-cov-2 rbd and ace2 figure 2a is the final simulation snapshot of the wild type spike protein-ace2 complex the polybasic cleavage sites are located 10 -13 nm away from the rbd in all three systems the sars-cov-2 rbd stayed bound to ace2 figure 2b-d  nevertheless the potential energy between the rbd and ace2 which was the summation of the intermolecular short-range coulomb and lennard-jones interactions exhibited remarkable differences  figure 2e  the rbd-ace2 binding energy for the wt spike protein is -740  70 kjmol the removal of n679sprra684 compromises the rbd-ace2 interaction by 36 to -470  50 kjmol supporting that mutant 1 heavily depresses the binding affinity between the rbd and ace2 this is in line with the experimental finding that the mutation of t 678nsprrar685 to a variant with t678--il--r685 of a murine leukemia virus decreased the transduction efficiency of human ace2-expressing baby hamster kidney cells 2 meanwhile the mutation from r682r683 to e682e683 decreased the rbd-ace2 binding energy by 20 to -590  40 kjmol therefore both mutants greatly destabilized the rbd-ace2 binding in comparison to the wt spike protein note that ace2 is highly negatively charged -28 e which leads to a highly negatively charged extracellular membrane surface the coulomb interactions favor the adsorption of positively charged species for instance arginine residues also of note is that due to the positively charged nature arginine has been found to enhance the cellular uptake of peptides 18 and promote the therapeutic delivery of peptides across the blood-brain barrier for alzheimers disease 19  therefore the observed drops in the rbd-ace2 binding energy for mutants 1 and 2 could be primarily ascribed to a change in long-range coulomb interactions between ace2 and the spike protein table s2  even though the polybasic cleavage sites are around 10 nm away from the rbd and ace2 moreover the substitution of positively charged arginine with negatively charged glutamic acid increases protein hydration table s2  which is consistent with the fact that negatively charged amino acids exhibit stronger hydration than positively charged ones 20 21 22 further analysis of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the rbd and ace2 demonstrated a similar influence of the mutants figure 2f  for the wt spike protein there exist 8  1 hydrogen bonds between the rbd and ace2 this is in good agreement with the experimental finding 5 that eight rbd-ace2 intermolecular polar interactions were suggested based on the cryo-em structure for mutant 1 the number of rbd-ace2 intermolecular hydrogen bonds decreased by 60 to 32  05 and by 21 to 63  08 for mutant 2 these results further support that both mutants weaken the rbd-ace2 binding affinity in line with the calculated rbd-ace2 intermolecular interaction energy visualization of the distribution of the rbd-ace2 intermolecular hydrogen bonds figure 2b-d suggested that balanced hydrogen bonds at both ends of the rbd-ace2 contact region play a crucial role in stabilizing the rbd-ace2 binding specifically the number of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds decreases at both termini from the wt spike protein to the mutant 2 and to the mutant 1 interestingly when we were preparing this work an antibody cr3022 12 was reported to bind a non-rbd region of the spike protein here we explore the possibility to inhibit sars-cov-2 rbd-ace2 binding by neutralizing the polybasic cleavage sites to this end we designed an oligopeptide a tetrapeptide glugluleuglu eele negatively charged glutamic acids glu were included to neutralize the positively charged arginine residues at the polybasic cleavage sites the hydrophobic leucine leu residue was introduced to decrease the hydration as a test simulation on a tetrapeptide eeee showed that eeee became quickly dissolved within 10 ns owing to the high hydration of the negatively charged amino acids 20 21 22 potential energy and number of hydrogen bonds between the rbd and ace2 in c the averages and standard deviations are from five parallel runs figure 4  three eele molecules were initially put next to the three polybasic sites of the trimeric spike protein the system was equilibrated using the same process as that in the simulations in the absence of the tetrapeptide one typical configuration is presented in figure 3a  the inclusion of the tetrapeptide eele can still preserve the spike protein-ace2 complex figure 3a b  nevertheless the rbd-ace2 intermolecular potential energy  figure 3c remarkably dropped by 34 from -740  70 kjmol without eele to -490  50 kjmol in the presence of eele similarly the number of rbd-ace2 intermolecular hydrogen bonds dropped by 41 therefore the presence of eele greatly lessened rbd-ace2 binding of note is that only one subunit of the trimeric spike protein directly binds to the ace2 receptor consequently the three polybasic cleavage sites have different distances to the ace2 receptor and distinct local environment furthermore the ace2 receptor and the tetrapeptide eele are both negatively charged -28e for ace2 and -3e for eele these effects collectively lead to the observation that the three tetrapeptides exhibited different binding behavior to the neighboring polybasic cleavage sites specifically the polybasic cleavage site distributed the farthest from ace2 stably binds to the tetrapeptide eele for the whole simulation duration of 100 ns  figure 3a  in contrast the two polybasic cleavage sites closer to ace2 form weaker interactions with their neighboring tetrapeptides eele which became unbound at around 40 ns and 74 ns to experimentally design polybasic cleavage site-targeting clinical therapeutic peptides a further increase in the oligopeptide hydrophobicity is required to elevate the stability in the sars-cov-2 spike protein-oligopeptide binding to determine if binding to all of the polybasic cleavage sites reduces the rbd-ace2 overall binding energy even further meanwhile the delivery of therapeutic peptides is known to be challenging concerning their short half-life due to the rapid proteolytic degradation and short circulation time due to the low molecular weight 23 24 these could be potentially overcome by covalently grafting oligopeptides at the side chains of peptide brush polymers 25 or integrating them onto peptide amphiphiles 26 or pegylation 27  using large-scale all-atom explicit solvent simulations we investigated the impact of the sars-cov-2 polybasic cleavage sites which are distributed approximately 10 nm away from the rbd on the binding affinity of the rbd and ace2 it is found that in comparison to the wild type sars-cov-2 spike protein a mutant with the deletion of n679sprra684 and a mutant with the substitution of r682r683 to e682e683 can both lessen the binding strength of the sars-cov-2 rbd and ace2 the mutation-driven difference is ascribed to the electrostatic interactions between the spike proteins wild type and mutants and ace2 and their hydration in line with recent experimental findings 2 11 this work supports that distal mutations can impact the sars-cov-2 rbd-ace2 binding affinity our design of a tetrapeptide glugluleuglu that binds to the polybasic cleavage site of sars-cov-2 demonstrates that the polybasic cleavage site is a target for neutralizing sar-cov-2 rbd-ace2 binding this supports a recent finding that the non-rbd region of sars-cov-2 can be targetted by an antibody 12 this work besides shedding light on the mechanism by which the sars-cov-2 spike protein binds to human cells suggests therapeutic peptides design to target the polybasic cleavage sites that inhibit sars-cov-2 rbd binding to ace2 all-atom explicit

spike protein was mutated for mutant 1 the n679sprra684 residues were deleted from all the three subunits of the spike protein trimer this was to mimic the experimentally reported mutant by walls et al 2 that the residues of t678nsprrar685 in the wild type spike protein of sars-cov-2 were mutated to t678--il--r685 accordingly six clions which were distributed next to the six arginine residues of r 682r683 were removed to neutralize the system the system was further equilibrated to relax the mutated region which was followed by the production simulations the simulation parameters were the same

structural determinants of human sars cov-2 spike protein for binding ace-2 receptor lalitha guruprasad  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars cov-2 the sars cov-2 is transmitted more rapidly and readily than sars cov both sars cov and sars cov-2 via their glycosylated spike proteins recognize the human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ace-2 receptor we generated multiple sequence

causing infection in humans our results show that among the genomes analysed two sequence regions in the n-terminal domain ntd mesefr and syltpg are specific to human sars cov-2 in the receptor

sneezing infection of this highly pathogenic virus can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome which impacts the lung and heart functions the prominent symptoms of this viral infection are flu severe respiratory enteric and neurological disorders resulting in increased white blood cells and kidney failure there are no vaccines or drugs available to combat this deadly infectious disease and there is no strategic plan to treat the infected patients hence there is a need to develop specific anti-sars cov-2 vaccines and drugs to treat infected patients in order to reduce viral shedding and further transmission in populations the sars cov-2 comprises positive-sense single-stranded rna genome of size 29-30 kb and belongs to the coronaviridae family and betacoronavirus sub-family mammals such as bats are the main reservoir of betacoronaviruses but due to the zoonotic contacts and viral genomic mutations sars cov-2 has recently crossed species and caused infections in humans 3 research

human sars cov-2 a six residues insertion sequence mesefr from 153m to 158r and another six residues insertion sequence syltpg from 247s to 252g the bat sars cov spike protein qhr63300 genbank code

distant from the ace-2 binding site from the three-dimensional structure of human sars cov-2 we infer that these regions are likely to be exposed towards the surface of the spike protein in ntd in human sars cov-2 there are two insertion regions a five residues insertion vggny from 445v to 449y and a thirteen residues insertion eiyqagstpcngv from 471e to 483v the bat sars cov spike protein qhr63300 has also gained equivalent insertions with the sequences eggnf and eiyqagskpcngq it is interesting to note that the bat sars cov qhr63300 has already acquired a thirteen residues sequence region whereas all other spike proteins that recognize the ace-2 receptor in sars cov comprise a twelve residues sequence region the figure 2a was generated by editing the msa in figure   s1 to depict the sequence regions discussed above in representative spike proteins from the four host sources bat civet human sars cov and human sars cov-2 the two sequence regions vggny and eiyqagstpcngv are part of the rbd and involved in recognition of the ace-2 receptor in human host their absence in the bat sars cov at equivalent positions may be responsible for their inability to bind human ace-2 to study

coronaviruses the novel sars cov-2 appears to be spreading more rapidly and readily posing a challenging task before the administrative and scientific communities the sars identified from camel to human transmission in saudi arabia in 2012 2 9 10 11 12 these coronaviruses have crossed species and resulted in causing human infections leading to mortality it is reported that civet sars cov can also infect humans 13 the viral rna stores the genetic information and also serves to translate into structural and non-structural proteins nsps of sars cov-2 the sars cov uses angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ace-2 as receptor for entry into human epithelial cells 20 to cause the infection virus infectivity studies on hela cells have shown that sars cov-2 also uses ace-2 as receptor for cellular entry 19 it has been reported that the first sars cov-2 infection in wuhan china is caused from the original host bats 19  and in less than 4 months transmitted among the human populations in the entire world the initial contact between the sars covcov-2 and human host is via recognition between the heavily glycosylated cell envelope spike protein of the virus and the ace-2 receptor of the human host resulting in infection in order to understand the specificity estimate the extent of similarities and variations in the sars cov-2 spike proteins required for binding the host receptor we analyzed the representative spike protein sequences further in order to estimate the evolutionary progression of the bat sars cov genome such that it is able to adapt to a human host as a novel coronavirus causing covid-19 we have analyzed the complete genomes of the bat civet human sars cov and human sars cov-2 we have carried out computational analyses on the nucleotide and protein sequences by generating multiple sequence alignments msas constructing phylogenetic trees and analyzing the three-dimensional structures of the spike proteins to address the above this article is

each dataset was removed using the cd-hit program 22 the nucleotide and protein sequence homology analyses based on msa reveals the substitutions deletions and insertions at each position to understand the evolutionary relationships between the members the msas were further processed to generate phylogenetic trees -a pictorial representation of the evolutionary relationships between

20 program that infers phylogenies using a distance approach since it is capable of handling large datasets 24 based on the input fasta sequences a msa is generated that adopts multiple alignment  the sars cov and sars cov-2 spike proteins retrieved from various host sources have a sequence length ranging between 1240 to 1273 amino acids structurally a spike protein is characterized by three regions 1 the n-terminal extracellular domain 2 a transmembrane anchor domain and 3 an intracellular segment the n-terminal extracellular domain comprises a receptor binding subunit s1 and a membrane-fusion subunit s2 the s1 subunit comprises two domains ntd and rbd the sequence analyses of spike proteins from the various host sources is shown in the msa in supplementary figure s1 and the phylogenetic tree in figure 1  from figure 1  it is observed that the paralogous proteins from individual host sources are associated with a distinct clade the spike proteins from human sars cov-2 share highest sequence similarity according to the least pairwise distances also the orthologous spike proteins from other host species are highly similar according to the low pairwise distances therefore it is intriguing to see that despite high sequence identity between the spike proteins from various host sources only some sars cov and sars cov-2 are able to bind the human host ace-2 receptor in order to understand this we have analyzed the msa of the spike proteins from supplementary figure s1  it is observed that the n-terminal 500 amino acids comprising s1 subunit vary to a moderate extent among all host sources relative to the later receptor 31 the structures were superimposed and amino acid residues within 5  distance from the ace-2 receptor were identified and highlighted in the pairwise sequence alignment of rbd  figure 2b  despite amino acid mutations in these regions in both proteins the structures are highly superimposable the location corresponding to the deletions of the two sequence regions in bat sars cov with respect to human sars cov-2 match with the ace-2 binding region  figure 2c  the second insertion sequence region ie cov-2 and is stabilized by a disulfide bond between 480c and 488c  figure 2c  this disulfide bond is conserved in all spike proteins that comprise the insertion sequence regions in rbd in bat sars cov spike proteins the position equivalent to 488c is replaced by a conserved glycine residue and therefore the above disulfide bond will be absent interestingly the bat sars cov spike protein qhr63300 which has acquired the insertion sequences in rbd also possesses the disulfide bond we believe that the presence of the above sequence regions in rbd and the disulfide bond that stabilizes the conformation of the extended loop are required for the recognition of human ace-2 the sequence regions identified in this work serve as potential candidate epitopes for the design of antibodies specific for human sars cov-2 recognition our analyses suggest that the bat spike protein qhr63300 has undergone significant evolutionary changes such that it resembles the human sars cov-2 spike protein more than the bat sars cov which may have led to the transmission of sars cov from bat to human as the novel sars cov-2 our results also suggest that the bat sars cov spike proteins avp78042 and avp78031 are in the progression of acquiring mutations towards becoming sars cov-2-like proteins the phylogenetic tree in figure 1 showing the proteins qhr63300 avp78042 and avp78031 close to the human sars cov-2 are in support of our hypothesis the representative complete genomes of nucleotide sequences from bat civet human cov and human cov-2 were analyzed the msa is shown in figure s2 and the phylogenetic tree

revealing high identity that suggest their  two sequence regions mesefr and syltpg in the ntd of spike protein in human sars cov-2 and two sequence regions vggny and eiyqagstpcngv in the rbd that

development enlightening nigerians about the pandemic and future treatment yusuf mummed   there is little or no research initiated to enlighten nigerians about the pathogenesis and targets for drug development for the newly discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection as a way forward to achieve long-lasting future treatment of the disease also many citizens of the country are not aware on the deadliness of the disease coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a kind of viral infection causing pneumonia-like symptoms was first reported in wuhan china in december 2019 and the disease is caused by sars-cov-2 12 the outbreak was declared a pandemic by who on 30th of january 2020 and it is regarded as the third introduction of a highly pathogenic virus into the human population the severity at which the virus causes infection to the human population is age and immune status dependent it is shorter among patients greater than 70-years old compared with those under the age of 70 with early symptoms which include fever cough and fatigue other symptoms include sputum production headache haemoptysis dyspnoea and lymphopenia fig 1
 3 clinical features unmask by a chest computer tomography ct scan presented as pneumonia however there are also abnormal features such as rnaaemia acute respiratory distress syndrome acute cardiac injury and incidence of ground-glass opacities that can lead to death 3 unfortunately the use of interferon inhalation for the treatment of some cases did not show clinical progress but worsen the condition and can lead to pulmonary opacities 4 besides patients infected with sars-cov-2 also developed gastrointestinal associated symptoms like diarrhea 35 to minimize the transmission of the sars-cov-2 through health care workers and patients it is important to develop methods for the identification of various modes of viral transmission such as through fecal and urine samples 3 genome sequencing of the virus of five patients with pneumonia hospitalized from december 18 to december 29 2019 showed the presence of a previously unknown  coronavirus -cov strain in all of them 6 upon isolation and sequencing of the -cov it shows 88 identity to the sequence of two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndromes sars-like coronaviruses batsl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 and about 50 identity to the sequence of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 7 there are similarities in the genome sequences of sars-cov-2 with a minimum number of ten open reading frames orfs with the genome sequences of other covs such as mers-cov and sars-cov the first orf making up two-third of the sars-cov-2 rna undergoes translation to two polyproteins in comparison to mers-cov and sars-cov in which their two polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab are then further processed by a post-translational modification to 16 non-structural proteins nsps which are nsp1 to nsp16 8 those nsps are then translocated from the rough endoplasmic reticulum into double-membrane vesicles where the replication and transcription of the virus occurred 910 while the remaining orfs of the sars-cov-2 that are localized on the one-third of the remaining genome are responsible for encoding non-replicating participating accessory proteins with unknown functions and structural proteins such as membrane m nucleocapsid n envelope e and spike proteins s an investigation by scientists in china revealed that the sars-cov requires angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor for their binding and invasion of the host also the binding is significant in the determination of the pathogenesis of the infection caused by sars-cov 11 nevertheless dipeptidyl peptidase 4 is a receptor required by mers-cov for invasion 12 to predict the specificity of zoonotic coronaviruses in the infection of humans and adaptation possibility a better understanding of the proteases action and receptor binding is essential therefore the development of therapeutics for the treatment of sars-cov-2 is highly warranted 3 however this review aims to discuss the molecular pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 its target for drug development to enlighten nigerians on the deadliness of the disease and the way forward to achieve future treatment of the current pandemic the molecular pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 is poorly understood up to date nevertheless mers-cov and sars-cov mechanisms can shed light on the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 the essential protein of sars-cov-2 that mediates binding to a human cell is spike protein a protein involved in the first step of infection the protein is composed of s1 and s2 subunit in which according to cryogenic electron microscopy cryoem studies the receptor-binding domain rbd is a 3d structure with the size of 12 kda which is localized in the s1 subunit the vibrational movement of the rbd has been examined during the characterization of the structure of related mers-cov and sars-cov and was found to have the same mechanism of action with sars-cov-2 interestingly there are similarities in the structure of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov spike glycoprotein but the only structural difference is in the rbd where the sars-cov-2 rbd is an angle closer to the central cavity of the trimer in the down conformation while sars-cov rbd can packs tightly against the domain of the n-terminal of the neighboring protomer in the down conformation 13 the binding affinity of the two viruses was investigated using surface plasmon resonance which showed that even though sars-cov and sars-cov-2 share the same binding receptor ace-2 the binding affinity of sars-cov-2 is 15 nm which is almost 1015 fold higher than sars-cov binding to ace-2 receptor this is the reason why sars-cov-2 can easily be transmitted from human to human whereas the complex formed by sars-cov-2 s-ectodomain and ace-2 has been studied using high-resolution cryoem which revealed that the complex is similar to the sars-cov complex the spike structural protein mediates entry of sars-cov-2 into human cells it is a trimetric protein of class 1 fusion protein with metastable prefusion conformation it undergoes structural rearrangement before human cell membrane fusion the rearrangement is activated upon binding of rbd of the s1 subunit to the host cell receptor ace2 13 destabilization of the prefusion trimer will then take place upon receptor binding viral membrane with the host cell membrane which will lead to the shedding of the s1 and s2 subunit transition to more stable postfusion conformation the rbd of the s1 will pass through hinge-like movement leading to transient hiding down conformation receptor inaccessible state or exposing up confirmation ie receptor accessible state of the receptor binding determinant therefore this is the mechanism of engaging host cell receptor by sars-cov-2 14 15 16 before entry into human cells mers-cov binds to the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp4 receptor and sars-cov binds to the ace2 receptor membrane fusion and viral infectivity of coronavirus occurred by proteolytic cleavage of s20 position of s protein this occurred in sars-cov pathogenesis the use of two-step furin activation is essential for the fusion of mers with the host membrane 17 the entry of sars-cov is also mediated by clathrin-dependent and -independent endocytosis 1819 the sars-cov-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor ace2 which results in its entry into the host the virus releases its rna into the cytoplasm the orf1a and orfab of the rna is translated into polyprotein 1a pp1a and polyprotein ab ppab the orf1a encodes the enzyme protease that cleaves the polyproteins into non-structural proteins nsps which form the rna replicase-transcriptase complex that is needed for structural protein synthesis the replicase complex executes the formation of negative-sense rna upon fragmentation of the negative-sense rna into sub-genomic rna through discontinuous transcription after which fragments that encode spike membrane nucleocapsid and envelope protein are formed the structural proteins are then synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and then they pass through the endoplasmic reticulum-golgi intermediate compartment ergic into the golgi apparatus where sortation and assembly take place finally viral protein and genomic rna are then assembled as virion in the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi and then released outside the cell as a vesicle 20 21 22 23 after the invasion of cells by sars-cov-2 its antigen will be attached to antigen-presenting cells as the central anti-viral immunity finally major histocompatibility complex mhc or human leukocyte antigen hla in humans present antigenic peptides and then cytotoxic t lymphocytes specific for the sars-cov recognized viral antigen therefore this pathogenesis mechanism fig 2
 of sars-cov will help in the understanding of drug development strategies for sars-cov-2 infection upon presentation of antigen by antigen-presenting cells cellular and humoral immunity of the body is then stimulated by virus-specific b and t cells therefore igm and igg are the common antibody profile of sars-cov and 12 weeks are marked as the time taken for igm against sars-cov to disappear with igg lasting longer 23 more researches on the cellular immunity of coronavirus have been carried out and the most updated report reveals that the number of cd4 and cd8 t cells in the peripheral blood of sars-cov-2 infected patients significantly reduced 24 during the acute phase of sars-cov infection there is a decrease in cd4 and cd8 t cells interestingly sars-cov recovered patients have four years of t cell memory and the t cells can undergo ifn-g production delayed-type hypersensitivity dth response and proliferation even without the antigen 25 also t cell memories against sars-cov persist after six years of infection from recovered patients 26 therefore the understanding of the immunology of sars-cov-2 can help in the development of a vaccine 27 pathological events associated with sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov infection is called acute respiratory distress syndrome ard 24 the mechanism of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards is that the effector immune cell uncontrollably released deadly systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines such as ifn-a ifn-g il-1b il6 il-12 il-18 il-33 tnf-a tgfb etc and also chemokines such as ccl2 ccl3 ccl5 cxcl8 cxcl9 cxcl10 etc 2728 the cytokine and chemokine release by the effector cells will lead to organ failure and death this happened in the severe case of sars-cov-2 infection 24 for better survival of mers cov and sars-cov in the invaded host for example pattern recognition receptor is responsible for recognizing pathogen-associated molecule however the mers and sars viruses will develop a way of producing double-membrane vesicle without pattern recognition receptor this allows the viral genome to replicate without the control of the immune system 29 even though ifn-i ifn-a and ifn-b has a protective effect on sars-cov and mers-cov infection it can be inhibited by mers accessory protein through activation of melanoma differentiated associated protein gene 5 mda5 by interaction with double-stranded directly 30 31 32 to elaborate nuclear transport of ifn regulatory protein and activation of ifn b promoter is blocked by mers-cov orf4a orf4b orf5 and membrane proteins 33 since coronaviruses such mers can destabilize the immune system by altering the antigen presentation cells through the downregulation of gene expression therefore it is important in drug development to develop a strategy of destroying immune evasion by sars-cov-2 4 non-structural proteins nsps are involved in protein synthesis translation rna transcription processing modification virus replication and host infection therefore nsps are considered as a significant functional protein of coronaviruses in which coronavirus main proteinase 3clpro papain-like proteinase plpro rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp and helicase are superior molecular targets for small inhibitory molecule drug development as a result of their well-understood enzyme active sites and biological functions for example papain-like proteinase plpro this protein cleaves replicase polyprotein n-terminus leading to the of release nsp1 nsp2 and nsp3 which is indispensable for the replication control corrections 7 also plpro can antagonize the immunity of the infected patient 1637 these group of enzymes is necessary for the replication and viral infection and it is the most popular target for coronavirus inhibition it is highly valuable to target the plpro protein of coronavirus to stop the infection of the virus surprisingly there are no fda approved marketed drugs targeting plpro protein interestingly drugs such as thymidine ribavirin chloramphenicol and chlorphenesin carbamate can easily bind to plpro and prevent viral replication 6 intensive research into plpro protein can open a new door of therapeutics development against sars-cov-2 infection then 3c-like main protease 3clpro otherwise called nsp5 this protein is cleaved automatically from polyprotein to form mature enzyme and it is then further cleaved downstream at 11 sites which will then leads to the release of nsp4 to nsp16 interestingly maturation of nsps is directly mediated by 3clpro and the life cycle of the virus depends on the maturation of 3clpro studies into the structure and catalytic mechanism of 3clpro can make it a promising drug development target for covid-19 therefore anti-bacterial drugs such as lymecycline and anti-hypertensive drugs such as nicardipine are all known to block the activity of the 3c-like main protease rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp otherwise known as nsp12 this protein is conserved in coronaviruses it forms the vital enzyme of the viral replication and transcriptional complex rdrp has conserved amino acid of which are serine and 2 aspartic acid therefore nsp12 has been used as an important target for sars and mers drug development even though no specific inhibitor of nsp12-rdrp has been found its targeted inhibition will not result in significant side effects and toxicity of the host cell strengthening research on this target can lead to therapeutic development for sars-cov infection 38 39 40 however natural products that exhibit anti-virus anti-tumor and anti-inflammation effects will exert binding affinity to rdrp molecules such as betulonal from cassine xylocarpa gnidicin and gniditrin from gnidia lamprantha will bind and inhibit the rdrp of coronaviruses helicase nsp13 this is a multifunctional protein with n terminal metal-binding domain and helicase domain the structure of the n terminal contains 26 cysteine residues that make up the zinc and binding domain with c terminus conserved motif helicase is also a necessary component for the replication of coronavirus therefore helicase is identified as a target for antiviral drug discovery but there is less research on helicase inhibitors drugs such as anti-bacterial lymecycline cefsulodine and rolitetracycline anti-fungal such as itraconazole an anti-hiv drug such as saquinavir an anticoagulant drug such as dabigatran and diuretic drug such as canrenoic acid were shown to be potent inhibitors of helicase 4142 also studies have shown that myricetin and scutellarein can potentially inhibit the sars-cov-2 helicase protein in vitro by affecting the atpase activity but not the unwinding activity of nsp13 43 the core structural protein of coronavirus that gathered to form a special corolla like structure on the viral surface like trimer is called spike protein its binds to host cell receptor using its rbd which results to the invasion of the host host cell protease cleaves spike protein into s1 and s2 the s1 binds to surface receptor of the host and s2 mediates virus to cell fusion and cell to cell fusion cleavage activation and structural integrity are crucial in the invasion and virulence activity which is mediated by spike protein 44 strategies to block spike protein as a means of preventing coronavirus from entering the host are regarded as valuable for the development of antiviral drugs 4445 natural flavonoids licoflavonol from glycyrrhiza uralensis therapeutics such as anticoagulant drug dabigatran etexilate anti-fungal drugs posaconazole and itraconazole anti-hypertensive drugs rescinnamine iloprost and prazosin and an anti-bacterial drug sulfasalazine azlocillin penicillin and cefsulodin inhibit coronavirus binding to a receptor in the cell surface of human cell 6 the rdb located in the s1 of the spike protein of sars-cov-2 is also a target for the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies despite the fact of structural homology of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov by cryoem studies a monoclonal antibody that was originally developed to target sars-cov rbd was tested against sars-cov-2 rbd sd1 fragment but the antibody did not show binding affinity to sars-cov-2 this is to say there are some amino acids involved in the interaction between the rbd of the spike protein and ace2 receptor in sars-cov-2 that are not the same in sars-cov this is further supported by 46 that modeling of sars-cov-2 rdb interaction with ace2 revealed some sequence of amino acids that are important for the interaction between ace2 and rbd of spike glycoprotein but there is less clarity on the actual sequence involved in that interaction therefore there is a need for new monoclonal antibody development for rbd of sars-cov-2 hence the knowledge of spike protein of the sars-cov-2 atomic level using cryoem will enable scientists to carry out protein engineering design and development of more effective inhibitory molecules and monoclonal antibodies 13 virulence factors in coronavirus that interferes with the innate immunity of infected cells are nsp1 nsp3c and orf7a the nsp1 induces degradation of host mrna and interferon type 1 production upon binding to the 40s ribosomal subunit 47 while nsp3c binds with the nucleotide of the host adp-ribose which gives coronavirus the ability to resist innate immunity for instance bone marrow matrix antigen 2 blocks assembled coronavirus in the host cell also sars-cov orf7a interacts with bst 2 and blocks its glycosylation which results in termination of orf7a activity 48 therefore the aforementioned virulence factors are potential drug discovery targets for coronavirus for example anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory natural products can bind and inhibit those virulence factors also drugs such as platycodin d streptomycin tetracycline piperacillin cefpiramide and lymecycline from platycodon grandifloras can potentially inhibit coronavirus virulence factors 4950 the receptor of the spike rna binding domain of sars-cov is the ace2 receptor since sars-cov can interact with the angiotensin receptor blocking the receptor can be a target for therapeutics development for sars-cov-2 infection therefore anti-hypertensive drugs losartan anti-bacterial cefmenoxime hepatoprotective silybin anti-diabetes troglitazone and analgesia ergotamine bind with high affinity to angiotensin 2 receptor 6 rna dependent rna polymerase nsp12 is the most promising molecular target for sars-cov-2 drug development the current state in finding treatment for sars-cov-2 is drug repositioning in which drug targeted for the treatment of the ebola virus called remdesivir which showed efficacy against sars-cov-2 replication therefore the rna dependent rna polymerase inhibitor rdrpscalled remdesivir was developed by gilead science inc to mimic the structure of adenosine and is regarded as nucleotide analog it was developed originally to inhibit ebola virus replication even though the drug did not pass the phase 3 clinical trial on the ebola virus but studies have shown that it is promising for the treatment of covid-19 51 also the drug was reported to be the most promising for sars-cov-2 replication inhibition by who as a result of structural similarities of rdrps of various viruses remdesivir can serve as a broad antiviral drug studies have also shown that the drug is effective against mers-cov interestingly the usa and china commence the phase 3 clinical trial of remdesivir against sars-cov-2 52 even though drugs such as broad-spectrum antibiotics anti-viral drugs and interferons-a nebulization have been used in the reduction of viral load but it is the only remdesivir that has a promising impact on sars-cov-2 the controversy of the efficacy of drugs used in the treatment of sars-cov and mers-cov such as ribavirin corticosteroids lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon is what makes them not to be investigated for the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection but the satisfactory result was achieved after the trial of remdesivir in mice model in which after the treatment of the mice a day after infection with coronavirus there is a decrease in the viral load and an improvement in mice pulmonary function however remdesivir administration after the viral load reaches a maximum peak of infection cannot improve the symptoms of the patient but remdesivir can improve patient symptoms before the virus reaches its maximum peak treatment of rhesus monkey with remdesivir 24 h before the infection is promising in the reduction of symptoms associated with mers-cov infection and within 2 h of administration of 10 g of remdesivir in rhesus monkey results to peripheral blood mononuclear blood distribution of the drug followed by drug activation to nucleotide triphosphate 53 according to the new england journal of medicine a patient with recent travel to wuhan china was diagnosed with covid-19 after returning to washington on january 15 2020 even though there is an improvement on the patient symptoms upon remdesivir treatment but the viral load got decreased before the treatment this is to say that the viral infection is self-limiting and his immune system might have started fighting the infection therefore it is not clear whether the improvement in the symptoms of the patient is due to the drug or the patients natural immunity however remdesivir is expected to be a specific drug that targets the rdrp of sars-cov-2 54 the great zealot of chinese to combat the pandemic has initiated research on covid-19 drugs in which remdesivir was approved for clinical trial after passing stringent ethical review and was on 5th february 2020 launched for the trial chinas compassionate use reported that remdesivir will be the immediate drug for the treatment of severe covid-19 if proven to be effective what brought remdesivir to the stage of the clinical trial is safety and good pharmacokinetics 55 remdesivir in vitro inhibition research carried out by wuhan research institute find out that the drug can block the replication of the virus at ec50  077 m cc50  100 m si  12987 very low micromolar concentration of infected-vero e6 cells wang et al 2020 other studies have shown that effective treatment of sars-cov-2 infection can only be achieved by combinational treatment of chloroquine and remdesivir which will result in the blockage of the viral replication and recovery of the patient from the disease 56 chloroquine increases the endosomal ph of a cell as well as affecting glycosylation of cellular receptor these result in blockage of sars-cov-2 infection 5057 the effect of chloroquine on sars-cov-2 was further investigated by 50 and they reported that chloroquine function at entry and post-entry of the virus in addition to its antiviral activity also chloroquine can modulate the immune system which in turn will result in the enhancement of its antiviral activity it can also inhibit the replication of coronavirus in the epithelial cells of lungs through cellular receptor glycosylation interference the authorization to use chloroquinehydroxychloroquine for the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection was granted by the fda of the usa hence chloroquine function in the blocking of virus fusion to the cell membrane 5859 widely distribution of chloroquine in blood and lungs upon its administration orally is another interesting future of the use of chloroquine in establishing treatment for sars-cov-2 infection it was recommended that covid-19 patients with mild moderate and severe symptoms should take 500 mg of chloroquine twice in a day this prescription has shown to decrease the length of stay in the hospital with improved symptoms hydroxychloroquine has the same activity as chloroquine because they are having an identical mechanism of action 60 moreover intensive research is needed to unravel the potential of other receptors for drug discovery and development for sars-cov-2 besides 59 reported that synthetic mrna called modernas mrna-1273 can be used as a vaccine for protection against sars-cov-2 infection in which upon its intramuscular administration it can evoke antiviral effect directed to the spike protein this is to say the synthetic mrna encodes pre-fused spike protein of sars-cov-2 the use of mrna to elicit antiviral activity does not need the use of a virus unlike conventional vaccines the clinical trial phase 1 of mrna-1273 is currently taking place and if the vaccine is promising its efficacy will be investigated immediately to sum up rna dependent rna polymerase and spike protein of sars-cov-2 are the most promising targets for sars-cov-2 vaccine and drug development and therapeutics repositioning 61 drug development for viral pathogens is a long-term process however as drug repositioning is taking place for the treatment and reduction of the peak of the covid-19 pandemic it is also imperative to identify some promising targets for drug development to have long-lasting future treatment for the disease also an in-depth understanding of the sars-cov-2 pathogenesis and its atomic studies using cryoem to understand the amino acid involved in the interaction between the rbd of spike protein with ace2 of human cells are essential for effective vaccine and drug development nigerian government should initiate research and clinical trial on antiviral drugs that can inhibit sars-cov-2 infection as the current pandemic is claiming the health and lives of people all over the world it is highly important to initiate and expand researches in the study of pathogenesis and drug targets for sars-cov-2 as this will help in developing treatment and vaccine and also will prepare the world to prepare the future reoccurrence of the disease research should also be initiated on the development of bispecific inhibitors of sars-cov-2 to achieve effective inhibition of the coronavirus activity the author declares that there are no conflicts of interest  interaction between heptad repeat 1 and 2 regions in spike protein of sars-associated coronavirus implications for virus fusogenic mechanism and identification of fusion inhibitors shuwen liu gengfu xiao yibang chen yuxian he jinkui niu carlos escalante r huabao xiong james farmar asim debnath k po tien shibo jiang   the global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars1 has seriously threatened public health and socioeconomic stability the disorder is caused by a novel coronavirus sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov2 3 4 5 6 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a functional receptor for the virus7 but the mechanism by which sars-cov enters target cells is unclear elucidation of the fusogenic mechanism will provide important information for development of antiviral drugs and vaccines for treatment and prevention of sars sars-cov could have originated from wild animals because a very similar coronavirus has been isolated from animals such as himalayan palm civets8 this coronavirus shares genetic and structural properties with others including murine hepatitis virus and bovine coronavirus9 10 11 12 for example sars-cov also expresses abundant spike glycoprotein on its surface in a trimeric or dimeric structure forming spikes about 20 nm long and 10 nm wide at the bulbous end2 3 4 5 6 the spike protein of sars-cov which is involved in virus binding fusion and entry is a typical class i viral fusion protein similar to the transmembrane glycoproteins of many enveloped viruses13 therefore information obtained from studies of other enveloped viruses such as hiv-1 could be useful for investigation of the fusogenic mechanism mediated by the sars-cov spike protein in the early 1990s wild and co-workers and our group discovered potent hiv-1 fusion-inhibitory peptides derived from the gp41 heptad repeat 1 and 2 hr1 and hr2 regions designated n-peptides and c-peptides respectively14 15 16 one of the c-peptides t-20 trimeris research triangle park nc usa was recently approved by the us food and drug administration as the first of a new class of anti-hiv drugsfusion inhibitors studies on the mechanism of action of these anti-hiv-1 peptides provided important information to elucidate the fusogenic mechanism mediated by hiv-1 gp4117 18 19 after binding of gp120 to cd4 and a coreceptor gp41 changes conformation via hr1 and hr2 interaction to form a fusogenic hexameric core structure which brings the viral and target-cell membranes into close proximity resulting in fusion between them at the intermediate state a c-peptide can bind the viral gp41 hr1 region and block formation of the six-helix bundle thus inhibiting virus fusion with the target cell20 the discovery of these hiv-1 fusion-inhibitory peptides launched a new line of investigation of viral fusogenic mechanisms and identification of antiviral peptides against infection by many other enveloped virusessimian21 and feline22 immunodefi-ciency viruses ebola virus23 newcastle disease virus24 and respiratory syncytial virus25
 similarly to hiv-1 gp41 the s2 domain of sars-cov spike protein contains hr1 and hr2 sequences which tend to form a coiled-coil structure figure 1
 the aminoacid sequences of peptides derived from the hr1 and hr2 regions of sars-cov spike protein are similar to those from the hiv-1 gp41 hr1 and hr2 regions figure 1 the similarity suggests that these two transmembrane envelope glycoproteins share a common mechanism mediating fusion between the viral and target-cell membranes with a similar approach to that used for studying hiv-1 gp41 we designed and synthesised a series of peptides corresponding to the sequences of sars-cov spike protein hr1 and hr2 regions and used these peptides as probes to study the fusogenic mechanism of the virus and to identify antiviral peptides the funding source had no role in study design collection analysis or interpretation of data the writing of the report or the decision to submit it for publication we analysed the spike protein of sars-cov strain tor25 by a predictprotein program37 the protein consists of an extracellular domain aminoacid residues 11199 a transmembrane domain residues 12001215 and an intracellular domain residues 12161255 a signal peptide residues 113 at the amino-terminus was observed but no obvious fusogenic peptide sequence was identified the spike proteins of most coronaviruses except porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus and feline infectious peritonitis virus are cleavable by cellular proteases to yield s1 receptor binding and s2 virus fusion subunits9 10 12 38 sars-cov spike protein does not contain a typical cleavage site a basic aminoacid sequenceeg rrfrr grhrr krrsrr9 therefore the boundary between the s1 and s2 domains cannot be accurately identified at present as in other coronavirus spike proteins the s2 domain has a more conserved sequence than the s1 domain the latter is a compact globular structure as predicted by the predictprotein program globe for prediction of globularity the s2 domain contains hr1 residues 8921013 and hr2 residues 11451194 similar to other class i viral fusion proteins9 13 39 analysis by the multicoil program31 showed that the sequences in the hr1 and hr2 regions have a tendency to form trimeric or dimeric helix bundles consistent with the observation that coronavirus spike proteins are homotrimers or homodimers9 thus these regions may take part in the oligomerisation and conformational changes of spike protein during viruscell fusion events the spike protein of sars-cov has only about 24 pairwise aminoacid identity with the corresponding proteins of other coronaviruses consistent with the observation by rota and colleagues6 however the identity of their hr1 and hr2 sequences is much higher table 2
 which suggests that the sequences in the hr1 and hr2 regions are more conserved than other sequences in spike protein alignments of the peptides derived from the hr1 and hr2 regions of sars-cov spike protein and the hiv-1 gp41 revealed high sequence similarity between hiv-1 n-peptide n36 and sars-cov n-peptide np-1 and between hiv-1 c-peptide c43 and sars-cov c-peptide cp-1 45 and 51 respectively figure 1 thus the hr1 and hr2 regions in sars-cov spike protein and hiv-1 gp41 may share certain structural and functional features we have also noticed that most of the residues located at the a and d positions of the helical wheels are hydrophobic figure 1 grey boxes and more conserved than those in the b c and f positions which are hydrophilic figure 1 white boxes this feature suggests that these helices form homologous oligomers by hydrophobic association through knobs-into-holes packing interactions at the a and d positions in a way similar to interactions between the n-helices in the hiv-1 gp41 core18 the residues at the b c and f positions form a hydrophilic face towards the solution making the oligomeric bundles water soluble since the hr1 and hr2 sequences of sars-cov spike protein are highly similar to those of hiv-1 gp41 we hypothesised that the hr1 and hr2 domains have similar functions to those of hiv-1 gp41ie participating in the viral fusion process17 40 therefore we designed and synthesised six peptides overlapping the sequences of the hr1 and hr2 regions table 1
figure 1 the peptides range from 34 to 40 aminoacid residues in length only the peptide cp-1 had inhibitory activity on sars-cov-induced cytopathic effect in vero e6 cells with ic50 values of about 19 moll figure 2
 np-1 had a marginal anti-sars-cov activity at 50 moll other peptides did not show inhibitory activity at 50 moll data not shown which suggests that cp-1 perhaps like the hiv-1 gp41 c-peptides interacts with a site in the hr1 region and interferes with the conformational change of the spike protein during the viral fusion process to identify the cp-1 binding site in hr1 we immobilised biotinylated cp-1 on streptavidin sensor chips and searched for the cp-1-binding peptides from hr1 region as determined by surface plasmon resonance with biacore cp-1 strongly bound to np-1 with a high binding affinity or kinetic dissociation constant 162108 moll figure 2 whereas other peptides derived from the hr1 region had very low or no binding activity to cp-1 data not shown cp-2 which has a ten-residue shift towards the c-terminus of cp-1 figure 1 table 1 did not bind to np-1 which suggests that the n-terminal residues of cp-1 are important for the interaction between np-1 and cp-1 or that the c-terminal residues in cp-2 interfere with binding between np-1 and cp-1 circular-dichroism spectroscopic analysis showed that the peptide cp-1 had a low content of -helicity with minima at 208 nm and 222 nm in phosphate buffer ph 72 np-1 and other n-peptides had random coil structure in the same solution when np-1 was mixed with cp-1 in equimolar concentrations the -helicity increased figure 3
 however the -helicity did not change when np-1 was mixed with cp-2 or when cp-1 was mixed with other peptides from hr1 these findings suggest that np-1 and cp-1 associate to form a complex with -helical conformation this helical complex is relatively stable in phosphate buffer with a tm of about 59c figure 3 we have previously shown by n-page that the hiv-1 gp41 peptides n36 and c34 can interact with each other to form a six-helix bundle30 by a similar approach we investigated whether cp-1 also forms an oligomeric complex with peptides derived from the hr1 region with the exception of np-3 n-peptides showed no bands in the gel figure 4
 because they carried net positive charges under the native electrophoresis conditions table 1 and could therefore have migrated up and off the gel np-3 did migrate down in the gel because it has net zero charge but it showed two bands perhaps because it has differing conformations peptide cp-1 showed a band in the lower part of the gel the mixture of np-1 and cp-1 showed two bands the lower one had the same position as isolated cp-1 and the upper one is expected to be a higher order of oligomeric complex formed by np-1 and cp-1 to confirm whether this band indeed represents a complex formed between np-1 and cp-1 we analysed the mixture of np-1 and biotinylated cp-1 at different ratios by n-page in two gels one was stained with coomassie blue figure 4 middle gel the peptides and their complex in another gel were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane which was stained with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase and its substrate figure 4 lower gel with increasing concentrations of np-1 the intensity of upper bands increased and that of the lower bands decreased which suggests that formation of the upper band depends on the concentration of np-1 and confirms that the band does not represent aggregates of cp-1 since the migration speed of a molecule or a complex in n-page depends on both the size and the net charge of the molecule or complex this method cannot be used to measure exactly the molecular mass of np-1cp-1 complex in the gel or to find out whether the lower band of cp-1 is monomer or oligomer therefore we analysed the apparent molecular masses of the peptides np-1 cp-1 and np-1cp-1 complex by sedimentation equilibration which was successfully used to find out the mass of the six-helix bundle formed by the hiv-1 gp41 n-peptides and c-peptides17 the isolated np-1 was a monomer and the molecular mass obtained for cp-1 corresponded to a trimer in phosphate-buffered saline table 3
 the hplc-purified mixture of np-1 and cp-1 showed a complex with a molecular mass of about 24 781 da figure 5
 which was close to the calculated molecular mass of a trimer of dimers these results were confirmed by se-hplc np-1 showed a single peak of monomer and cp-1 a major peak corresponding to a trimer whereas the mixture of np-1 and cp-1 showed three peaks corresponding to np-1 monomer cp-1 trimer and np-1cp-1 trimer of heterodimer hexamer figure 6
 these findings suggest that np-1 is a monomeric structure and that cp-1 has a trimeric conformation in phosphate-buffered saline once they are mixed at equimolar concentration they interact to form a six-helix bundle consisting of three molecules of np-1 and three of cp-1 this notion is consistent with the biophysical properties of the hiv-1 gp41 n-peptides and c-peptides as shown by sedimentation equilibration and se-hplc17 30 41
 alignments of the np-1 and cp-1 peptides on the corresponding hiv-1 gp41 n-peptides and c-peptides revealed reasonable sequence similarities and gave us confidence that a homology model of np-1 and cp-1 association could be built on the basis of the x-ray crystal structure of the hiv-1 gp41 core formed by the gp41 n-peptides and c-peptides18 19 np-1 showed a typical coiled-coil structure figure 7
 most of cp-1 had an -helical conformation with the exception of a kink in the middle of the structure the structure of the possible complex between these two peptides was then investigated by use of specialised protein-docking software35 the residues at the a and d positions in the np-1 and cp-1 are hydrophobic the complex structure formed by the docking technique also shows that there are hydrophobic interactions between these two peptides eg l898 i905 f909 i913 and i916 of np-1 interact very well with l1182 v1171 l1168 i1165 and i1161 of cp-1 respectively owing to the lack of crystal coordinates of the sequence beyond the n-terminus of the hiv-1 gp41 peptide c3418 the corresponding n-terminal sequence residues 11531159 of cp-1 could not be modelled and its interaction with the corresponding region in the c-terminus of np-1 could not be predicted discovery of the peptidic hiv-1 fusion inhibitors14 15 16 and elucidation of their mechanism of action17 18 19 have provided important information to explain the fusogenic mechanism of hiv-1 and other enveloped viruses21 22 23 24 25 by a similar approach we identified an anti-sars-cov peptide from the hr2 region of the sars-cov spike protein this finding conforms with the prediction by gallaher and garry that peptides overlapping the sequences of hr regions of sars-cov spike protein might have inhibitory activity on sars-cov infection httpwwwvirologynetarticlessarss2modelhtml the anti-sars-cov peptide cp-1 and other peptides derived from the hr regions of the spike protein can be used as probes to investigate the roles of hr1 and hr2 regions in the process of sars-cov entry into target cells the biophysical studies showed that the peptides derived from these regions of sars-cov spike proteins have similar properties to those derived from the hiv-1 gp41 hr1 and hr2 regions respectively for example like the hiv-1 gp41 n-peptides and c-peptides np-1 and cp-1 from sars-cov can interact to form high-order oligomeric helices which may have important roles in the fusion of sars-cov with target cells on the basis of results from this study and knowledge about hiv-1 gp41 and other viral transmembrane proteins14 15 16 17 18 19 21 22 23 24 25 we propose a model to elucidate the fusogenic mechanism mediated by sars-cov spike protein and the mechanism by which cp-1 inhibits sars-cov infection figure 8
 in the native state spike proteins on the virus surface could be in oligomeric form through the self-association of their partly helical hr2 regions to form the stems of the spikes on sars-cov hr1 regions may be in random coil conformation covered by s1 domain after the binding of the s1 domain to a receptor eg angiotensin-converting enzyme 27 on the target cell receptor-binding state the s2 domain changes conformation by forming -helices extending and inserting its inert fusion peptide into the target-cell membrane and exposing hr1 and hr2 regions intermediate pre-hairpin state then the hr1s form a trimer and the hr2 trimer dissociates to monomers subsequently the hr2 monomers pack onto the grooves of the hr1 trimer to form the six-helix bundle this fusion-active core structure brings the viral and target-cell membranes into close proximity resulting in fusion between the membranes and formation of fusion pores which allow the virus genome to enter the target cell if a c-peptide such as cp-1 is present in the intermediate state it could bind to the hr1 region and block hexamer formation thereby inhibiting fusion however more direct evidence is needed to validate this model nevertheless the information obtained from other coronaviruses can provide indirect evidence to support the hypothesis luo and colleagues42 have shown that the spike protein of murine hepatitis virus like hiv-1 gp4113 18 contains hr1 and hr2 regions that may have important roles in spike-protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and virus entry double alanine substitutions of the four middle heptadic leucine and isoleucine residues within the hr2 region lead to significant reduction in fusion activity and defects in spike oligomerisation bosch and co-workers43 reported the structural and functional characterisation of the fusion core complex formed by the hr1 and hr2 regions of the murine hepatitis virus spike protein although our group and theirs have worked independently on distinct coronaviruses by different approaches we have obtained surprisingly similar results first only peptides derived from the hr2 region not the hr1 region have antiviral activity second hr2 peptides derived from both murine hepatitis virus and sars-cov spike proteins have antiviral activity in the micromolar range third the fragments involving the interaction between the hr1 and hr2 in spike proteins of both viruses are located in the same regions these findings suggest that murine hepatitis virus and sars-cov have a common fusogenic mechanism which may be shared by other coronaviruses the peptides derived from the hr2 regions of the sars-cov and murine hepatitis virus spike proteins have much less potent inhibitory activity than hiv-1 gp41 c-peptides eg c34 and t-20 which have activity in the nanomolar range16 44 sars-cov and murine hepatitis virus may therefore have a fusogenic mechanism different from that of hiv-1 however the peptides derived from the hr2 regions of many other enveloped viruses including ebola virus23 newcastle disease virus24 parainfluenza virus45 and respiratory syncytial virus25 inhibit the corresponding virus infection also in the micromolar range and these viruses have similar fusogenic mechanisms to hiv-123 two major factors can affect the potency of a fusion-inhibitory peptide the sensitivity of a virus to the corresponding antiviral peptides and the sequence and conformation of the inhibitory peptide the sensitivity of hiv-1 to the fusion-inhibitory peptide t-20 correlates with fusion kinetics envelopecoreceptor affinity and receptor density46 different viruses might have differing fusion rates or receptor-binding affinities therefore these viruses might have different sensitivity to the corresponding inhibitory peptides the antiviral activity of the peptidic fusion inhibitors depends on their optimum peptide sequences and conformations changes in their sequences or conformations could substantially affect their antiviral activity and the stability of the complexes they form17 47 48 however optimisation of the peptide sequence and conformation could improve antiviral activity 
relevance to practice
background
insights into the viral fusogenic mechanism have been gained from studies on the peptidic hiv-1 fusion inhibitors the sars-cov spike glycoprotein contains heptad repeat 1 and 2 hr1 and hr2 sequences that are similar to those from hiv-1 envelope glycoprotein gp41 this similarity might help to elucidate the mechanism by which sars-cov enters target cells and thus could have implications for treatmentthis paper assesses the ability of synthesised peptides derived from the sars-cov hr1 and hr2 regions to inhibit a cytopathic effect in tissue culture and it investigates the interactions between hr1 and hr2 peptides only the cp-1 peptide derived from the hr2 region had strong inhibitory activity in tissue culture cp-1 and the np-1 peptide derived from the hr1 region interacted to form a six-helix structure similar to the fusogenic core structure of hiv-1 gp41
implications
these findings confirm that the carboxyl terminal portion of the spike glycoprotein of sars-cov is a type 1 fusion glycoprotein a possible fusogenic mechanism involves cp-1 binding to the hr1 region thereby interfering with conformational changes that lead to fusion between the viral and target-cell membranes
 therefore cp-1 can be used as a lead in designing more potent anti-sars-cov peptides for drug development use of such peptides for treatment of sars is better than application of anti-hiv peptides for chemotherapy of aids because only a few doses should be needed to treat an individual with acute sars-cov infection no chronic sars has been reported whereas an hiv-infected individual might have to use t-20 one of the most expensive anti-hiv drugs for life furthermore the anti-sars-cov peptides might also be used prophylactically as nasal spray or inhalation formulations to protect at-risk populations working and travelling in sars-endemic areas the peptides derived from the hr1 and hr2 regions of sars-cov spike protein could be used to establish high-throughput assays for screening non-peptidic sars-cov fusion inhibitors we have successfully developed several such assays with the hiv-1 gp41 n-peptides and c-peptides for identification of small-molecule hiv-1 fusion inhibitors20 49 50 any compounds that block the hr1hr2 interaction could be used as leads for development of virus fusion inhibitors  a spike with which to beat covid-19 nawsad alam matthew higgins k   as sars-cov-2 the cause of the covid-19 pandemic has swept across the globe we have been reminded of what it is like to live with rampant infectious disease without effective drugs or vaccines researchers have piled in to the quest to provide rational designs the structural biology community are no exception with structures of sars-cov-2 proteins emerging at unprecedented speed one of their main focuses has been the viral spike glycoprotein that binds to the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 allowing virus entry here we discuss some of these recent papers on structural characterization of the spike and highlight how they might guide structure-based approaches to develop an effective spike-based vaccine coronavirus spikes are trimeric molecules that present their receptor-binding domains rbds at their distal tips these rbds recognize receptors allowing the virus to enter cells during entry the spike undergoes a large conformational rearrangement from its pre-fusion to post-fusion state driving viral fusion with the cell membrane coronavirus spikes have been structurally characterized before in particular for sars-cov and mers-cov two related viruses that have caused epidemics of respiratory disease a crucial question was whether sars-cov-2 resembled either of these related viruses if it did this would be exciting news as years of study of these viruses could be applied to the quest for a sars-cov-2 vaccine using cryo-electron microscopy a number of studies including walls et al1 determined structures of the spike these resembled most closely the structure of the sars-cov spike as seen for other coronaviruses two conformations were visualized  a closed state with the rbds docked against the trimeric core and an open conformation with a single rbd raised into its up position1 these studies also showed just like sars-cov that sars-cov-2 uses ace2 for human cell entry1 a crystal structure soon followed showing how the rbd binds to ace2 ref2 shortly after this the first structure of a neutralizing antibody bound to the rbd of the spike glycoprotein showed that sars-cov-reactive antibodies could neutralize the new virus3 and polyclonal antibody sera against sars-cov also proved effective1 in many ways these structural studies showed that the new virus resembles a virus that causes sars a true sars-cov-2 so what does this mean for design of a vaccine two spike-based vaccine-design strategies developed for sars-cov should be applicable the first approach relies on stabilization of the spike to generate the most effective neutralizing antibody responses vaccinated individuals should generate antibodies to the pre-fusion spike thus preventing ace2 binding and cell entry for this reason structure-guided mutations have been designed that fix the sars-cov spike into this pre-fusion state4 stabilized sars-cov-2 spikes designed using this method are therefore promising for a vaccine but do we need the whole spike a second approach is to design a vaccine that just contains the rbd a number of studies reviewed in ref5 suggest that the most effective neutralizing responses are due to antibodies that target this small domain ensuring that we induce only the best antibodies also reduces the risk of producing dangerous antibodies that help virus entry through antibody-dependent enhancement whether the future holds stabilized spikes or rbds the new spike structures which revealed that our knowledge of sars-cov is also applicable to sars-cov-2 are good news now we must all hope that the quest to design rational vaccines based on this knowledge is as quickly realized as those structural studies as the research community work together to fight this global pandemic  molecular mechanism of evolution and human infection with the novel coronavirus 2019-ncov jiahua he huanyu tao yumeng yan sheng-you huang yi xiao  since december 2019 an outbreak of pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus 2019-ncov has hit the city of wuhan in the hubei province with the continuous development of the epidemic it has become a national public health crisis and calls for urgent antiviral treatments or vaccines the spike protein on the coronavirus envelope is critical for host cell infection and virus vitality previous studies showed that 2019-ncov is highly homologous to human sars-cov and attaches host cells though the binding of the spike receptor binding domain rbd domain to the angiotensin-converting enzyme ii ace2 however the molecular mechanisms of 2019-ncov binding to human ace2 and evolution of 2019-ncov remain unclear in this study we have extensively studied the rbd-ace2 complex spike protein and free rbd systems of 2019-ncov and sars-cov using protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics md simulations it was shown that the rbd-ace2 binding free energy for 2019-ncov is significantly lower than that for sars-cov which is consistent with the fact that 2019-ncov is much more infectious than sars-cov in addition the spike protein of 2019-ncov shows a significantly lower free energy than that of sars-cov suggesting that 2019-ncov is more stable and able to survive a higher temperature than sars-cov this may also provide insights into the evolution of 2019-ncov because sars-like coronaviruses are thought to have originated in bats that are known to have a higher body-temperature than humans it was also revealed that the rbd of 2019-ncov is much more flexible especially near the binding site and thus will have a higher entropy penalty upon binding ace2 compared to the rbd of sars-cov that means that 2019-ncov will be much more temperature-sensitive in terms of human infection than sars-cov with the rising temperature 2019-ncov is expected to decrease its infection ability much faster than sars-cov and get controlled more easily the present findings are expected to be helpful for the disease prevention and control as well as drug and vaccine development of 2019-ncov  coronaviruses covs are a group of enveloped positive-stranded rna viruses that can cause respiratory intestinal and central nervous system infections in humans and animals 1  until last year six strains of coronaviruses that are able to infect humans have been identified 1 2  among them four human coronaviruses including hcov-oc43 hcov-229e hcov-nl63 and hcovhku1 are not highly pathogenic and only cause mild respiratory diseases 1  however two other coronaviruses the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov 3 4 5 6 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 7 8  have caused two large-scale pandemics and resulted in more than 8000 cases including nearly 800 related deaths and about 2500 cases including about 860 related deaths respectively the outbreaks of sars-cov and mers-cov showed that some coronaviruses can be highly-pathogenic viruses when they transmit to humans from animals 9  therefore it is urgent to develop antiviral treatments or vaccines targeting such high-risk coronaviruses like sars-cov and mers-cov before efficient antiviral drugs or vaccines are developed for sars-cov or mers-cov another outbreak of pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus 2019-ncov has emerged in wuhan since december 2019 as of february 17 2020 2019-ncov has caused more than 70000 cases in china and nearly 8000 cases around the world with about 1700 related deaths 10 11 12 13 14  the full-length genome sequence of 2019-ncov was soon determined by the zhang group 15  it was revealed that 2019-ncov has a probable bat origin and is 96 identical at the whole-genome level to a bat sars-like coronavirus 16  in addition 2019-ncov is also closely related to other sars-like coronaviruses and shares 795 sequence identify to sars-cov 16  for some encoded proteins like coronavirus main proteinase 3clpro papain-like protease plpro and rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp the sequence identity is even higher and can be as high as 96 between 2019-ncov and sars-cov 17  therefore it has been thought that 2019-ncov would function the similar way to sars-cov in the human-infection and pathogenic mechanism 16 17 18  coronaviruses uses the surface spike s glycoprotein on the envelope to attach host cells and mediate host cell membrane and viral membrane fusion during infection 19  the spike protein includes two regions s1 and s2 where s1 is for host cell receptor binding and s2 is for membrane fusion the s1 region also includes an n-terminal domain ntd and three c-terminal domains ctd1 ctd2 and ctd3 21  for sars-cov the receptor binding domain rbd is located in the ctd1 of the s1 region sars-cov attaches the human host cells through the binding of the rbd protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme ii ace2 20  therefore the interaction between rbd and ace2 is a prerequisite for the human infection with sars-cov given the high homology between sars-cov and 2019-ncov it was expected that 2019-ncov would also use the ace2 molecule as the receptor to entry human cells 18  this hypothesis was further experimentally confirmed by the virus infectivity studies from the shi group in which 2019-ncov is able to use the ace2 proteins from humans chinese horseshoe bats and civet as an entry receptor in the ace2expressing cells but not cells without ace2 16  xu et al have used moe to calculate the binding free energies between the rbd of spike protein and human ace2 showing that the binding free energy between 2019-ncov and human ace2 was 506 kcalmol whereas that between sars-cov and human ace2 was 786 kcalmol 18  very recently the cryo-em structure of the 2019-ncov spike protein in the prefusion conformation has been determined 22  the biophysical and structural evidence suggested that 2019-ncov binds ace2 with higher affinity than sars-cov 22  although it seems clear that 2019-ncov infects human cells through the binding of the rbd domain to the human ace2 receptor 16 17 18 22  the molecular mechanism of the binding between the rbd protein and the ace2 receptor is still unknown many questions remain to be answered for example previous studies showed that the binding affinity between 2019-ncov and human ace2 is weaker than that between sars-cov and human ace2 18  however in reality 2019-ncov has resulted in many more cases and seems to be more infectious than sars-cov in this study we have extensively investigated the spike proteinhuman ace2 protein systems of 2019-ncov and sars-cov by using protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics md simulations specifically we have extensively studied the free energies and dynamics of rbd-ace2 binding spike protein and free rbd systems given that the spike protein is not only a potential drug target but also the virus antigen the present study will be beneficial for the drug design vaccine development and disease prevention for 2019-ncov in this study we have investigated the rbd-ace2 complex spike protein and free rbd systems of sars-cov genbank id np 8288511 and 2019-ncov genbank id mn9089473 for sars-cov the rbd-ace2 complex structure was directly downloaded from the protein data bank pdb entry 3sci 23  then all the water molecules were removed from the complex structure the free rbd structure was obtained by removing the ace2 protein from the rbd-ace2 complex the structure of the trimeric spike protein of sars-cov was also downloaded from the pdb pdb entry 6acd 21  for 2019-ncov the three dimensional 3d rbd structure was modeled based on the rbd structure of sars-cov using the modeller program 24  where the sequence alignment was performed using the clustalw program 25 26  the complex structure between the 2019-ncov rbd protein and human ace2 was then predicted by our protein-protein docking approach 28 29 30  the 3d structure of the trimeric spike protein for 2019-ncov was constructed based on the structure of the sars-cov spike protein using modeller the complex structure between the 2019-ncov rbd protein and the human ace2 molecule was predicted using our hybrid protein-protein docking algorithm hdock 27 28 29 30  specifically given the individual structures of the spike rbd protein and the human ace2 molecule hdock will globally sample all possible binding modes between the two proteins through a fast fourier transform fft search strategy 30  then all the sampled binding modes were evaluated by our iterative knowledge-based scoring function 31  last the binding modes were ranked according to their binding energy scores and the top ten binding modes were provided to users during the docking calculation all the default parameters were used namely the grid spacing was set to 12 for 3d translational search the angle interval was set to 15  for rotational sampling in 3d euler space the binding interface information in the pdb was automatically applied during the modeling of individual structures a web server version of our hdock algorithm can be freely accessed from our web site at httphdockphyshusteducn 29  the amber suite was used for the md simulations 32  before the simulations the missing residues in the middle of a chain were added using the modeller 24  during the simulations the ff14sb force field was selected 33  explicit solvent model was used the time step was set to 2 fs langevin dynamics were used for temperature control and the program pmemdcuda was used as the simulation engine where the simulations were performed on a gpu compute node 34  specifically for each system the following four stages of md simulations were performed before the production simulation 1 a 1000-step simulation was first run to minimize the solvated protein system with weakly restraints on the backbone atoms 2 the system was then heated to 300k by a 25000-step ie 50ps simulation with weakly restraints on the backbone atoms 3 next another 25000-step ie 50ps constant pressure simulation was conducted to equilibrating the density of the system at 300 k 4 the system was then equilibrated by a 250000-step ie 500ps of constant pressure simulation at 300k finally two 2500000-step production simulations were run to record the trajectories of the system at 300k where the coordinates were written out every 5000 steps ie 10ps resulting in a total of 10ns simulation with 1000 recorded trajectories after the simulations the mmpbsapy was used to calculate free energies of the systems using the mm-gbsa model 35  and the cpptraj was used to analyze the coordinate trajectories 36  the rbd proteins of 2019-ncov and sars-cov exhibit a high sequence similarity 892 with a sequence identity of 737 the high homology resulted in an accurate 3d rbd model of 2019-ncov with a small rmsd of 055 from the experimental sars-cov rbd structure with the experimental human ace2 structure and the 2019-ncov rbd model we then performed proteinprotein docking to predict their binding mode using our hdock approach 28 29 30  figure 1a shows the predicted complex structure between the human ace2 molecule and the 2019-ncov rbd protein it can be seen from the figure that the predicted rbd-ace2 complex structure for 2019-ncov is very close to the experimentally determined rbd-ace2 complex structure for sars-cov and the interface root-mean-square-deviation rmsd between the two complexes is 0473 showing that the rbds of 2019-ncov and sars-cov bind to the same site of the human ace2 receptor  figure   1a  these results can also be understood by comparing the residues at the rbd-ace2 binding interface for 2019-ncov and sars-cov the binding sites on the rbd proteins of 2019-ncov and sars-cov are very conserved and the corresponding residues show a high sequence similarity of 833 figures 1b and c  among them those hydrophobic residues that are important for proteinprotein interactions are especially conserved for the rbd of 2019-ncov there are 13 hydrophobic residues at the binding site which are comparable to 13 hydrophobic residues for that of sars-cov  figure 1b  we have run a long-time md simulation to generate the trajectories of the rbd-ace2 complex system for 2019-ncov and sars-cov the binding free energies were calculated using the mm-gbsa model by the mmpbsapy script in the amber package table 1 shows a comparison of the rbd-ace2 binding free energies for 2019-ncov and sars-cov it can be seen from the table that the binding free energy of the rbd-ace2 interaction for 2019-ncov is 5043 kcalmol which is significantly lower than the binding free energy of the rbd-ace2 interaction for sars-cov 3675 kcalmol in other words 2019-ncov binds human ace2 with a significantly higher affinity than sars-cov this result is consistent with the current fact that 2019-cov is much more infectious than sars-cov very recently experimental studies also showed that 2019-cov could bind human ace2 with a higher affinity than sars-cov 22  further examination of the binding free energy contributions reveals that the higher binding affinity of 2019-ncov than sars-cov is mostly attributed to the solvation energy contribution g solv 67497 vs 69656 kcalmol whereas 2019-ncov has a higher binding free energy in vacuum g gas than sars-cov -72541 vs -73331 in other words 2019-ncov tends to bind human ace2 better than sars-cov in the water while sars-cov would bind to human ace2 better than 2019-ncov in the gas further investigation is needed to confirm such binding differences the spike protein on the coronavirus envelope is a trimeric protein this protein is critical for the vitality of coronaviruses because it is not only an important component for the virus particle but also plays a crucial role in attaching host cells and fusing the membranes 21  in addition the spike protein also determines the solubility of coronavirus particles and thus the viral infectivity because the spike protein is the largest protein located on the membrane surface therefore the spike protein is directly related to the stability and functionality of coronaviuses here we have run a lengthy md simulation to study the trimeric spike proteins of 2019-ncov and sars-cov table 2 gives a comparison between the free energies of the spike proteins for 2019-ncov and sars-cov it can be seen from the table that the spike protein of 2019-ncov has a significantly lower total free energy g total  6730328 kcalmol than the spike protein of sars-cov g total  6313996 kcalmol  table 2  these results suggest that 2019-ncov is more stable and can survive a significantly higher temperature than sars-cov this may also partly explain the higher infectivity of 2019-ncov than sars-cov because 2019-ncov would have a higher virus vitality than sars-cov in the same temperature the lower free energy of the 2019-ncov spike protein may result from the virus evolution of sars-cov because sars-like coronaviruses normally originate from bats that are known to have a higher body temperature than humans in other words 2019-ncov and other sars-like coronavirus would have evolved to achieve a lower free energy for their spike proteins by recombination or mutations so that they can survive in high-temperature animals like bats 1  in addition the free energy decomposition also shows that the lower free energy of 2019-ncov spike protein than sars- table 2  this may reflect an evolution trend for sars-like coronaviruses ie favoring the internal interactions between residues instead of the solvation energy this kind of evolution would be also beneficial because such kinds of coronaviruses would be more robust and able to survive in both the air and solvent coronaviruses uses the spike protein to attach host cells by binding the host cell receptor therefore the receptor binding domain rbd of the spike protein is critical for coronaviruses to infect host cells here we have run lengthy md simulations to investigate the structural properties of the rbd proteins for 2019-ncov and sars-cov table 3 shows a comparison between the free energies of the rbd proteins for 2019-ncov and sars-cov similar to the findings in the spike protein as detailed in the last section table 2  the rbd protein of 2019-ncov also shows a significantly lower free energy than that of sars-cov -409004 vs -361773 kcalmol table 3  which may also be understood by the evolution pressure from the high-temperature host environment however unlike in the spike protein where the free energy difference between 2019-ncov and sars-cov is mostly attributed the inter-residue interactions in vacuum g gas  here in the rbd protein the free energy difference between 2019-ncov and sars-cov comes from both the free energy in vacuum g gas -210437 vs -170366 kcalmol and solvation energy g solv -198568 vs -1914 07 kcalmol  table 3  the lower solvation energy of 2019-ncov than sars-cov in the rbd may be understood because the rbd must move up away from the spike protein and into the water in order to bind human ace2 20  in other words 2019-ncov would have evolved to be more soluble so that it can move up and bind the ace2 more easily the better solubility of the rbd of 2019-ncov than sars-cov may also contribute to part of the higher infectivity of 2019-ncov than sars-cov protein flexibility is a critical factor in binding as it may not only change the binding interface between two proteins but also be an important contribution to the entropy penalty upon binding figure 2a  that means that 2019-ncov must overcome much more entropy penalty than sars-cov when binding to human ace2 as we know the binding free energy between two proteins can be expressed as g  e  t s where e is the interaction energy s is the entropy and t is the temperature of the system as s is negative the binding free energy will become higher and the binding will become weaker with the increasing temperature therefore the rbd-ace2 binding affinity for 2019-ncov is expected to decrease much faster than that for sars-cov when the temperature increases in other words 2019-ncov is much more temperaturesensitive than sars-cov namely 2019-ncov will decrease its infection ability much faster than sars-cov when the temperature rises therefore it is expected that 2019-ncov will become less infectious compared to sars-cov and the disease prevention and control for 2019-ncov will get easier when the weather gets warmerhotter although the drug and vaccine development targeting the rbd protein will be more challenging because of the protein flexibility at the binding site in this study we have extensively studied the rbd-ace2 complex spike protein and free rbd protein systems of 2019-ncov and sars-cov through protein-protein docking and md simulations it was found that 2019-ncov has a higher binding affinity with human ace2 than sars-cov explaining the fact that 2019-cov is much more infectious than sars-cov the spike protein of 2019-ncov also shows a lower free energy than that of sars-cov suggesting that 2019-ncov is more stable and may be able to survive a higher temperature than sars-cov this may also explain the bat origin of 2019-ncov as bats have a higher body-temperature than humans in addition the rbd of 2019-ncov exhibits a significantly higher flexibility than that of sars-cov especially near the binding site that indicates that 2019-ncov must overcome a higher entropy penalty in order to bind ace2 and is thus more temperature-sensitive than sars-cov therefore with the rising temperature 2019-ncov is expected to decrease the infection ability much faster and become much less infectious than sars-cov which would make the disease prevention and control of 2019-ncov easier taking the above results together unlike sars-cov that is gone after 2003 2019-ncov might survive the high-temperature environment like summer in which the virus is not activeinfectious due to the high flexibility in the rbd and then become infectious when the temperature is low in the winter these findings will have a far-reaching implication for disease prevention and control as well as drug and vaccine development for 2019-ncov   structural and simulation analysis of hotspot residues interactions of sars-cov 2 with human ace2 receptor ganesh veeramachaneni kumar v thunuguntla b janakiram bobbillapati jayakumar bondili singh   the emergence of highly pathogenic novel coronavirus in 2019 sars-cov 2 became pandemic and posed a global health emergency the coronaviridae family viruses are mostly hosted by

not able to neutralize ncovid-19 symptoms lan et al 2020 this signifies the structural differences of the ncov from cov the recently published crystal structure pdb id 6m0j elucidates the structural interactions of spike protein rbd of ncov considering that there are extended mutations present in the ncov sequence which comes under rbd sinha et al 2020 it has been shown that more ace2 interacting residues were present in the ncov spike protein rbd than cov lan et al 2020 pant et al 2020 it is important to understand the hot spot amino acids and their interactions and how far these interactions are stable allowing the membrane perfusion of virus into the host cell the current in silico study focuses on highlighting the ace2 and spike protein rbd amino acid interactions the strength of the hot spot amino acid interactions were studied through molecular dynamic simulations for a period of 100 ns the deviations and fluctuations made by the ace2-rbd complex along with energies clarify in understanding the stability of the ncov spike protein rbd interaction with ace2 receptor in comparison to sars-cov the mapping of s protein rbd sequences of both cov and ncov was performed using the multiple sequence viewer tool of the prime application of schrodinger suite the crystal structures were retrieved from protein databank and prepared using protein preparation wizard tool the parameters used in refining the structure are addition of hydrogens creating disulphide bonds maintaining zero order bonds and selenomethionines to methionines conversion in the import and process tab further in refine tab optimizing the hydrogen bonds to repair and finally minimized the structure through force field opls2005 using superimposition tool of the maestro both complexes cov and ncov-ace2 and individual s-protein rbd of both cov and ncov were structurally superimposed and their rmsd root mean square deviations was calculated jorgensen et al 1996 sastry et al 2013 veeramachaneni et al 2015 veeramachaneni et al 2015 molecular dynamic simulations mds of the complexes were performed using desmond software initially the complex was imported into the system builder

number of particles n pressure p and temperature t 300 k temperature 1 bar pressure simulation run time was set to 100 ns islam et al 2020 and relaxed using the default relation protocol guo et al 2010 veeramachaneni et al 2019 protein binding analysis was performed using the protein interaction analysis application of the schrodinger suite spike protein s-protein sequence of sars-cov cov and sars-cov 2 ncov were retrieved from the uniprot databank with sequence ids p59594 and p0dtc2 respectively the multiple sequence alignment was performed using clustal omega web server of embl-ebi services the alignment results displayed 759 identity figure 1 between the sequences previous studies aydin et al 2014 reported the receptor binding domain rbd of the cov spike protein ranging from 306 to 527 and in specific the residues 424494 related to binding motif played a crucial role in binding to the human ace2 receptor for viral admittance in ncov these residues were aligned at 319541 and 437508 positions respectively the spike protein rbd of cov and ncov shared only 74 identity the alignment displayed 26 mutations and 58 residues were found mutated in the spike protein rbd region of ncov among these 34 mutations related to the binding motif were predicted as the crucial amino acids based on the correlation analysis done with the spike protein binding motif of cov considering this binding region as a major criterion the cov and ncov receptor binding domains were further analyzed for any structural changes resulting out of these mutations to continue the structural analysis of the receptor binding regions reported pdb structures of sars-cov pdb id 3sci and sars-ncov pdb id 6m0j were retrieved from the protein databank the f-chain in both the sequences relates to the spike protein rbd of the virus and the a-chain represents ace2 receptor prior to the analysis rbd sequences retrieved pdb were cross validated against their corresponding full length uniprot sequences many structural modifications were observed in the ncov rbd of spike protein because of the mutations occurred during the course of time compared to the cov the overview of the mutational changes in the secondary structure of both cov and ncov spike protein receptor binding region were aligned in figure 2a in cov the majority of the spike protein rbd 3d structure was made of loops with 2 helices and 5 sheets while the 3d structure of ncov spike protein rbd comprised of 4 helices and 10 sheets with interconnecting loops figure 2b lan et al 2020 the detailed information regarding the residues involved in the helices and sheets of both the proteins were tabulated table 1 the major structural changes recorded were seen in the residues ranging from 306 to 382 of cov which were in the loop region while the corresponding residues of ncov ie 333395 were framed into two helices and three sheets the helix observed in the cov protein 426429 was absent in the corresponding ncov 439442 residues and these residues were sited in loop region extra sheets in ncov protein between tyr 473-gln 474 cys 488-tyr 489 and val 524-cys 525 were absent in cov and these residues were shaped into loops the complex of the ace2 receptor with rbd of the cov and ncov spike protein crystal structures were retrieved and prepared using the protein preparation wizard application of the schrodinger suite through a series of steps as explained in the methodology part the prepared complexes were subjected to protein interaction analysis application available in the suite to investigate the interactions occurring between the receptor and spike protein rbd the superimposition of cov and ncov without ace2 receptor resulted in 737  rmsd figure 2c and in complex with ace2 receptor the superimposed complexes were displaying 1524  deviations rmsd figure 3a the cov rbd-ace2 complex was maintained with 7 hydrogen bonds 1 pi-pi interaction and 1 salt bridge figure 3b concurrently the ncov spike protein rbd-ace2 receptor complex displayed 11 hydrogen bonds and 1 salt bridge figure 3c interactions like hydrogen bond pi-pi stacking and salt bridge made by the cov and ncov spike protein with ace2 receptor were reported along with their closest residues distance and also the solvent accessible surface area sasa table 2 in both the complexes residues 473487 436449 and 473487 of virus rbd maintained hydrogen bond interaction profiles with the residues 24 38 and 83 of the ace2 receptor respectively primemmgbsa based binding-free energy was calculated by considering ncov and cov as ligands against the ace2 receptor the binding-free energies calculated were 1265 kcalmol for ncov and 1002 kcalmol with cov comparing the two complexes binding interaction profiles ncov was found binding more rigidly to the ace2 receptor than cov with more number of h bonds and the binding free energy calculations were also found inline supporting the interaction analysis results confirming ncov binding with more stringency to the human ace2 receptor when compared to cov using the trajectories of the complex the deviations made by the two spike proteins were reported individually the deviations made by the ace2 receptor and spike protein rbd of cov complex 3sci were displayed in the figure 4a in the initial simulation period until 30 ns the ace2 receptor deviations were found in the inclined state and thereafter the protein maintained stable deviations till the end of the simulation run time 100 ns the deviation range was between 20 and 40  while majority of the deviations were around 35  the spike protein rbd inclined deviations were observed throughout the simulation run time and the deviations were in the range of 3050  in the ace2 - ncov spike protein rbd complex 6m0j the ace2 receptor made deviations between 25 and 35  and majority of the deviations were maintained around 30  from 20 ns of simulation run time steady state in the deviations with small fluxes were observed till the end of 100 ns figure 4b based on the acceptable deviation range ie 23  the deviations made by the ace2 receptor reflects the stability of the receptor in the complex form the deviations made by the ncov spike protein rbd were low raging between 20 and 30  only the stability in the deviations was attained from the 40 ns run time and maintained the pace till the end of the simulation run comparing the two complexes based on the rmsd results the ace2-ncov was found more stable compared to the ace2-cov complex the spike protein rbd of cov and ncov deviations difference was 2025  which is higher when compared to the ace2 receptor with a change of around 051  only the receptor made deviations were almost similar in both the complexes while the difference in the deviations made by cov and ncov spike protein rbd could be attributed to mutations and structural changes fluctuations made by the ace2 receptor and cov spike protein rbd were depicted in the figure 4c the range of the ace2 receptor residues fluctuation with cov was between 05 and 30  while the majority of the residues fluctuated between 1 and 2 interestingly the residues of the ace2 receptor in complex with ncov spike protein rbd also produced a similar type of fluctuation range ie 0530  figure 4d cov spike protein rbd showed fluctuations ranging 054  with average fluctuations around 20  while ncov spike protein rbd fluctuations were reported between 05 and 28  and the majority of the residues fluctuated around 15  the tail end residue fluctuations were also observed as expected in conclusion considering all the fluctuations made by the spike protein rbd in both the complexes the ncov residues fluctuations range was low leading to more stability and rigidity of the complex using the trajectories and simulation event analysis the number of hydrogen bonds formed between the complexes during the simulation runs was calculated in ace2-cov spike protein rbd complex pdb 3sci the hydrogen bond range was 111 and mean value average number of hydrogen bonds was 5 figure 5a similarly in ace2-ncov spike protein rbd complex pdb 6m0j the range was 519 and the mean value was 11 figure 5b using the simulation quality analysis tool the total and potential energies of the two complexes were calculated the cov complex reported with 23630988 and 28831827 kcalmol of total and potential energy whereas ncov showed 25976980 and 31673074 kcalmol respectively figure 5c d these values state that the ncov complex was more stable compared to the cov complex justifying the increase in the average number of hydrogen bond the main aim of this interaction profile study was to elucidate the residues hotspots in both the receptor and s-protein and their interactions using the trajectory file at every 10 ns of simulation run time interval poses were considered for the binding analysis study a total of 10 frames were retrieved and the residues which were involved in hydrogen bond formation in both ace2 receptor and spike protein rbd of ncov were identified table 3 during the simulation run some residues which were involved in the hydrogen bonding in the initial time intervals failed to continue the same bond in the succeeding intervals and were later found again retaining their interactions by the end of the simulation simultaneously some of the residues which failed to produce hydrogen bond in the initial time frames were later found establishing and continuing with the established hydrogen bond by the end of the simulation run based on the results 18 amino acids of ncov spike protein and 15 residues of the ace2 receptor were identified showing stable hydrogen bond formation table 4 the hydrogen bonds were characterized into strong 2225  moderate 2532  and weak 3240  based on the distance between the donor and acceptor jeffrey  jeffrey 1997 khan jha et al 2020 based on this majority of the reported hydrogen bonds between ace2 receptor residues with ncov spike protein rbd were under moderate category the interaction percentage 100 correlating to the hydrogen bond sustainability in all the selected 10 frames of the ace2 receptor residues with ncov spike protein rbd were glu 35 100 which preserved hydrogen bond interaction in all selected frames tyr 83 and asp 38 90 three residues lys 31 glu 37 and his 34 80 followed by lys 353 and asp 30 70 gln 24 and gln 42 50 and the remaining other five residues reported below 50 hydrogen bond sustainability table 5 the corresponding ncov amino acid residues involved in the hydrogen bonding with the receptor during the simulation studies were also identified table 6 residue gln 493 showed 100 hydrogen bonding throughout the simulation other residues hydrogen bond interaction percentage were gln 498 90 asn 487 tyr 505 and lys 417 80 followed by tyr 489 asn 501 and tyr 45360 and ala 47550 apart from these the remaining other nine residues reported below 50 hydrogen bonding interaction percentage during simulations some hydrogen bonds between ncov s-protein rbd and ace2 receptor residues were intact throughout the run time while certain residues showed shift in the hydrogen bonds interestingly top listed residue gln 493 of ncov s-protein and glu 35 of receptor were maintained hydrogen throughout the simulation in addition gln 493 also maintained another hydrogen bond with lys 3170 of the receptor and hence based on these observations gln 493 was reported as the crucial residue in ncov binding residue gln 498 was seen maintaining an overall 90 hydrogen bond interaction shared with asp 38 70 and in some intervals shifted to lys 358 20 third residue in the ncov s-protein rbd was asn 487 which maintained its 90 of interaction profile with tyr 83 simultaneously a shift in the h bond was also found among the residues like lys 31 of receptor forming hydrogen bonds with phe 490 leu 492 and glu 484 of the s-protein during the entire simulation period these changes could be attributed to the flexibility nature of both receptor and s-protein during the course of the simulations run cov s-protein rbd residues 436 473 475 479 481 482 486 487 488 and 491 were previously reported as hotspots in several studies han et al 2006 wan et al 2020 in the present study comparing the hotspots of cov and ncov it can be stated that most of the hotspots of cov were replicated in ncov too among them two residues asn 479thr 487 of cov were found mutated to gln 493asn 501 in ncov these mutated animo acid residues were found having h bond interactions gln493 100 and asn 50160 during the simulations and profoundly influenced the binding to s-protein rbd to ace2 receptor the important hot spots identified in ace2 receptor and ncov s-protein rbd after simulation studies were displayed in the figure 6 along with the hydrogen interactions hydrophobic interactions between the ncov s-protein rbd and ace2 receptor were also analyzed in the time frames defined tina et al 2007 based on the analysis leu 79 met 82 tyr 83 phe 28of ace2 receptor and phe 486 tyr 489 of ncov s protein rbd were found involved in the hydrophobic interactions in conclusion this study reports the hotspot amino acid residues involved in the binding of the ncov spike protein rbd with human ace2 receptor overall the mutations identified in ncov spike protein receptor binding domain had led to structural changes with additional sheets and helices in the rbd structure facilitating more h bond interactions between the ace2 receptor and spike protein the hotspot residues interactions were listed and the rmsd and rmsf of the 100 ns simulation run confirms the stability and rigidity of the interactions the energy calculations reiterate the binding efficiency of the ncov in comparison to cov further considering these hotspot amino acid residues blockers could be designed for inhibiting the binding of ncov spike protein rbd to human ace2 receptor and thereby stopping the entry of the virus into the host cells  genetic variants in tmprss2 and structure of sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein and tmprss2 complex

tmprss2 in complex with spike glycoprotein we also report the structures of protease inhibitors in complex with tmprss2 which could hamper the interaction with spike protein these findings advance our understanding on the role of tmprss2 and in the development of potential therapeutics  the pandemic covid-19 caused by a highly transmittable pathogen sars-cov-2 has infected millions of people worldwide 1 2  to date it has infected more than 38 million people resulting in 265000 deaths with varied incidence and mortality rates across the globe 5  the usa and european countries recorded a large number of infections associated with higher mortality compared to asian countries these variations could be due to differences in the virulence pathogenicity of viral strains and host factors including genetic makeup sars-cov-2 use spike glycoprotein for host cells adhesion the n-terminal s1subunit interact with receptor ace2 it is also known that sars-cov-2 s-protein gets activated through host proteases 7 8  evidences have also shown that corona viruses s proteins are cleaved by host cell proteases such as furin at s1s2 cleavage site exposing s2 to serine protease tmprss2 to activate fusion of membranes for viral entry 7 12  however lack of structural and molecular studies concerning tmprss2 interaction with s-protein limits our understanding of key priming action of tmprss2 for the host cell entry of the s-protein which has great therapeutic implications here with the aid of whole exome sequencing we discover and report the functionally relevant variants in ace2 and tmprss2 in human genome that contribute to differences in covid-19 infection rates by employing structural mutation studies molecular dynamics we show this variant v160m decreased stability with a plausible role in viral entry furthermore for the first time we demonstrate the structural interactions between tmprss2 and s2 subunit of sars-cov-2 spike protein we also report the structural

the residues occupied ramachandran favored positions using coot wwwmrc-imbcamuk the final model of complex structure of activated sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein homotrimer and tmprss2 was visualized in pymol tmprss2 and potent protease inhibitors chemostat upmoastat nafamostat and bromhexine hydrochloride were docked and simulated individually for molecular docking and dynamics studies both protein

ttps type ii transmembrane serine proteases  based on available literature addressing the serine protease target sites we mapped two potential tmprss2 binding sites in s-protein t1 aa837 to aa 845 and t2 aa 976 to aa986 located in the s2 domain region fig 3  the structure of s-proteins with s1 and s2 domains are shown in fig 3b   the tmprss2 variant rs12329760 and the current epidemiological reports showing lower sars-cov-2 infection rate in the indian ethnic background raises an intriguing question about its correlation with the infection valine 160 in the wild-type protein v160 is located in the n-terminal srcs domain scavenger receptor cysteine rich and is paired with the three antiparallel -sheets aa145-aa170 structurally the replacement of v160m does not accommodate the met due to the topology and charge limit fig 4a  we performed molecular dynamics and simulation studies to know mutant protein characteristics and found undergone structural deformation due to the complete shift in the motif fig4c  this is corroborated with the overall increase in the b-factor stability factor of tmprss2 with v160m mutation fig   4 e f  these observations reiterate that the v160m variant of tmprss2 decreases the stability of the protein  we have observed tmprss2 potentially interacting with the t1 and t2 sites of the s2 domain of spike glycoprotein the overall complex structure shows that tmprss2 binds to t1 site of sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein homo-trimer and adopts typical protease binding mode and interacts with a higher affinity -250 kcal this suggests a bonafide and tight interaction of tmprss2 protease with the spike glycoprotein the active or catalytic pocket of tmprss2 is made of residues q276 h296 e299 k300 p301 k340 k342 e389 k390 l419 s441 q438 and w461 and the residues h296 s441 k432 and q438 are highly conserved among several serine proteases the tmprss2 catalytic pocket of a cup-like architecture accommodates and interacts with the linker region connecting 12 and 34 of s2 domain of the spike protein fig 5a  5b with respect to tmprss2 interaction with t2 site of activated s2 domain of sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein the extended and well-exposed loop region g832 to n856 adopts the peptide binding mode with the tmprss2 the entire s-shape loop region of t2 site k835 to i850 of s2 domain pass into the canyon-like crevice or cuplike structure of tmprss2 catalytic pocket fig 5d  among them residues k835 y837 d839 c840 l841 d843 i844 r847 r848 are the key interacting residues and also well positioned towards the catalytic pocket of the tmprss2 fig 5 e   to explore the specificity and validate the precision of the catalytic pocket we performed molecular docking refinement and dynamic studies with four potential tmprss2 protease inhibitors chemostat upamostat nafmostat and bromhexine hydrochloride fig 6 a-f  as expected we observed the specific binding location of all drugs directed to the catalytic pocket of tmprss2 the main drug binding region is structurally linked with the binding of t1 and t2 sites of the s2 domain of spike glycol proteins with binding energy of -9 kcal  we identified a missense variant rs12329760 in tmprss2 gene that is shown to confer decreased stability of the protein from the homology model of tmprss2 and its mutant v160m we have identified its interaction sites with sars-cov-2 s-protein for the first time binding of clinically proven protease inhibitors with precision and specificity at these interaction sites suggest that this site can be targeted for developing newer drugs in the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection and till then these drugs can be tested on patients therapeutically in current covid clinics it is intriguing to note that although the viral strain emerged from china and spread to various regions of the world significant differences in the incidence and mortality rates cannot be we have also identified the interactions of tmprss2 with spike glycoprotein using the above model in complex with the validated model structure of full-length sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein 19 as the available structures with pdb lack furin and tmprss2 recognition and cleavage sites 11  based on available literature on the target sites of other serine proteases 20 21 along with sequence analysis we identified two prime tmprss2 recognition sites in the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein the two identified sites span a part of heptad region1 hr1 of six helix bundle of sars-cov-2 near the fusion peptide recently it is reported that heptad regions hr1 and hr2 aid in bringing the fusion peptide in close proximity to transmembrane domain facilitating membrane fusion 22 23 24  it is convincing to speculate that furin protease acts first on the spike glycoprotein at s1s2 region and cleaves the spike protein to s1 ace2 and cd26 binding region and s2 trimerization domain resulting in the complete exposure of s2 domain and tmprss2 recognition sites as elucidated earlier 12  25  while this model fits well for the normal genotype of tmprss2 whether genetic variant in tmprss2 protease has any physiological role in sars-cov-2 infection or activation of spike glycoprotein is elusive insilico studies suggested decreased stability of the protein in variant as the free energy change is less than -05 k calmol and is present in an important domain of the protein 15 26  molecular dynamics simulation confirm structural distortions due to complete shift in the motif leading to changes in quaternary structure of the protein and concomitant increase in b factor with v160m variant this reiterates the fact that although the v160m is not located in the catalytic pocket of tmprss2 decrease in the stability of the protein might hamper sars-cov-2 viral entry however this needs to be confirmed in order to assess the binding efficiency of tmprss2 with identified cleavage sites on s2 subunit of spike protein we tested the clinically proven protease inhibitors camostat nafamostat upamostat and bromhexine hydrochloride bhh camostat used therapeutically for unrelated clinical conditions was shown to inhibit influenza viral replication 2728 while nafamostat is a potent inhibitor of mers s-protein mediated membrane fusion 29  bhh on the other hand is fda approved mucolytic agent and a specific inhibitor of tmprss2 30 31  upamostat is another serine protease inhibitor under consideration for clinical trials 32  all four drugs bind to the active site of tmprss2 with high precision and specificity  fig 5 and supplementary fig s5  we demonstrate that camostat upamostat and bhh preferentially bind to a specific location at the catalytic pocket of tmprss2 while nafamostat binds to 3 additional binding residues in two modesfurthermore these potential tmprss2 inhibitors also share their interaction via several polar charged and hydrophobic interactions  supplementary fig s5  the specific binding of these drugs with high precision confirms that they could potentially bind and impede the interaction between the spike glycoprotein and tmprss2 this study identified the interaction sites of the drugs with tmprss2 and therefore this conserved epitope can be targeted for developing vaccines and therapeutic drugs based on these findings we propose a model of interaction of tmprss2 with s2 subunit of spike protein of sars-cov-2 fig 8  limitation of this study is that we have not shown the association of v160m variant with infectivity in covid-19 patients and instability of the protein is shown by in silico approaches further studies are needed in covid-19 patients to explore the association and functional assays to gain mechanical insights on the role of the variant as in other human diseases the incidence severity progression and therapeutic response have a genetic predisposition susceptibility to covid-19 may also have a predisposition although age sex and comorbidities are shown to associate with varied incidence and severity of the disease host genetic predisposition has not been explored this study reports for the first time host factor genetics molecular structure of tmprss2 and its cleavage sites on s2 subunit of spike glycoprotein it is interesting to note that a significant proportion are variant carriers in india with lesser incidence of covid-19 as compared to other ethnicities including usa and european countries that have a lower variant carriers with higher incidence while we report the importance of host genetic factors for the first time covid-19 host genetics initiative httpswwwcovid19hgorg reiterate the need to study the role of human genome in explaining covid-19 severity and susceptibility  binding ability prediction between spike protein and human ace2 reveals the adaptive strategy of sars-cov-2 in humans xia xue jianxiang shi hongen xu yaping qin zengguang yang shuaisheng feng danhua liu liguo jian linlin hua yaohe wang qi zhang xueyong huang xiaoju zhang xinxin li chunguang chen jiancheng guo wenxue tang jianbo liu  sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is a novel coronavirus causing an outbreak of covid-19 globally in the past six months a relatively higher divergence on the spike protein of sasr-cov-2 enables it to transmit across species efficiently we particularly believe that the adaptive mutations of the receptor-binding domain rbd of spike protein in sars-cov-2 might be essential to its high transmissibility among humans thus here we collected 2142 highquality genome sequences of sars-cov-2 from 160 regions in over 50 countries and reconstructed their phylogeny and also analyzed the interaction between the polymorphisms of spike protein and human ace2 hace2 phylogenetic analysis of sars-cov-2 and coronavirus in other hosts show sars-cov-2 is highly possible originated from bat-cov ratg13 found in horseshoe bat and a recombination event may occur on the spike protein of pangolin-cov to imbue it the ability to infect humans moreover compared to the s gene of sars-cov-2 it is more conserved in the directbinding sites of rbd and we noticed that spike protein of sars-cov-2 may under a consensus evolution to adapt to human hosts better 3860 amino acid mutations in spike protein rbd t333-c525 of sars-cov-2 were simulated and their stability and affinity binding to hace2 s19-d615 were calculated our analysis indicates sars-cov-2 could infect humans from different populations with no preference and a higher divergence in the spike protein of sars-cov-2 at the early stage of this pandemic may be a good indicator that could show the pathway of sars-cov-2 transmitting from the natural reservoir to human beings  coronavirus is commonly found in nature and infects only mammals and birds 1-3  among 46 species only seven of them are human-susceptible 4 5  aside from sars-cov and mers-cov that cause deadly pneumonia in humans by crossing the species barrier 367  sars-cov-2 is now bringing a global pandemic of respiratory disease within six months after the first case has been confirmed in wuhan city of china 8  it has been identified as a novel coronavirus that is a member of -coronavirus in the family coronaviridae which is a positive single-stranded rna virus with a protein envelope 2  up to date covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 results in more than six million people infected and over 380 thousand deaths worldwide compared with sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 spreads more rapidly and being highly infectious to humans 8 9 10  it is crucial to understand the origin of this coronavirus and its strategy in adapting to human hosts so efficiently moreover to apply this knowledge for controlling this pandemic and developing effective therapeutics and vaccines against covid-19 by reconstructing phylogenomic relationships among various coronavirus 11  it showed around 70 genome sequence similarity with sars-cov 11  and more closely related to bat coronavirus ratg13 in the spike s gene 1  given closely related to sars-like coronaviruses the genome structure of sars-cov-2 is similar to other beta-coronaviruses which composed in order with 5replicase orf1ab-s-envelopee-membranem-n-3 with numbers of open reading frames orfs function resembles those of sars-cov 12  it is noted that ratg13 is highly similar to sars-cov-2 especially between genes while they differed in some crucial genomic structures one of the most notable features is that a polybasic furin cleavage site insertion prra residue at the junction between two subunits s1 s2 of s protein 1 2 12 13  although some studies show bats could be the reservoir host for many coronaviruses including sars-cov the reservoir host of sars-cov-2 remains unclear 4 10 14  given the global spread of this epidemic it draws a lot of attention to reveal the origins of the pandemic event the evolutionary of sars-cov-2 may explain its infectiousness and transmissibility among different animal hosts and provide evidence about whether this virus is natural or artificial spike glycoprotein on the surface of sars-cov-2 is the key to enter the target cells which forms homotrimers protruding from the surface to recognize host cell receptor and cause membrane fusion 15  spike protein contains s1 and s2 subunits and the receptor-binding domain rbd exists on s1 which can bind to the peptidase domain pd of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 while s2 is responsible for membrane fusion during viral infection 14 16  in sars-cov rbd in spike protein is the most diverse part of the whole genome of which six amino acid y442 l472 n479 d480 t487 and y4911 have been found to play a key role in binding to ace2 receptor and further in transmissibility across species boundary 16  similar to sars-cov rbd mutations acquired during adaption to different host cells along transmission have also been observed in sars-cov-2 thus dissection of the key mutations in spike protein rbd that affect binding to the ace2 receptor would be important for understanding the molecular mechanism of how sars-cov-2 infect human cells recent studies show the ace2 receptor in host cells would mediate the entry ability of sars-cov-2 by interacting with spike protein and its binding capacity to spike protein of sars-cov-2 determines the transmissibility of this coronavirus across species particularly among humans 14 17  the present study intends to 1 reveal the phylogenetic relationship of sars-cov-2 identified in the different population at the genomic level and provide genetic evidence based on the structural protein-coding genes s m n e for identifying the nucleotide variations of sars-cov-2 collected from different regions amid covid-19 pandemic 2 provide a prediction for revealing the adaptive mutations on spike protein of sars-cov-2 based on the specific variation of s gene and finding the differences of stability of spike protein mutants and their affinities with the human ace2 receptors 3 explore whether there are variants of ace2 in different populations which may affect the infectivity of covid-19 to this end we analyzed the variants of ace2 in a large cohort including 1000 chinese local people and other human populations and identified polymorphisms that may influent on the binding between ace2 and spike protein of coronaviruses furthermore we predicted the affinities of spike protein to binding ace2 variants to understand whether those changes would render individuals resistant or susceptible to sars-cov-2 at the molecular level herein our study could explain part of the origin of sars-cov-2 at a phylogenetic level based both on whole genome and multiple key genes to allow the elucidation of population risk profiles and also help advance therapeutics such as a rationally designed soluble ace2 receptor for the management of covid-19 was carried out by kimura two factor correction method for nucleic acid level calculation to avoid the prediction error caused by the selection of outgroups with a far evolutionary relationship the complex outgroup was adopted in this study and the sequence of mers-cov and sars-cov were selected as outgroups to predict the genetic relationship  the maximum likelihood ml phylogenic trees were constructed based on 2147 genome sequences of sars-cov-2 with sars-cov and mers-cov were selected as the out-groups  figure 1  after alignment we merged identical sequences into one clade with labels kept as one the genomic tree showed all sars-cov-2 was closely related to the sars-like virus found in the horseshoe bat from yunnan ratg13 and a coronavirus from pangolin collected in guangdong province was the sister taxon with ratg13 which is closer to the virus from bat than to other pangolins from guangxi sars-cov-2 is not related closely with sars-cov at the nucleic level australia european countries and usa and the case document showed this patient was confirmed after his seven-day trip to italy and he didnt show any symptoms before his journey some branches were poorly supported by the bootstrap values and exhibited polytomies which indicated sars-cov-2 was adapting the human hosts globally and it is hard to determine the origin of sars-cov-2 solely based on nucleic data furthermore same to the genomic tree multiple genes sequences of sars-cov-2 are divergent from outgroups and we detected some mutations according to s gene sequences comparison  figure 3  as shown in figure 3  we extracted and aligned the s gene sequences from sars coronavirus in different hosts the one from pangolin that closer to sars-cov-2 and ratg13 was from a horseshoe bat rhinolophus spp and we found no big fragment shift in s genes of pangolin and it was less similar to s in sars-cov-2 compared with ratg13 but the insertions exhibited in pangolin indicated potential recombination in spike protein of coronavirus would occur during its cross-species hosts manumission according to s gene sequences in different strains we found the similarity between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-bat 98 is higher than it compared with coronavirus from pangolins 85 it showed more solved of the phylogenetic tree based on s gene fig 4 compared to the trees based on genomic sequences and multiple genes nevertheless the phylogeny reconstructed based on genome s gene and multiple genes all indicate the sars-cov-2 is closely related to ratg13 and the virus isolated from pangolin s gene has been studied as the key gene for sars-cov-2 binding to host cells receptor and this gene shows less conserved compared to the genome sequence of sars-cov-2 and some studies suggest that the high divergence found in spike protein rbd and specifically the direct bonding sites to ace2 receptor play an important role to sars-cov-2 adapting to different animal hosts or the populations in different regions combined with the phylogeny based on the s gene we also detected all mutationson the s gene and their binding capacity with ace2 receptor in human beings 23 point mutations were predicted to significantly influence the affinity and stability of the spike protein fig 5  among which 9 polymorphisms exhibited increased affinity and stability while 14 ones showed decreased affinity and stability table 1  all analysis outcomes of over 3000 polymorphisms in spike protein were shown in supplementary table 1 figure 5 and table 1 showed the missense mutation in spike protein rbd that has significant changes cutoff 3 of the affinity and stability with ace2 receptors interestingly residues l455 q498 and n501 would have two potential mutations that leading to contrary affinities including increased affinity in leucine changed to methionine on aa455 glutaurine changed to tryptophan on aa498 and asparagine changed to tyrosine on aa501 reduced affinity in leucine changed to alanine glutamine changed to alanine asparagine changed to glycine the polymorphisms on the same residue causing two opposite effects of affinity suggested that mutations on those positions may lead to different adaptation directions on sars-cov-2 to fit in different hosts furthermore phe456 gln493 and phe486 showed two mutations that both result in affinity reduction the stability of spike protein with different mutations was showed in table 1  we found only 5 mutants increased the stability of spike protein including g446w g496a q498w n501y and g502y which is not consistent with the affinity to match the mutations of spike protein that reported by sars-cov-2 database of china national center for bioinformation httpsbigdbigaccnncov with our predictions a total of 1150 polymorphisms in spike protein were collected from the database and 643 missense variants were selected and run analysis about their affinity and stability binding to ace2 supplementary table   2  we focused on 76 missense variants in region t333-c525 of spike protein and 9 variants bring significant changes on the affinity of it to ace2  figure 6a  moreover 13 variants cause structural stability changes in spike protein rbd  figure 6b  we calculated the population frequency of 388 missense variants in ace2 collected from gnomad supplementary table 3  and the local population  table 2  analysis of their stability and affinity to spike protein of sars-cov-2 were performed in this study and the results showed no significant differences in both affinity and stability revealing the evolutionary origin of sars-cov-2 is of great value to understand its transmission pathway cross-species and provide a guide to long-term infection prevention of zoonotic coronavirus since it is a novel coronavirus the extremely limited morphological information of sars-cov-2 could be used in the phylogenic analysis genomic data of sars-cov-2 nowadays provide a helpful approach to identify its divergence along with the transmission among  to most sars-coronavirus 5 17  and the s gene is more divergent in coronavirus at a genetic level relative to other genes 14  along adapting to the human host cellular environment mutations occur in spike protein in some of which enable to enhance the binding affinity and stability of spike protein-hace2 complex and the enhancement would increase the transmissibility of sars-cov-2 among human and bring more severe disease 16 table 1  23 variants of spike protein rbd that causing significantly higher or lower affinity to ace2 and stability were focused in this study the cutoff we set up was three for determining significance table 1  among 9 of the mutations that highly enhance the binding between spike protein and ace2 the residue g446 figure 7  was also reported cdc up to date combined 1150 variants 634 missense mutations in total in the spike protein of sars-cov-2 reported by cdc we found their affinity and stability in our analysis outcomes among 76 missense variants that locate in the region between t333-c525 five variants in spike protein enhance its affinity binding to hace2 table 3  and only three of them increase the stability of spike-hace2 complex table 4  additionally we collected the genome sequences of sars-cov-2 that harbor those variants in spike protein and found the variants v483a occurs in 26 strains from the usa v367f occurs in 12 strains from hong kong australia and other european countries and a variant g446v that highly enhance the affinity were identified in a strain from australia supplementary table 2  we mapped those strains onto our genomic phylogenetic tree and found they were dispersed distributed in the position close to the sars-bat and sars-pangolin as covid-19 widespread globally several studies tried to find where this novel coronavirus came from but few reports analyze the origin of sars-cov-2 according to the divergent pattern in spike protein in our study the multiple variants in spike protein found in different countries and clustered in the ancestral direction on phylogeny which might suggest sars-cov-2 infection start to occur at multiple sites but not only in wuhan city however due to the limited detection capability and restricted availability of samples from infected animals the variants available in the national database are uncompleted more data needs to be collected for further studies furthermore since the sars-cov-2 strains have variants on spike protein relative to a reference sequence of sars-cov-2 nc0455122 were found more divergence on the phylogenetic position that closer to sars-bat and sars-pangolin it might indicate a consensus evolution occurred in s gene and enable sars-cov-2 to adapt to human hosts well however since it is difficult to determine the exact time the zero patient who got infected by sars-cov-2 the date of the sample collection and data extracted could mislead the results we believe further clinical information from all the countries would be needed for research and this is a global concern that requires more cooperation and collaboration but not political games or constant blames we shared all the analysis of over 3000 variants on spike protein in this study to help the world tracking the mutations of sars-cov-2 and also can be useful to select the potential druggable targets and neutral inhibitors to prevent the further damages may be brought by the pandemic of covid-19 aside from mutations in spike protein for adapting to new hosts the hace2 also represents polymorphisms in the binding region host-virus interaction over time makes a natural selection on both virus and host cells 30  therefore the variants in hace2 receptor would also play a role in sars-cov-2 infection cao and his colleagues 2020 31 researchers found three unique variants in hace2 in the italian population that might be corresponding to the high fatality including p389h w69c and l351v 33  we compared the unique variants found in local and italian population by mapping them on the hace protein structure  figure 8  and found the italian ones were closer to the binding region than local ones but in silico simulation indicated that none of them change the affinity and stability of spike protein of sars-cov-2 and hace2 complex table 2  generally we did not find any variants in ace2 that would significantly increase or decrease the affinity and stability of spike the ml phylogeny tree

treat covid-19 via in silico molecular docking models of the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein and 3cl protease donald hall c hai-feng ji   the world health organization has now declared a global emergency and pandemic for the coronavirus disease covid-19 that has been actively spreading around the globe covid-19 which is caused by the virus sars-cov-2 can cause symptoms such as fever cough pneumonia nausea and fatigue as of now sars-cov-2 has reached 24 countries around the globe with more than 190000 cases confirmed as of march 18 20201 the epidemiological background of the virus was thought to stem from a seafood market in wuhan china 2 however the true epicenter of the initial transfer to humans is still unknown currently there are 100 complete genome sequences known in the ncbi genbank from over 10 countries the variation between these sequences is less than 1 this virus is closely related to the sars-cov and this allows utilization of the known protein structures to quickly build a model for drug discovery on this new sars-cov-2 3 while traditional methods of drug discovery could take years the approach taken here to search for possible medications for the sars-cov-2 is in silico docking models from the most variable proteins in the sars-cov-2 the spike glycoprotein and the sars-cov-2 3cl main protease the cov spike protein binds to a host cell membrane through a receptor-mediated interaction which allows entrance to the host cell it has been computationally determined that the sars-cov-2 has similar mechanism to that of the sars virus and the receptor to which it has the highest affinity is ace2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 4 while there are structural similarities between the sars-cov-2 spike protein and the sars spike protein the conservation is only 73 with most of the variability being in the host cell interaction region of the protein currently there is no crystal structure available for the sars-cov-2 spike protein so we employed homology modeling of the sars-cov-2 utilizing the sars spike protein pdb 2ghv as a template the second in silico docking model is the 3clpro main protease which is responsible for controlling several major functions of the virus and has a highly conserved catalytic domain from the sars virus 5 some of its functions include the replication processes of the virus which makes it an ideal target for drug development 6 the sars-cov-2 main protease was determined by ref 7 pdb 6lu7 both these proteins spike and protease are essential to the transmission and virulence of the virus by inhibiting anyone of these two proteins or both for a higher active therapy the severity of the infection will be reduced our efforts have been placed in competitively inhibiting the binding of its natural substrates a library of known bioactive compounds has been run against several sites on the spike protein and the catalytic site of the sars-cov-2 main protease by utilizing an approved compound database quick trials of these compounds with minimal effort of approval by food and drug agencies could be carried out we have chosen to run the zinc15 database which is classified by zinc15 8 as approved drugs in major jurisdictions including the fda ie drugbank approved this database covers all major bioactive pharmaceutical compounds utilized around the globe and currently has 3447 entries molecular docking calculations were completed using schrodinger docking suits schrdinger maestro new york ny usa version 119011 mmshare version 45011 release 20191 platform windows-x64 using a virtual screening workflow this workflow utilized three docking precisions htvs sp and xp which yielded the top 10 of hits for each binding site both proteins were prepared by restrained minimization using force field opls3e the grid sites were created using glide receptor grid generator with docking length of 20  grids centers were determined from active resides on target protein ligands were prepared using force field opls3e and possible states were generated from ph 7020 docking scores are reported in kcalmol the more negative the number the better binding the surface glycoprotein wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus sequence id yp0097243901 structure was modeled using modbase 9 which utilized modeller 10 for the structural modeling the sequence ncbi accession yp009724390 was uploaded to the modbase interface and was run with the template being sars spike protein receptor binding domain pdb 2ghv chain e the sequence identity was found to be 73 fig 1
a the calculation was completed and imported into schrdinger maestro the structure was then minimized using the force field opls3e the overlay of the pre and post minimized structure can be seen in fig s2 sequencing has revealed that the sars-cov-2 is similar to that of the sars-cov virus which allows for genomic and proteomic homology comparison using the homology modeling we have been able to develop a model of the spike glycoprotein fig 1 this model has allowed us to perform docking calculations utilizing a database of known bioactive and approved compounds the modeller and modbase programs were able to use a homologue sars spike protein pdb 2ghv and the original sars-cov-2 sequence genbank mn908947 and construct the sars-cov-2 spike protein the protein was then run through a restriction minimization process utilizing schrodinger docking suits protein preparation which allows side chains to be placed in the most energetically favorable conformation fig 1b in an effort to stop the spike-ace2 interaction several sites have been determined and targeted on the spike protein for docking studies three of these sites are located at the interaction points specifically where hydrogen bonding is calculated as the main intermolecular force of the spike-ace2 interaction and a fourth allosteric site has been determined by surface mapping of the protein the locations of the binding sites have been chosen as these would cause the most destruction in ace2 interactions the sites are labeled as site 14 and information on the sites can be seen in supplemental table s1 fig s1 the results from the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein are reported in table 1
 structural alignments have revealed that the sars-cov-2 protease is highly conserved for that of the sars pdb 1lvo main protease at 98 id 11 the 3clpro main protease was run through a restriction minimization process utilizing schrodinger docking suits 
fig s3a previous studies have revealed in the sars protease mutation of the residue his162 renders the enzyme inactive the sars-cov-2 homologous residue is his163 site 1 center x  1759 y  1581 z  6353 fig s3b which has been used as the central point for molecular docking calculations the active site also revealed a second histidine center his41 site 2 center x  1381 y  1972 z  7191 fig s3c that seems to play a role in the interactions of the bound ligand in the 6lu7 structure so this was targeted as a second center point for the molecular docking calculations the results from the sars-cov-2 3cl protease are reported in table 2
 molecular docking has been employed for the search of possible medications that are contained in the approved bioactive compound database the hit compounds reported here have potential to inhibit the sars-cov-2 spike protein and the 3clpro main protease but are not guaranteed to have any activity however this lays the groundwork for computational drug discovery for new compounds to reduce transmission and symptoms of sars-cov-2 we have used structural homology modeling to determine a dock-able target for the sars-cov-2 spike protein and have utilized the newly characterized 3clpro main protease in our docking models we have several exciting hits on the 3clpro main proteinase zanamivir is an approved medication for the treatment of influenza a and b viruses 12 indinavir and saquinavir have been shown to treat and prevent hiv remdesivir is an antiviral compound in experimental stages that has shown activity against the sars-coronavirus ebola virus and possibly the sars-cov-2 13 14 15 it is also exciting to uncover that flavin adenine dinucleotide fad adeflavin b2 deficiency medicine and coenzyme a a coenzyme may also be potentially used for the treatment of sars-cov-2 infections

 in this study we examined 137 genomes to establish the relationship between spike glycoproteins from different coronaviruses this was done with a combination of the phylogenetic tree analysis reconstructed from the translated sequences and a comparison of the structural models the phylogenetic study has confirmed close relatedness of sarscov2 to bats coronaviruses in contrast a comparison of the structural models has found yak bos grunniens betacoronavirus as the closest match recently released complete genome sequences were downloaded for the analysis from ncbi listed in table s1 furthermore spike glycoprotein orfs nucleotide and protein sequences were retrieved from ncbi orffinder httpswwwncbinlmnihgovorffinder and conserved domains were checked with cdsearch ncbi respectively complete translated orfs were used for multiple sequence alignments performed using muscle the tests of substitution models and phylogenetic analysis were carried out using the mega x software

 the neighborjoining method and jtt substitution models were selected assuming an estimated proportion of invariant sites and 4gammadistributed rate categories to account for rate heterogeneity across sites the gamma shape parameter was estimated directly from the data reliability for the internal branch was assessed using the bootstrapping method 1000 bootstrap replicates two spike glycoproteins from the gammacoronaviruses were used as an outgroup structural models of the spike glycoproteins table s1 marked with  were built using swissmodel

 predicted structures were refined with an online tool 3drefine httpsysbiornetmissouriedu3drefine and verified using qmean httpsswissmodelexpasyorgqmean ipba web server was used for pdb structure alignment httpswwwdsimbinsermfrdsimbtoolsipbaindexphp the quality of the structure alignments was evaluated using root mean square deviation and normalized score chimera software

 was used for structure visualization altogether 137 genomes were analyzed our primary focus was on the severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus 92 genomes released from 2019 till 25 march 2020 ncbi the middle east respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus genomes n  18 further shortened to mers were used to check the reliability of our in silico approaches a set of different coronaviruses taxonomical origin hosts and release date was used in our analyses table s1 four conserved domains were identified spike glycoprotein nterminal domain pfam16451 spike receptorbinding domain pfam09408 coronavirus s1 glycoprotein pfam01600 and coronavirus s2 glycoprotein pfam01601 listed from nterminal to cterminal direction figure s1 surprisingly none of the analyzed genomes exhibited such domain architecture as is known for example for the viruses studied earlier top line in figures s1 and s2 as a common feature we noticed that alphacoronaviruses and gammacoronaviruses share domain architecture represented by two domains coronavirus s1 glycoprotein along with coronavirus s2 glycoprotein in contrast all analyzed betacoronaviruses have a full or partial spike receptorbinding domain interestingly only betacoronaviruses with humans and yaks as hosts have spike glycoprotein nterminal domain which is absent in all other analyzed hosts to gain insight into the phylogenetic relationships between spike glycoproteins from alphacoronaviruses betacoronaviruses and gammacoronaviruses of different hosts a robust phylogenetic tree after multiple alignments of the 137 extracted sequences figure s3 was generated the tree was rooted in the outgroup gammacoronaviruses as expected all sarscov2 spike glycoproteins with humans as a host were almost identical and formed separate clusters similarly all the mers with humans as a host were nearly identical and clustered together with camels mers isolates from kenya with closely related mers isolates from the egyptian camel two betacoronavirus isolates from bats hku5 and hku4related mn6115201 pipistrellus abramus and mn6115191 tylonycteris pachypus respectively were located between sarscov2 and mers clusters two other branches formed two welldistinguished clusters for alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses isolates alphacoronaviruses have hostdependent subclusters humans and bats in contrast other betacoronaviruses hku1 and oc43 are closely related to the yak isolate furthermore to better understand the relationships between spike glycoproteins on the structural level we built protein models with homologybased server swissmodel
9
 table s1 marked with  obtained models were evaluated and verified table s2 in the next step ipba web server with a local backbone conformation comparison similarity algorithm was used to match human hostdelivered sarscov2 and mers spike glycoproteins to models delivered from other coronaviruses and hosts table 1 mers betacoronavirus was used as a control data set as it is wellstudied in both hosts human and camel and as their close genetic relationship is wellcharacterized
11
 as expected human hostdeliveredmers showed the highest similarity to that from camels sarscov2s spike glycoprotein on the contrary has shown the highest similarity to the yakdelivered betacoronavirus table 1 and figure 1b proper domain classification and identification remain to be a matter of discussion earlier papers refer to the spike glycoprotein as cleaved in the middle and forming s1 and s2 domains further subdividing them into nterminal and cterminal domains in each
12
 based on the current conserved domain database cdd output we concluded that nterminal s1 corresponds to the spike glycoprotein nterminal domain pfam16451 cterminal s1 corresponds to the spike receptorbinding domain pfam09408 and s2 domain contains coronavirus s1 glycoprotein pfam01600 and coronavirus s2 glycoprotein pfam01601 as subdomains figure s1 canonical spike glycoprotein contains four domains each of which plays a specific function it is known that both spike glycoprotein nterminal domain pfam16451 and spike receptorbinding domain pfam09408 participate in specific receptor binding the nterminal domain binds to carcinoembryonic antigenrelated cell adhesion molecule 1 ceacam1 in mouse hepatitis coronavirus and binds sugar in porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus
13
 spike receptorbinding domain binds to the aminopeptidase n or angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 in coronaviruses
14
 an interplay between coronavirus s1 glycoprotein pfam01600 and coronavirus s2 glycoprotein pfam01601 is required for the attachment of spike to susceptible tissues and subsequent fusion
15

 the phylogenetic data reported above show that the new humandelivered sarscov2 spike glycoproteins cluster with two betacoronaviruses hku4 and hku5related delivered from the hosts t pachypus and p abramus respectively also as seen from the phylogenetic tree figure s1 these two sequences deviate from the other bat coronavirus sequences suggesting that these bat coronaviruses are homologous and genetically more similar to humandelivered sarscov2 than to the other bats coronaviruses in general these data support phylogenetic results obtained by previous researches based on a wholegenome b nonstructural proteins ns7b and ns8 c spike glycoprotein and d nucleocapsid protein
16

 for the next experiment based on the alignment and comparison of the structures mers has been set as a control data set due to the wellcharacterized close relationship between human and cameldelivered strains
11
 
17
 in contrast alignment and comparison of the sarscov2 structural models have revealed close relationship to the yak betacoronavirus b grunniens table 1 while batdelivered hku4 and hku5related betacoronaviruses had a lower matching score bovine coronavirus is a worldwide spread zoonotically transmissible infection in domestic and wild ruminants that is known to cause severe diarrhoea in neonatal dysentery in adult and respiratory diseases in animals of all ages and could also infect humans
18
 our conclusion is also wellsupported by a recent report
19
 on the ace2spike glycoprotein complexes which suggests bovidae as one of the potential intermediate hosts interestingly the identified bovine coronavirus strain strain yakhy24ch2017 has unique amino acid variation in the s gene that represents an uncommon adaptive evolution pathway with unknown biological meaning
20

 it should be noted that many bat species have been identified in europe that are natural hosts for many viruses including coronaviruses in particular sarslike
21
 unexplored natural reservoirs of viruses could pose potential threats for public health
22
 this possibility also raises the question of unique transmission channels specific for each region
23

 in conclusion the results of our phylogenetic study support the fact that the infection originated from bats additionally results from the comparison structural models propose an additional intermediate host yak b grunniens that could transmit bat coronavirus to human hosts we also wish to emphasize the importance of further investigations into the evolution of the spike glycoprotein such work could render a positive impact on the current sarscov2 transmission and prevent zoonotic disease outbreaks of this type in the future the authors declare that there are no conflict of

bieniasz d oren rosenburg s kevin leung k james wells a  a serious public health crisis is currently unfolding due to the sars-cov-2 pandemic sars-cov-2 viral entry depends on an interaction between the receptor binding domain of the trimeric viral spike protein spike-rbd and the dimeric human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor while it is clear that strategies to block the spikeace2 interaction are promising as anti-sars-cov-2 therapeutics our current understanding is insufficient for the rational design of maximally effective therapeutic molecules here we investigated the mechanism of spikeace2 interaction by characterizing the binding affinity and kinetics of different multimeric forms of recombinant ace2 and spike-rbd domain we also engineered ace2 into a split nanoluciferase-based reporter system to probe the conformational landscape of spike-rbds in the context of the spike trimer interestingly a dimeric form of ace2 but not monomeric ace2 binds with high affinity to spike and blocks viral entry in pseudotyped virus and live sars-cov-2 virus neutralization assays we show that dimeric ace2 interacts with an rbd on spike with limited intra-spike avidity which nonetheless contributes to the affinity of this interaction additionally we demonstrate that a proportion of spike can simultaneously interact with multiple ace2 dimers indicating that more than one rbd domain in a spike trimer can adopt an ace2accessible up conformation our findings have significant implications on the design strategies of therapeutic molecules that block the spikeace2 interaction the constructs we describe are freely available to the research community as molecular tools to further our understanding of sars-cov-2 biology  in late 2019 a novel pathogenic coronavirus sars-cov-2 entered the human population and has since spread throughout the world the number of people suffering from the associated disease continues to rise increasing the need for effective therapeutic interventions sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 spike proteins are highly homologous 76 sequence identity similar to sars-cov-1 the interaction between the sars-cov-2 spike protein and the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 on human cells is critical for viral entry into host cells gralinski  menachery 2020 tai et al 2020 wu et al 2020  sars-cov-2 spike is an obligate trimer while ace2 presents as a dimer on the cell surface chen liu  guo 2020  several highresolution structures of sars-cov-2 spike receptor binding domain spike-rbd bound to ace2 have been published lan et al 2020 yan et al 2020  however as of this writing structures of sars-cov-2 spike trimer in complex with either the dimeric or monomeric form of ace2 have not been reported resulting in an incomplete understanding of the nature of this interaction structural studies of trimeric sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-1 spike protein demonstrate that each of the spike-rbds as in other coronaviruses can undergo hinge-like movements to transition between up or down conformations the host ace2 receptor can only interact with an rbd in the up conformation whereas the down conformation is inaccessible to ace2 wrapp vlieger et al 2020  the rbds of sars-cov-1 spike can rotate away from the down position by different angles to an up position gui et al 2017  several cryo-em structures report that approximately half of the sars-cov-1 and 2 spike particles are in the three-down closed conformation and half in the one-up open conformation song gui wang  xiang 2018 walls et al 2020  while another cryo-em study on sars-cov-1 spike reported 39 of spike in the two-up conformation and 3 in the three-up conformation kirchdoerfer et al 2018  the different conformations of spike observed by these cryo-em studies may be affected andor limited by the properties of the grid and sample preparation conditions and may also reflect differences between sars-cov-1 and 2 thus it remains unknown how many rbds of sars-cov-2 are accessible within a trimeric spike to bind ace2 under physiological conditions and thus the degree to which intra-spike avidity plays in the interaction of ace2 with sars-cov-2 spike recombinant ace2 and an engineered dimeric ace2-fc fusion have been shown in several studies to neutralize sars-cov-2 virus lei et al 2020 li et al 2020 monteil et al 2020  however it remains unknown whether the dimeric form of ace2 offers any affinity enhancements through avidity compared to a monomer understanding the role and mechanism of intra-spike avidity in binding is important for engineering tight binding antagonists to neutralize virus infection to elucidate the nature of the interaction between dimeric ace2 and trimeric sars-cov-2 spike we performed a thorough characterization of the binding interactions of the different multimeric forms of spike-rbd and ace2  figure 1a  the results reveal that while both the ace2 monomer and ace2-fc dimer can bind the isolated spike-rbd only the ace2-fc dimer can bind tightly to the trimeric spike ectodomain fl-spike interestingly the affinity of the ace2-fc dimer is much higher to the rbd-fc dimer than to fl-spike suggesting that although intramolecular avidity plays a role in both interactions its effect is compromised in the context of fl-spike consistent with this we find that ace2 associates more slowly to fl-spike which indicates that the rbds in fl-spike protein are not readily accessible to ace2 to further probe the conformational landscape of the rbds in fl-spike we engineered ace2-fc as split-nanoluciferase nanoluc reporters we found that a proportion of fl-spike can interact with multiple ace2-fc molecules simultaneously indicating that more than one rbd domain in a spike trimer can adopt an up conformation using pseudotyped and sars-cov-2 virus neutralization assays we further show that ace2-fc dimer is much more potent at neutralizing virus than ace2 monomer these findings extend our biochemical insight into how a spike trimer binds to an ace2 dimer and have important implications for how multimeric therapeutic molecules such as dimeric ace2 or antibody-based biologics can effectively target sars-cov-2 to study the interaction between ace2 and sars-cov-2 spike we constructed a panel of spike and ace2 proteins in various multimeric formats  figure 1a  trimeric sars-cov-2 spike ectodomain aa 1-1213 fl-spike was expressed and purified as described amanat et al 2020  the construct generously provided by the f krammer lab has the furin cleavage site removed a pair of stabilizing mutations and a c-terminal t4 trimerization motif followed by a 6xhis tag added these modifications have been widely used for structural analysis gui et al 2017 kirchdoerfer et al 2018 song et al 2018 walls et al 2020 wrapp wang et al 2020  we designed a dimeric form of the spike receptor binding domain aa 328-533 spike-rbd-fc containing a tev-cleavable fc-fusion molecule with a c-terminal avi tag for biotinylation czajkowsky hu shao  pleass 2012  we also generated a monomeric form of spike-rbd aa 328-533 spike-rbd-monomer with a c-terminal tev-8xhis-avi the human ace2 ectodomain contains a nterminal peptidase domain aa 18-614 and a c-terminal dimerization domain aa 615-740 we designed the monomeric form of ace2 aa 18-614 ace2-monomer with a c-terminal tev-8xhis-avi tag and the dimeric form of ace2 aa 18-614 ace2-fc as a tev-cleavable fcfusion molecule with a c-terminal avi tag czajkowsky et al 2012  all of the ace2 and spike proteins were expressed in bira-er-expressing expi293 cells howarth et al 2008 martinko et al 2018  the fc-fusion molecules were purified by protein a affinity chromatography and the spike-rbdmonomer and fl-spike by ni-nta affinity chromatography figure 1b 1c  however the ace2 monomer did not express but was generated instead by tev release from ace2-fc  figure   1a  1b all these proteins except the ace2 monomer were 95 biotinylated during expression  to understand how oligomerization affects spikeace2 interaction we determined the affinity and binding kinetics of the different spike-rbd and ace2 proteins by bio-layer interferometry bli figure 2  spike-rbd-monomer spike-rbd-fc and fl-spike were immobilized on streptavidin or ni-nta sensors and allowed to bind ace2 monomer or ace2-fc in solution a four-fold avidity effect was observed for the spike-rbd-monomerace2-fc interaction kd  55 nm figure 2d  compared to the spike-rbd-monomerace2-monomer interaction kd  224 nm figure 2a  in contrast the spike-rbd-fcace2-fc interaction kd  10 -12 m figure   3e  showed 1000-fold increase in binding affinity compared to the spike-rbd-fcace2monomer interaction kd 132 nm figure 2b  this dramatic increase in affinity is driven by a massive decrease in the off rate and little change in on rate which indicates a strong intramolecular two-on-two avidity between spike-rbd-fc and ace2-fc we next tested binding of ace2 monomer and ace2-fc to fl-spike to determine the affinity and avidity effect surprisingly we found that the binding interaction between ace2 monomer and fl-spike is very weak and could not be measured accurately  figure 2c  by contrast the ace2-fc interacts with fl-spike with a kd of 59 nm similar to the affinity for the isolated spike-rbd-monomer  figure 2f  this suggests that the presence of two ace2 molecules in close proximity in ace2-fc is essential for a productive interaction with fl-spike and that a single ace2 monomer is not sufficient to bind an rbd on fl-spike however the affinity between fl-spikeace2-fc interaction was substantially less than spike-rbd-fcace2-fc interaction kd  10 -12 m figure 2e  suggesting that the high-avidity two-on-two interaction is compromised in the context of fl-spike this could be due to geometricsteric constraints or the unique conformations of the rbds in the fl-spike context when fl-spike is loaded to a much higher density on the bli sensor load to 20 nm and probed with ace2-fc we see that avidity can be recovered supplementary figure s3a  this indicates that if spike is presented at high density the ace2-fc arms can engage two rbds if neighboring spike trimers are close enough in contrast monomeric ace2 did not bind fl-spike strongly even when fl-spike was loaded until saturation further demonstrating the importance of ace2 dimerization for interacting with fl-spike supplementary figure s3b  interestingly the kon of the fl-spikeace2-fc interaction  figure 2c and 2f is 10-fold lower than the interactions between spike-rbd-monomer or spike-rbd-fc with ace2 or ace2-fc figure 2a  2b 2d and 2e while the koff is also 10-to 20-fold lower the decreased kon suggests that the rbds in fl-spike protein may have to undergo a conformational change for binding to ace2 previous cryo-em studies on sars-cov-2 fl-spike show that approximately half of the particles have the three rbd domains in the down conformation  of conformations between the down and up states and any rbd with an angle lower than 522 from the body of the trimer are inaccessible to ace2 peng et al 2020  our data supports that a significant proportion of the rbds in fl-spike protein are in a closed or partially closed state inaccessible to ace2 and the rbd has to open up to allow binding to ace2 the decreased koff on the other hand suggests that the presence of multiple rbds within the context of a fl-spike could slow down the dissociation of ace2-fc to further investigate the rbd conformational landscape in fl-spike we designed a split-nanoluc system to orthogonally probe the spikeace2 interaction split-nanoluc enzymes in particular nanobit promega have been broadly used to detect protein-protein interactions and to study analyte concentrations dixon et al 2016  the nanobit system is composed of lgbit and smbit smbit is an 11 amino acid peptide which has a low intrinsic affinity to lgbit kd  190 m but when smbit and lgbit are in close proximity the two subunits assemble to form an active luciferase enzyme to interrogate the interaction between ace2 and spike we engineered ace2-fc reporter molecules where smbit or lgbit were fused at the n-or c-termini  figure 3a  all constructs expressed at high yield and purity  figure 3b  3c to functionally validate the split reporter system we immobilized spike-rbd-fc on streptavidin magnetic beads at high-density incubation with 1 nm of ace2-fc-smbit and ace2-fc-lgbit or 1 nm of smbit-ace2-fc and lgbit-ace2-fc with substrate showed dose-dependent luminescence signal consistent with an assembled functional split enzyme reporter and intermolecular proximity figure 3d  3e we found the n-terminal fusion reporter pair showed higher sensitivity compared to the c-terminal fusion reporter pair supplementary figure s4 suggesting that the increased entropy from the flexible linker and fc domain reduces productive luciferase reconstitution we next used these split reporters to interrogate the soluble fl-spike trimer  figure 3f  3g smbitlgbit-ace2-fc followed by the addition of substrate the smbitlgbit-ace2-fc reporters showed dose-dependent increase in luminescence signal with 1-10 nm fl-spike this result suggests that although fl-spike cannot form a high-avidity two-on-two interaction with both arms of ace2-fc at a time there is a proportion of fl-spike proteins with two-up or perhaps even three-up rbds that can simultaneously interact with multiple ace2-fc molecules we cannot resolve if these two-up or three-up conformations are present prior to ace2 binding or appear because ace2 binding induces a conformational change which enables two or more of the rbd domains to engage in the binding to a second ace2-fc domain to translate these studies to cells we compared the ability of ace2 monomer and ace2-fc to neutralize sars-cov-2 pseudotyped virus to infect cells pseudotyped hiv-1 particles carry the wildtype sars-cov-2 spike protein and are capable of delivering a nanoluc luciferase reporter gene to ace2-expressing hek293t cells cells and pseudovirus were pre-incubated with serially diluted ace2-fc or monomeric ace2 and luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates at 48 hours post infection ace2-fc neutralized the sars-cov-2 pseudotyped particles at an ic50  096 gml 475 nm while ace2 monomer did not substantially neutralize at the concentrations we tested up to 48 gml 2375 nm  figure 4a 4b  this stark difference in efficacy between monomeric and dimeric ace2 confirms that ace2 monomer binds poorly to spike we further tested the ability of ace2-fc and ace2 monomer to neutralize sars-cov-2 virus sars-cov-2 live virus was pre-incubated with 100 nm of ace2-fc or ace2 monomer prior to infecting veroe6 cells a monkey kidney epithelial cell line broadly used for studying viral infectivity 16 hours post infection cells were lysed and intercellular viral and host rna was isolated converted to cdna and quantified by qpcr consistent with the pseudotyped virus neutralization results ace2-fc neutralized sars-cov-2 much more potently than ace2 monomer  figure 5a  5b worldwide efforts are currently underway to develop effective and fast-acting clinical interventions to control the spread and mortality of sars-cov-2 while it is clear that the interaction between ace2 and spike-rbd plays a crucial role in viral entry our current understanding is insufficient for the design of maximally effective therapeutic options in this work we systematically interrogated how an ace2 dimer interacts with sars-cov-2 spike trimer to understand the fundamental avidity properties of the spikeace2 interaction the results from the bli experiments split reporter assays and virus neutralization assays provide important insight into the conformational landscape of the rbds in sars-cov-2 spike and are summarized in figure 6a  the decreased kon of ace2-fc suggests the majority of rbds in fl-spike are in an ace2-inaccessible down conformation which requires opening up for binding ace2  figure 6a  the poor binding of monomeric ace2  figure 6b  and strong binding to dimeric ace2-fc  figure 6c  indicate intra-spike avidity and ace2 rebinding plays an important role in promoting this interaction however while we observed a highly productive avidity effect for the spike-rbd-fcace2-fc interaction we did not observe the massive two-on-two avidity for the fl-spikeace2-fc interaction  figure 6d  this weaker interaction could be due to rbd conformations in spike or a sub-optimal geometry of the two proteins for high-avidity binding nonetheless we show that two or more of the rbd domains can be in the up conformation allowing binding of two ace2-fc on one spike trimer  figure 6e  this is evidenced in our bli experiment where once bound to fl-spike the presence of the other rbds slows down the dissociation of ace2-fc  figure 2f in comparison to 2d  this is further shown in the split-nanoluc reporter experiments where ace2 domains from two separate ace2-fc split-reporters can simultaneously bind a spike trimer to generate an active luciferase figure 3  together these results indicate that trimeric sars-cov-2 spike interacts with ace2 with limited but important intra-spike avidity in addition to intra-spike avidity inter-spike avidity could contribute to the improved affinity of ace2-fc especially in the intact virus it is possible that ace2-fc could bridge two spike molecules on the viral surface and bind with increased avidity similar to what we observed in the high-density loading bli experiment supplementary figure 3a  previous structural studies of sars-cov-1 shows the spike proteins are densely distributed lin et al 2004  with 100 spike molecules displayed on a viral particle with a diameter of 100 nm beniac andonov grudeski  booth 2006 neuman et al 2006  using values from these studies we estimate an inter-spike distance of 180  the structure of the native ace2 dimer pdb 6m17 shows that the two ace2 arms 80  apart would not be able to span this predicted inter-spike distance an ace2 monomer fused fc with flexible linker ace2-fc may be sufficient to only bridge two spikes that are 150  apart structural studies of iggs have shown the antigen binding sites in the fab arms on a flexible-hinge region of an fc to be roughly 117-134  apart sosnick et al 1992  this would still fall short of the inter-spike distance however these estimates are based on a rigid membrane where spike proteins are uniformly distributed and also do not account for heterogeneity in spike presentation across viral particles this may not be the case as coronaviruses are an enveloped virus with a fluid lipid membrane that allows for spike protein mobility and clustering and potentially enable inter-spike binding by ace2 dimers or iggs indeed cryo-em images of sars-cov-1 show irregularity and lack of symmetry of spike distribution on the coronavirus envelope beniac et al 2006  as there are no direct reports of inter-spike avidity for dimeric ace2 further experiments are needed to thoroughly examine the spikeace2 interaction on the viral surface while all cryo-em structural studies to date on sars-cov-2 spike have identified only the closed or one-up rbd conformation cao et al 2020 pinto et al 2020 walls et al 2020 wrapp wang et al 2020  our split reporter assay identified a population of spike in two-up or three-up conformation the relative population of these rbd conformers and whether they exist in an ace2-unbound state or emerge only upon ace2 binding remains unknown  figure   6f  previous studies have suggested that ace2 binding could lead to conformational change in sars-cov-1 or 2 spike song et al 2018 yuan et al 2020  molecular dynamic simulation of sars-cov-2 spike bound to ace2 found that there is significant flexibility in the rbd conformation peng et al 2020  and an em study of sars-cov-1 spike reported that the distribution of the rbd conformers was very different in the ace2-bound structure compared to the unbound structure kirchdoerfer et al 2018  in accordance with these studies our results support the model that ace2 binding induces a conformational change in spike and enables two or more rbds to be in the up conformation  figure 6f  this complex and dynamic nature of the spikeace2 interaction is likely to play a key role in the biology of sars-cov-2 infection we anticipate that further characterization of the interaction between sars-cov-2 spike and native ace2 will elucidate the exact nature of this binding furthermore our findings have important ramifications in developing a successful protein therapeutic for covid-19 recombinant ace2 proteins or antibodies which can block the host ace2-viral spike interaction are promising as anti-sars-cov-2 therapeutics the much higher potency of ace2-fc in comparison to ace2 monomer we observed in the live virus neutralization assays suggest that monovalent therapeutics such as ace2 monomers or fab domains will likely be much less effective than multimeric formats such as dimeric ace2 ectodomain monteil et al 2020  ace2-fc lei et al 2020 yan et al 2020 or igg  figure 6g  finally our results highlight the importance of understanding the ace2-spike interaction in the context of the fl-spike trimer we also hope that the spike and ace2 constructs generated here are useful tools to the greater research community to enable better understanding of sars-cov-2 biology we thank members of the wells lab particularly those working on the covid-19 project for their efforts and contributions we also thank dr john pak chan zuckerberg initiative biohub and  the authors declare no competing interests

bruijns c m ernesto rodriguez r li j eveline antonio molinaro alba silipo flaviana lorenzo di dagmar garcia-rivera yury valdes-balbin vicente verez-bencomo yvette van kooyk  the immediate call for translational research in the field of coronavirus disease covid-19 pandemic needs new and unexplored angles to support and contribute to this important worldwide health problem the aim of this study is to better understand the pathogenic mechanisms underlying covid-19 deciphering the carbohydrate-mediated interactions of the sars-cov-2 spike protein we studied the carbohydrate-binding receptors that could be important for viral entry and for immune-modulatory responses and we studied the interactions of the spike protein with the host lung microbiota exploring solid-phase immunoassays we evaluated the interactions between the sars-cov-2 spike protein and a library of 12 different human carbohydrate-binding proteins c-type lectins and siglecs involved in binding triggering and modulation of innate and adaptive immune-responses we revealed a specific binding of the sars-cov-2 spike protein to the receptors dc-sign mgl siglec-9 and siglec-10 that are all expressed on myeloid immune cells in addition because the lung microbiota can promote or modulate viral infection we studied the interactions between the sars-cov-2 spike protein and a library of streptococcus pneumoniae capsular polysaccharides as well as other bacterial glyco-conjugates we show specific binding of the spike protein to different s pneumoniae capsular polysaccharides serotypes 19f and 23f but not to serotype 14 moreover we demonstrated a specific binding of sars-cov-2 spike protein to the lipopolysaccharide from the opportunistic human pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa one of the leading cause of acute nosocomial infections and pneumonia interestingly we identified rhamnosylated epitopes as one of the discriminating structures in lung microbiota to bind sars-cov-2 spike protein in conclusion we revealed novel ace2-independent carbohydrate-mediated interactions with immune modulating lectins expressed on myeloid cells as well as host lung microbiota glycoconjugates our results identified new molecular pathways using host lectins and signalling that may contribute to viral infection and subsequent immune exacerbation moreover we identified specific rhamnosylated epitopes in lung microbiota to bind sars-cov-2 providing a hypothetical link between the presence of specific lung microbiota and sars-cov-2 infection and severity  viral infections constitute a serious public health and social problem worldwide especially during the recent covid-19 pandemic caused by the betacoronavirus sars-cov-2 1  this virus utilizes a glycosylated spike protein to bind to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 and tmprss2 2 3  during the initial and crucial infection steps different carbohydrate-mediated interactions are playing key roles at the host-pathogen interface as shown for many viruses such as hiv-1 influenza viruses ebolavirus and sars-cov 4 5  the viral proteins often highly glycosylated can be recognized by different carbohydrate-binding proteins from the host triggering simultaneously immune-responses that can facilitate or inhibit viral entry or dissemination 5  in contrast to other pathogens and with rare exceptions viruses do not have a glycosylation machinery and exploit the host intracellular glycosylation machinery during the viral intracellular replication due to the high evolutionary pressure the glycosylation profiles of various human-infecting viruses are very different from a classic host-glycosylated protein as described for example for surface proteins of hiv-1 ebolavirus mers sars-cov and siv 5 6  the glycans on viral proteins are important for proper folding and for modulating accessibility to host proteases and neutralizing antibodies 4  virus have exploited the host-glycosylation machinery as camouflage strategy hiding hypothetical immunogenic epitopes as well as using the host carbohydrate binding receptors as entry mechanisms as for example described for ebolavirus 7 and hiv-1 8  in addition low affinity antibodies against some viral glycoproteins have been reported to increase the viral infection 4  in this scenario the glycosylation profiles of the spike glycoprotein from sars-cov-2 have been recently described 9 10 11  nglycosylation profile of the sars-cov-2 spike protein expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells hek293 showed a combination of high mannoses and complex-type oligosaccharides including highly processed sialylated complex-type glycans and fucosylated glycans on different glycosylation sites 9 10 11  interestingly the n-glycosylation profile of the sars-cov-2 spike protein shows also some difference compared with the sars-cov spike protein 11  in addition o-linked glycan residues have been predicted 12 and described 10  apparently three adjacent predicted o-linked glycans seem to be unique for the sars-cov-2 spike protein the host-immune system has an evolutionary conserved class of carbohydrate-binding proteins lectins able to sense these different glycan-epitopes triggering innate responses in a carbohydrate-dependent manner 13  in this frame the c-type lectins dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin dc-sign and langerin have been described as well-known receptor on dendritic cells used by many viruses as entry mechanism such as hiv-1 14 15 and ebolavirus 7  the macrophage galactose binding lectin mgl and the mannose receptor mr play a role in influenza a virus infection 16  and sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectins siglecs-1 has been involved in hiv-1 trans infection and ebolavirus uptake 17 18  in the context of sars-cov-2 infection we investigated the interactions between the glycosylated viral spike protein expressed in hek293 cells and the host immune lectins via solidphase immunoassays we screened a library of different human c-type lectins expressed on myeloid cells such as the antigen-presenting cells like dendritic cells and macrophages dc-sign langerin mgl mr dectin-1 and the macrophage inducible calcium dependent lectin receptor mincle or soluble mbl to bind to the sars-cov-2 spike protein used as coating agent in elisa experiments figure 1 clearly shows binding of the sars-cov-2 spike protein to human lectin receptors dc-sign and mgl the binding to dc-sign but not to langerin mr and mbl suggests the interactions with specific fucosylated glycans present at n343 core 16 fucose or with lex type of structures 9 or a particular conformation of the high-mannoses able to discriminate between dc-sign and langerin the binding of the sars-cov-2 spike protein to mgl fits with the presence of o-glycans at thr323 or ser325 on the spike protein 10  as the specificity of mgl has been described for  or  galgalnac containing glyco-conjugates 19  surprisingly both mgl and dc-sign are receptors found on tolerogenic macrophagesdendritic cells and their carbohydrate-binding have been shown to hijack myeloid function keeping macrophages immune-silent by the induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines and induction of t cell apoptosisexhaustion 20  although the oligomannosides-content of the spike protein has been reported to be around 30 and man5glcnac2 has been described to be the predominant oligomannose-type glycan n234 and n709 9  we did not see binding to langerin mr and mbl being bona fide lectins able to recognize mannosides despite the fact that the mr mannosebinding evolved separately from the other c-type lectins mbl and mr have close similarity in their mannose-binding profiles 21  however these human lectins were able to bind the positive controls of our experiment illustrating sensitivity of the assay for these lectins to bind their carbohydrate structures see figure s1  the specific binding to dc-sign but not to langerin has been shown also for marburg virus marv 22  while viruses like hiv-1 binds both receptors 15  the fact that sars-cov-2 spike protein binds dc-sign but not langerin nor mr or mbl may indicate that the high-mannoses are not accessible or that there is a preferential specificity for the different fucosylated residues in the context of core fucosylation or terminal lewis antigens on the spike protein this is line with our finding that both lectins do not bind to the spike protein confirming poor accessibility of the spike protein high-mannoses to the immune system as expected the lectin mincle and dectin-1 recognising mostly mycobacterial glycolipids and betaglucans respectively were used as control and did not bind to the spike protein as full figure with all the positive controls is shown in figure s1   binding of sars-cov-2 spike protein to human c-type lectins human c-type lectins elisa results wells were coated with the viral spike protein and the binding to different c-type lectins was evaluated in a calcium-containing buffer the experiment has been performed three times in duplicate with similar results and data were normalized over signal from bsa-coated wells error bars indicate standard deviations od optical density since the sars-cov-2 spike protein has been described to express highly processed sialylated complex-glycans at n165 n282 n801 n1074 and n1098 10 we investigated whether these glycans could be a signature for the sialic-acid binding lectins siglecs a family of carbohydrate receptors with immune-receptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif itim and known immune inhibitory signaling properties 23  using our solid-phase immunoassay screening-system a library of different siglecs siglec-3 siglec-5 siglec-7 siglec-9 and siglec-10 was explored for binding activity to sars-cov-2 spike protein siglecs can be expressed on almost all immune cells including b and t cells monocytes eosinophils and macrophages 23  although siglecs are bona fide sialic-acids binding proteins the literature is not consistent in assigning a specific sialylated pattern to each siglec notwithstanding this human siglec-3 and siglec-10 have a prevalence to interact with 26 linked sialic acids while siglec-9 has a prevalence to interact with 23 linked sialic acids in the context in most of the cases of fucosylated or sulfated oligosaccharides siglec-3 is highly expressed on macrophages and monocytes siglec-9 on monocytes neutrophils conventional dendritic cells nk and t cells siglec-10 on b cells monocytes and eosinophils 24  different siglecs have been implicated in t cell-mediated tolerance alter b cell function and the inhibitory siglec-9 and siglec-10 were upregulated on tumor-infiltrating cd4 and cd8 t cells contributing to exhaustion of tumor t cell responses 23  as shown in figure 2 we observed a specific interaction of the sars-cov-2 spike protein with siglec-3 siglec-9 and siglec-10 our results clearly suggest the presence of 26 and 23 linked sialic acids on the viral spike protein as well as the roles of immunomodulatory siglecs during sars-cov-2 infection probably by altering and modulating the b-cells neutrophil eosinophils monocytes and macrophages function as full figure with the positive controls is shown in figure  s2  the experiment has been performed three times in duplicate with similar results and data were normalized over signal from blocking buffer-coated wells error bars indicate standard deviations od optical density these data illustrate that the heterogeneous glycan-repertoire expressed on the sars-cov-2 spike protein modulate the binding to different carbohydrate-binding receptors expressed on host immune cells in particular we speculate that the spike protein could target a repertoire of immune inhibiting glycan binding receptors such as dc-sign mgl siglec-3 siglec-9 and siglec-10 this also illustrates the enormous potential of sars-cov-2 to modulate the host immune system on multiple levels we next explored a different angle of carbohydrate-mediated interactions of sars-cov-2 studying the interactions with lung microbiota components that may contribute to the disease severity various viruses such as influenza viruses hiv-1 coronavirus oc43 and mers have been described to interact with the host sialic-acids containing structures 25 26 or to interact with sulfated glycosaminoglycans suggesting a carbohydrate-recognition activity for different viral proteins 27  in this context recently the glycosaminoglycan heparin has been described to interact with the sars-cov-2 spike protein inducing conformation changes 28 and heparan sulfate showed binding to the spike protein in a length dependent manner 29  starting from these evidences we chose to study the interaction of the sars-cov-2 spike protein with different glyco-conjugates from the lung microbiota the mechanism underlying the interactions between the lung microbiota and viruses are currently not fully understood it is known that the lung resident microbiota modulates viral infections yielding beneficial outcomes conferring protection against viral infection or harmful outcomes since virus can use the resident bacteria to spread in the host by direct or indirect mechanisms 30 31 32 33  moreover viruses can perturb the integrity of the commensal microbiota modified by viral infections age and smoke that in turn influences virus infectivity and morbidity 31  looking closely to all the bacteria occupying the lung and upper-respiratory microbiota they are covered by an extremely complex library of glyco-conjugates mostly in the form of bacterial capsular-polysaccharides cps and lipopolysaccharides lps this outer layer may contribute to the intimate interactions between sars-cov-2 and the lung microbiota and could help not only in understanding mechanistically the viral entry but also in supporting therapies and prognosisdiagnosis markers from a clinical perspective few data suggest that the microbiota composition of the upper-respiratory tract during acute respiratory syncytial virus infection differs from that of healthy controls 34  during the covid-19 pandemic as well as other past viral outbreaks respiratory viral infections are associated with co-infections with streptococcus pneumoniae sp as recently reported 50 of covid-19 patients who have died also showed secondary bacterial infections and fungal coinfections 35  thus as a proof-of-concept we designed a solid-phase immunoassay coating the plates with a library of seven structurally different cps from s pneumoniae the seven most abundant serotypes worldwide as well as the ones included in pneumococcal conjugate-vaccines pcv sp1 sp5 sp06b sp14 sp18c sp19f and sp23f and determined the binding of sars-cov-2 spike protein as fc-construct in our assay to quantify potential interactions surprisingly when analyzing the binding of the spike protein to the structurally different sp cps with our assay we observed a strong binding of the spike protein to sp19f and sp23f figure 3  the spike protein was able to strongly recognize the cps from sp19f and sp23f while a somewhat weaker interaction was observed with sp18c and sp06b the cps from sp1 and sp5 poorly bound sars-cov-2 spike protein while the csp from sp14 was not recognized looking for a structural rationale sp19f sp23f and sp18c sp06b have in common the presence of the following glycan epitope glc or gal 12 13 or 14 linked to rham where rha stands for rhamnose glc for glucose and gal for galactose interestingly sp1 sp5 and sp14 have no rhamnose in their structures rhamnose is a deoxy sugar not present in humans but highly abundant for example in bacteria and mycobacteria bacterial rhamnosylated glyco-conjugates have evolutionary conserved patterns that co-evolved with the host immune system triggering for example in mammals a conserved and abundant class on naturally-acquired anti-rhamnose antibodies 36  despite the fact that we see differential binding of the sars-cov-2 spike protein to these different capsules we are sure that an equal amounts is coated in the plates increase of the concentrations of the different a cps showed no improvement of the binding and different monoclonal antibodies against the reported cps have been tested in these experimental conditions showed equal coating of the different cps following the observation of the binding of the sars-cov-2 spike protein to different sp cps we aimed at studying also the interactions between other lung microbiota glyco-conjugates we designed another elisa experiment to prove the spike protein binding to different lps expressed as surface antigens from different gram-negative bacteria a small library of different lps pseudomonas aeruginosa salmonella typhimurium and shigella flexneri was tested in an elisa assay against the spike protein p aeruginosa is a typical and widespread human opportunistic pathogen it can cause severe and often deadly lung infections particularly in immunocompromised patients and increasingly resistant to a large number of antibiotics 37  we chose to compare p aeruginosa to two bacteria not interesting the lungs namely s typhimurium 38 and s flexneri 39  enteric pathogens both capable of invading and disseminating the intestinal epithelium the specific interaction between the spike protein and the lps from p aeruginosa when compared to the lps from the gut-associated pathogens s typhimurium and s flexneri is indeed clear and showed in figure 4  the same structural considerations mentioned for the sp cps might be here done  that is the lps from the intestinal pathogens here tested salmonella and shigella do not express rhamnosylated-epitopes while the p aeruginosa strain here analysed in addition to be an opportunistic pathogen able to occupy the lung ecosystem p aeruginosa expresses a lps containing in its core-antigen the glc 12-rha epitope 40  also in this case we proved with different parallel experiments lectins binding that the three tested lps are coating the elisa wells in a similar way all together our results on bacterial glyco-conjugates suggest in the context of sars-cov-2 infection that some bacteria and serotypes in the lung that harbor a rhamnosylated-epitopes could facilitate the binding of the virus to the epithelial cells and its subsequent dissemination these observations could trigger the design of new therapeutic approaches for the bacterial coinfections in covid-19 patients these unreported results indicate that lung microbiota cps and lps can play a role in accelerating the viral infection in addition due to the very high prevalence of bacterial pneumonia in covid-19 patients these results could also help in evaluating the impact of pcv vaccination on covid-19 patients as already suggested of other viral infections 41  as well as to identify specific sp serotypes able to modulate the viral infection in conclusion we identified different carbohydrate-mediated interactions of the sars-cov-2 spike protein these interactions could impact and drive the infection severity and the corresponding uncontrolled immune responses and inflammation processes 42  here we proved that the glycan-heterogeneity on the sars-cov-2 spike protein is the cause of the multiple interactions with the host lectins we showed that the spike protein is recognized specifically by c-type lectins dc-sign and mgl and by different siglecs siglec-3 siglec-9 and siglec-10 interestingly this connects to new ace2 independent infection pathways with the hypothetical immune suppression of monocytes macrophages dendritic cells and b cells the binding to dc-sign mgl siglec-9 and siglec-10 indicates the presence and accessibility of the immune system to fucosylated and sialylated structures as well as the clear presence of oglycans on the spike glycoprotein we also proved a totally unexplored behavior for viral proteins showing the specific binding of the sars-cov-2 to different glyco-conjugates expressed by the bacteria able to colonize the lungs these results may have implications to control and understand the bacterial co-infections to have a better understanding on the disease severity and to add risk factors in covid-19 patients together these data aim at adding different carbohydrate-mediated interactions in the complex and holistic picture of the sars-cov-2 infection and its implications and the optical density od was measured at 450 nm in an elisa

f   the earliest coronavirus isolates were identified from mammalian and avian sources in the 1930s and 1940s beaudette and hudson 1937 doyle and hutchings 1946 cheevers and daniels 1949 at this time electron microscopy revealed prominent large spikes on the surface of virions whose resulting crown-like appearance gave rise to the name coronavirus fig 31 coronaviruses have 45 structural proteins including the spike protein s envelope protein e membrane protein m nucleocapsid protein n and members of the coronavirus phylogenetic subgroup 2a have a shorter s protein called hemagglutinin esterase he the sars-cov genome is unusually large at 297 kb and encodes 14 open reading frames for several proteins marra et al 2003 rota et al 2003 on the interior the lipid envelope of sars-cov appears to have a gap observed as a low density in three-dimensional 3d structures fig 32 and then a more dense layer which is presumably the surface of the nucleocapsid comprising mainly the n protein details of how this nucleocapsid is organized are not clear however the n protein is presumably anchored to the cytoplasmic side of the virion envelope via the m protein which is a low abundance protein and may account for the gap of low density between the envelope and the nucleocapsid electron microscopic examination shows no evidence for supercoiled rna such as that seen in paramyxoviruses and the interior appears amorphous by cryo-electron microscopy cryo-em hence the arrangement whereby the rna may be bound to the nucleocapsid protein is not clear

 a striking feature of the sars-cov spike is its huge mass 500 kd per trimer however despite the size differences the sars-cov spike performs the same fundamental task in viral entry to the host cell as other smaller type 1 viral fusion proteins such as the influenza hemagglutinin ha 220 kd per trimer the sars-cov spike can be subdivided into four structural domains from n to c terminus two large external domains s1 and s2 are largely responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion respectively in most type 1 viral fusion proteins the analogous peptides are generated by proteolysis of the spike precursor during the maturation process in the host cell yielding two peptides with the fusion peptide on the n terminus of s2 in sars-cov the s1s2 assignment is given based on sequence homology to other viral fusion proteins although there appears to be no peptide cleavage the final two small domains are comprised of a transmembrane domain and a carboxyterminal cytoplasmic domain the cell-surface molecule angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is the receptor for the sars-cov s protein li et al 2003 which is a relatively large macromolecule with a diameter of 70  by comparison the receptor for influenza ha sialic acid is much smaller with a 10  diameter one of the challenges of achieving structural molecular studies with native sars-cov is that it is classified as a biological safety level 3 organism requiring handling in containment however once it was shown that specimens could be -irradiated with a sufficient dose 2 mrad for viral inactivation while still preserving protein structure it was possible to carry out cryo-em of intact virions and to obtain the 3d structure of the native unfixed virions and the spike using single particle image processing and averaging from multiple images containing many different viewing angles of the molecule booth et al 2005 beniac et al 2006 immunolabeling showed that these virions were intact antigenically as well as structurally fig 31 and still able to bind to the sars-cov receptor ace2 cryo-em coupled with 3d single-particle image analysis has been used to determine the structure of the sars-cov spike and positioning of the binding of ace2 to the spike beniac et al 2006 2007 spikes on the surface of virus particles are readily imaged by cryo-em in the frozen-hydrated native state fig 31e 3d image processing was carried out on selected spikes using single-particle image processing penczek et al 1994 frank et al 1996 beniac et al 2006 the structures of both the spike and the spikeace2 complex have been solved to 185  resolution figs 32 and 33 beniac et al 2006 2007 the spike shows a striking structure being about 180  in diameter and with three distinct lobes or domains 50  thick on each subunit of the trimer similar in appearance to the blades of a propeller and a thin stalk connecting the spike to the viral envelope the blades are twisted at an angle of 30 to the axis of symmetry and are almost certainly composed of the spike s1 domain
 ace2 binding does not result in a fundamental structural unfolding of the spike however the overall height of the spike was reduced from 160  to 150  following binding when viewed end-on the spike undergoes a rotation of 5o following binding and the mass at the center of the axis of symmetry on the distal end of the spike redistributes itself these redistributions of mass were further identified in difference maps between the two reconstructions fig 34 upon ace2 binding the spike undergoes a decondensation of mass around the central axis fig 34bg blue this region is the putative location of the s2 domain the difference map for the bound spike fig 34di shows changes in both the ace2 component purple and the outer edges of the three blades of the s1 domain green
 the precise location of ace2 binding on the distal end of the spike is centered at 70  from the central axis of the spike with a 30  gap between the axis of symmetry and ace2 one ace2 molecule can bind to each of the three propeller-like blades of the spike making a structure 220  high fig 33b binding of more than one ace2 to each spike on one or both of the other two propeller blades of each trimer is possible hence binding of one ace2 molecule does not stearically hinder binding of additional ace2 molecules the cryo-em 3d structures of the spike and the spikeace2 complex when combined with the atomic resolution structures of the sars-cov spike receptor-binding domain  ace2 complex li et al 2005a and the heptad repeat pre- and postfusion cores supekar et al 2004 hakansson-mcreynolds et al 2006 show that the receptor-binding domain docks to the distal end of the spike with ace2 filling the extra mass on the spike shown by the color violet in fig 33 the empty upper region of the mass appears to be components of the second ace2 and the fc component of the chimeric protein and the location of the c-terminus of the docked ace2 was consistent with this interpretation viral membrane fusion proteins are responsible both for binding to cellular receptors and the subsequent fusion of viral and cellular membranes the paradigm for type 1 fusion proteins consists of two heptad repeat regions and a hydrophobic fusion peptide dutch et al 2000 this motif is present in sars-cov hakansson-mcreynolds et al 2006 and other coronaviruses xu et al 2004 as well as the hemagglutinin ha of influenza skehel and wiley 2000 gp21 of human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 kobe et al 1999 gp41 of hivweissenhorn et al 1997 gp2 of ebola weissenhorn et al 1998 malashkevich et al 1999 and the fusion protein of paramyxovirus zhao et al 2000 chen et al 2001 type 1 viral fusion proteins can also be divided into two subtypes those whose fusion mechanism is low ph-dependent such as influenza ha and those that are ph-independent like the retroviral fusion proteins in retroviruses receptor binding itself can trigger fusion with temperature and redox conditions also influencing the fusion mechanism hernandez et al 1997 damico et al 1998 the sars-cov spike appears to be insensitive to redox conditions fenouillet et al 2007 although the factors which trigger fusion endocytosis ph sensitivity single receptor vs primary and coreceptor binding redox change differ amongst diverse virus families all viral fusion proteins are thought to share the same basic fusion mechanism baker et al 1999 skehel and wiley 2000 dutch et al 2000 colman and lawrence 2003 dimitrov 2004 hofmann and pohlmann 2004 the precise mechanisms by which type 1 viral fusion proteins gain access to the host cell remain unknown the hypothetical entry process includes several steps that take place in sequence receptor binding fusion core rearrangement fusion peptide insertion in host cell membrane refolding of heptad repeats membrane fusion and finally viral nucleocapsid transfer earp et al 2005 in most proposed models of membrane fusion it is postulated that the s1 domain or analogous receptor-binding domains dissociate from the spike during the membrane fusion process this dynamic process was demonstrated for influenza ha by kemble et al 1992 in their investigation where they engineered intermonomer disulfide bonds between the ha s1 subunits the result of this was that fusion activity was impaired however it could be restored under reducing conditions it is probable that the sars-cov spike shares a similar mechanism with the structural changes detected by cryo-em representing the initial step in this process by analogy with other type 1 viral fusion proteins the fusion core of the sars-cov spike is thought to undergo similar structural rearrangements during fusion the receptor-binding domain is localized in a position on the distal end of the molecule closer to the 3-fold axis than anticipated yet still in a position that would not impede these structural rearrangements putative mechanisms by which type 1 viral fusion proteins achieve membrane fusion have been proposed baker et al 1999 skehel and wiley 2000 dutch et al 2000 colman and lawrence 2003 dimitrov 2004 but complete structural evidence for the role of intermediate structures in these mechanisms has yet to be obtained the structural biology of this process has been best characterized for the influenza ha and paramyxovirus fusion protein f for which the prefusion and membrane fusion ph structures have been determined by x-ray crystallography sauter et al 1992 bullough et al 1994 skehel and wiley 2000 yin et al 2005 2006 fig 35 inset all of the subsequent models for type 1 viral fusion proteins are based on the structural data of these two fusion proteins a drawback in all of these models is that they are based on recombinant ectodomains that are not proven to exist as a component in the complete molecule and they lack both membrane-interacting residues and lipids skehel and wiley 2000 the cryo-em structures of intact sars-cov spike bound to native virion lipid envelopes are very instructive when atomic resolution fragments are docked within the overall molecule especially as the entire sars-cov spike has proven to be a difficult subject for x-ray crystallography and atomic resolution data exist for only a few fragments of the sars-cov spike this structural data has been modeled into a scheme to propose a mechanism for sars-cov spike-mediated membrane fusion figs 35 and 36 in the initial step the receptor-binding domain of the spike attaches to its human receptor ace2 at this point the fusion core is in the prefusion configuration with the three heptad 2 repeats hr2 forming a coiled-coil symmetric trimer at the center of the stalk of the spike hakansson-mcreynolds et al 2006

 during the next step of the membrane fusion process the virus is internalized in the cell by endocytosis and is exposed to a low ph environment and may undergo proteolytic cleavage between the s1 and s2 domains simmons et al 2005 the next step is fusion core rearrangement so that the fusion peptide fp inserts into the host cell membrane in fig 35 this initial process is illustrated with models m0m3 based on the atomic structure of the hr2 prefusion core which begins to collapse upon itself in model m3 in a manner similar to that which occurs with influenza ha skehel and wiley 2000 the inset in fig 35 illustrates this process in ha by coloring segments of s2 to illustrate the rearrangement from m0 to m3 that takes place during this process we propose that the receptor-binding domain still holds on to ace2 so that the fully extended fusion peptide will be positioned to penetrate through the host membrane our cryo-em results show that it is possible for the spike to attach to three ace2 receptors at once this may serve to hold on to the host membrane like a tripod so as to accurately orientate the fusion core fig 37 in addition the 30  gap between the axis of symmetry and ace2 provides sufficient space for fusion core rearrangement damico et al 1998 demonstrated that the kinetics of binding of the rous sarcoma virus envelope protein ectodomain to liposomes was not linear with respect to receptor concentration this suggested that activation of the trimeric ectodomain favored binding to multiple receptor monomers one can therefore infer that other structurally homologous viral envelope proteins can also bind multiple receptors which may be a general adaptation that provides the correct temporal and spatial arrangement to bring about membrane fusion the observation that the sars-cov spike could bind three soluble ace2 receptors provides three possible binding states with one two or three membrane-bound receptors attached to the spike in fig 37 we present these three states with only one receptor bound the spike and virus have a wide range of movement possible whereas with two receptors bound the movement is greatly restricted to motion in one plane only only in the case of three bound receptors will the spike and its fusion core be arranged perpendicular to the cell surface with minimal movement possible at present it has not been demonstrated that membrane fusion requires the fusion core to be oriented perpendicular to the host cell membrane to function however one can hypothesize this based on the orientation of ace2 on the distal end of the sars-cov spike it is interesting to note that binding to three receptor molecules is the minimum number of binding events required to achieve this perpendicular orientation in 3d space this observation matches up with the conserved trimeric structures of type 1 fusion proteins which are common amongst enveloped viruses thus indicating that a possible conserved structuralfunctional relationship may exist
 the next step in the membrane fusion process involves the refolding of the fusion core back upon itself to adopt the postfusion configuration supekar et al 2004 fig 35 models m4m6 in this configuration three heptad 1 repeats hr1 form a parallel coiled-coil trimer and the three hr2 pack in an antiparallel fashion in the hydrophobic grooves of the hr1 trimer the result of this is that both the fp and transmembrane regions of the spike are brought in close proximity to each other resulting in the host and viral membranes being in close contact each sars-cov virion has an average of 65 spikes beniac et al 2006 at this density several spikes would be close enough together to act in concert to disrupt the plasma membrane and induce pore formation between viral and cellular membranes opening of these pores would allow the sars-cov nucleocapsid to enter the host cell cytoplasm as shown in our model in fig 36 multiple sars-cov spike trimers may be involved in formation of the fusion pore similar to the situation in influenza where it has been suggested that between three and six ha trimers may be involved in the production of each fusion pore skehel and wiley 2000 in figs 35 and 36 we have presented the ace2sarss1 domains as they were solved in this cryo-em investigation for the model of membrane fusion that we present for other fusion proteins like influenza ha1 and hiv gp120 it has been modeled that the rearrangements upon membrane fusion are dramatic involving a shedding of the above-mentioned domains the cryo-em investigations have detected structural movement of s1 upon ace2 binding which could represent the initial phase of this dramatic process that is postulated to occur in the course of membrane fusion an analysis of the structure of the spikereceptor complex demonstrates how sars-cov can adapt to utilize receptors from different species and how they may evolve to gain specificity for new receptor types in that there is redundancy and a great deal of protein mass that can accommodate evolutionary changes rna viruses have a high rate of mutation and recombination moya et al 2004 in sars-cov the spike is able to retain specific binding affinity for the ace2 of more than one host species and rapid evolution to gain specificity for novel ace2 species has been demonstrated li et al 2005b 2006 the large size of the spike of coronaviruses may be related to the use of large host cell-surface molecules such as ace2 as specific receptors amongst the coronavirus family specific cell-surface receptors for the s protein are all in the range of 60110 kd wentworth and holmes 2001 these large host receptor molecules are of course functionally constrained and in turn relatively well conserved across species barriers in utilizing binding to a large receptor molecule the spike s1 domain also acts as a spacer arm holding the receptor far enough away from the threefold axis of symmetry of the spike s2 domain to permit fusion core rearrangement and subsequent membrane fusion such a property necessitates having a large spike molecule moreover multiple receptor binding can have functional significance enhancing the binding and entry of viruses cross-linking of adjacent host receptor molecules could increase the affinity of the virus for its target cell as well as improving the kinetics of fusion the sars-cov spike is a useful model system for the investigation of type 1 viral fusion protein dynamics utilizing this system for further research may lead to the possibility of developing broad-spectrum antivirals that target conserved cell fusion mechanisms shared by diverse virus families  computational simulations reveal the binding dynamics between human ace2 and the receptor binding domain of sars-cov-2 spike protein cecylia lupalaa s xuanxuan lib jian leic hong chene jianxun qif haiguang liua xiao-dong sue  a novel coronavirus the sars-cov-2 has been identified in january 2020 as the causal pathogen for covid-19 pneumonia an outbreak started near the end of 2019 in wuhan china the sars-cov-2 was found to be closely related to the sars-cov based on the genomic analysis the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 protein ace2 utilized by the sars-cov as a receptor was found to facilitate the infection of sars-cov-2 as well initiated by the binding of the spike protein to the human ace2 using homology modeling and molecular dynamics md simulation methods we report here the detailed structure of the ace2 in complex with the receptor binding domain rbd of the sars-cov-2 spike protein the predicted model is highly consistent with the experimentally determined complex structures plausible binding modes between human ace2 and the rbd were revealed from all-atom md simulations the simulation data further revealed critical residues at the complex interface and provided more details about the interactions between the sars-cov-2 rbd and human ace2 two mutants mimicking rat ace2 were modeled to study the mutation effects on rbd binding to ace2 the simulations showed that the n-terminal helix and the k353 of the human ace2 alter the binding modes of the cov2-rbd to the ace2  the outbreak of a new type of severe pneumonia covid-19 started in december 2019 1 has been going on world-wide and caused over 15000 fatalities infected more than 350000 individuals globally although the earlier infected cases were mainly found in china before march 2020 particularly in hubei province the confirmed covid-19 cases have been reported in more than 160 countries or territories by the end of march 2020 and still increasing rapidly one urgent desire in coping with this global crisis is to develop or discover drugs that can treat the diseases caused by the novel coronavirus the sars-cov-2 also known as 2019-ncov2 according to the genome comparative studies the sars-cov-2 belongs to the genus beta-coronavirus with nucleotide sequence identity of about 96 compared to the closest bat coronavirus ratg13 about 89 compared to two other bat sars-like viruses bat-sl-covzc45  bat-sl-covzxc21 and 79 compared to the sars-cov 34 furthermore the sars-cov-2 spike protein has a protein sequence identity of 73 for the receptor binding domain rbd with the sars-cov rbd denoted as sars-rbd in the following the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 both utilize the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 protein ace2 to initiate the spike protein binding and facilitate the fusion to host cells 5-9 the 193-residue rbd of the sars-cov spike protein has been found to be sufficient to bind the human ace2 6 based on this fact the rbd of sars-cov-2 becomes a critical protein target for drug development to treat the covid-19 when this study was started neither the crystal structure of the sars-cov-2 spike protein nor the rbd segment were determined so the homology modeling approach was applied to construct the model of the sars-cov-2 spike rbd in complex with the human ace2 binding domain denoted as cov2-rbdace2 in the following similar approach has been applied to predict the complex structure and estimate the binding energies 3 because of the high sequence similarity between cov2-rbd and sars-rbd the predicted structure was found to be highly consistent with the resolved crystal structures 10 see another crystal structure at httpnmdccnncov entrynmdcs0000001 pdbid 6lzg these structures laid the foundation for the dynamics investigation of the cov2-rbdace2 complex using computational simulation method the predicted cov2-rbdace2 model was subjected to all-atom molecular dynamics md simulations to study the binding interactions although the crystal structure and the predicted model of the cov2-rbdace2 complex provide important information about the binding interactions at the molecular interfaces md simulations can extend the knowledge to a dynamics regime in a fully solvated environment the importance of the ace2 residues was investigated by simulating the complexes with ace2 mutants in which partial dissociation from the ace2 was observed within 500 ns simulations the control simulations of the sars-rbdace2 complexes allowed the detailed comparison in receptor binding for the two different types of viruses the results showed that the wild type cov2-rbdace2 complex is stable in 500 ns simulations especially in the well-defined binding interface on the other hand the mutations on the helix-1 or k353 of the ace2 can alter the binding revealing new binding poses with reduced contacts compared to those in the crystal structures the analysis of the interaction energy showed that the binding is enhanced by adjusting conformations to form more favorable interactions as the simulation progressed consistent with the increased hydrogen bonding patterns furthermore the analysis also showed that sars-rbd and cov2-rbd have comparable binding affinities to the ace2 with the former slightly stronger than the latter the dynamic information obtained by this study shall be useful in understanding sars-cov-2 host interaction and for designing inhibitors to block cov2-rbd binding the computer model of the sars-cov-2 spike rbd in complex with human ace2 the spike rbd of sars-cov-2 genbank mn908947 2 comprises cys336-gly526 residues according to the sequence homology analysis with sars-cov spike rbd the predicted three-dimensional structure model of these residues was obtained with the swiss-model server 11 this predicted sars-cov-2 rbd model was subsequently superimposed into the x-ray structure of sars-cov rbd in complex with human ace2 pdb code2ajf chain d 7 finally the computer model of sars-cov-2 rbd with human ace2 cov2-rbdace2 was obtained for further simulations and analysis based on the analysis of the predicted model sequence alignment and literature survey two other systems containing mutations in the human ace2 were prepared and subject to md simulation studies the mutant construct is based on the fact that rat ace2 markedly diminishes interactions with sars spike protein 12 and it was proposed that the rat ace2 likely has reduced binding affinity to the cov2-rbd 13 to investigate the roles of critical residues on the ace2 we created two mutants of the human ace2 see table 1  1 mutant muth1 with the ace2 n-terminal residue 19-40 mutated to the residues of rat ace2 and 2 mutant k353h in which the highly conserved k353 was mutated to histidine the corresponding amino acid in rat and mouse ace2 proteins to focus on the impact of these two binding sites the rest of the ace2 were kept to be the same as human ace2 the predicted model of cov2-rbdace2 complex was used as the starting models for md simulations the spike protein rbd domain is composed of 180 residues 323-502 while the ace2 protein contains 597 residues from the n-terminal domain the simulation parameterization and equilibration were prepared for complex structures including the mutant systems using the charmm-gui webserver 14 each system was solvated in tip3p water and sodium chloride ions to neutralize the systems to a salt concentration of 150 mm approximately each system was composed of about 220000 atoms that were parametrized with the charmm36 force field 15 after energy minimization using the steepest descent algorithm each system was equilibrated at human body temperature 31015 k which was maintained by nose-hoover scheme with three independent trajectories starting from random velocities based on maxwell distributions were simulated for both cov2-rbdace2 and sars-rbdace2 complex systems in their wild types in all simulations a time step of 20 fs was used and the pme particle mesh ewald 20 was applied for long-range electrostatic interactions the van der waals interactions were evaluated within the distance cutoff of 120  hydrogen atoms were constrained using the lincs algorithm 21 the human ace2 mutants in complex with cov2-rbd were constructed as described previously each mutant complex model was simulated in two independent trajectories furthermore as the crystal structure of the cov2-rbdace2 complex became available two additional simulations were carried out using the crystal structure as the starting model to cross-validate the simulation results based on the homology model each trajectory was propagated to 500 ns by following the same protocol as the wild type cov2-rbdace2 complex simulations analyses were carried out with tools in gromacs such as rmsd rmsf energy and pairdist to examine the system properties such as the overall stability local residue and general structure fluctuations through the simulations the gmmpbsa program 22 was applied to extract the molecular mechanics energy emm lennard jones and electrostatic interactions between ace2 and the rbd of spike proteins vmd and chimera were applied to analyze the hydrogen bonds molecular binding interface water distributions visualization and rending model images 23 24  the homology structure of the cov2-rbdace2 was compared to the sars-rbdace2 crystal structure and the newly resolved crystal structure of the cov2-rbdace2 the results indicated that the homology model is accurate especially at the binding interface the md simulations further refined the side chain orientations to improve the model quality the simulation data revealed the stable binding between the cov2-rbd and the ace2 in spite of the conformational changes of the ace2 the relative movement between the cov2-rbd and the ace2 mainly exhibited as a swinging motion pivoted at the binding interface simulations also revealed the roles of water molecules in the binding of the rbd to the ace2 receptor the md simulation of complex with ace2 mutants suggested that mutation to the ace2 helix-1 and the k353 can alter the binding modes and binding affinity the predicted cov2-rbdace2 complex structure is highly similar to the sars-rbdace2 as shown in figure 1  the rbd domain has an rmsd of 099  for the aligned residues 153  for all 174 residue pairs indicating that the homology model of the cov2-rbd is in good agreement with the sars-rbd for ace2 residues near the binding interface within 40  of the rbd the rmsd is smaller than 043  compared to the sars-rbdace2 complex the superposed structures revealed that the rbdace2 interfaces are almost identical in two complexes figure 1c  in a retrospective comparison the predicted complex structure was superposed to the newly resolved crystal models see figure 2d for a detailed comparison at the interface the results indicated that the homology model is very accurate especially for the binding interface the residues near the cov2-rbdace2 interface defined as the combined set of ace2 residues within 40  of rbd and the rbd residues within 40  of the ace2 exhibited a difference of 043  rmsd which is comparable to the difference between the two independently reported crystal models an rmsd of 025  for the same comparison the rmsd is about 077  for residues in an extended region within 100  of the binding interface the rbd domain of the spike protein showed an overall rmsd values less than 15  and the ace2 domain with an rmsd about 20  between the predicted model and the crystal structures in three simulations of the cov2-rbdace2 systems the binding interface was highly stable exhibiting very small conformational changes especially for the interfacing residues of the ace2 protein the rmsd for the residues at the rbd binding interface is 085 -013 on average side chain atom positions were refined to form more favorable interactions figure 2d  one outstanding example is the k31 side-chain which pointed in the wrong orientation in the predicted structure was quickly refined to the correct orientation consistent with the crystal structure right panel of figure 2d  in terms of collective conformational changes the cov2-rbdace2 complex showed two interesting movements 1 the loop l67 between 6 and 7 residues between s477 and g485 in particular of cov2-rbd was found to expand its interactions with the nterminal helix the helix-1 of the ace2 figure 2a  while it pointed away from the helix-1 in the predicted and the crystal structures figure 2d left  2 a tilting movement of the rbd relative to the ace2 was observed which can be depicted as a swinging motion with the binding interface as the pivot see figure 4 for an illustration in both predicted and the crystal structures of the cov2-rbdace2 complex the l67 does not form close contacts with the ace2 the analysis of the crystal packing revealed that this loop participated in the interaction with another asymmetric unit see supplemental information interestingly the simulation data suggested that the l67 could move towards the ace2 and form contacts with the helix-1 this can potentially enhance the binding as reflected in the change of interaction energies in the crystal structure the c480 and c488 of the rbd are cross-linked via a disulfide bond that reduces the flexibility of the l67 region limiting its access to the ace2 on the other hand it has been reported that the binding of sars-rbd to ace2 is insensitive to the redox states of the cysteines to a high extend 26 based on the simulation results we hypothesize that the reduced form of c480 and c488 can also exist during the virus invasion to host cells and the reduced cysteines can potentially enhance the binding to ace2 in the other two simulation trajectories we found that the l67 remained in conformations similar to that in the crystal structure and the cysteines c480 and c488 were close enough for disulfide bond formation by examining the binding interface of cov2-rbd and the ace2 we found the polar and charged residues account for a large fraction therefore the electrostatic interactions play critical roles for the complex formation based on the distances between the two proteins the key residues at the binding interface were identified and summarized in table 2 for the three representative models see figure 2  majority of these residues are conserved for these three models except that the model1 figure 2a has additional contacts to the ace2 from residues in the l67 region highlighted with green color in table 2  as shown in figure 2  the l67 remained in the starting position for the other two representative models figure 2bc  the same simulations were carried out for the sars-rbdace2 complex serving as a comparative system interestingly the sars-rbd counterpart of the l67 in cov2-rbd did not form close contacts with the ace2 in three simulations it is worthwhile to mention that the sequence identity between cov2-rbd and sars-rbd is low in this loop region suggesting the loop region might be partially responsible for the difference in the receptor binding the hydrogen bonds between the cov2-rbd and ace2 were extracted using vmd based on the statistics of three simulation trajectories the cov2-rbdace2 complex has 27 hydrogen bonds between the subunits on average with stringent criteria in comparison the sars-rbdace2 has 32 hydrogen bonds on average see supplementary   information  the statistics of hydrogen bonds suggest a slightly weaker binding between the cov2-rbd and the ace2 relative to the sars-rbdace2 complex it is also noteworthy to point out the important roles of water molecules at the complex interface for cov2-rbdace2 complex at any instant time there are approximately 15 water molecules at the binding interface simultaneously located within 25  of both the cov2-rbd and the ace2 figure 6  these water molecules can function as bridges by forming hydrogen bonds with the residues from the rbd or the ace2 the dwelling time of water molecules at the interface can be a few nanoseconds as revealed by the md simulations this results is also consistent with the crystal structure which has 12 water molecules at the interface figure 6c  these discoveries emphasize the role of the water molecules which desires detailed quantification to understand the interactions between the rbd and the ace2 it has been demonstrated that the ace2 from several mammalian species possess high sequence similarities yet their binding to the sars-rbd differs significantly in particular the binding of sars-rbd to the rat ace2 is much weaker as discovered in experiments 12 inspired by these information two mutants of the cov2-rbdace2 were constructed 1 ace2-mut-h1 by mutating n-terminal helix-1 to that of the rat ace2 2 ace2-k353h by mutating k353 to histidine the amino acid in wild type rat ace2 two 500ns md simulations were carried out for each mutant system the simulation showed that the mutations in ace2-mut-h1 reduced the interaction between the cov2-rbd and the helix-1 and the ace2-k353h showed weaker binding between the cov2-rbd and the -hairpin centered at the h353 using the clustering analysis the representative structures were identified from each simulation trajectory figure 7  although the overall topology is very similar to the wild type complex structure there are pronounced differences for the ace2-mut-h1 system the cov2-rbd tilted further away from the ace12 helix-1 in one simulation figure 7a  and the cov2-rbd lost its contact with helix-13 g326 to n330 in another simulation for the ace2-k353h figure 7c  in the wild type ace2 the k353 is a hydrogen donor and its mutant h353 cannot form the hydrogen bond with the cov2-rbd as in the wild type cov2-rbdace2 complex the number of contacting residue pairs was significantly reduced in the ace2-k353h mutant system this is in line with the report that k353 is more critical than the other residues as its hydrophobic neighborhood enables this positively charged residue high selectivity to the rbd 2728 the physical interactions between the rbd and the ace2 were quantified for the simulated structures we considered the molecular mechanics energy emm  which is composed of the van der waals and the electrostatic interactions furthermore the number of residue contacts nc between rbd and ace2 was extracted from simulated structures both the emm and nc indicate that the rbd interactions with the ace2 are comparable for cov2 and sars spike proteins figure 8  from the simulations the we would like to point out that the energy emm is the physical interaction between the rbd and the ace2 rather than the binding energy which requires accurately incorporating solvation energy and entropy furthermore the standard deviations of emm are 702 kjmol and 655 kjmol for the two complexes therefore we infer that the binding affinities are comparable for cov2-rbdace2 and sars-rbdace2 the simulations started from the predicted and crystal models yielded very similar results purple triangles this is in line with a recent study in which the authors showed similar binding affinity to human ace2 for both sars-cov-2 and sars-cov spike proteins 29 they found the association rate constants kon to be the same at 14x105 m-1s-1 while the sars-cov spike protein showed a faster dissociation with the rate constant koff to be 71x10-4 s-1 about 44 times larger than the sars-cov-2 spike protein koff 16x10-4 s-1 similar kon values and the equilibrium dissociation constants kd in nanomolar range were reported in other studies for sars-cov-2 spike protein or rbd binding to human ace21030 more interestingly the mutation impacts were reflected in the emm and nc analysis the ace2-muth1 is likely to reduce the binding to the ace2 due to the tilting movement of cov2-rbd making it further from the ace2 helix-1 the blue triangle symbol at lower right see figure 7a for the representative structure in the other simulation trajectory for the cov2-rbdace2-muth1 complex blue triangle at the left upper corner the largest nc was observed among all simulations for simulations of the complex with ace2-k353h mutants green diamonds the number of contacts were both reduced compared to the wild type system in one simulation the contacts between the cov2-rbd and the helix-13 of the ace2 were completely lost see figure 7c  consistent with the less favorable interactions reflected on an increase of emm for the sars-rbd interaction with the ace2-muth1 both simulations revealed fewer contacts compared to the wild type sars-rbdace2 complex purple stars in figure 8  the homology modeling of the cov2-rbdace2 complex yielded highly consistent models compared to the crystal structures all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to study the dynamic interactions of cov2-rbd with human ace2 the results were compared to the sars-rbdace2 system the human ace2 mutants were also constructed to mimic the rat ace2 to investigate the roles of critical residues and possible binding modes in other mammals it is observed that md simulations improved the structure at the binding interface and strengthened the interactions between the subunits the structure of the complex interface is highly stable for all simulations of cov2-rbdace2 complex in the wild type the loop region between 6 and 7 can potentially form more contacts with the ace2 as observed in one simulation trajectory the simulations results also reveal that the interactions between cov2-rbd and the ace2 are mediated by water molecules at the interfaces stressing the necessity of accounting for the explicit water molecules when quantifying the binding affinity the interactions between the rbd and the ace2 were quantified by physical interaction energies molecular mechanics energy and the number of contacting residues the detailed comparison results suggest that the cov2-rbd and the sars-rbd bind to human ace2 with comparable affinity the comparison between the sars-rbdace2 and the cov2-rbdace2 complexes with the former forms fewer contacts than the latter figure 8  yet exhibiting stronger interactions the decomposition of the emm to the van der waals and the electrostatic interactions revealed that the major difference is attributed to the electrostatic interactions furthermore we compared the major contacting residues and found that the sars-rbd has two charged residues r426 and d463 and the cov2-rbd has only one charged residue k417 at the complex interface the polar and hydrophobic residues are comparable in the two rbds this is consistent with the statistics of hydrogen bonds at the complex interfaces this study was started with a structure predicted using homology modeling method which later found to be highly consistent with the crystal structure demonstrating the potentiality of structure prediction and dynamics simulation in revealing molecular details before the availability of high resolution experimental information furthermore the interactions between cov2-rbd and the ace2 mutants mimicking rat ace2 protein were investigated the results provide valuable information at the atomic level for the reduced binding affinity the recent report on the sars-cov-2 infection to

bnab 2g12  2g12 targets glycans at positions 709 717 and 801 in the sars-cov-2 spike  our studies suggest a common epitope for fdg antibodies centered around glycan 709 the covid-19 pandemic caused by sars-cov-2 has escalated into a global crisis the spike s protein that mediates cell entry and membrane fusion is the current focus of vaccine and therapeutic antibody development efforts the s protein like many other viral fusion proteins such as hiv-1 envelope env and influenza hemagglutinin is glycosylated with both complex and high mannose glycans here we demonstrate binding to the sars-cov-2 s protein by a category of fab-dimerized glycan-reactive fdg hiv-1-induced broadly neutralizing antibodies bnabs a 31  resolution cryo-em structure of the s protein ectodomain bound to glycandependent hiv-1 bnab 2g12 revealed a quaternary glycan epitope on the spike s2 domain involving multiple protomers these data reveal a new epitope on the sars-cov-2 spike that can be targeted for vaccine design  the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 emerged in late 2019 and rapidly spread causing a global pandemic of a severe acute respiratory syndrome  the sars coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 utilizes a heavily glycosylated spike s protein to bind its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 and mediate cell entry and fusion 1 the s protein is a trimeric class i fusion protein composed of two functional subunits responsible for receptor binding s1 subunit and membrane fusion s2 subunit 2 3  the surface of the virally encoded s protein is covered by host-derived glycans with each trimer encoding 66 n-linked glycosylation sites 4  viral fusion proteins such as the spike proteins of diverse coronaviruses the hiv-1 envelope env and influenza hemagglutinin ha are typically covered with high mannose and complex glycans 5 6  viruses rely on host glycosylation machinery to synthesize and express glycans which cover the surface of proteins exposed on the virus and shield conserved neutralization epitopes from immune surveillance while genetic and somatic diversities can preclude targeting protein epitopes for broad-spectrum neutralization viruses may display common carbohydrate moieties that can be targeted by glycan binding agents indeed targeting glycan moieties has been proposed as a general strategy for broad-spectrum virus neutralization 7 8 9  while one concern with this general concept is that the glycan targeting agents may have unfavorable cross-reactivity with human tissue by binding host carbohydrate moieties heavily glycosylated viral proteins of which hiv-1 env is an example have significant population of unprocessed oligomannose-type glycans that are not usually observed at high abundance on secreted mammalian glycoproteins 10 11  this divergence from host cell glycosylation and the non-self nature of these oligomannose glycans represent immunogenic targets and indeed a number of anti-hiv-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies bnabs have been isolated that specifically target gp120 glycans as part of their epitope 12 13 14  site-specific glycan analysis of the sars-cov-2 spike protein demonstrated 28 of oligomannose-type glycans on the s protein surface 4  here we raised the hypothesis that the glycan shield of the sars-cov-2 spike protein can be targeted by hiv-1 glycan-reactive antibodies we tested sars-cov-2 s protein for binding by hiv-1 bnab 2g12 that binds a glycan-only epitope on the hiv-1 env 12 15 16  as well as by a panel of fab-dimerized glycan-reactive fdg antibodies we have recently demonstrated that fdg antibodies are common in the hiv-1 uninfected b cell repertoire and they bound high mannose glycans on hiv-1 env yeast and other environmental antigens 17  in a companion manuscript 17 we described highly prevalent fdg antibodies that target the high mannose glycan shield of the hiv-1 env here we test members of this category of antibodies for binding to the sars-cov-2 spike s protein a sars-cov-2 s protein ectodomain construct incorporating residues 1-1208 of the sars-cov-2 s protein and harboring two stabilizing proline mutations in the s2 domain a foldon trimerization domain as well as c-terminal twin streptactin and his tags were expressed and purified as described previously from hek-293f cells  figure s1  2  we tested three different groups of fdg antibodies -1 fdg antibodies that were isolated from shiv-infected macaques and shown to broadly neutralize hiv-1 isolates dh8511 -dh8513 and dh10032 2 fdg precursor antibodies that were isolated from a hiv nave human dh1005 and shiv infected dh8981 and dh8984 or hiv env vaccinated dh7171 -dh7174 and dh501 macaques and 3 antibody 2g12 that forms a subcategory on its own as the only variable heavy vh domainswapped fdg antibody known to date antibody 2g12 is a bnab that neutralizes heterologous hiv-1 isolates and binds to a conformational glycan cluster on hiv-1 env 15 18 19  to test whether the fdg antibodies that bind the hiv-1 env glycan shield can also recognize the sars-cov-2 spike we performed elisa and spr assays figures 1 and s2-s8  as a positive control in the elisa assays we included antibody d001 see methods that binds the receptor binding domain rbd of sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 and as a negative control antibody ch65 20 that binds the influenza hemagglutinin we observed binding of the s protein to the rbd-directed antibody d001 whereas no binding was observed for negative control antibody ch65 all fdg antibodies tested bound the sars-cov-2 spike to varying degrees figures 1 s2 and s3  to determine if these antibodies were targeting glycan epitopes on the sars-cov-2 s protein we tested binding of the antibodies to the s protein in the presence of a high-mannose glycan d-mannose figures 1 s2 to gain insight into the epitope on the sars-cov-2 spike ectodomain targeted by the fdg antibodies we chose 2g12 for structural determination in complex with the sars-2 spike ectodomain while the non-domain-swapped fdg antibodies exist as mixtures of y-and ishaped forms 17  the vh domain-swapped 2g12 presents a 100 i-shaped population that can be separated from its intermolecular dimer form by size exclusion chromatography 21 and digested using papain to yield a stable domain-swapped fab dimer amenable to structural studies  figure s7  12 15 18 19  the 2g12 fab obtained by papain digestion of the 2g12 igg  figure s7  bound to sars-cov-2 spike with affinity of 313 nm figure s8  and on-and off-rates of 35 x 10 4 m -1 s -1 and 119 x 10 2 s -1  respectively the fdg antibodies in figure 1 as well as the hiv-1 bnab 2g12 were tested in a sars-cov-2 plaque reduction neutralization assay and were all negative starting at 50 gml data not shown importantly in none of the assays were enhanced numbers of viral plaques seen with the addition of fdg antibodies to visualize the epitope of 2g12 bound to the sars-cov-2 spike we determined a cryo-em structure of the 2g12 fab bound to a stabilized sars-cov-2 ectodomain construct 2 figures 2-6 s9 and s10 table s1  the cryo-em dataset obtained from 6804 micrographs showed considerable compositional heterogeneity revealing populations of unliganded spike as well as spike bound to 2g12 at 1 2 or 3 of it binding sites  figure s9  the 2g12-bound spike was 15 of the total population we obtained cryo-em reconstructions of the sars-cov-2 s protein bound to a single 2g12 fab at 33  from  108000 particles and s protein bound to two 2g12 fabs at 32  resolution from 110000 particles figure s9  we also observed a smaller population 42000 particles that showed occupancy at all three binding sites although the 2g12 density at one of the sites was substantially weaker than at the other two even upon extensive 3d classification of this population the weaker density at the third site remained suggesting that this weak density was due to flexibility of the bound 2g12 rather than partial occupancy to maximize the resolution of the 2g12 interface with the sars-cov-2 spike we performed 3d refinement by combining all 2g12-bound particles and using a mask that focused the refinement on the s protein and one 2g12 fab on doing so we obtained a 31  reconstruction of 2g12 fab bound to the sars-cov-2 spike figures 2 and s9  table s1  fitting this map with the coordinates for the sars-cov-2 spike pdb 6vxx 3 and 2g12 fab2 pdb 6n35 12 followed by iterative coordinate refinement and model building 22 23 yielded a model for 2g12 fab2 bound to the sars-cov-2 spike that was used for further analysis the local resolutions of the cryo-em reconstruction spanned a range from 2 the vh domain swapped configuration of the 2g12 fab-dimer fab2 was well-defined in the electron density of the bound 2g12 figure 2a and b  this unique domain-swapped architecture that has been described previously in a number of high-resolution structures solved using x-ray crystallography or cryo-em 12 19 24 25 26 27  results in the creation of two secondary binding sites on either side of the vhvh interface in addition to the primary binding site at the vhvl interface 19  the cryo-em reconstruction of the fab2 fragment of 2g12 bound to the sars-cov-2 spike revealed a quaternary epitope for 2g12 in the s2 subunit of the sars-cov-2 spike with glycans from different protomers clustered together to form the 2g12 epitope figures 2-4  three s protein glycans were the primary contributors to the 2g12 binding epitope -glycans 717 and 801 from one protomer and glycan 709 from the adjacent protomer figures 3-5  the 2g12 fab2 interaction with the sars-cov-2 spike buried a 1500  2 area at its interface with the epitope composed entirely of n-linked glycans with the primary binding sites each at one of the vhvl interfaces contacting glycans at positions n709 and n717  figures 1a-1c  see figure s2 for glycan nomenclature one of the two secondary binding sites created as a result of the vhvh domain swapping contacted the glycan at positions n801  figures 3 and 4  because glycan-only epitopes are expected to be more mobile than a protein epitope we investigated the extent of disorder and motion in the position of the 2g12 bound to the s protein heterogeneous 3d classification performed on the cryo-em dataset using a mask including the 2g12 density and s2 density and excluding the s1 and the hr2 regions revealed two distinct 2g12 orientations that were related by a 9-degree angular displacement about a hinge at glycan 709  figure 5a and b  to test the importance of this residue that appeared to be a pivot point for the bound 2g12 a n709a glycan deletion mutant was expressed and purified and confirmed by nsem to contain well-dispersed and properly folded spike particles  figure s1  deletion of the glycan at position 709 resulted in abrogation of 2g12 fab binding thus confirming that glycan 709 is critical for the binding of 2g12 to the sars-cov-2 spike  figure 5c  we next tested the binding of the panel of non-domain-swapped fdg antibodies to the n709a glycan-deleted mutant in an spr assay the n709 glycan deletion either abrogated or substantially reduced the binding of the fdg iggs tested figures 5d and s11  thus suggesting a common epitope on the sars-cov-2 spike that is recognized by fdg antibodies the vh domain-swapped 2g12 has been shown to bind isolated man9 glycans and to hiv-1 env in this study we demonstrate that 2g12 can also bind the sars-cov-2 s protein  figure 6a -d 12 19  while 2g12 can recognize free mannose in its non-domain-exchanged form it only binds the hiv-1 glycan shield if domain-exchanged thus highlighting the importance of avidity for its interactions with glycan clusters 27  the structure of 2g12 bound to hiv-1 env revealed binding sites for 4 hiv-1 env glycans on 2g12 15 18  one each at the two primary binding sites at the vhvl interface and the other two at the secondary sites at the vhvh interface created as a result of domain-swapping figures 6b consistent with its glycan-only epitope 2g12 binding to a soluble hiv-1 env construct is inhibited by d-mannose  figure 6d  in the structure of 2g12 fab2 bound to the sars-cov-2 s protein only 3 of these glycan binding sites on 2g12 were occupied by spike glycans  figure 6c  and while 2g12 showed robust glycan-dependent binding to the sars-cov-2 s protein the binding was weaker than for the hiv-1 env  figure 6d  another noteworthy difference between the binding of 2g12 to hiv-1 env versus is binding to sars-cov-2 s is that on the hiv-1 env all the binding glycans come from a single gp120 monomer in the hiv-1 env trimer whereas in the sars-cov-2 s protein the binding site is quaternary and the 2g12-binding glycans at each site are contributed by two of the three protomers making this one of the first examples of a quaternary epitope spanning multiple protomers on the sars-cov-2 s protein 28  and the first in the s2 domain in this paper we demonstrated that a category of prevalent glycan-reactive antibodies termed fdg antibodies can bind to high mannose glycans on the surface of the sars-cov-2 spike protein fdg antibodies can bind to isolated high mannose glycans 17 29 as well as high mannose glycans on hiv-1 and on fungal pathogens such as candida albicans and cryptococcus neoformans 17 30  with hiv-1 infection in humans or shiv infection of macaques fdg antibodies can be affinity matured to achieve heterologous breadth while the 2g12 hiv-1 broadly neutralizing antibody has vh domain swapped architecture 12  this architecture was so unique that 2g12 was the only antibody of its kind known for a long time however we recently discovered non-domain-swapped fdg antibodies that dimerize without vh domain swapping and are capable of broad hiv-1 broad neutralization as shown for the dh851 igg clonal lineage antibodies 17  here we show in addition to 2g12 binding that vh domain swapping is also not required for fdg antibody recognition of the sars-cov-2 spike protein as demonstrated by its binding to the non-domain-swapped fdg antibodies while the hiv-1 env-reactive fdg antibodies tested in this study do not neutralize sars-cov-2 the demonstration that a common epitope for fdg antibodies exists on the surface of the sars-cov-2 spike raises the hypothesis that sars-cov-2 infection may enjoin fdg precursors and select for fdg affinity matured antibodies that evolve the capacity to neutralize sars-cov-2 via glycan recognition that fdg precursors are common in the human b cell repertoire demonstrates that they are not deleted due to immune tolerance mechanisms 17  it has been previously postulated that the 2g12 and other glycan-reactive hiv-1 antibodies are rare due to reactivity with selfglycans 31  in this regard select hiv-1 glycan reactive antibodies have been shown to react with the surface of immune cell subsets 32  whether immune tolerance mechanisms will limit the affinity maturation of fdg antibodies to potently neutralize sars-cov-2 is yet unknown these data along with the companion paper describing the category of fdg anti-hiv-1 antibodies raise the hypothesis that preexisting antibodies raised by high mannose-containing environmental antigens such as fungi or host molecules can be co-opted by hiv-1 env to become hiv-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies here we propose this same set of fdg precursor antibodies might be able to be targeted by the s protein of sars-cov-2 in the setting of covid-19 disease or vaccination and induce sars-cov-2 neutralizing antibodies it will be of interest to determine if fdg category of s-protein-reactive antibodies that can neutralize sars-cov-2 can be isolated from covid-19 infected or vaccinated individuals in this regard ng et al have demonstrated pre-existing s2 igg antibodies to sars-cov-2 s-protein likely induced by human covs that cause common cold syndromes some of these sera were able to neutralize sars-cov-2 33 however it remains unknown if such pre-existing s2-protein antibodies are glycan reactive in summary we demonstrate the reactivity of a pool of glycan-reactive antibodies with a quaternary epitope on the sars-cov-2 spike protein a key study will be to determine if fdg antibodies can be recruited by vaccination to develop into antibodies that can play a preventive role in protection from sars-cov-2 infection  the sars-cov-2 ectodomain constructs were produced and purified as described previously

calcagnile patricia forgez antonio iannelli cecilia bucci marco alifano pietro alifano pr alifano pietro pr alifano marco  the current sars covid-19 epidemic spread appears to be influenced by ethnical geographical and sex-related factors that may involve genetic susceptibility to diseases similar to sars-cov sars-cov-2 exploits angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a receptor to invade cells notably type ii alveolar epithelial cells importantly ace2 gene is highly polymorphic here we have used in silico tools to analyze the possible impact of ace2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms snps on the interaction with sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein we found that s19p common in african people and k26r common in european people were among the most diffused snps worldwide the only two snps that were able to potentially affect the interaction of ace2 with sars-cov-2 spike firedock simulations demonstrated that while s19p may decrease k26r might increase the ace2 affinity for sars-cov-2 spike this finding suggests that the s19p may genetically protect and k26r may predispose to more severe sars-cov-2 disease  in principle any new infectious agent that challenges a totally susceptible population with little or no immunity against it is able to totally infect the population causing pandemics pandemics rapidly spread affecting a large part of people causing plenty of deaths with significant social disruption and economic loss however if we look at the even worst pandemics in the human history we can realize that ethnic and geographical differences in the susceptibility to disease actually exist in spite of the infectious sources and transmission routes that are the same for all individuals 1  the current sars covid-19 a shortened form of coronavirus disease of 2019 epidemic spread appears to be similarly influenced by ethnical and geographical factors after its initial spread in china the pandemic is now progressing at an accelerating rate in western europe and the united states of america 2  in these regions the causative agent the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus -2 sars-cov-2 is spreading incredibly quickly between people due to its newness -no one on earth has immunity to sars covid-19 -and transmission route yet in the other regions of the world the kinetics of diffusion and mortality seem less impressive although the world has become highly interconnected as a result of a huge growth in trades and travels 2  a multitude of factors may concur to explain the ethnic and geographical differences in pandemic progression and severity including cultural social and economic inequality as well as health care system organization and climate also mostly considerable individual differences in genetic susceptibility to diseases may be involved 3  genomic predisposition is a major concept in modern medicine and understanding of molecular bases of genetic predisposition can help to find prevention and treatment strategies for the corresponding diseases 3  in the sars covid-19 even subtle inter-individual genetic differences may affect both the sars-cov-2 viral life cycle and the host innate and acquired immune response sars-cov-2 is an enveloped positive-stranded rna virus that replicates in the cytoplasm and uses envelope spike projections as a key to enter human airway cells 4  in coronaviruses spike glycoproteins which forms homotrimers protruding from the viral surface are a primary determinant of cell tropism pathogenesis and host interspecies transmission spike glycoproteins comprise two major functional domains an n-terminal domain s1 for binding to the host cell receptor and a c-terminal domain s2 that is responsible for fusion of the viral and cellular membranes 5  following the interaction with the host receptor internalization of viral particles into the host cells is accomplished by complex mechanisms that culminate with the activation of fusogenic activity of spike as a consequence of major conformational changes that in general may be triggered by receptor binding low ph exposure and proteolytic activation 5  in some coronaviruses spike glycoproteins are cleaved by furin a golgi-resident protease at the boundary between s1 and s2 domains and the resulting s1 and s2 subunits remain non-covalently bound in the prefusion conformation with important consequences on fusogenicity 5  notably at variance with sars-cov and other sars-like cov spike glycoproteins sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein contain a furin cleavage site at the s1s2 boundary which is cleaved during viral biogenesis 6  and may affect the major entry route of viruses into the host cell 5  productive entry of coronaviruses that harbor non-cleaved spike glycoproteins such as sars-cov rely on endosomal proteases suggesting that this entry is accomplished by hijacking the host endocytic machinery 5  indeed it has been reported that sars-cov infection is inhibited by lysomotropic agents because of the inhibition of the low-ph-activated protease cathepsin l 7  however sars-cov is also able to fuse directly to the cell membrane in the presence of relevant exogenous proteases and this entry route is believed to be much more efficient compared to the endocytic route 8  in fact proteases from the respiratory tract such as those belonging to the transmembrane proteaseserine subfamily tmprss tmprss2 or hat tmprss11d are able to induce sars-cov spike glycoprotein fusogenic activity 9101112  the first cleavage at the s1-s2 boundary r667 facilitates the second cleavage at position r797 releasing the fusogenic s2 subdomain 5  on the other hand there is also evidence that cleavage of the ace2 c-terminal segment by tmprss2 can enhance spike glycoprotein-driven viral entry 13  notably it has been very recently demonstrated that also sars-cov-2 cell entry depends on tmprss2 and is blocked by protease inhibitors 14  sars-cov-2 and respiratory syndrome corona virus sars-cov spike proteins share very high phylogenetic similarities 99 and indeed both viruses exploit the same human cell receptor namely angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 a transmembrane enzyme whose expression dominates on lung alveolar epithelial cells 6 15 16  this receptor is an 805-amino acid long captoprilinsensitive carboxypeptidase with a 17-amino acids n-terminal signal peptide and a c-terminal membrane anchor it catalyzes the cleavage of angiotensin i into angiotensin 1-9 and of angiotensin ii into the vasodilator angiotensin 1-7 thus playing a key role in systemic blood pressure homeostasis counterbalancing the vasoconstrictive action of angiotensin ii which is generated by cleavage of angiotensin i catalyzed by ace 17 although ace2 mrna is expressed ubiquitously ace2 protein expression dominates on lung alveolar epithelial cells enterocytes arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells 18  there is evidence that ace2 may serve as a chaperone for membrane trafficking of an amino acid transporter b0at1 also known as slc6a19 which mediates the uptake of neutral amino acids into intestinal cells in a sodium dependent manner 19  recently 29  resolution cryo-em structure of full-length human ace2 in complex with b0at1 was presented and structural modelling suggests that the ace2-b0at1 can bind two spike glycoproteins simultaneously 20 21  it has been hypothesized that the presence of b0at1 may block the access of tmprss2 to the cutting site on ace2 20 21  b0at1 also known as slc6a19 is expressed with high variability in normal human lung tissues as shown by analysis of data available in oncomine from the work by weiss et al 22  notably a wide range of genetic polymorphic variation characterizes the ace2 gene which maps on the x chromosome and some polymorphisms have been significantly associated with the occurrence of arterial hypertension diabetes mellitus cerebral stroke coronary artery disease heart septal wall thickness and ventricular hypertrophy 23 24 25  the association between ace2 polymorphisms and blood pressure responses to the cold pressor test led to the hypothesis that the different polymorphism distribution worldwide may be the consequence of genetic adaptation to different climatic conditions 25 26  in this study we have used a combination of in silico tools to analyze the possible impact of ace2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms snps on the interaction with sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein results seem to suggest that ace2 polymorphism can contribute to ethnic and geographical differences in sars covid-19 spreading across the world 27  6lzg sars-cov-2 spike rbd ace2 complex 28  6m0j sars-cov-2 spike rbd ace2 complex 29  6vw1 chimeric sars-covsars-cov-2 spike rbd ace2 complex 30  and

a convexity formed by two helices on the exposed surface of ace2 strong network of hbond and salt bridge interactions mediate the receptor-ligand binding global energy and several distinctive features of the 3d models with and without glycosylation are reported in supplementary   table 1  contact residues are classified as permanent predicted as binding residues in all 10 models stable predicted as binding residues in 6 or 7 out 10 models unstable predicted as binding residues in 6 or 7 out 10 models hyper-unstable 1 or 2 models out of 10 twenty-seven substitutions were predicted to influence the ace2spike interface in at least one of the different 3d pdb models fifteen and seventeen were predicted to affect the ace2b0at1 and ace2ace2 interfaces respectively some residues which are described in uniprot database httpswwwuniprotorguniprotq9byf1 as important for the interaction between spike and ace2 are permanent contact residues predicted as binding but all of these are non-polymorphic  fig 1b  in contrast polymorphic residues are stable unstable or hyper-unstable a list of 18 snps from dbsnp s19p  i21t i21v e23k a25t k26e k26r t27a e35d e35k e37k s43r e75g m82i g326e e329g g352v d355n which were predicted to affect the ace2spike interface was used for further analysis snps possibly affecting ace2 glysosylation supplementary table 1 illustrates amino acid glycosylation sites and structure of the glycosidic chains as inferred from different ace2spike complex pdb models putative polymorphic sites q60r n103h n546d n546s from dbsnp database that may affect ace2 glycosylation are also reported one of these amino acid variations n546d is rather common in south asia supplementary table 4  firedock 34 was used to estimate the effects of removal of glycosidic residues or chains on ace2 interaction with sars-cov-2 spike rbd by calculating g values the data indicated that removal of glycosidic chains results in either an increased or a decreased g values depending on the pdb model  fig 1c  in particular removal of glycosidic moieties apparently strengthened the ace2spike interaction in sars-cov spikeace2 in the 2ajf model while it appeared to weaken the interaction between sars-cov-2 spike and ace2 in the 6vw1 model in both cases the effect was mostly due to removal of the terminal beta-mannose bma fig 1c  which was predicted to decorate a glycosidic chain attached to aspartic amino acid residue at position 90 that maps in a helix that is involved in the interaction with spike as shown in fig 1d  noteworthy in the 6vw1 model bma is involved in two h-bonds and one pseudo-bond fig 1e  and these bonds are lost in non-glycosylated models in contrast in the 2ajf model the bma forms only one h-bond and after removal of terminal bma the thr-41 acquires more grads for binding thereby strengthening the interaction with ace2 these results seem to suggest that ace2 glycosylation may play a different role in modulating the interaction with sars-cov spike and sars-cov-2 spike were among the most diffused snps worldwide the only two snps that were able to potentially affect the interaction of ace2 with sars-cov spike and sars-cov-2 spike supplementary table 3  in particular the s19p snp is rather common in african people with a frequency about 03 while k26r snp is frequent in european people with a frequency about 05 supplementary table 4  firedock 34 results indicated that the s19p substitution decreased the affinity of ace2 with spike in 2ajf and 6vw1 models fig 2c  and similar results were obtained with all other models moreover this amino acid substitution seems also to affect the ace2 n-terminal cleavage site fig   2d  and when firedock 34 simulations were carried out on ace2 with the alternative cleavage site the effects of s19p snp was much more impressive fig 2 c  in contrast the k26r and the less common k26e substitutions appeared to increase the affinity of ace2 with sars-cov-2 spike 2ajf model and slightly decrease the affinity of ace2 with sars-cov spike 6vw1 and 6m17 models fig 3a  as 6vw1 was generated with a chimeric sars-covsars-cov-2 spike to support our results we performed an additional simulation by challenging the ace2 structure from 6vw1 with the spike structures that were generated by the different models fig 3b  and the results confirmed those shown in fig 3a  noteworthy the receptor-ligand interactions was much weaker in 6m17 sars-cov-2 spike rbd ace2b0at1 complex with respect to the other models confirming an inhibitory function of b0at1 however in this model at lower energy values the effects of k26re substitutions were much more evident shows that ace2 computed by using 3d pdb model 6m17 as input file is characterized by a high deformation tract that is located immediately upstream of the transmembrane domain fig 4b  whereas the c-terminal tail is characterized by high fluctuation fig 4c  suggest that the hydrophobic domain alone is highly unstable in the membrane confirming that a chaperone is required for correct topology maintenance this function was assigned to the moonlighting amino acid transporter b0at1 19  to investigate dynamic properties of ace2 globular head the trans-membrane helix and conserved domains were firstly mapped on a 3d structure then dynamut 36 simulation was carried out on ace2 by using 6wv1 pdb model without the transmembrane domain fig 5ab  results indicate that some residues of the ace2 interface which are involved in the interaction with sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein can actually fluctuate fig 5cd  dynamic properties of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov spike proteins were also investigated between the two helices and beta-sheet and between the residues of the beta-sheet are illustrated in supplementary fig 4d fig 6a supplementary fig   5 and supplementary table 7  all 197 amino acid residues that were reported as polymorphic in dbsnp were analyzed in that women are probably more prone to infection but often present a less severe disease although higher incidence of cardiac respiratory and metabolic co-morbidities are probably responsible for more severe form of infection in men estrogen-induced upregulation of ace2 expression would explain increased susceptibility of women to a less severe and often asymptomatic form of disease furthermore the ace2 gene is located on xp22 in an area where genes are reported to escape from x-inactivation further explaining higher expression in females 45 46  on the other hand it has been hypothesized that regardless of sex pharmacological antihypertensive drugs such as ace inhibitors and sartans or environmental factors no2 pollution capable of inducing an overexpression of ace2 could be responsible of increased susceptibility to infection andor greater severity 47  ace2 plays an essential role in the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system and its loss of function due to the massive binding of viral particles and internalization could constitute an essential element of the pathophysiology of pulmonary and cardiac damage during covid-19 infection 47 48  in this context it should be underlined that ace2 probably plays a dual role in the dynamic of infection and disease course while at beginning ace2 overexpression may increase the entry of the virus into the cell and its replication its consequent viral-induced loss of function results in an unopposed accumulation of angiotensin ii that further aggravates the acute lung injury response to viral infection indeed in the rodent blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system limits the acute lung injury induced by the sars-cov-1 spike protein 49  suggesting that if ace2 function is preserved because of increased baseline expression as especially seen in pre-menopausal women clinical course of infection might be less severe it has been suggested that polymorphisms in the ace2 gene could reduce the spike affinity with subsequent lower susceptibility to infection in this hypothesis their geographical  ethnical distribution could explain the strong discrepancies in infection rate andor lethality observed worldwide 47  effectively we showed by network plot and non-metric multidimensional scaling that most of the snps diffused worldwide did not affect significantly the interaction of ace2 with sars-cov-2 spike s19p was one of the rare polymorphisms able to potentially affect this interaction by lowering the affinity this polymorphism is more frequent in african populations but its diffusion 03 remains too low to explain except in minimal part the reduced death toll  this allowed the authors to predict that hamsters could be infected which was experimentally confirmed -underlining the reliability of in silico modeling-and could be subsequently at the origin of inter-animal transmission however hamsters although developing clinical signs of the infection and relative histopathological changes did not die 50  we speculate that lethality may be related to spikeace2 affinity on the other hand the lower affinity in bat could explain -besides a better immune control-why these animals are carriers without dying in the same study chan and colleagues 50 so if modestly snp-determined lower affinity between spike and ace2 does not seem to explain the differences in the distribution and lethality of the disease in humans we hypothesize that the question can be addressed in a specular way perhaps polymorphisms responsible for higher affinity can be responsible of higher severity of disease especially when very high affinity receptors are overexpressed because of the above mentioned environmental and pharmacological factors obviously underlying diseases would contribute to an even more severe course of the disease with an intense viral replication capable of infecting in turn a large number of persons including some individuals with similar ace2 polymorphisms and so on our in silico models allowed us to identify k26r and k26e as snps with a possible increase in spikeace2 affinity k26r snp is relatively frequent in european people with a frequency about 05 which would correspond to a potential target population of 2230000 people at the european union level in addition to firedock 34 35 simulations that led to predict the possible effects of s19p k26r and k26e ace2 snps dynamut 36 and encom 42 tools were used to compare dynamic features of ace2 and its polymorphic variants in order to analyze the possible indirect effects on binding interfaces of snps that are located outside these interfaces snps i468v v488a and a501t were identified as the most common snps that may produce these indirect effects in dynamic models although the precise effects of these snps on the interaction between ace2 and sars-cov-2 or sars-cov spike proteins have to be determined in more detail nevertheless it is desirable to use dynamic modeling to unmask indirect effects of snps it seems necessary to confirm in vivo that among patients with serious disease andor fatal outcome polymorphisms responsible for a very high spikeace2 affinity are more frequent than among patients with less severeasymptomatic disease or even than in general population obviously the impact of these polymorphisms on severity of outcome should be weighted by appropriate demographic and clinical factors if these differences were confirmed this would pave the way for the identification on a population scale of healthy individuals whose molecular phenotypes would be responsible for more serious disease apart from the usual social distancing measures which could be reinforced for these cases targeted drug prevention strategies could be evaluated it could be logical to assess pharmacological prophylactic interventions as proposed in categories of healthy people at particular risk of exposure such as care-givers in particular chloroquine interfering with n-terminal glycosylation of ace2 could lower its affinity for spike thus representing an interesting candidate in our in silico model we found that removal of glycosidic moieties weakened the interaction between sars-cov-2 spike and ace2 the serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate approved in japan to treat unrelated diseases has been shown to block tmprss2 activity 54 55 and is thus another interesting candidate on the other hand the identification of broader categories of people with lower risk of developing severe disease could allow a safer exit from the lock-down phase while facilitating the establishment of a faster herd immunity and waiting reliable serological tests and above all effective vaccines on the basis of our in silico study we speculate that infection and mortality are  databases 3d structures of proteins were downloaded from pdb rcsb protein data bank 56  we focused our analysis on 2ajf for sars-cov 27 57 58 was used to identity the ace2 receptor snps and to select the most diffused ones

selected pdb models were analyzed by a structural point of view using chimera software in order to identify the glycosylation sites and the secondary structures of proteins involved in the binding

used to compute the global energy scores between the native structures and the de-glycosylated models on the other side starting from the entire list of snps ssipe evoef 32 was used to identify the residues involved in the binding interfaces a second step which was carried out with ssipe ssipe 33  was aimed at estimating the effects of single snps and to generate mutant models different snps

models the transmembrane domains ace2 ace2 interface and b0at1ace2 interface are absent spike models reported in this study as ligands in a similar manner other static models from ssipe were used as models to estimate the variation in terms of free energy related to polymorphisms that map on the ace2 dimerization interface and ace2-b0at binding interface legends to figures   fig 1 3d oscillation

recently emerged pathogen to develop such probes we designed constructs incorporating an n-terminal purification tag a site-specific protease-cleavage site the probe region of interest and a cterminal sequence targeted by biotin ligase probe regions included full-length spike ectodomain as well as various subregions and we also designed mutants to eliminate recognition of the ace2 receptor yields of biotin-labeled probes from transient transfection ranged from 05 mgl for the complete ectodomain to 5 mgl for several subregions probes were characterized for antigenicity and ace2 recognition and the structure of the spike ectodomain probe was determined by cryo-electron microscopy we also characterized antibody-binding specificities and cell-sorting capabilities of the biotinylated probes altogether structure-based design coupled to efficient purification and biotinylation processes can thus enable streamlined development of sars-cov-2 spike-ectodomain probes  severe acute respiratory

longitudinally liu et al 2011 yongchen et al 2020 and to quantify elicited responses against spike and its domains as correlating such responses with neutralization should provide crucial insight into sites of spike vulnerability for antibody identification probes are used in b cell sorting to identify b cells 4 encoding antibodies capable of recognizing the spike or particular spike domains as well as characterization of antibody binding affinities through surface plasmon resonance spr or biolayer interferometry bli analyses here we describe the structure-based design of molecular probes encompassing sars-cov-2 spike and its domains we first designed a construct that allowed for tag-based purification and on-column biotinylation next we incorporated the sars-cov-2 spike ectodomain with prefusion stabilizing mutations and a c-terminal trimerization motif which we expressed biotinylated purified and characterized including by cryo-em based on the structure-defined spike-domain organization wrapp et al 2020b  we also created and characterized separate molecular probes comprising the n-terminal domain ntd the receptor-binding domain rbd and rbd with spike domain 1 rbd-sd1 we also used the structure of rbd with ace2 lan et al 2020 wang et al 2020b yan et al 2020a to define mutations that could inhibit ace2 interaction which we incorporated into mutant rbd probes with ace2-recognition ablated finally we characterized properties of the devised probes including degree of biotinylation antibody-binding specificity and use in sorting yeast cells expressing sars-cov-2 spike-binding antibodies or b cells from a covid-19 convalescent donor overall our findings demonstrate how structure-based design can be used to develop molecular probes of the sars-cov-2 spike to facilitate purification and biotinylation we devised a probe construct using the constant portion of an antibody fc as an n-terminal purification tag fc expresses and folds 5 efficiently and can be effectively captured by protein a resins jager et al 2013  to prevent intermolecular dimer formation of the fc-tag we used a single chain-fc scfc with knob-inhole feature ridgway et al 1996  in which a knob comprising a protruding tyrosine t366y was incorporated into the n-terminal-half of the fc-interface followed by a 20-residuelinker ggggs 4 and a hole comprising a recessed threonine y407t was incorporated into the c-terminal-half fc-interface kabat antibody residue numbering johnson and wu 2000   figure 1a  between the scfc and the target region of interest  figure 1b  we added a cleavage site for the human rhinovirus 3c hrv3c protease cordingley et al 1990  a highly specific protease that recognizes the sequence levlfqgp cleaving after q and leaving a gp dipeptide at the start of the target this allowed us to remove the target protein from the protein a-capture resin by protease treatment avoiding low ph elution that is known to alter the conformations of type 1 fusion machine and could potentially alter the conformation of the probe after the target sequence of interest we incorporated a 10-residue linker followed by a biotin ligase-specific sequence 10lnqq-avi this construct design enabled capture by protein a and on-column biotinylation  figure 1b  as buffers for biotinylation and hrv3c cleavage are compatible the entire process of biotinylation hrv3c cleavage and purification could in principle be accomplished with a single column though we have generally added a polishing size exclusion chromatography step to ensure size homogeneity to obtain a molecular probe of the sars-cov-2 spike we incorporated stabilizing mutations into the spike target protein residues 14 to 1208 wrapp et al 2020b  replacing 6 rrar at the s1s2 cleavage site with gsas and kv between domains hr1 and ch with pp  figure 2 and table s1  and adding the t4-phage fibritin trimerization domain foldon at the cterminus efimov et al 1994 miroshnikov et al 1998  this construct is hereafter referred to as s2p and expressed it by transient mammalian cell transfection we observed cleavage by hrv3c protease to be impeded with the glutathione-s-transferase-tagged but not the his-tagged version of the protease suggesting partial steric constraints on access to the hrv3c site overall we could obtain 05 mg of the purified s2p probe per liter cell culture after 24 h incubation at 4 c with the his-tagged hrv3c the protease-liberated probe sars-cov-2 s2p ran primarily as a single peak on sizeexclusion chromatography and a major band on sds-page  figure 3a  b appeared homogeneous by negative-stain em  figure 3c  and was recognized by the rbd-binding antibody cr3022 tian et al 2020 yuan et al 2020  we also characterized binding to three antibodies from a sars-1 convalescent donor s652 s652-109 which recognizes the rbd s652-112 which recognizes an epitope in s2 and s652-118 which recognizes the ntd all three of these antibodies bound well to the s2p probe as did the ace2 receptor but not to soluble cd4 d1d2-scd4 or antibody vrc01 wu et al 2010  which bound a control probe encompassing hiv-1 envelope glycoprotein trimer bg505 ds-sosip  figure 3d  we note that the iggs of cr3022 s652-109 s652-118 and s652-s112 showed stronger binding than corresponding antigen-binding fragment fab potentially due to avidity all of these properties suggested the sars-cov-2 s2p probe to be a good biological mimic of the prefusion sars-cov-2 spike ectodomain to provide atomic-level insight into the mimicry of spike by probe we determined the cryo-em structure of the biotinylated sars-cov-2 s2p probe figures 3e and s3 table s2  the cryo-em grids were frozen with the biotinylated sars-cov-2 s2p probe in pbs at ph 74 we observed two distinct conformations one with all three rbds in the down position displaying c3 symmetry and the other with one rbd in the up position and the other two rbds in the down position c1-symmetric we observed more particles 43 176 in the rbds down conformation which contributed to a 345  resolution map whereas the 1 rbd up state 34 223 particles 3d reconstruction achieved an overall resolution of 400  the two final atomic models were very similar to published cryo-em spike-ectodomain structures wrapp et al 2020b  the c1-symmetric structure included residues 27-1147 while residues 27-1152 were modeled for the c3-symmetric structure in both cases some regions could not be modeled because of their intrinsic flexibility five additional residues at the cterminal region 1148-1152 were visible in the reconstruction density of the rbds down structure but -similar to published structures wrapp et al 2020b  -the cterminal region of the s2 domain and in our case the rest of the probe were not sufficiently ordered to be modeled the two structures were similar except for the single rbd that was in the up position in the c1 symmetry structure excluding this single rbd the rmsd was 095  between the two probe structures for 2738 aligned c atoms the domain structure of the sars-cov-2 spike was clearly evident in our cryo-em structure and consistent with published accounts wrapp et al 2020b  based on these structures we created constructs incorporating ntd rbd and rbd-sd1 regions as 8 separate molecular probes  figure 4  transient transfection yield for each of these constructs was greater than 5 mgl both ntd and rbd eluted as a single peak on size-exclusion chromatography and exhibited a single band on sds-page  figure 5a b rbd-sd1 eluted as two peaks on sec a disulfide-bonded dimer and a monomer  figure 5a b we chose the monomeric form for further studies as there is no biological basis for a higher association receptor recognition of these domain probes was specific for each construct with ace2 binding to rbd and rbd-sd1 probes but not the ntd probe  figure 5c  left similarly antibodies cr3022 and s652-109 recognized rbd and rbd-sd1 while the s652-112 showed no binding to these two probes  figure 5c  right and antibody s652-118 recognized only the ntd probe these results indicate that the truncated domain probes folded properly and retained the native conformation as on the full-length s2p probe structural information can define not only domain boundaries but also biological interfaces based on the structure of the rbd domain with ace2 lan et al 2020 figure 6a  we designed constructs with ace2-interface residues mutated to arg to knockout ace2 affinity  figure 6b  we expressed and purified two double-arg mutants rbd-l455ra475r-avi and rbd-l455rg496r-avi and one triple-arg mutant rbd-l455ra475rg502r-avi all three eluted in a single peak on size-exclusion chromatography and exhibited a single band on sds-page  figure 6c d all three mutants completely ablated ace2 binding as designed  figure 6e  left by contrast cr3022 recognition by all three mutants was mostly retained as the epitope of cr3022 and ace2-binding site are located at different locations on rbd s652-9 rbd-l455ra475rg502r-avi was reduced but at detectable level indicating a potential epitope overlapping the g502 region similar to observations with s2p-avi rbd-avi and rbd-sd1-avi s652-109 fab recognition by all three mutants was substantially reduced  figure 6e  right our results indicated that the ace2-interface-mutant probes can be used to specifically distinguish antibodies targeting the ace2-binding site and other epitopes on the rbd to assess the molecular probes for their quality and function we first performed kinetic analyses of ace2 receptor and antibodies binding to the probes by spr  figure 7a  purified biotinylated probes were immobilized on streptavidin sensor chip surface and ace2 and antibodies were in the mobile phase ace2 bound the full-length ectodomain probe s2p with a k d of 465 nm and its affinity to the isolated rbd domain probe was somewhat lower with a k d of 121 nm we found the s2p probe to be sensitive to chip regeneration required to remove antibody so we used single-cycle kinetics to analyze the interaction with the fabs of antibodies cr3022 s652-109 s652-112 and s652-118 these all bound sars-cov-2 s2p probe with high affinity  figure 7a  top row interestingly the binding on-rates for all three of the antibodies were comparable but the off-rates varied cr3022 an antibody known to bind rbd but not neutralize the sars-cov-2 virus  bound to sars-cov-2 s2p at a lower affinity than ace2 914 vs 465 nm respectively although cr3022 had a higher affinity to the rbd probe 250 nm than to s2p 914 nm another rbd-binding non-neutralizing antibody s652-109 bound to the rbd and s2p probes at 163 and 396 nm respectively antibody s652-112 also non-neutralizing did not bind ntd or rbd probes  figure 5c  but 1 0 did bind s2p probe with a k d of 032 nm consistent with it being s2 directed an ntd-specific antibody s652-118 which does have some neutralizing capacity bound ntd and s2p probes at 174 and 146 nm respectively these results confirm that the biotinylated probes have the binding specificity for the receptor and antibodies and are functioning properly as expected we next tested the probes for sorting antigen-specific yeast cells displaying sars-cov- depending on the initial level of antigen-specific antibodies present just one or two rounds of sorting and enrichment could increase the antigen-specific cells by several orders of magnitude indicating substantial utility of the probes for cell sorting to further demonstrate the utility of the probes in sorting of human b cells we obtained overall the designed probes were found to be functional in spr and in sorting yeast cells or b cells with spike-reactive antibodies molecular probes comprising key targets such as the sars-cov-2 spike and its domains can be of broad utility for vaccine development such probes can be used to define and monitor the elicited responses and for antibody characterization such probes can serve as critical molecular tags facilitating the identification of the highly effective antibodies which could be used for passive therapy cao et al 2020 reviewed in casadevall et al 2004 graham and ambrosino 2015 walker and burton 2018  in diagnostics they can be employed to assess sera reactivity and to provide sensitive markers of infection perera et al 2020 yan et al 2020b zhao et al 2020  in pathogenesis they can assist in delineating susceptible cells that virus might infect or in tracking viral variants including those that might have selective advantages korber et al 2020  here we show how structure-based design coupled to incorporation of i a purification-tag based construct ii a sequence-specific protease and iii a sequence-specific biotin ligase enable streamlined probe development 1 2 for probe construction we used a process incorporating the cut-and-paste assembly of necessary components employing an n-terminal purification tag and sequence stretches targeted by sequence-specific enzymes the hrv3c protease and biotin ligase other sequence-specific cleavage sites such as thrombin could be incorporated to further control the presence of components surrounding the target protein of interest such protease-specific cleavage however can lead to the addition of residual amino acids at resultant n-and c-termini after protease cleavage we note in this context that an n-terminal hrv3c site appends only a dipeptide gly-pro to the n-terminus of the liberated target importantly structure of the target protein can define domain boundaries allowing for separate probes of specific domains or domain combinations the structure-based methods we describe here for probe construction may allow for the assessment of immune responses of other type 1 fusion machines we previously created hemagglutinin trimer probes with a y96f mutation whittle et al 2014 and used them to identify broadly neutralizing antibodies against influenza joyce et al 2016  we also created ebolavirus trimer probes that could be used to identify protective neutralizing antibodies against sudan outbreak ebolavirus strain gaudinski et al 2019 misasi et al 2016  and we previously used a biotinylated envelope sosip probe to identify broadly neutralizing fusion peptide-directed antibodies against hiv-1 kong et al science 2016 overall the cutand-paste structure-based design described here should be easily adapted to the streamlined development of molecular probes against not only these pathogens but also emerging pathogens as shown here for sars-cov-2  the authors declare no

tested for 180s followed by a 300s dissociation phase at 50lmin blank buffer cycles were performed throughout the experiment by injecting running buffer instead of ace2 to subtract systematic noise from the binding signal the data was processed and fit to 11 binding model using scrubber 20 biologic software to avoid the need for surface regeneration that arises with the low off-rate fabs we used single-cycle kinetics for the fab binding experiments each fab was tested at analyte concentrations 180-666nm prepared in running buffer using a three-fold dilution series binding over the spike or rbd surface or the ntd surface for s652-118 was monitored for 120s followed by a dissociation phase of 120s-900s depending on the interaction four blank buffer single cycles were performed by

model generation 3d refinements and local resolution estimation were carried out in cryosparc 214 punjani et al 2017  the 3d reconstructions were performed using c3 symmetry for the rbds down map while c1 symmetry was applied for the 1 rbd up map local refinement beta with c1 symmetry was performed on the rbds down map using a mask focused on the c-terminal 2 4 helices which included the bottom of the s2 subunit spanning from residue 1070 to the c terminus the overall resolution was 345  for the rbds down map 400  for the 1 rbd up map and 428  for the rbds down local refinement map confirmed by providing the half maps to resolve cryo em in phenix adams et al 2004  the coordinates of sars cov-2 spike ectodomain structures pdb entries 6vxx and 6vyb  were employed as initial models for fitting the cryo-em map of the rbds down and the 1 rbd up conformation respectively in both structures the rbds in the down position were modeled using the crystallographic structure of rbd in complex with cr3022 fab pdb entry 6w41 as a template for the rbd in the up position the map quality did not allow visualization of most side chains which were then modeled as poly-ala consistent with what observed for 6vyb  manual and automated model building were iteratively performed using coot emsley and cowtan 2004 and real space refinement in phenix respectively in order to accurately fit the

figure s2 and table s1 pre-sort round 1 pre-sort round 2  structural basis for the neutralization of sars-cov-2 by an antibody from a convalescent patient tiong kit f robert  donat  the covid-19 pandemic has had unprecedented health and economic impact but currently there are no approved therapies we have isolated an antibody ey6a from a late-stage covid-19 patient and show it neutralises sars-cov-2 and cross-reacts with sars-cov-1 ey6a fab binds tightly kd of 2 nm the receptor binding domain rbd of the viral spike glycoprotein and a 26 crystal structure of an rbdey6a fab complex identifies the highly conserved epitope away from the ace2 receptor binding site residues of this epitope are key to stabilising the pre-fusion spike cryo-em analyses of the pre-fusion spike incubated with ey6a fab reveal a complex of the intact trimer with three fabs bound and two further multimeric forms comprising destabilized spike attached to fab ey6a binds what is probably a major neutralising epitope making it a candidate therapeutic for covid-19 sars-cov-2 emerged in december 2019 resulting in a pandemic with an estimated 5-6  mortality rate 1  akin to sars-cov-1 the causative agent of the 2003 sars outbreak this is an enveloped beta-coronavirus with protrusions of large trimeric spike proteins receptor binding domains rbd located at the tip of these spikes facilitate host cell entry via interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 spikes are type i transmembrane glycoproteins formed from a single polypeptide which transitions into a post-fusion state via cleavage into s1 n-terminal and s2 c-terminal chains following receptor binding or trypsin treatment in the pre-fusion state the apical rbd 22 kda is folded down enshrouded by the n-terminal domain of the spike so that the receptor binding site is inaccessible until it is assumed an rbd stochastically swings upwards to present the ace2 binding site 2-5  ace2 interaction locks the rbd in the up conformation which drives  conversion to the post-fusion form where the s2 subunit engages the host membrane whilst dispensing with s1 23  neutralising human monoclonal antibodies that recognise the ace2 receptor binding site for sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 are generally not cross-reactive between the two viruses and are susceptible to escape mutation 6-10 indeed a natural mutation y495n has already been identified at this site gisaid 11  accession id epiisl429783 wienecke-baldacchino et al in contrast cr3022 derived from a sars-cov-1 patient cross-reacts strongly with sars-cov-2 methods fig 1  and has been shown to recognise a cryptic conserved epitope on the rbd distinct from the binding epitope of ace2 7 12 13 14  that this is not uncommon for sars-cov-1 antibodies is suggested by similar observations for 47d11 15  to isolate sars-cov-2 spike-reactive monoclonal antibodies we cloned antibody genes from blood-derived plasmablasts of a covid-19 patient in the convalescent phase one of these ey6a was shown by elisa to bind s1 of sars-cov-2 and cross react with sars-cov-1 fig 1  binding of ey6a to sars-cov-2-infected cells was detected by immunofluorescence  fig 1  surface plasmon resonance spr measurements for ey6a fab showed high affinity binding to immobilised sars-cov-2 rbd kd  2 nm although the value for immobilised ey6a igg was somewhat higher as derived from the kinetic data methods extended data fig 1  extended data table 1  spr studies showed that there was some interdependence of ey6a and cr3022 binding which varied depending on which component was immobilised on to the sensor chip ace2 blocking assays confirmed a somewhat asymmetric blocking effect extended data fig 2  with rbd stably expressed on 5 mdck-siat1 cells mdck-rbd ey6a did not block binding of ace2 to the rbd whereas with ace2 stably expressed on mdck-siat1 cells mdck-ace2 ey6a blocked the interaction of rbd with ace2 in this assay ey6a exhibits around 7 times stronger ace2 blocking than cr3022 13 ey6a ic50  54 nm cr3022 ic50  347 nm and has equivalent ace2 inhibition compared to ace2-fc ic50  54 nm and vhh72-fc ic50  69 nm 2  these observations are suggestive of an indirect effect by ey6a once bound to the rbd consistent with an allosteric or weak direct interaction this was supported by an spr competition assay with immobilised cr3022 which binds distant from the ace2 binding site extended data fig 2  12  this showed complete competition with ey6a for rbd binding suggesting they recognise the same or overlapping epitopes and indicated that ey6a binds the sars-cov-2 rbd more tightly two independent neutralisation tests both using live wild type sars-cov-2 showed strong neutralisation a neutralisation test for ey6a based on quantitative pcr detection of virus in the supernatant bathing infected vero e6 cells after 5 days of culture showed a 1000-fold reduction in virus signal methods extended data fig 3  indicating that it is highly neutralising this was further corroborated by a plaque reduction neutralisation test prnt at phe porton down methods and extended data table 2  using sars-cov-2 virus and ey6a which gave an nd50 of 108 gml 70 nm calculated according to grist 16   a separate prnt implementation at oxford gave a slightly higher nd50 of 30 gml consistent with a shorter incubation time of antibody with virus at lower temperature extended data fig 4  to elucidate the epitope of ey6a we determined the crystal structures of the deglycosylated sars-cov-2 rbd in complex with ey6a fab alone and in a ternary complex incorporating a nanobody nb which has been shown to compete with ace2 for data on a closely related nb see huo 2020 submitted as a crystallisation chaperone the crystals of the binary complex diffracted to 38  resolution methods extended data table 3  and those of the ternary complex to 265  the interaction between ey6a and the rbd was identical in both complexes extended data fig 5  the higher resolution ternary complex which showed that there was no interaction between ey6a and the nb permitted a full interpretation of the detailed interactions figs 2 and 3 and has been refined to give an rworkr-free of 02160262 and good stereochemistry methods extended data table 3  residues 333-527 of the rbd 1-136 and 141-224 of the heavy chain and 1-215 of the light chain of ey6a and 2-126 of the nb are well defined fig 2a b the nb recognises an epitope adjacent to and slightly overlapping the ace2 receptor binding site and binds the rbd orthogonally to ey6a fig 2bc  ey6a binds essentially the same epitope as cr3022 12 13 but with a different pose corresponding to a rotation of 73 about an axis perpendicular to the rbd 3 helix central to both epitopes fig 2de  the fab complex interface buries 564 and 361  2 of surface area for the cdrs of the heavy and light chains respectively the ey6a interaction is mediated by the cdr loops h1 h2 h3 l1 and l3 contacting predominantly 3 but also 2 and the 2-3 4-5 and 5-4 loops of the rbd fig 3 and extended data fig 6  a total of 16 residues from the heavy chain and 11 from the light chain participate in the interface together with 31 residues from the rbd for the heavy chain these form potentially 6 hydrogen bonds and a single salt bridge between d99 of h3 and k386 of the rbd and the light chain interface residues contribute an additional 6 hydrogen bonds hydrophobic interactions further increase the binding affinity fig 3  of the 31 residues involved in the interaction 21 are conserved between the cr3022 and ey6a epitopes  fig 3 and extended data fig 6  conformational changes are introduced into the rbd by binding to ey6a at the 2 residues 365-371 and 3 residues 384-388 helices extended data fig 6  similar to those seen for the cr3022 complex 12  comparison of the epitope residues for ey6a cr3022 12 and vhh-72 17 shows that there is a very substantial overlap extended data fig 6  although the bulk of the molecules extend in different directions such that vhh-72 directly blocks ace-2 binding 17  in the first pre-fusion spike structures pdb ids 6vsb 2  6vxx 6vyb 4  where residues 986 and 987 in the linker between two helices in s2 were mutated to a pro-pro sequence to prevent the conversion to the post-fusion helical conformation the rbds were found in either one up two down or all three down configuration and in both cases the epitope is inaccessible in the down position it is packed against another rbd of the trimer and the nterminal domain ntd of the neighbouring protomer a recent publication for the wild type spike identifies a more closed form 18 where the s1 portion of the spike is tightened up the structure is not yet deposited however and so we have looked at the role of the epitope in the down rather than fully closed form which will be broadly similar here the ey6a epitope packs down tightly against the s2 knuckle bearing the pro-pro mutations forming a buried protein-protein interface and making the epitope completely inaccessible we assume that in the closed form this interaction will be even tighter and is probably responsible for maintaining the spike in the pre-fusion state even when the rbd is in the up configuration the epitope remains largely inaccessible and substantial further movement of the rbd would be required to permit interaction unless more than one rbd was in the up conformation 12  to investigate how the fab insinuates itself into the spike we performed cryo-em analysis spike ectodomain was mixed with a 6-fold molar excess of ey6a fab and incubated at room temperature 21 c with an aliquot taken at 5 hours applied to cryo-em grids and frozen methods unbiased 2d class averages revealed three major particle classes with over onethird comprising a trimeric spikeey6a complex some of which are self-associated methods extended data table 4 and 121 in addition the orientations of the vh domains relative to their associated rbds differ slightly from that of the crystal structure by 5 2 and 7 respectively the quality of the density suggests that these likely samples selected from a continuous distribution extended data fig 10  the majority of the remaining particles form either a roughly 2-fold symmetric structure or a triangular association methods extended data table 4 and figs 7-11 reconstructions of these particles were anisotropic due to a preferential orientation of the particles on the grid which was somewhat mitigated by collecting data with 30 tilt to yield reconstructions at 44  and 47  respectively in the plane of the grid but significantly worse resolution perpendicular to the grid extended data fig 10  the reconstructions were sufficiently clear to allow the unambiguous fitting of ey6a-rbd complexes extended data fig 11  however the density for what we assume are the n-terminal domains is poor in both reconstructions and we did not attempt to fit a model these structures likely represent a residual well-structured fragment from the unfolding of the pre-fusion state of the spike sds page analysis shows that the spike polypeptide remains largely uncleaved extended data fig 12  the dimeric and trimeric structures are formed by different lateral associations and these also differ from that seen for similarly structurally degraded spike-cr3022 complexes 12 extended data fig 11  convalescent serum has shown promise in patients severely ill with covid-19 19 20  thus immunotherapeutics have potential for treating covid-19 even at a relatively late stage in the disease to this end it is desirable to find a combination of antibodies that neutralise the virus by different mechanisms to mitigate against immune evasion and antibody dependent enhancement one neutralisation mechanism is blocking receptor attachment we propose that attachment at the ey6a epitope is a further major neutralisation mechanism in support of this the epitope recognised by ey6a has been reported for several antibodies 12 13 21 22 and nanobodies 1723 raised against sars-cov-2 sars-cov-1 and mers for sars-cov-1 cr3022 has also been shown to neutralise synergistically with ace2 blocking antibodies 7  despite the spatial separation of the ey6a and ace2 epitopes we find some cross-talk between the two binding events the ey6a epitope is extremely unusual since it is completely inaccessible in the pre-fusion spike trimer this raises the question of what the mechanism of neutralisation might be in the pre-fusion state the ey6acr3022 epitope rests down upon the upper end of the helixturn-helix between heptad repeat 1 hr1 and the central helix ch of s2 essentially putting a lid on the spring-loaded extension of the helix which occurs on conversion to the postfusion state in the vicinity of the mutations designed to prevent conversion between the preand post-fusion conformation 24 fig 5  the residues of the epitope are crucial to these protein-protein interactions and therefore highly conserved explaining why it has to date proved impossible to generate mutations that escape binding of the antibody 712  ey6a binding to the isolated rbd is tight at 2 nm it is roughly an order of magnitude tighter than cr3022 and remarkably the binding pose on top of the spike allows three fabs to bind simultaneously around the central axis whereas cr3022 fab cannot be accommodated in line with this a major portion of spike molecules incubated for 5 h with ey6a are still in the intact pre-fusion state with only about 13 being converted simple modelling suggests that a similar packing could occur for intact antibodies extended data fig 13  in general we would expect binders at this epitope to neutralise by displacing the lid on the hr1ch turn reducing the stability of the pre-fusion state and therefore reducing the barrier to conversion to the more stable post-fusion trimer this conversion is hindered in the construct we have used by the presence of the proline mutations at the turn between the helices premature conversion would prevent later attachment to the cell and block infectivity the kinetics of this process will determine the effectiveness of the antibody in neutralisation and ultimately protection since the rbd is a relatively small domain there might also be an interplay between separate epitopes thus we saw allosteric effects between ey6a and ace2 binding and similarly vhh-72 which binds an overlapping epitope to ey6a strongly inhibits ace-2 binding by virtue of its different angle of attack 17  the reason for the cross-talk between this study was designed to isolate sars-cov-2 antigen-specific human mabs from peripheral plasmablasts in humans with natural sars-cov-2 infection to characterize the antigenic

of covid-19 spike protein with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor sanchita hati sudeep bhattacharyya  the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has led to an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease  which started in 2019 this is a member of coronaviridae family in the genus betacoronavirus which also includes sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is the functional receptor for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 to enter the host cells in particular the interaction of viral spike proteins with ace2 is a critical step in the viral replication cycle the receptor binding domain of the viral spike proteins and ace2 have several cysteine residues in this study the role of thiol-disulfide balance on the interactions between sars-covcov-2 spike proteins and ace2 was investigated using molecular dynamic simulations the study revealed that the binding affinity was significantly impaired when all the disulfide bonds of both ace2 and sars-covcov-2 spike proteins were reduced to thiol groups the impact on the binding affinity was less severe when the disulfide bridges of only one of the binding partners were reduced to thiols this computational finding provides a molecular basis for the severity of covid-19 infection due to the oxidative stress  the novel coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 or simply covid-19 is the seventh member of the coronavirus family 1 the other two viruses in this family that infect humans are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov these are positive-sense single-strand enveloped rna viruses the coronavirus particles contain four main structural proteins the spike membrane envelope and nucleocapsid 1 2 the spike protein protrudes from the envelope of the virion and consists of two subunits a receptor-binding domain rbd that interacts with the receptor proteins of host cells and a second subunit that facilitates fusion of the viral membrane into the host cell membrane recent studies showed that rbd of spike proteins of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 interact with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 ace2 belongs to the membrane-bound carboxydipeptidase family it is attached to the outer surfaces of cells and is widely distributed in the human body in particular higher expression of ace2 is observed in organs such as small intestine colon kidney and heart while ace2 expression is comparatively lower in liver and lungs 3 4 the role of oxidative stress on the binding of viral proteins on the host cell surface receptors is a relatively underexplored area of biomedical research 5 6 7 8 9 10 previous studies have indicated that the entry of viral glycoprotein is impacted by thiol-disulfide balance on the cell surface 5 7 8 9 11 12 any perturbations in the thiol-disulfide equilibrium has also been found to deter the entry of viruses into their target cells 5 the first step of the viral entry involves binding of the viral envelop protein onto a cellular receptor this is followed by endocytosis after which conformational changes of the viral protein helps the induction of the viral protein into the endosomal membrane finally releasing the viral content into the cell these conformational changes are mediated by ph changes as well as the conversion of disulfide to thiol group of the viral spike protein 7 several cell surface oxidoreductases 9 regulate the thiol-disulfide exchange responsible for conformational changes of viral proteins needed for virus entry into host cells in the backdrop of significant mortality rate for sars-cov-2 hereinafter referred to as cov-2 infection it is important to know if the thiol-disulfide balance plays any role on the binding of the spike glycoprotein on to the host cell receptor protein ace2 a recent study with the spike glycoprotein of sars-cov hereinafter referred to as cov has exhibited a complete redox insensitivity 7 despite the reduction of all disulfide bridges of cov to thiols its binding to ace2 remained unchanged 7 however this study did not probe the redox sensitivity of ace2 receptor thus in the present study we computationally investigated the redox state of both partners ace2 and covcov-2 on their binding affinities the structure of cov 1 3 and cov-2 14-15 complexed with ace2 are known and the noncovalent interactions at the protein-protein interface 16 have been reported recently using these reported structures molecular dynamics simulations and electrostatic field calculations were performed to explore the impact of thioldisulfide balance on covcov-2 and ace2 binding affinities the structural and dynamical changes due to the change in the redox states of cysteines in the interacting proteins were analyzed and their effects on binding free energies were studied the molecular basis of the binding of spike proteins to ace2 is known from x-ray crystallographic sars-cov 13 and cryo-electron microscopic sars-cov-2 16 studies the sequence alignment of cov and cov-2 spike proteins showed high sequence identity 75  indicating that their binding to ace2 receptors will be similar  fig 1  in both bound structures the rbd of cov and cov-2 is found to be complexed with ace2 fig 2  both ace2 and cov-2 possess four disulfide bridges whereas cov subunit has only two disulfide linkages table 1 and fig 2a and 2b  two large helices of ace2 form a curved surface fig 2 illustrated by the dashed curved line that interacts with the concave region of cov or cov-2 subunit structural change along the trajectory in all cases the simulation started with an equilibrated structure which was obtained after minimizing the neutralized solvated protein complex built from the experimentally determined structures the evolution of the protein structure along the md trajectory was monitored by calculating the root-mean-square deviation rmsd of each structure from the starting structure as a frame of reference following standard procedure 17 briefly during the md simulation the protein coordinates were recorded for every 10 ps interval and a root-mean-square-deviation rmsd of each frame was calculated from the average root-mean-square displacement of backbone c  atoms with respect to the initial structure then the rmsd values averaged over conformations stored during 1 ns time were plotted against the simulated time fig 3  compared to the starting structure only a moderate backbone fluctuation was noted in all protein complexes during 20 ns simulations and the maximum of rmsd was in the range of 20-38   table 2  the evolution was smooth and its stability was demonstrated by the standard deviation of the computed rmsds which was less than 03  taken together results of the simulations showed no unexpected structural deformation of the sar-covcov-2ace2 complex in both reduced thiol groups and oxidized disulfide bonds states table 2  table 3  however when all disulfides in covcov-2 as well as ace2 were reduced to thiols the binding became thermodynamically unfavorable in both cases the binding free  the study found that the reduction of all disulfides into sulfydryl groups completely impairs the binding of sars-covcov-2 spike protein to ace2 this is evident from the positive gibbs energy of binding  bind g o  obtained for both cov ox ace2 ox and cov-2 ox ace2 ox complexes when the disulfides of only ace2 were reduced to sulfydryl groups the binding becomes weaker as the the redox environment of cell surface receptors is regulated by the thiol-disulfide equilibrium in the extracellular region 12 18 this is maintained by glutathione transporters 19 a number of oxidoreductases 12 including protein disulfide isomerase 8 and several redox switches 12 under oxidative stress the extracellular environment becomes oxidation-prone resulting more disulfide formation on protein surfaces 12 therefore under severe oxidative stress the cell surface receptor ace2 and rbd of the intruding viral spike protein are likely to be present in its oxidized form having predominantly disulfide linkages this computational study shows that under oxidative stress the lack of reducing environment would result in significantly favorable binding of the viral protein on the cell surface ace2 in terms of energetics this computational study demonstrates that the oxidized form of proteins with disulfide bridges would cause a 50 kcalmol of decrease in gibbs binding free energy furthermore ace2 which the viral spike proteins latch on to is known to be a key player in the remedial of oxidative stress 20 binding of the viral protein will prevent the key catalytic function of ace2 of converting angiotensin 2 a strong activator of oxidative stress to angiotensin 1-7 thereby creating a vicious circle of enhanced viral attack in summary the present study demonstrates 1 0 that the absence of or reduced oxidative stress would have a significant beneficial effect during early stage of viral infection by preventing viral protein binding on the host cells computational setup setting up of protein systems and all structural manipulations were carried out using visual molecular dynamics vmd 21 disulfide groups were

between the ace2 and sars cov or cov-2 proteins were calculated using apbs using a standardized method of a treecode-accelerated boundary integral poisson-boltzmann equation solver tabi-pb 33 in this method the protein surface is triangulated and electrostatic surface potentials are computed the discretization of surface potentials is utilized to compute the net energy due to solvation as well as electrostatic interactions between the two protein subunits as outlined in thermodynamic scheme scheme 1 following scheme 1 the free energy of binding of the two protein fragments in water can be expressed as a sum of two components eq 1 where the  coul g represents the coulombic electrostatic interactions between the proteins occurring at the protein-protein interface scheme 1 and   solv g is the difference of the solvation energies between the complex and the corresponding free proteins however the solvation calculation used only part of the entire spike protein as well as the ace2 therefore  bind g tabi-pb was calibrated by correcting   solv g using experimentally known binding free energy of ace2cov-2 where k d is the experimental dissociation constant which is equal to 37 nm 16 the corrected free energy of the solvation using the  g corr and eq 4 the corrected binding free energy  bind g o of all protein complexes is expressed by as shown in eq 4 the combination of last two terms in eq 5 is equal to   solv g corr therefore eq 5 can be simplified as figure 1  sequence alignment generated by clustal omega 35  between the receptor-binding domain of sars-cov and

nucleocapsid protein sergio forcelloni anna benedetti maddalena dilucca andrea giansanti sapienza   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which first occurred in wuhan china in december 2019 is a novel virus that causes a severe acute respiratory disease the virus spike glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins are the main targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs to control the disease spread we herein study the structural order-disorder propensity and the rates of evolution of these two proteins to characterize their b cell and t cell epitopes previously suggested to contribute to immune response caused by sars-cov-2 infections we first analyzed the rates of evolution along the sequences of spike and nucleocapsid proteins in relation to the spatial locations of their epitopes for this purpose we compared orthologs from seven human coronaviruses sars-cov-2 sars-cov mers-cov hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 we then focus on the local structural order-disorder propensities of the protein regions where the sars-cov-2 epitopes are located we show that the vast majority of nucleocapsid protein epitopes overlap the rna-binding and dimerization domains and some of them are characterized by low rates of evolutions similarly spike protein epitopes are preferentially located in regions that are predicted to be ordered and well-conserved in correspondence of the heptad repeats 1 and 2 interestingly both the receptor-binding motif to ace2 and the fusion peptide of spike protein are characterized by high rates of evolution probably to overcome host immunity in conclusion our results provide evidence for conserved epitopes that may help to develop long-lasting broad-spectrum sars-cov-2 vaccines  coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals in humans seven coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases the first two coronaviruses human cov-229e hcov-229e and human cov-oc43 hcov-oc43 were discovered in the 1960s and cause relatively mild respiratory symptoms human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sarsr-cov was identified in 2003 and causes flu-like symptoms and atypical pneumonia in the worst cases fouchier et al 2003  the human coronavirus nl63 hcov-nl63 identified in 2004 and the human cov-hku1 hcov-hku1 described in 2005 woo et al 2005  generally cause upper respiratory disease in humans which may progress in lower respiratory infections van der hoek et al 2004  more recently the pathogenic middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov coronavirus which appeared for the first time in 2012 was identified as the sixth human coronavirus zaki et al 2012  finally a previously unknown coronavirus probably originated in baths sars-cov-2 was identified in december 2019 in wuhan china andersen et al 2020 gorbalenya et al 2020  sars-cov-2 caused an ongoing pandemic of severe pneumonia named coronavirus disease 19  which has affected over 4 million people worldwide and caused more than 300000 deaths as may 13 2020 currently no vaccine for any of the known coronaviruses has been approved coronavirus vaccines can be live attenuated inactivated viruses protein-based vaccines dna and mrna vaccines  the viral spike s glycoprotein and the nucleocapsid n protein are two of the main targets for antibody production and for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs  due to their ability to trigger a dominant and longlasting immune response the spike protein is a large type i transmembrane protein of approximately 1400 amino acids s protein is an attractive target for vaccine development as its surface expression renders it a direct target for the host immune response spike proteins assemble into trimers on the virion surface to form the distinctive crown-like structure and mediate the contact with the host cell by binding to ace2 receptor a process necessary for the virus entry s protein contains 2 subunits s1n-terminal domain responsible for receptor binding and s2 c-terminal domain responsible for the fusion the s2 subunit is the most conserved one while the s1 subunit differs even within species of the same coronaviruses the s1 contains two sub-domains n-terminal and c-terminal which are both show receptor-binding functions the s2 domain contains two heptad repeats with hydrophobic residues responsible for the formation of an helical coiled-coil structure that participate in the virus-host cell membrane fusion walls et al 2020  the nucleocapsid protein regulates the viral genome transcription replication and packaging and it is essential for viability the n protein is of potential interest for vaccine development as it is highly immunogenic and its amino acid sequence is highly conserved this protein contains two structural domains the n-terminal domain that acts as a putative rna binding domain and a c-terminal domain which acts as a dimerization domain tilocca et al 2020  t cell-responses against s and n proteins have been shown to be the most immunogenic and long lasting in sars-cov patients furthermore b-cell antibody response against s and n proteins was also reported to be effective although short-lived compared to the t cell-response the search of t-cell and b-cell epitopes  which can stimulate a specific immune response against s and n proteins represents a valuable strategy to identify targets for the development of a sars-cov-2 vaccine ahmed et al 2020  in a previous study we showed that genes encoding n and s proteins tend to evolve faster than genes encoding matrix and envelope proteins dilucca et al 2020  this result suggested that the higher divergence observed for these two genes could represent a significant barrier in the development of antiviral therapeutics against sars-cov-2 here we perform a comprehensive analysis of the position-specific rates of evolution and the order-disorder propensities of the spike glycoprotein s and the nucleocapsid protein n of sars-cov-2 thus we provide an in-silico survey of the major nucleocapsid protein and spike protein epitopes and identify a subset of them that are well-conserved among homologues of human coronaviruses that could help design broad-spectrum vaccines against sars-cov-2 the complete coding genomic sequences of sars-cov-2 was obtained from ncbi viral databases accessed as of 10may2020 in this study we also considered six human coronaviruses human cov-229e hcov-229e human cov-oc43 hcov-oc43human severe acute respiratory

investigated the evolutionary conservation and the structural disorder tendency of protein n uniprot id p0dtc9 and s uniprot id p0dtc2 which are regarded as important targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs to explore the evolutionary relationships among the proteins n and s in the seven human coronaviruses here considered the selected protein sequences were aligned by using clustal omega httpswwwebiacuktoolsmsaclustalo madeira et al 2019  this tool is a new multiple sequence alignment msa program that uses seeded guide trees and hmm profile-profile techniques to generate alignments and phylogenetic tree of divergent sequences the structural order-disorder propensity of each protein was predicted by usingiupred2a httpsiupred2aeltehu mszros et al 2018  using the option for long disordered regions briefly iupred2a is a fast robust sequence-only predictor based on an energy estimation approach that allows to identify disordered protein regions the key component of the calculations is the energy estimation matrix a 20 by 20 matrix whose elements characterize the general preference of each pair of amino acids to be in contact as derived from globular proteins this prediction associates a score to each residue in the protein sequence ranging from 0 strong propensity for an ordered structure to 1 strong propensity for a disordered structure with 05 as the cut-off to classify residues as either ordered or disordered in line with the original protocol dosztnyi et al 2005  the position-specific estimations of the structural order-disorder propensity of each residue were then averaged over a window of 21 residues and the average value was assigned to the central residue of the window taking into account the limitations on both sides of the protein sequence we calculated the rate of evolution per site of the sars-cov-2proteins n and s relative to their orthologs in other six human coronaviruses using rate4site httpsmtauacilitaymaycprate4sitehtml pupko et al 2002 rate4site calculates the evolutionary rate at each site in the msa using a probabilistic-based evolutionary model this allows taking into account the stochastic process underlying sequence evolution within protein families and the phylogenetic tree of the proteins in the family the conservation score at each site in the msa corresponds to the sites evolutionary rate the position-specific estimations of the rate of evolution of each residue were then averaged over a window of 21 residues and the average value was assigned to the central residue of the window taking into account the limitations on both sides of the protein sequence the size of the window was taken equal to that used above in section 23 the aminoacidic sequences of the nucleocapsid n protein and spike s glycoprotein from the seven human coronaviruses here considered sars-cov-2 sars-cov mers-cov hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 were compared to assess the position-specific rates of evolution of these two proteins we then investigated the relationships between the position-specific rates of evolution and the distribution of the epitopes that have previously been suggested to contribute to immune response caused by human sars-cov-2 infections for this purpose we considered the sars-cov-2b cell and t cell epitopes derived from n and s proteins by ahmed et al  ahmed et al 2020  it is worth noting that these epitopes were also considered in another study aiming to provide a molecular structural rationale of the major nucleocapsid protein epitopes for a potential role in conferring protection from sars-cov-2 infection tilocca et al 2020 we herein focused on the sars-cov-2 n and s proteins because both these two proteins are the main targets of vaccines and antiviral drugs due to their dominant and long-lasting immune response previously reported against sars-cov ahmed et al 2020 we aligned the homologous protein sequences in the seven human coronaviruses and used the resulting alignment to calculate a conservation profile by using the software rate4site pupko et al 2002 see materials and methods in fig 1  we report the profile obtained for the protein n together with the functional regionsdomains and the sars-cov-2 derived b cell and t cell epitopes on the top we report the sars-cov-2 derived b cell epitopes in blue and t cell epitopes in red by ahmed et al ahmed et al 2020  in this profile values greater or less than zero reflect a faster or a slower evolution respectively we note that both the rna-binding domain region 41-186 and the dimerization domain region 258-361 correspond to regions with values less than zero implying a higher conservation with respect to the rest of the sequence although the general trend of the conservation profile hovers around 0 there are some regions where the conservation score is greater than one indicating that these regions are likely to be under positive selection interestingly the location of some of these regions corresponds to the presence of b cell and t cell epitopes see fig s1 for the specific location and the sequences of each epitope these segments could display high amino acid variability because amino acid diversity in these regions allows the virus to evade the host immune system recognition thus we can conclude that the source of variability in this regions is likely to be the host immune response however it is worth noting the presence of epitopes in highly conserved regions spanning residues 150-200 and 250-315 which may potentially offer long-lasting protection against sars-cov-2 similarly we study the conservation profile of the protein s and the distribution of the associated epitopes fig 2  the solid blue line represent the position-specific estimations of the rate of evolution of each residue averaged over a window of 21 residues around that position taking into account the limitations on both sides of the protein sequence as a function of the distance from the start codon thin horizontal dotted line represent the threshold value above which the score is characteristic of disorder 0 for rate4site on the bottom with orange rectangles we show the receptor-binding domain and its receptor binding motif to human ace2 the fusion peptide and the two heptad repeats on the top we report the sars-cov-2 derived b cell epitopes in blue and t cell epitopes in red by ahmed et al ahmed et al 2020  on the bottom of fig 2 in endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into endosomes located within cells wang et al 2008 millet and whittaker 2018  interestingly both the receptor-binding motif to ace2 region 437-508 and the fusion peptide amino acids 788-806iyktppikdfggfnfsqil for sars-cov-2 the segment of the fusion protein that inserts to a target lipid bilayer and triggers virus-cell membrane fusion are characterized by high rates of evolution conversely heptad repeats 1 and 2which are known to play a crucial role in membrane fusion and viral entry liu et al 2004  show lower rates of evolution moreover we note that a large percentage of both b cell and t cell epitopes are located in the c-terminal region of spike protein in correspondence of the heptad repeats 1 and 2 in the s2 domain see fig s2 for details about the sequences of epitopes and their location along the sequence thus at variance with the protein n we note that spike protein epitopes are mainly located in the protein regions that are characterized by lower rates of evolution this observation suggests that the immune system has adapted to recognize slowly evolving regions of the s protein we predicted the structural order-disorder propensity proteins s and n to investigate the relationship between disordered structure and the spatial distribution of the sars-cov-2 derived b cell and t cell epitopes to estimate the structural stability of a protein from its sequence without relying on the structure we used the energy estimation approach at the core of the iupred2a disorder prediction method see materials and methods in fig 3  we show the order-disorder propensity profile for protein n together with the sars-cov-2 derived b cell and t cell epitopes the solid blue line represent the position-specific estimations of the structural order-disorder propensity of each residue averaged over a window of 21 residues around that position taking into account the limitations on both sides of the protein sequence as a function of the distance from the start codon thin horizontal dotted line represent the threshold value above which the score is characteristic of disorder 05 for iupred2a on the top we report the sars-cov-2 derived b cell epitopes in blue and t cell epitopes in red by ahmed et al ahmed et al 2020  with two orange rectangles we show the rnabinding domain and the dimerization domain the rationale to understand the results below is that the score of each residue in the protein sequence ranges from 0 strong propensity for an ordered structure to 1 strong propensity for a disordered structure in particular each residue in the sequence is classified as either ordered or disordered depending on whether the iupred2a score is  05 or  05 respectively both the rna-binding domain and the dimerization domain are predicted to be ordered in a large percentage of their residues and the vast majority of the b cell epitopes and t cell epitopes overlap these two functional regions of the protein n see also fig s3 for details although disordered protein regions are expected to be under-represented as epitopes due to their sensitive to proteolysis miti et al 2004  we note the presence of a large fraction of b-cell and t-cell epitopes in predicted disordered regions similarly we then studied the order-disorder propensity profile of s protein fig 4  order-disorder propensity profile of sars-cov-2 protein s the solid blue line represent the position-specific estimations of the structural order-disorder propensity of each residue averaged over a window of 21 residues around that position taking into account the limitations on both sides of the protein sequence as a function of the distance from the start codon thin horizontal dotted line represent the threshold value above which the score is characteristic of disorder 05 for iupred2a on the top we report the sars-cov-2 derived b cell epitopes in blue and t cell epitopes in red by ahmed et al ahmed et al 2020  with orange rectangles we show the receptor-binding domain and its receptor binding motif to human ace2 the fusion peptide and the two heptad repeats 1 and 2 the spike protein is predicted to be ordered along the whole sequence both the receptor binding domain and the fusion peptide are well-structured also in this case we observe that the vast majority of the sars-cov-2 derived b cell and t cell epitopes are located in regions displaying reduced disorder tendency see also fig s4 for details the characterization of evolutionary and structural properties of the spike-surface s glycoprotein and the nucleocapsid n protein is central for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs ahmed et al 2020  in this study we performed a systematic analysis of the rates of evolution and the structural order-disorder propensities of protein n and s in relation to the location of the sars-cov-2b cell and t cell epitopes derived from n and s proteins by ahmed et al ahmed et al 2020  identification of conserved epitopes is of strong interest to help design broad-spectrum vaccines against the present outbreak of sars-cov-2 indeed high-affinity neutralizing antibodies against conserved epitopes could provide immunity to sars-cov-2 and protection against future pandemic viruses conservation score measures the evolutionary conservation of an amino acid position in a protein based on the phylogenetic relationships observed amongst homologous sequences the rate of evolution is not constant among amino acid sites some positions evolve slowly and are commonly referred to as conserved while others evolve rapidly and are referred to as variable see fig 1 and fig 2  the rate variations correspond to different levels of purifying selection acting on these sites  the purifying selection can be the result of geometrical constraints on the folding of the protein into its 3d structure constraints at amino acid sites involved in enzymatic activity or in ligand binding or alternatively at amino acid sites that take part in protein-protein interactions here we used rate4site as a method to infer the rate of evolution of each residue in the amino acid sequences of protein n and s we then analyzed the structural properties of the protein regions where the epitopes are located by studying their order-disorder propensity we show the presence of both conserved epitopes and non-conserved epitopes in terms of rates of evolution specifically the vast majority of the sars-cov-2 derived b cell epitopes and t cell epitopes for the nucleocapsid n protein are located in the rna-binding and dimerization domains in this case we found epitopes in both ordered and disordered regions although we noted that the vast majority of epitopes are located in regions having high rates of evolution we also identified epitopes in conserved protein regions similarly we observed that the sars-cov-2 derived b cell and t cell epitopes for the spike s protein are preferentially located in protein regions that are predicted to be ordered and conserved we thus suggest that the immune targeting of these conserved epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel coronavirus finally it is worth noting that numerous sars s-protein-specific neutralizing antibodies have been reported to recognize epitopes within the receptor binding domain rbd for ace2 receptor sui et al 2014  indeed rbd immunization induced specific antibodies may block this recognition and thus effectively prevent the invasion of the virus however we showed here that both the receptor-binding motif to ace2 region 437-508 and the fusion peptide region 788-806 are characterized by high rates of evolution indicating a tendency for these two regions to mutate and therefore overcome the host immunity in conclusion our results suggest that targeting conserved regions of sars-cov-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins with less plasticity and more structural constraint should have broader utility for antibody-based immunotherapy neutralization and prevention of escape variants  an engineered stable mini-protein to plug sars-cov-2 spikes maria romano alessia ruggiero flavia squeglia rita berisio  the novel betacoronavirus sars-cov-2 is the etiological agent of the current pandemic covid-19 like other coronaviruses this novel virus relies on the surface spike glycoprotein to access the host cells mainly through the interaction of its receptor binding domain rbd with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 therefore molecular entities able to interfere with binding of the sars-cov-2 spike protein to ace2 have a great potential to inhibit viral entry starting from the available structural data on the interaction between sars-cov-2 spike protein and the host ace2 receptor we here engineered a mini-protein with the aim of creating a soluble and stable spike interactor this mini-protein which was recombinantly produced in high yields possesses a stable  helical conformation and is able to interact with the rbd of glycosylated spike protein from sars-cov-2 with nanomolar affinity as measured by microscale thermophoresis by plugging the spike protein our mini-protein constitutes a valid tool for the development of treatments against different types of coronavirus  the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 has spread widely and rapidly since it was first identified in wuhan china in december 2019 1 2 3  its associated disease covid-19 causes severe respiratory difficulties with aged patients at higher risk of mortality 1  at the time of writing over 3000000 confirmed cases and over 200000 deaths have been registered worldwide given the dramatic public health emergency there is a strong and urgent need for new antiviral agents to block human-to-human transmission and to treat infected patients like other coronaviruses sars-cov-2 makes use of a densely glycosylated spike s protein to gain access into host cells 4 5  the s protein forms homotrimers protruding from the viral envelope and binds with high affinity to the host receptor ace2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 mainly expressed by epithelial cells of the respiratory tract 6  recently another human receptor cd147 has been identified as a possible route of viral entrance again mediated by the s protein 7  cd147 is also known as basigin or emmprin and is a transmembrane glycoprotein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily involved in many processes including tumor development plasmodium invasion and virus infection 7  after attachment the human transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 cleaves and activates the s protein thus allowing sars-cov-2 to enter the host cells 8  compared to sars-cov an additional protease possibly furin is likely involved in priming of the sars-cov-2 since the s protein of sars-cov-2 contains four redundant furin cut pro-arg-arg-ala motifs which are absent in sars-cov 6  the s protein contains two subunits s1 and s2 of these s1 comprises the receptor binding domain rbd which is responsible for recognizing and binding the cell surface receptor ace2 5  being essential for infection the s protein is a promising target for antibodies and vaccines 9  indeed preventing attachment of the s protein to either the ace2 or the cd147 receptors would hamper infection at the early viral entry step based on the structural information available on the complex between the s protein and the ace2 receptor 10  we engineered a miniaturised mimic of ace2 here named spikeplug this mini-protein which we produced in high yields is highly soluble conformationally stable and displays nanomolar binding affinity with the s protein of sars-cov-2 given its properties spikeplug is a promising molecule for the development of treatments based on inhibition of viral entry for different types of coronavirus we used all available structural information on the interactions between s protein and the human ace2 receptor to design spike interactors an analysis of the structure of sars-cov-2 complex with ace2 reveals that most hydrogen bonds between protein s and ace2 involve the helix h1 residues 20-52 and the c-terminal part of helix h2 residues 56-82 of ace2 10  outside this region an important interaction between the s protein and ace2 is mediated by lys353 of ace2 indeed the presence of histidine in the place of lysine at position 353 of rat ace2 disfavours viral binding 11  starting from the region h1-h2 of ace2 as a basic scaffold for the design of a spike interactor we included a number of mutations to increase its stability and solubility and with the aim to compensate for the missing interactions mediated by residues outside helices h1 and h2 an important issue with peptide or small protein design is their conformational stability since peptides are usually not folded in solution therefore to stabilise this scaffold we included an extra helix h3 residues 91-101 which naturally caps helices h1 and h2 in the ace2 structure through a cluster of hydrophobic interactions involving val92 leu97 and leu100 of h3 phe28 leu29 phe32 of h1 and ala80 of h2 therefore holding together the two helices h1 and h2  figure 1  in addition we noticed that glu37 is important to stabilise the structure of the ace2 receptor by forming a salt bridge interaction with arg393 and a hydrogen bond with the backbone n of lys353  figure 2a  however this residue forms a weak hydrogen bond with tyr505 which is considered outside the receptor binding motif sars-cov-2 10  while it is not engaged in any contact in the complex of ace2 with rbd of the s protein of sars-cov 74 homologous to sars-cov-2 and 83 on the rbd domain 11  therefore we mutated glu37 to an arginine residue and energy minimised using gromacs 12  as shown in figure 2a  arg37 side chain can form hydrogen bonds with the main chain of gly496 of the s protein  figure 2a  as such the conformation of arg37 also stabilised by a salt bridge with asp38 mimics the interactions with the s protein mediated by lys353 of ace2  figure 2a  10 11  we further engineered this variant by including two mutations leu 91 to gln and leu 95 to gln to improve protein solubility by replacing hydrophobic with hydrophilic residues and hamper aggregation in solution in ace2 these two residues are located on the opposite side of the s-binding region and form hydrophobic interactions with the core of ace2 to stabilise it  figure 2b c their mutation to glutamine residues was also motivated by the characteristics of glutamine to further stabilize  helix structures this recombinant mini-protein here named spikeplug table 1 figure   2c  was successfully over-expressed in ecoli resulting in a high yield of 70 mg of pure protein from one litre of bacterial culture  using far-uv cd spectroscopy we observed that the spectrum of spikeplug is typical of a wellstructured fold with a high -helical content  figure 3a  with typical minima at 208 and 222 nm  figure 3  spectra also showed that folding is fully reversible with the cd spectrum after refolding fully superimposable to that recorded at 4c  figure 3a  to investigate the heat-induced changes in the protein secondary structure thermal unfolding curves were recorded by following the cd signal at 208 nm as a function of temperature thus providing a melting temperature tm of 37c  figure   3b  microscale thermophoresis mst analysis was performed to measure the binding affinity of  blocking the very first step of sars-cov-2 entry into host cells by hampering the interaction of the s protein with the cellular receptor represents a highly promising therapeutic strategy against covid-19 we focused on generating a spike interactor that resembles the human ace2 receptor as we argued that such type of molecule would act against all known coronaviruses using this receptor such as sars-cov and hcov-nl63 as well as other coronavirues possibily emerging in the future several structures of the complex between the s protein and the ace2 receptor have been recently published based on this structural information we designed a mini-protein which embeds all important spike-interacting residues of the ace2 receptor this miniaturised mimic of ace2 was properly engineered to be stable in solution and to enhance its affinity with the s protein indeed an important issue with peptide-or protein-based drugs is its conformational stability this mini-protein spikeplug presents a highly stable  helical conformation in solution and a nanomolar binding affinity to the rbd domain of glycosylated s protein from sars-cov-2 the dissociation constant kd determined here using mst 40 nm is in the same range of the affinity measured between the s protein and the ace2 receptor of 147 nm 5  we are currently designing additional variants to further improve binding affinity to the s protein our basic idea is that mimics of the host receptor have a great advantage over other drugs for several reasons first if a novel coronavirus will emerge able to infect humans through the ace2 receptor then its s proteins will be recognised and plugged by our receptor mimics  figure 5  blocking viral entry importantly spikeplug is large enough to cover most important interactions with the s protein but small enough to bind simultaneously to the three chains of the s protein thus increasing its potential to hamper interactions with the ace2 receptor  figure 5  another point we considered in our research was drug resistance as pathogens can easily mutate to escape therapeutic treatments however if the virus mutates to escape binding to spikeplug then it will also likely drop its affinity for the natural ace2 receptor resulting in suicide action the validity of such an approach has been demonstrated by the development of the antiretroviral drug enfuvirtide which blocks the action of the hiv-1 gp41 fusion protein thus preventing viral entry as for all antiviral drugs also enfuvirtide can select for resistance mutations however it has been shown that resistance to the drug comes at a serious fitness cost for the virus since it involves structural alterations in an essential component of the virus-host cell fusion complex 13  hence targeting the receptor binding domain of sars-cov-2 might also result in a high genetic barrier towards resistance last we expect spikeplug to be well tolerated because of its almost complete identity with the correspondent domains of the endogenous human protein in conclusion we believe that spikeplug is a first-in class promising lead candidate for the development of molecular targeted therapies against sars-cov-2 and other coronaviruses figure 5  cartoon representation of a plugged spike trimer the structure of the s protein pdb code 6vxx 9 is reported in magenta prune and blue the position of spikeplug molecules green surface representation on the s protein was determined upon superposition of rbd domain of our minimised spikeplug-rbd complex on the rbd domain of the entire s protein pdb code 6vxx a and b panels report side and top views respectively molecular modelling was initially performed using the cryo em structure of the sars-cov-2 s protein pdb code 6vsb 5 and the crystal structure of the complex between ace2 and the rbd domain of sars-cov s protein pdb code 2ajf 11  to complete missing regions in the cryo em structure we computed the homology model of sars-cov-2 s protein using modeller 14  and the structure 2ajf as a template while this work was in progress the crystal structure of the complex between ace2 and the rbd domain of the s protein from sars-cov-2 pdb code 6m0j was released 10  in this structure most of the interactions between the s protein and ace2 are conserved given the high sequence identity between rbd of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 84 we relied on both structures to take also possible crystal packing bias into account mutations in the basic scaffold were generated using the software coot 15  models were energy minimised using the gromacs package 12  figures were generated with pymol 16  the gene encoding spikeplug was synthesised and codon-optimised for e coli expression by geneart gene synthesis company invitrogen and subsequently sub-cloned into petm-13 vector embl germany between the ncoi and xhoi restriction sites this plasmid endows the placement of a histidine-tag at the c-terminal of the mini-protein the expression level was optimised after carrying out small scale expression screening using different e coli available strains from the screenings the recombinant protein was successfully over-expressed in ecoli bl21de3 cells resulting in a yield of 70 mg of pure protein from one litre of bacterial culture briefly an overnight starting culture of 10 ml was prepared for growth in 1l of luria bertani lb medium containing 50g l 1 kanamycin

milan italy equilibrated with binding buffer after washing with ten volumes of binding buffer the protein was eluted by adding 300 mm imidazole to the binding buffer the fractions containing the

were performed using monolith nt115 device with red detection channel nanotemper technologies munich germany recombinant spikeplug was produced in our laboratory while sars-cov-2 spike rbd was purchased from sino biological inc for mst recording the sars-cov-2 spike rbd was labelled with the fluorescent dye nt647 using the protocol suggested from the nanotemper thermophoretic experiments

coronaviruses covs are enveloped single positive stranded rna viruses that belong to the subfamily coronavirinae the genomes of covs are within the range of 26 to 32 kilobases in length and is probably the largest viral rna known cui et al 2019 fehr  perlman 2015 one of the main features of the coronavirus is that it has spike projections that stand out from the virion surface and resemble

et al 2020 of worthy interest is that the described receptors for coronaviruses depend on the lineage therefore for the alpha lineage aminopeptidase n apn has been described as their receptor while sars-cov and hcovnl63 use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as their receptor in the case of mers-cov it uses the protein cd26 as a host infecting epitelial bronchial non ciliated cells and type ii

we are facing a new pandemic nishiura et al 2020 unfortunately there is no treatment or vaccines currently the best preventive strategy to treat diseases from diverse pathogens is vaccine application vaccine application can prevent some diseases from pathogens currently one of the most common strategies is the development of peptide based vaccines immunogenic regions by using inmunoinformatics

respectively furthermore in this work we have used bioinformatics tools to find spike glycoprotein epitopes from sars-cov-2 as possible immunogenic peptides that could be used as possible vaccines in the future adequate selection of these epitopes through bioinformatics tools will help to induce a more direct and potent immune response by using this methodology we have considered some epitopes

supertypes molecules of mhci and mhcii proteins were identified the affinity of each of the peptides to hla-supertype molecules was determined employing the following servers netmhc 40 and netmhcii 23 netmhc 40 server was used to predict 10 mer peptides which could have affinity to hla supertypes of mhci proteins andreatta  nielsen 2016 whereas netmhcii 23 jensen et al 2018 was employed to predict 25mer peptides which could show affinity for hla sypertypes for mhcii proteins at the time we prepared the manuscript there was no crystal structure in protein data bank rose et al 2017 thus a three-dimensional 3d model of the protein was built employing molecular modeling techniques and the program swissmodel httpsswissmodelexpasyorg waterhouse et al 2018 from the ncbi database the primary sequence of sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein id sequence yp0097243901 was found this sequence was used to build a 3d model of the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein by using the swissmodel software in this process the crystal structure pdb 6acd of the sars-cov spike glycoprotein structure was employed as template to build the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein the sars-cov spike glycoprotein has an identity of 7647 with sars-cov-2 the predictive 3d model from the consensus sequence was named scons and represents the structure of the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein furthermore this model was validated using the software pdbsum laskowski et al 2018 additionally at the time we were preparing the manuscript two crystal structures that represent distinct conformational states of the spike glycoprotein were released the pdb id 6vyb represents the up conformation whereas pdb id 6vxx constitutes the down conformation both of the crystals showed missing fragments thus these were completed by employing molecular modeling techniques using the program modeller 923 script segmentpy webb  sali 2016 after this process the resultant models were denoted as 6vxx-fill and 6vyb-fill in the pdb database we searched for the structures of the mhc-i-ii proteins for the hla-drb10401 molecule the crystal with the pdb id 6bij for hla-a2402 we used the crystal structure pdb id 3w0w and for hla-a0301 we used the structure pdb id 2xpg whereas for the hla-drb10701 molecule we did not find a structure in the pdb so we modeled the structure by homology modeling using program modeller 923 webb  sali 2016 we employed the crystal structure pdb id 3pdo as a template with an identity of 100 for the alpha chain and an identity of 8990 for the beta chain three dimensional 3d structures of the chosen epitopes were built by employing pep-fold 3 server which employs the novo peptide structure prediction strategy based on a hidden markov model derived structural alphabet sa lamiable et al 2016 mhci-ii proteins were docked with the chosen epitopes using the cluspro 20 server vajda et al 2017 with regards to this program epitopes can be considered as ligands whereas molecules such as hla-drb10401 hla-a2402 hla-a0301 and hla-drb10701 can be determined as receptors cluspro server employs distinct algorithms which permit to evaluate millions of predictive complexes by taking account their electrostatic energy as well as desolvation parameters larkin et al 2007 subsequently some mhc-epitope complexes which show the highest affinity were selected eleven molecular dynamics simulations of the mch ii epitopes-complexes were carried out by means of the namd program and using the known inputs for namd standard md simulations phillips et al 2005 complexes were solvated and the notal charge was neutralized up to a final concentration of 015 m nacl md simulations were performed under periodic boundary conditions pbc the method of partcile-mesh ewald pme was used for the calculation of the electrostatic potential energy a no bonded cutoff of 12  switchdist of 10  and pairlistdist of 16  were implemented for these long range interactions in the equilibration step a ntv constant volume and temperature protocol was applied for the production step a ntp constant temperature and pressure ensemble was maintained with langevin thermostat 310 k and anisotropic langevin barostat 1 atm for these last two steps a integration time step of 2 femtosecond fs was used and all the bond lengths involved finally md simulations were run for about 10 ns mch ii-epitope complexes binding free energy gbind were measure of the 10 ns md simulation trajectories a stride of 10 was considered for the calculations resulting in about 100 frames for the gbind analysis the estimations were carried out employing molecular mechanics combined with poisson-boltzmann surface area mm-pbsa method mm-pbsa was applied by calculation of free energy cafe plugin liu  hou 2016 implemented to vmd program from the predicted alignment of the complete genome sequences 81 amino acid changes were identified table s02 and figure 1a and from the spike glycoprotein sarc cov2 alignment protein sequences 164 amino acid changes were found table s01 and figure 1b from these results the mutation snp d614g was identified interestingly this mutation is presumably found in the possible region of the s1-s2 binding site near the furin recognition site r667 for the cleavage of the spike glycoprotein yin 2020 the sequence id yp0097243901 was analyzed through the servers netmhc 40 server and netmhcii 23 to predict immunogenic regions which could induce antibodies against the virus sars-cov-2 both of the servers mentioned predicted more than 200 regions which could have affinity either for mhci or mhcii proteins after this process we selected 11 epitopes because these regions showed promising characteristics which include promiscuity ebrahimi et al 2019 saraav et al 2016 conservation affinity to hla-supertypes doytchinova  flower 2005 sidney et al 2008 and exposure to the surface of the trimeric spike glycoprotein liang et al 2009promiscuity and affinity revealment to hla-supertypes after submitting peptides in the above mentioned servers 11 epitopes table 1 which showed affinity to the mhci and mhcii molecules were identified as promiscuous since they were capable of binding to different molecules and universal because displayed affinity towards hla-supertype molecules thus epitopes would be efficient in different ethnic groups the conservation grade of the epitopes was also calculated from the two multiple sequence alignments described above table 2 shows the most conserved epitopes highlighting e440-464 change of the residue in y453f e627-651 change of the residue in p631s e332-370 changes of the these residues a348t and v367f and e694-715 change of the residues s704l and a706s finally the epitopes that showed more variations or higher number of reside changes are e811-848 and e136-167 figure 2 shows different trimers on which the epitopes are bound and they exhibited exposed scons consensus sequence 6vxx-fill down conformation and 6vyb-fill up conformation in the up conformation 6vyb-fill the e199-225 and e238-262 epitopes are not exposed however is the down conformation 6vxx-fill and in the model of consensus sequence scons they are exposed in the surface of the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein figure 3 it can be also depicted from the figures 3 and 4 that the other epitopes are exposed in the all the models specifically the e481-506 epitope is more exposed in chain b figure 3c colored in gray in comparison to the other conformations figure 3a b figure 4b shows down conformation 6vxx-fill in which e440-464 epitope is more exposed on this structure than in the up conformation or in the scons based on these results we suggest that conformational state of the protein could influence the exposure grade of the peptides on the surface for these studies we have focused mainly on the mhc ii molecule since it has been widely described the potential roles of mhc-ii molecules in inducing immune responses to vaccination although the mechanisms are still unknown eunju et al 2014 takenaka et al 2012 two md simulations correspond to alleles hla-drb10401 and hla-drb10701 and the others to the mhcii-epitopes complexes we carried out structural analysis of the 11 mhcii-epitopes md simulations by calculating root mean square deviation rmsd while considering only the alpha carbon atoms of the mhcii molecules along the 10 ns trajectories calculations were performed by using carma program glykos 2006 figure 10 shows that rmsd values of all the protein structures are stable after about 2 ns rmsd values of the mhcii molecules e199-225hla-drb10401 e238-262hla-drb10401 e694-715hla-drb10401 and e811-848hla-drb10401 fluctuate between 1 to 2  for the mhcii molecules e136-167hla-drb10401 e332-370hla-drb10401 and e911-939hla-drb10401 rmsd values fluctuate between 15 and 25  rmsd value for the mhcii molecule e440-464hla-drb10701 oscillates between 1 to 35  finally mhcii molecules e153-180hla-drb10401 e481-506-hla-drb10401 and e627-651hla-drb10401 show rmsd values between 15 to 3  table 5 shows the binding free energy calculations of the mhcii-epitopes complexes by using mm-pbsa method from these results it could be seen that the epitope with the lowest energy 18109855 kcalmol corresponds to e811-848hla-drb10401 other epitopes that show low binding free energy values correspond to e694-715hla-drb10401 e332-370hla-drb10401 and e136-167hla-drb10401 these epitopes are marked in bold in the table currently immunoinformatics represents a useful interface between computer science and experimental immunology in this work we have used computational tools which permitted to find spike glycoprotein epitopes from sars-cov-2 as possible immunogenic peptides in the process of selection of these epitopes we considered different epitope features such as promiscuity conservation and exposure to the surface of the trimeric spike glycoprotein table 1 lists e136-167 e199-225 e238-262 e332-370 e481-506 e627-651 e153-180 e694-715 and e911-939 epitopes which show affinity to the hla-drb10401 allele according to docking studies such alleles are expressed in different ethnic groups amerindian arab asian austronesina black caucausoid jew kurd melanesian polynesian mixed mixed ancestry north african-spain mulatto mextizo micronesian oriental and persian liu et al 2010 additionally the e136-167 e199-225 e332-370 e440-464 e481-506 e627-651 e153-180 e694-715 and e911-939 peptides display affinity towards the hla-a2402 allele which is expressed in different ethnic groups amerindian arab asian aboriginal austronesina caucausoid hispanic jew melanesian mextizo mixed mixed ancestry mulatto oriental persian polynesian y siberian gonzalez-galarza et al 2011 overall all these peptides mentioned in table 1 were identified as promiscuous and showed affinity to hla-supertype these two properties of peptides are important because they can be recognized by different proteins of both the mchi and mhcii families providing greater capacity to generate antibodies in addition as mentioned in the databases where the frequency of the alleles has been investigated we found that the hla-drb10401 and hla-a2401 alleles are distributed in different ethnic groups therefore these peptides could be used as a base to design new vaccines for different human races or ethnic groups which are important because sars-cov-2 is not only in china but also distributed in different countries from this immunoinformatics analysis it could be depicted that the e332-370 e627-651 e440-464 and e694-715 epitopes are potential candidates as immunogenic agents because they show four important features promiscuity universality hla-supertype exposure to the trimer and are conservation grade interestingly the mentioned epitopes also showed the lowest binding free energies from the mm-pbsa calculations indicating also structural stability of the mhcii-epitope complexes the e440-464 peptide showed not only the mentioned features before but also a region that can be crucial for the receptor interaction of the target cells which could also initiate the infection process additionally structural alignments have demonstrated that the amino acid leu455 is crucial in the affinity of spike glycoprotein for ace2 protein wan et al 2020 on the other hand epitope 694-715 is located near the peptide fusion ou et al 2016 in the trimeric spike glycoprotein therefore it could be recognized by antibodies and this could prevent structural changes that are necessary for the virus to fuse to the endosome membrane and release genome for cycle replication we suggest that the proposed epitopes by using immunoiformatics tools could interfere in functional regions of the spike glycoprotein which are crucial in the steps of the virus infection from in silico studies we identified that epitopes e332-370 e627-651 e440-464 and e694-715 accomplish essential features such as promiscuity conservation grade exposure and universality and also they also form stable complexes with mhcii molecule as observed from the binding free energy calculations mm-pbsa on the whole these characteristics could provide higher probability to generate a specific immune response the epitope e440-464 is located in the functional region of the spike glycoprotein while the epitope e694-715 is located near this region on the other hand the antibodies that could be potentially generated by the epitope e440-464 could recognize the rbm region while avoiding the formation of the spike glycoprotein-ace2 complex and this could result in the interruption of the virus entry in a host cell finally these immunoiformatics tools permitted us to identify epitopes that can be used as potential vaccines in pandemic events this work proposed a set of epitopes that could be synthesized and assayed in animal model to determine their potential to induce immunogenic responses and even used for future applications such as the design of new epitope vaccines against the sars-cov-2 which could also represent a preventive strategy to stop the pandemic worldwide  targeting the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein prefusion conformation virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulations applied to the identification of potential fusion inhibitors alice romeo federico iacovelli mattia falconi   the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic has rapidly become an international public health threat which is causing an inconceivable loss of lives and a severe socio-economic instability worldwide the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 identified as the causal agent of this disease is an enveloped single-stranded positive-sense rna virus assigned to the species severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus genus betacoronavirus family coronaviridae and was firstly identified from a cluster of pneumonia cases in wuhan china on december 2019 zhou et al 2020 on january 30 2020 the world health organization who declared the coronavirus epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern who raised the threat of the coronavirus epidemic to the world level to very high on february 28 and on march 11 the covid-19 was officially declared a worldwide pandemic on march 13 who stated that europe is becoming the new epicentre of the pandemic the main cause of the uncontainable spread of this disease is the lack of specific antiviral medications though several groups in the world are making a lot of effort in trying to speed up this research although the production of vaccines could be the most powerful weapon against sars-cov-2 spread and invasion it will take quite a long time to develop and clinically test their safety thus as an emergency measure it would be fundamental to identify or develop antiviral molecules not only to treat the covid-19 but also to prevent its further transmission although no antiviral treatment has yet been approved several therapeutic approaches have been proposed based on the administration of molecules developed for treating other diseases as the combination of lopinavirritonavir chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine kupferschmidt and cohen 2020 preclinical studies also suggested that remdesivir a rna polymerase inhibitor developed against ebola could be effective for both prophylaxis and therapy of human coronavirus infections as suggested by results obtained testing its activity in a rhesus macaque model of mers-cov infection de wit et al 2020 finally an investigation led by the istituto nazionale tumori fondazione pascale di napoli is focused on the use of tocilizumab a humanized igg1 monoclonal antibody directed against the il-6 receptor and commonly used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis to prevent the cytokine storm syndrome caused by the sars-cov-2 infection clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04317092 available from httpsclinicaltrialsgovct2shownct04317092 however there is no certain evidence that these treatments can be conclusive and that they may also be available for developing countries it has been confirmed that the sars-cov-2 initiates its entry into host cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 cell receptor via the receptor binding domain rbd of its trimeric spike s glycoprotein triggering a mechanism which mediates the fusion of host and viral membranes zhou et al 2020 the s protein is a trimeric class i fusion protein that exists in a metastable prefusion conformation which undergoes substantial structural rearrangements to fuse the viral membrane with the host cell membrane bosch et al 2003 li 2016 the s protein further subdivides into two distinct functional subunits the s1 subunit is involved in host cell receptor recognition while the s2 mediates viral fusion to host cells fusion process is triggered when the s1 subunit binds to a specific cell receptor receptor binding destabilizes the prefusion trimer resulting in shedding of the s1 subunit and transition of the s2 subunit to a stable postfusion conformation the latter is characterized by the assembly of its heptad repeats 1 hr1 and 2 hr2 regions into a 6-helix bundle structure that allows viral fusion and entry into host cells bosch et al 2003 walls et al 2017 the complete three-dimensional structure of the human sars-cov-2 spike in postfusion conformation has not yet been published but recently wrapp and coworkers wrapp et al 2020 determined the first 35  resolution cryo-electron microscopy cryo-em structure of the sars-cov-2 s trimer in the prefusion conformation the study provides biophysical and structural evidences that the sars-cov-2 s protein binds the ace2 receptor with higher affinity than does the closely related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov s protein additionally the authors tested several published sars-cov rbd-specific monoclonal antibodies and found no appreciable binding to the sars-cov-2 s protein suggesting that antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the rbds of these two viruses wrapp et al 2020 because of the crucial function of the s protein in the sars-cov-2 infection process this structural component could represent a target for antibody or small-molecules mediated neutralization and characterization of the prefusion s structure allowed to get atomic-level information essential to guide the design and development of novel therapeutic molecules previous data obtained for the human respiratory syncytial virus hrsv f protein a class i viral fusion glycoprotein sharing structural similarities with most of the lower respiratory tract viruses fusion glycoproteins indicated that newly generated escape mutations for evaluated small-molecule fusion inhibitors were clustered inside the central cavity of the f protein in prefusion conformation battles and mclellan 2019 lopes et al 2020 yan et al 2014 crystallographic studies later confirmed that these small-molecules bind within the central cavity contacting from two to three lobes of the trimeric binding pocket and interacting with residues of the fusion peptide and the second heptad repeat battles et al 2016 functional studies involving soluble f proteins samuel et al 2015 and membrane-bound f proteins battles et al 2016 further demonstrated that the evaluated small-molecules act as antagonists that prevent the protein transition to the postfusion conformation to date all known small-molecule fusion inhibitors bind in the same pocket and have the same mechanism of action devincenzo et al 2014 stevens et al 2018 these data suggest that also in the case of sars-cov-2 targeting the central cavity of the spike glycoprotein in prefusion conformation could be a valuable approach for hindering its prefusion to postfusion transition and consequently virus entry into host cells in this paper we have used the sars-cov-2 s trimer structure in prefusion conformation wrapp et al 2020 to perform a drug repurposing with the aim to find and suggest small-molecule fusion inhibitors for clinical use repurposing of drugs already approved or still in clinical trial represents an accelerated route for drug discovery because existing drugs have already established clinical and pharmacokinetic data we have carried out a virtual screening vs simulation using 8770 fda drugs extracted from the drugbank database httpswwwdrugbankca wishart et al 2018 the structure of the spike glycoprotein wrapp et al 2020 has been completed using modeling techniques and used for the identification of available compounds strongly interacting inside its inner cavity fig 1
 furthermore the stability of selected protein-drug complexes has been tested using classical molecular dynamics md simulations and the free energy of interaction of these molecules has been finely evaluated through the molecular mechanics energies combined with generalized born and surface area continuum solvation mmgbsa method and per-residue energy decomposition analysis genheden and ryde 2015 finally alignments between the sequence of the spike glycoprotein used in our study and sequences of all betacoronavirus spike glycoproteins reported in the genbank database clark et al 2016 including recently deposited sequences of different sars-cov-2 isolates have been carried out to evaluate the presence of variability within the protein region analyzed by this simulation research as a result considering the available scientific information a selected set of drugs has been suggested as sars-cov-2 fusion inhibitors with the hypothesis that the use of these compounds can be extended also to other related viruses cryo-em structure of the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein in prefusion conformation has been obtained from the pdb database pdb id 6vsb wrapp et al 2020 the trimer structure composed by three identical monomers named a b c has been completed modeling non-terminal missing loops using the swiss-model web-server waterhouse et al 2018 the modeling procedure mainly involved regions of the s1 subunit of the glycoprotein residues 67-78 96-98 143-155 177-186 247-260 329-334 444-448 455-490 501-502 621-639 673-686 of monomer a residues 67-80 142-154 177-186 210-216 243-262

s2 subunit residues 812-814 and 829-852 of monomers a b and c although the modeled regions were not close to the central cavity of the spike glycoprotein they have been rebuilt since it is not possible to accurately simulate and analyze a protein with missing parts using classical md simulation in fact during the simulation the protein would be subjected to unnatural fluctuations misleading the subsequent analyses a drug library containing 8770 compounds in mol2 format has been extracted from the drugbank database v 515 wishart et al 2018 httpswwwdrugbankca spike glycoprotein receptor and drug structure files have been converted into pdbqt format using the preparereceptor4py and the prepareligand4py tools of the mgltools software morris et al 2009 sanner 1999 seven drug structures have been excluded from the analysis since prepareligand could not generate their pdbqt files while other eight structures containing si atoms have been excluded due to the absence of force-field parameters the 8755 molecular docking simulations have been performed using an in-house parallelized version of the autodock vina 112 program trott and olson 2010 one docking simulation including ten docking runs has been carried out for each drug for each docking simulation the autodock vina program selects 10 binding poses representing the cluster centroids of all the different conformations

drugs have been generated using the antechamber module of the ambertools 19 package case et al 2018 and the general amber force field wang et al 2004 each spike glycoprotein complexed with three drugs has been inserted into a rectangular box of tip3p water molecules jorgensen et al 1983 setting a minimum distance of 120  from the box sides and neutralizing the solution with 015 moll of nacl ions in order to remove unfavourable interactions structures have been subjected to four minimization cycles each composed by 500 steps of steepest descent minimization followed by 1500 steps of conjugated gradient minimization a starting restraint of 200 kcalmol-1 -2 has been imposed on protein and ligand atoms and subsequently reduced and removed in the last minimization cycle systems were gradually heated from 0 to 300 k in a nvt ensemble over a period of 20 ns using the langevin thermostat goga et al 2012 imposing a starting restraint of 05 kcalmol-1 -2 on each protein and ligand atom which was decreased every 500 ps in order to slowly relax the system the systems were simulated in an isobaric-isothermal npt ensemble for 20 ns imposing a pressure of 10 atm using the langevin barostat aoki et al 2004 and fixing the temperature at 300 k covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms have been constrained using the shake algorithm ryckaert et al 1977 a production run of 30 ns has been performed for both systems with a timestep of 20 fs using the pmemdcuda module of the amber 18 software case et al 2018 the pme method was used for calculating long-range interactions while a cut-off of 90  has been set for short-range interactions darden et al 1993 system coordinates have been saved every 1000 steps rmsd analysis for the spike glycoprotein has been performed using the rms module of the

implemented in the amber18 software case et al 2018 on 3 nodes of the enea hpc cluster cresco6 ponti et al 2014 decomposition analysis has been performed on residues surrounding each drug located within a cut-off distance of 12  a virtual screening vs analysis drug repurposing of a set of 8755 structures of approved experimental and investigational drugs extracted from the drugbank database httpswwwdrugbankca wishart et al 2018 has been performed in order to find compounds that entering the inner cavity of the protein and blocking the hr1 conformational changes could act as spike glycoprotein fusion inhibitors using an in-house parallelized version of the autodock vina software trott and olson 2010 we evaluated the binding affinity of each drug for one of the three hr1 internal regions of the spike glycoprotein residues 897-920 the ten top-ranking compounds obtained from the vs analysis are reported in fig 2
and in table s1 interestingly three of these compounds have already been reported as possible antiviral agents targeting different types of enveloped viruses in particular the compounds 31h-phthalocyanine from here simply referred to as phthalocyanine and hypericin represent the two most appealing molecules in fact they show a significantly high affinity for the hr1 region and additionally hypericin and different phthalocyanine derivates have been already shown to prevent human immunodeficiency virus hiv infections interfering with the surface glycoprotein gp120 binding and fusion to the host cell franois et al 2009 lenard et al 1993 vzorov et al 2003 furthermore these two compounds or their derivatives also possess different antiviral activities towards other viral species as it will be discussed below in section 35 and hypericin has also been recently shown to inhibit the infectious bronchitis virus ibv an avian coronavirus acting through a mechanism involving inhibition of the virus-induced cellular apoptosis chen et al 2019b considering the trimeric structure of the spike glycoprotein we propose an inhibitory mechanism by which at least three drug molecules could enter and arrange inside the inner cavity binding the three hr1 internal regions wrapp et al 2020 the concurrent binding of three molecules could generate a strong steric hindrance inside the pocket preventing the conformational changes of the hr1 regions and hence the formation of the 6-helix bundle stabilizing the postfusion conformation walls et al 2017 in order to evaluate our hypothesis starting from the top ranking complexes obtained from the vs procedure we evaluated the binding affinity of two phthalocyanine or two hypericin molecules for the other two hr1 internal regions of the spike glycoprotein the average binding energies obtained for each molecule have been reported in table 1
 it can be observed that even if the binding affinities of the second and third bound molecules are lower than that obtained for the first due to the reduction in the conformational space inside the pocket they still remain particularly suitable for establishing valuable interactions both compounds contact a high number of residues within the pocket both from the hr1 internal regions and from upward and downward regions of the spike creating a connection between the hr1s and surrounding regions of the inner cavity fig 3
 phthalocyanine molecules arrange in a symmetric orientation fig 3 a-b facing the inner cavity of the pocket and establishing 11 hydrophobic interactions with surrounding residues in particular stacking interactions are settled between the isoindole groups of phthalocyanines and aromatic side-chains of the protein fig 3 b the three phthalocyanines can also set up hydrophobic interactions within themselves increasing the stability of the multiple complex fig 3 b-c hypericin molecules on the other hand bind to the hr1 regions in an alternate orientation fig 3 d-e establishing 7 hydrophobic interactions and 4 hydrogen bonds with the surrounding residues the hypericin molecules also set up contacts within themselves interacting through hydrogen bonds established between their hydroxyl groups fig 3 f however the higher affinity showed by phthalocyanine for the hr1 regions suggests that hydrophobic interactions can drive the formation of extremely favourable associations inside the pocket hypothesis supported by the presence of many aromatic moieties in all the compounds showing higher affinity for this internal cavity fig 2 it is difficult to hypothesize what the location of these compounds might be in an intermediate or postfusion form of the spike since complete postfusion structures are still not available from a recently published incomplete structure of the spike postfusion core pdb id 6lxt xia et al 2020 we found that only three of the key cavity residues involved in interactions with the compounds are present in the spike 6-helix bundle structure residues 912-914 nevertheless since our aim was to prevent virus entry in an earlier phase directly blocking the prefusion conformation potential interactions of the drugs with structures in conformational progress were not taken into further consideration since they would not add details to improve our model to further assess the affinity of the top two drugs for the spike pocket we performed 30 ns md simulations of both multiple docking complexes to accurately evaluate through the mmgbsa method genheden and ryde 2015 the interaction energies between the docked compounds and the receptor mmgbsa analysis confirmed the high affinity of both drugs for the binding pocket table 2
 in particular mmgbsa results highlighted that van der waals electrostatic and non-polar solvation energy terms favourably contribute to the binding energy the van der waals term accounting the strength of nonpolar interactions derived from the binding of the drugs to the pocket gives the highest contribution to the binding energy showing extremely negative values on the other hand highly positive polar solvation energy terms have been obtained in all the calculations this term representing the energy associated with dissolving these drugs in the solvent depict their preference for a hydrophobic environment highly favourable van der waals energies have been obtained for the phthalocyanine drugs while electrostatic interactions with surrounding residues play only a marginal role indicating that the massive hydrophobic contacts established by these molecules within the pocket are crucial for the stability of the complex on the other hand electrostatic interactions are important for the stability of the hypericin drugs although the hydrophobic interactions still play a significant role for their binding affinity hydrogen bond analysis performed for both the simulations further supports these results showing that the presence of the three hypericin drugs leads to an increase in the hydrogen bonds network established within the pocket in fact these molecules can stably set up from 1 to 4 hydrogen bonds fig s1 lower panel mainly with residues p1090 r1091 and e1092 of the monomer a n907 e1092 and q1113 of the monomer b and p1090 of the monomer c as well as with themselves conversely polar interactions play only a minor role in phthalocyanine drugs binding to the pocket since none of the three molecules established valuable hydrogen bonds during the simulation time fig s1 upper panel per-residue energy decomposition analysis genheden and ryde 2015 was also carried out for each drug to highlight the independent contribution of specific pocket residues to the binding and to dynamically describe the compounds interactions within the pocket table s2 the analysis showed that the drugs can establish from 9 to 15 medium- to high-affinity contacts with residues belonging to the internal hr1 regions residues 897-920 and with other surrounding residues inside the cavity this evidence further supports the hypothesis that the drugs may act like anchors between surrounding internal regions moreover the results also confirmed that the interactions established by the three phthalocyanines are mostly hydrophobic while the three hypericin molecules can also set up valuable electrostatic interactions with most of the contacted residues although the hydrophobic contribution is still much stronger the md and mmgbsa results mainly confirmed the interaction patterns described by the molecular docking simulations indicating that highly stable binding poses have been obtained these molecules improve the number of hydrophobic interactions inside the pocket creating a non-polar network and the establishment of strong steric hindrance within the cavity that may likely hamper the subsequent conformational changes leading to the formation of the postfusion conformation of the spike interestingly during the simulations it has been also observed that the first and second docked phthalocyanine or hypericin molecules maintain their starting binding poses interacting with the hr1 internal regions of the monomer a and b while the third added phthalocyanine or hypericin compound moves towards the centre of the pocket simultaneously contacting all the hr1 internal regions fig 4
a-b the arrangement of these compounds is expected to create a hard impairment to the motion of the hr1 regions further contributing to the stabilization of the spike prefusion conformation in conclusion all these results sustain the hypothesis that the presence of these drugs inside the pocket may block the hr1 regions preventing the huge spike conformational changes that permit the sars-cov-2 entry into the target cells the ranking of the compounds obtained through the vs procedure table s1 has been reweighted based on the literature retrieved for each compound table 3
 and fig s2 and s3 in particular we conceived a scoring method which allowed us to evaluate a reformulated ranking based on a the obtained binding energies b known side effects and physiological effects of compounds and c previously identified antiviral properties briefly side effects have been classified using a score ranging between -5 and 5 named sse in particular compounds interfering with other drugs have been penalized compounds with mild side effects have been assigned a positive score and compounds with unknown effects received a score of 0 physiological effects of the compounds also received a score ranging between -5 and 5 named spe according to which compounds with unfavourable physiological activities were negatively weighted compounds with predicted or evaluated antiviral or anti-inflammatory activity received a value between 1 and 5 and compounds with unknown or neutral physiological activities obtained a value of 0 drugs previously evaluated in clinical trials have been positively weighted computing the clinical trial score named strials as followsstrials  51xnat01xnt01xnphaseii 02xnphaseiii 03xnphaseivwhere nat indicates the number of clinical trials where the compound has been evaluated for its antiviral action nt the number of trials with other clinical targets and nphaseii nphaseiii nphaseiv the number of trial in each experimental phase as reported on the us national library of medicine nlm clinical trials database httpsclinicaltrialsgov a maximum value of 05 10 and 15 was allowed for the last three terms of the equation to balance the ranking and a maximum value of 10 for the overall strials score compounds with antiviral properties even if directed towards viruses andor targets different from the one chosen in our research have been highly favoured in the final score this property can add an extra value to the drugs assuming that they could affect other sars-cov-2 targets in addition to the spike cavity furthermore in particular in the case of phthalocyanine the antiviral activity was experimentally observed but the specific viral targets were not completely understood vzorov et al 2003 so the drug interaction within the inner cavity could provide a reason for this still undefined antiviral activity for the santiviral calculation compounds with known antiviral activity have been assigned a score of 10 while compounds for which this activity was only hypothesized but not experimentally assessed were assigned a score of 5 if the compound showed activity on enveloped viruses a 5 was added to the score finally according to confirmed data a score between 10 and 20 was given to those compounds for which the reported inhibitory mechanism involved the binding of spike glycoproteins andor the inhibition of virus fusion to host cells for each compound the average binding energy named sbinding has been calculated from three repeated molecular docking simulations and summed to the obtained score finally a 2 weight was added to the best 5 compounds obtained from the vs procedure named svs as reported in table s1 concluding the final score for each compound was computed using the following equationsfinalssespestrialssantiviralsbindingsvs
 the reweighted ranking reported in table 3 shows that four top ranking compounds ie phthalocyanine hypericin tmc-647055 and quarfloxin evaluated combining of all the analyzed data represent the most promising drugs and are suggested as a possible treatment against sars-cov-2 infection to highlight the clinical potential of the four selected compounds we provide a brief description for each drug strictly focused on known or hypothesized antiviral properties the listed effects although not directed towards sars-cov-2 and not representing an evidence of interaction with this virus may contribute to the general antiviral properties of the drug cocktail - phthalocyanines are dye molecules commonly used for optical electrical and catalytic applications sorokin 2013 wright 2001 different phthalocyanine derivatives have also been evaluated for their efficacy as virucidal agents and as fusion inhibitors franois et al 2009 vzorov et al 2003 2007 given their photochemical properties pththalocyanines also showed a phototoxic virucidal action on different enveloped viruses korneev et al 2019 nikolaeva-glomb et al 2017 smetana et al 1994 concerning the safety of this molecule no cell toxicity has been reported and an in vivo study on mice showed a good toxicity profile and no tissue damage styczynski et al 2015 - hypericin is a natural naphthodiantrone compound mainly derived from plants of the genus hypericum particularly hypericum perforatum st johns wort and widely known for its antidepressant activity jendelovsk et al 2016 karioti and bilia 2010 hypericin has also shown specific antiviral activity on a wide variety of enveloped viruses mainly related on the viral assembly and release inhibition kubin et al 2005 hypericin was also reported to act as a fusion inhibitor for different viruses kubin et al 2005 lenard et al 1993 stevenson and lenard 1993 hypericin and h perforatum extracts have also been shown to inhibit the cellular apoptosis induced by the avian coronavirus ibv and to attenuate the pathological injuries caused by this virus in the trachea and kidney of chickens chen et al 2019a chen et al 2019b side effects reported for st johns wort treatment include skin rash dizziness headache tiredness and difficult sleep - tmc-647055 is a macrocyclic indole non-nucleoside inhibitor of the hepatitis c virus hcv ns5b rna-dependent rna polymerase cummings et al 2014 devogelaere et al 2012 vendeville et al 2012 clinical trials have highlighted its promising antiviral properties against hcv as well as its good safety and tolerability profiles with limited toxicity and off-target activities in combination with the tmc435 protease inhibitor also known as simeprevir and ritonavir showed an increased antiviral activity against hcv and was well tolerated by patients bourgeois et al 2017 vijgen et al 2017 - quarfloxin also known as cx-3543 or itarnafloxin a fluoroquinolone derivative is a g-quadruplex-binding compound which has been clinically evaluated for its antineoplastic activity balasubramanian et al 2011 drygin et al 2009 this compound was well tolerated by patients during clinical trials and showed a good toxicity profile but after reaching phase ii it was discarded for poor bioavailability at the action site balasubramanian et al 2011 other g-quadruplex binding compounds were shown to exert antiviral activity against different enveloped viruses and to interact with g-quadruplex regions of viral genomes lavezzo et al 2018 ruggiero and richter 2018 for this reason we hypothesize that quarfloxin could possess a potential antiviral activity despite to our knowledge it has not yet been evaluated the inhibition mechanism hypothesized in this research strictly depends on the interactions established between the compounds and the hr1 internal residues of the pocket this mechanism may be consequently extended to other members of the betacoronavirus family depending on the sequence identity found in this region with this purpose the sequence of the spike glycoprotein structure used in this study has been first checked against the high number of sars-cov-2 sequences deposited until april 1 2020 in the genbank protein database clark et al 2016 we retrieved all complete sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein protein sequences from the ncbi virus portal hatcher et al 2017 and performed a similarity search using the blast-p suite of blast altschul et al 1990 selecting only the region spanning from the fusion peptide to the hr1 region residues from 811 to 984 in the cryo-em structure the 174-residues long query sequence showed 100 identity towards 345 of the 360 evaluated spike-glycoprotein target sequences indicating that this region is highly conserved between all the sars-cov-2 isolates sequenced to date among 15 entries with an identity lower than 100 two sequences showed only one residue mismatch located outside of the internal cavity while the others contained undetermined residues that do not match to the query explaining the lower identity percentage obtained we further evaluated whether this region was also conserved among other betacoronaviruses ncbitxid694002 the submitted query sequence showed a 100 identity with the spike glycoprotein sequence of the bat coronavirus ratg13 ncbitxid2709072 genbank accession qhr633002 identity values ranging from about 88 to 95 were observed for different sars-cov isolates and other animal sars-like betacoronaviruses for a total of 148 different entries in particular the internal hr1 region the specific target of our compounds is completely conserved among all these 148 hit sequences except for one residue mismatch observed within the sequence of the palm civet sars coronavirus a013 ncbitxid305402 genbank accession aav979851 on the other hand the spike glycoprotein sequences deposited for the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov another concerning human pathogen only showed about 52 to 57 sequence identity against the fusion peptide-hr1 sars-cov-2 region and an identity between about 58 and 67 for the internal hr1 region alone these results show that our selected compounds targeting the highly conserved internal regions of the spike could represent a broad-spectrum treatment active against all sars-cov-2 currently isolated variants overcoming the concerning mutation potential of this virus furthermore the high sequence and structural identities between the sars-cov and the sars-cov-2 spike glycoproteins suggest that these compounds may represent an efficient therapeutic strategy also towards the sars-cov virus finally the low sequence identity evaluated between the sars-cov-2 internal hr1 region and that of other members of the betacoronavirus family do not completely exclude the possibility that these drugs may also effectively bind within these non-identical pockets since the different pattern of interactions that would be established could perhaps enhance the binding of the compounds instead of preventing it the results obtained in this research support the hypothesis that the presence of specific compounds inside the inner cavity of the spike glycoprotein in prefusion conformation fig 1 could block the hr1 regions preventing the conformational changes that allow sars-cov-2 entry into target cells in fact the hr1 regions are actively involved in the compounds recognition as confirmed by the mmgbsa per-residue decomposition analysis table s2 in addition our hypothesized inhibitory mechanism may explain the unknown mechanisms by which phthalocyanine derivatives have been experimentally shown to induce viral fusion inhibition with no impairment in spike glycoproteins binding to cell receptors vzorov et al 2003 we suggest that an optimal therapeutic strategy could involve the simultaneous administration of a cocktail of inhibitors that could boost up each individual antiviral property based on the reweighted virtual screening results table 3 obtained though the evaluation of the previous literature we propose the concurrent administration of four compounds phthalocyanine hypericin tmc-647055 and quarfloxin to be used as a possible antiviral treatment against sars-cov-2 their already observed antiviral properties although mostly assessed on different targets and viruses add an important value to these drugs since they could interfere with sars-cov-2 infection also with other mechanisms independent from the hypothesized inhibition of spike glycoprotein fusion to the host cell to evaluate the feasibility of the simultaneous localization of different compounds inside the pocket we also performed sequential molecular docking simulations of these four selected drugs fig s4 results showed that the compounds could fit together inside the pocket still maintaining a high affinity for the hr1 regions and the overall binding pocket where evaluated interaction energies are phthalocyanine -167 hypericin -137 tmc-647055 -127 and quarfloxin -116 kcalmol furthermore the results obtained carrying out the sequence alignments strongly indicate that the hypothesized inhibition mechanism described in this work may be extended to all the identified sars-cov-2 isolates to the closely related sars-cov and potentially even to other known members of the betacoronavirus family concluding the hypotheses arising from this simulation research can represent a valid contribution to the international community for the modulation of the sars-cov-2 infection and could also be useful against other enveloped viruses sharing the same infection mechanism mf fi and ar conceived designed and wrote the paper ar and fi performed the calculations and analyzed the data

define a recurrent anti-sars-cov-2 antibody class derived from vh3-53vh3-66 and similarity to a sars-cov vh3-30 antibody providing criteria for evaluating vaccine-elicited antibodies  neutralizing antibody responses to coronaviruses mainly target the receptor-binding domain rbd of the trimeric spike here we characterized polyclonal iggs and fabs from covid-19 convalescent individuals for recognition of coronavirus spikes plasma iggs differed in their focus on rbd epitopes recognition of alpha-and beta-coronaviruses and contributions of avidity to increased bindingneutralization of iggs over fabs using electron microscopy we examined specificities of polyclonal plasma fabs revealing recognition of both s1 a and rbd epitopes on sars-cov-2 spike moreover a 34 cryo-em structure of a neutralizing monoclonal fab-spike complex revealed an epitope that blocks ace2 receptor binding modeling based on these structures suggested different potentials for inter-spike crosslinking by iggs on viruses and that characterized iggs would not be affected by identified a newly-emergent betacoronavirus sars-cov-2 resulted in a pandemic in 2020 causing the respiratory disease covid-19 wu et al 2020b  sars-cov-2 is the third zoonotic betacoronavirus to infect humans this century following sars-cov and mers-cov middle east respiratory syndrome infections in 2003 and 2012  respectively de wit et al 2016  in addition four globally-distributed human coronaviruses hcov-oc43 hcov-hku1 betacoronaviruses and hcov-nl63 hcov-229e alphacoronaviruses contribute to 15-30 of common colds fung and liu 2019 the neutralizing antibody response to coronaviruses is primarily directed against the trimeric spike glycoprotein s on the viral membrane envelope which serves as the machinery to fuse the viral and host cell membranes fung and liu 2019  coronavirus s proteins contain three copies of an s1 subunit comprising the s1 a through s1 d domains which mediates attachment to target cells and three copies of an s2 subunit which contains the fusion peptide and functions in membrane fusion  figure 1a  neutralizing antibody responses against sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov s proteins often target the receptor-binding domain rbd also called the s1 b domain hwang et al 2006 pinto et al 2020 prabakaran et al 2006 reguera et al 2012 rockx et al 2008 walls et al 2020 walls et al 2019 widjaja et al 2019 wrapp and mclellan 2019 wrapp et al 2020  the s proteins of sars-cov-2 1273 residues strain wuhan-hu-1 and sars-cov 1255 residues strain urbani share 775 amino acid sequence identity while the s proteins of sars-cov-2 and mers-cov 1353 residues strain emc2012 are more distantly related sharing only 31 identity figure 1b c  sequence identities between sars-cov-2 and common cold coronavirus s proteins are even lower varying between 25 and 30 phylogenetic analyses confirm that sars-cov-2 and sars-cov are more closely related to each other than to other human coronaviruses  figure 1b  the rbds1 b domains show varying degrees of sequence identity ranging from 13 sars-cov-2 and hcov-nl63 to 74 here we analyzed purified igg and fabs from the plasmas of 10 covid-19 convalescent individuals robbiani et al 2020 for binding to trimeric s and monomeric rbds1 b domains of six human coronaviruses and for neutralization of sars-cov-2 pseudoviruses to better understand recognition by polyclonal antibodies we further characterized plasma fabs from two individuals using negative-stain electron microscopy polyclonal epitope mapping nsempem showing that the polyclonal landscape includes antibodies that target epitopes in both sars-cov-2 s1 a and rbd domains in addition we solved a 34  single-particle cryo-em structure of an s trimer bound to a neutralizing monoclonal antibody mab which targeted an epitope on an up rbd that overlapped with the rbd epitope identified by nsempem and would sterically block ace2 receptor binding the epitopes we found represent binding classes defined by distinct vh gene segments suggesting that these recurring classes are commonly represented in neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov-2 and providing criteria for evaluating neutralizing antibodies raised by infection or vaccination finally we used modeling to suggest that distinct binding orientations allow for differential avidity effects demonstrating the potential for interspike crosslinking that would increase effective affinities for some anti-s iggs on sars-cov-2 virions coronaviruses and effects of avidity convalescent plasma samples were collected from individuals who had recovered from covid-19 at rockefeller university hospital robbiani et al 2020  we isolated polyclonal iggs from 10 convalescent plasmas figure 2  most of which had relatively high neutralizing titers robbiani et al 2020  and compared binding of their iggs to purified s proteins from sars-cov-2 sars-cov mers-cov hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 and hcov-229e  figure s1  by elisa figure 3  figure s2  purified plasma iggs recognized s proteins from all coronaviruses evaluated with weaker binding observed for most samples to mers-cov  figure 3c  and common cold coronavirus s proteins  figure 3d -f amongst the plasmas cov21 cov57 and cov107 chosen for further analysis based on elisa ec 50 values and neutralization potencies robbiani et al 2020  iggs from cov21 and cov57 showed the strongest binding to the s proteins from sars-cov-2 and sars-cov with only the elisas against rbd or s1 b domain for two of the common cold coronavirus s proteins showed the strongest binding to sars-cov-2 rbd for cov21 followed by cov57 and then cov107 iggs with the proportion of rbd versus s binding from cov21 cov72 and cov47 suggesting that the majority of the igg responses from these plasmas were focused on the rbd often a target of neutralizing antibodies in coronavirus infections hwang et al 2006 pinto et al 2020 prabakaran et al 2006 reguera et al 2012 rockx et al 2008 walls et al 2020 walls et al 2019 widjaja et al 2019 wrapp et al 2020  the only appreciable reactivity with sars-cov or mers-cov rbds was exhibited by cov21 igg which bound to sars-cov rbd  figure 3b  although we cannot determine whether the same iggs are binding all three s proteins the potential for cross-reactive binding of sars-cov antibodies was demonstrated for a mab that was isolated from a sars-infected individual which was shown to recognize sars-cov and sars-cov-2 rbds pinto et al 2020  no reactivity with mers-cov rbd was observed for any of the polyclonal iggs  figure 3c  for most of the plasma iggs binding to the rbd was substantially weaker than binding to the counterpart s protein with the exception of the strong cov21 and cov72 responses to the sars-cov-2 rbd most of the plasma iggs exhibited stronger binding to the common cold s1 b rbds than to the counterpart s protein trimers  figure 3d -f to assess the degree to which cross-reactive recognition contributed to binding of plasma iggs to rbds1 b domains we repeated the elisas before and after adsorption with sars-cov-2 rbd-coupled resin or a control resin for five plasma igg samples  figure s3  as a positive control purified plasma iggs incubated with the rbd resin showed little or no sars-cov-2 rbd binding  figure s3a  binding to sars-cov rbd was also reduced for the iggs remaining after sars-cov-2 rbd adsorption  figure s3b  suggesting cross-reactive recognition consistent with the 78 sequence conservation and structural homology of sars-cov-2 rbd and sars-cov rbd  by contrast adsorption of plasma iggs with sars-cov-2 rbd resins had only a modest effect on binding to common cold coronavirus rbds  figure s3d -f consistent with little to no cross-reactive antibody recognition likely due to the low conservation between the sars-cov-2 rbd and mild coronavirus rbds premkumar et al 2020  we also note that iggs from control plasmas collected from individuals not exposed to sars-cov-2 exhibited binding to common cold coronavirus rbds that was not affected by sars-cov-2 rbd adsorption  figure s3  again consistent with pre-exposure to mild coronaviruses rather than cross-reactivity with sars-cov-2 rbd taken together these results suggest i the binding strengths and patterns of different coronavirus s protein recognition were diverse across covid-19 individual plasma samples ii convalescent covid-19 individuals harbor antibodies to the sars-cov-2 s protein and to a lesser extent the rbds1 b  as well as reactivity to other coronaviruses which likely represents previous exposure to common cold viruses iii polyclonal iggs from individual plasma samples that bind to s proteins from mers-cov andor sars-cov may display cross-reactive recognition since the plasma donors were unlikely to have been infected with either of these coronaviruses and iv compared to the cov57 and cov107 plasmas the cov21 igg response had a higher proportion of iggs that recognized the sars-cov-2 rbd we further evaluated the degree to which avidity effects contributed to the strength of binding of plasma iggs to s proteins and rbds by comparing the binding of bivalent polyclonal iggs to binding of monovalent fabs prepared by proteolytic cleavage of purified polyclonal iggs  figure   2a -c differential effects were evident in igg to fab comparisons most of the sars-cov-2 anti-s response was reduced by at least 50 in the case of monovalent fabs for all plasmas except for cov57  figure 3a  recognition of the other coronavirus s proteins was also diminished for fabs compared to intact iggs  figure 3b -f for the three plasma iggs that were further evaluated the largest relative differences in igg versus fab binding to sars-cov-2 s protein was observed for cov21 and cov107 the igg versus fab binding difference for cov57 was less pronounced  figure 3a  notably the sars-cov-2 s protein and rbd elisas showed that a higher fraction of the cov21 plasma iggs were rbd-specific compared with the cov57 iggs  figure 3a b robbiani et al 2020  in summary the elisa data indicate that iggs in plasma samples differ in their degree of focus upon epitopes within the s protein rbds1 b domain their relative amounts of reactivity with sars-cov mers-cov and common cold coronaviruses and the extent to which avidity effects contribute to the tighter binding of polyclonal bivalent iggs as compared with monovalent fabs plasma iggs are more potent neutralizers than plasma fabs to investigate whether the bivalent architecture or larger size of iggs compared with fabs resulted in increased neutralization potencies we measured the potencies of purified plasma iggs and fabs using in vitro neutralization assays  figure 3g  sars-cov-2 pseudoviruses were constructed as described robbiani et al 2020  and the concentrations of iggs and fabs at which 50 neutralization was achieved ic 50 values were calculated all tested plasma iggs neutralized pseudoviruses at lower molar concentrations than their fab counterparts with increased potencies ranging from 6-to 100-fold  figure 3h  the increased potency of the iggs compared to fabs was statistically significant p  00003 even when accounting for two fabs per igg we conclude that bivalent iggs more effectively neutralize sars-cov-2 pseudoviruses than monovalent fabs we next used negative stain polyclonal electron microscopy nsempem bianchi et al 2018 nogal et al 2020 to map epitopes from fabs isolated from convalescent covid-19 plasma iggs onto the sars-cov-2 s protein in this method fabs that bind to an antigenic target are separated from non-binding fabs in a polyclonal mixture by size-exclusion chromatography sec fab-antigen complexes are imaged by em and 2d3d classification are used to identify predominant epitopes bianchi et al 2018 nogal et al 2020 figure 2a-c  typically fabs are incubated at 1000-2000x above ec 50 values calculated from binding assays bianchi et al 2018 nogal et al 2020  for most covid-19 plasmas anti-s fab ec 50 values were estimated to be 50 gml  figure s2  purified polyclonal fabs from cov21 and cov57 plasmas which had approximate ec 50 s ranging from 20-50 gml showed stable binding by sec after incubation with sars-cov-2 s trimers  figure 2d  and 2d class averages showed evidence of bound fabs  figure s4  by contrast purified fabs from cov107 ec 50 50 gml showed no evidence of binding to s by sec data not shown or in a 3d reconstruction  figure 4a  in order to verify that extra densities in nsempem 3d reconstructions corresponded to bound fabs we first solved a 3d reconstruction of sars-cov-2 s alone revealing the expected low resolution structure of the closed prefusion s trimer  figure 4a  a 3d reconstruction of cov21 fabs complexed with s showed recognizable density for the s trimer with a single extending density at the apex of the trimer corresponding to a fab or mixture of fabs bound to a similar epitope  figure 4a  the density could be fit to an s trimer with a fab bound to a single rbd in an up position using coordinates from sars-cov-2 s trimer structures wrapp et al 2020  consistent with elisa results mapping the cov21 response to the sars-cov-2 rbd  figure 3a  the complex structure and the position of the cov21 fabs closely resembled a structure of sars-cov s bound to a fab from the s230 mab isolated from a sars-cov-infected individual whose epitope overlaps with the binding site for the ace2 receptor  figure 4b  interestingly s230 binding was shown to functionally mimic ace2 binding allowing cleavage of the sars-cov s protein to promote fusogenic conformational rearrangements  while the cov21 fab complex reconstruction showed occupancy for one s-protomer with an rbd in an up position  figure   4a  cov21 fabs might also bind analogous to the s230 fab-sars-cov s complex where classes of s trimer structures were found with two upone down and three up rbd conformations  moreover antibody s230 whose binding orientation resembles the position observed in the cov21 fabs reconstruction  figure 4b  appears to be a member of a class of recurrent anti-sars mabs it belongs to a set of 10 non-clonally-related vh3-30-derived mabs isolated from an individual infected with sars-cov which represented 40 of the clones isolated from this individual pinto et al 2020  notably these clones contained similar 9 amino acid light chain complementarity determining 3 cdrl3 sequences consensus sequence mqgthwppt suggesting that this group of mabs has a common mode of binding partially dependent on vh3-30-derived features rbd residues 473 and 475 contacted by the antibody heavy chain in the s230 fab-sars-cov structure are conserved between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 and these residues are in the vicinity of antibody heavy chain residues n57 and k58 the only vh gene segments encoding the n57k58 pair are vh3-30 vh3-30-3 and vh3-33 lefranc et al 2015  when mabs were isolated after single b cell sorting using sars-cov-also found in sequenced antibodies from five other donor plasmas robbiani et al 2020  the similarity in binding orientation of cov21 fabs with s230  figure 4b  suggests that cov21 fabs may be members of the s230 recurrent class consistent with this hypothesis 38 of 127 sequenced antibodies from the cov21 donor were derived from vh3-30 or from the closelyrelated vh3-30-3 or vh3-33 vh gene segments robbiani et al 2020  the cov57 fabs-s structure also showed recognizable density for both the s trimer and a single bound fabs  figure 4c  however in this complex the s trimer appeared closed with no rbds in an up position and the fab density was not associated with an rbd but rather with one of the s1 a subunits in the complex the fabs pointed downwards ie towards the viral membrane rather that upwards away from the viral membrane as seen for the cov21 fabs the cov57 fabs density was in the vicinity of loops on the s1 a domain that were disordered in sars-cov-2 s trimer structures wrapp et al 2020  such flexibility could explain the diffuse nature of the cov57 fabs density in this reconstruction interestingly characterization of cov57 neutralization showed less correlation with rbdspecific antibodies relative to cov21 robbiani et al 2020  consistent with the elisas  figure   3a  and nsempem characterizations  figure 4c  reported here this suggests that targeting s1 regions outside of the rbd may represent alternative modes for potent neutralization of sars-cov-2 as found for neutralizing antibodies isolated after vaccination against mers-cov in nonhuman primates  fabs-s reconstruction although we could not resolve densities for bound fabs in the cov107-s nsempem reconstruction  figure 4a  rbd-binding mabs isolated from the cov107 individual were potently neutralizing robbiani et al 2020  we determined a 34  singleparticle cryo-em structure of the complex of one such antibody c105 ic 50 for neutralization of sars-cov-2 pseudovirus  261 ngml robbiani et al 2020 bound to the sars-cov-2 s protein using a 18  crystal structure of the unbound c105 fab for fitting to the cryo-em density  figure 5  figures s5 s6  tables s1s2 we found two populations of c105 fab-s complexes an asymmetric s trimer with two up rbds each of which was complexed with a fab state 1 34  resolution and a symmetric trimer with three rbds in the same up conformation again with each rbd complexed with a fab state 2 37  resolution  figure 5a  a subset of complexes in the cryo-em structure of the s230 mab bound to sars-cov s trimer were also found with three up rbds bound to three fabs  although in that structure as in the c105-s structure the majority of complexes had their rbds in a two up one down configuration the c105-rbd interfaces were similar across the five examples in the state 1 and state 2 complex structures  figure s5  thus we describe the interface for one of the fab-rbd complexes in the state 1 complex in which the resolution at the interface was improved by performing a focused local refinement punjani et al 2017 on the c105 fab-rbd portion of the complex  figure s5  the c105 fab uses its three heavy chain complementarity determining regions cdrh1 cdrh2 and cdrh3 and two of its light chain cdrs cdrl1 and cdrl3 to rest against the receptor-binding ridge of the rbd  figure 5b c the majority of the antibody contacts are made by cdrh1 cdrh2 and cdrl1 with cdrh3 and cdrl3 playing minor roles the c105 epitope overlaps with the cov21 epitope defined by nsempem which also rests against the receptor-binding ridge in the rbd although the fabs in the cov21 reconstruction are predicted to adopt a different angle of approach  figure 5d  interestingly the c105-rbd interaction closely resembles the rbd interaction of another covid-19 donor-derived neutralizing mab b38  figure 5e  as reported in a recent fab-rbd crystal structure wu et al 2020c  the heavy chains of both b38 and c105 are derived from the vh3-53 gene segment whereas the light chain gene segments differ kv1-9 for b38 wu et al 2020c and lv2-8 for c105 robbiani et al 2020  accordingly the cdrh1 and cdrh2 loops of both neutralizing antibodies share similar conformations and contribute more to the antibody-rbd interface than their cdrh3 loops  figure 5b e the common epitope of c105 and b38 overlaps with the binding site for ace2  figure 5f  rationalizing their potent neutralizing activities robbiani et al 2020 wu et al 2020c  given that cov21 was one of the more potent neutralizing plasmas of the 149 that were collected robbiani et al 2020  the overlap in the c105b38 neutralizing epitope with the nsempemdefined predominant cov21 epitope suggests that recognition of the cov21 epitope by s230like antibodies would also be neutralizing 2 rbd neutralizing antibodies the shared binding mode of c105 and b38 both vh3-53derived mabs defines a recurrent class of anti-sars-cov-2 mabs among a large set n534 of cloned anti-sars-cov-2 mabs against the rbd those derived from the vh3-53 and vh3-66 gene segments were over-represented robbiani et al 2020  other studies have also reported anti-sars-cov-2 mabs derived from these genes brouwer et al 2020 cao et al 2020 chi et al 2020 ju et al 2020 rogers et al 2020 seydoux et al 2020 wu et al 2020c zost et al 2020  the vh3-53 and vh3-66 vh gene segments encode v regions that differ in only one amino acid position which is not in a cdr thus they are functionally equivalent in terms of vgene-determined mab classes when grouping vh3-53 and vh3-66 over-representation of vh3-53vh3-66-derived mabs is significant p  0035 a notable characteristic of the vh3-53vh3-66-derived subset 75 mabs within the 534 anti-rbd mabs robbiani et al 2020  was a bias towards shorter cdrh3s as defined by imgt lefranc et al 2015  75 had lengths between 9 and 12 residues which is significantly different from the human antibody repertoire and from the entire set of 534 anti-sars-cov-2 rbd mabs two sample kolmogorov-smirnov test p  0017  figure s7a  superposition of vh domains from unrelated antibodies with longer cdrh3s suggests that rbd residues 456-457 andor 484-493 present a steric barrier limiting the cdrh3 loop lengths that are compatible with this binding orientation  figure s7b  a recent report identified a clonallyunrelated group of vh3-53vh3-66 anti-sars-cov-2 mabs based on cdrh3 sequence similarity to the anti-sars-cov mab m396 derived from vh1-69  the structure of a sars-cov rdb complex with m396 pdb code 2dd8 prabakaran et al 2006 shows that mab m396 does not share the b38c105 binding mode we suggest that the key feature of the vh3-53vh3-66 mabs identified based on cdrh3 sequence similarity to m396 is their cdrh3 length 11 residues and that these mabs will share the c105b38 binding mode not the m396 binding mode identified s mutations are unlikely to affect epitopes revealed by nsempem and singleparticle cryo-em a recent report suggested that a mutation in the s protein d614g increases transmissibility of sars-cov-2 korber et al 2020  and it has been speculated that this substitution or others found in different s protein sequences could affect antibody recognition in cryo-em structures of the prefusion s trimer wrapp et al 2020 and in our c105-s complex  figure 5  s protein residue d614 is located in s1 d  where it makes contact with an adjacent protomer to address whether the d614g mutation could affect binding of antibodies we marked the location of the d614 residues and other residues that were reported to mutate korber et al 2020 on the cov21 and cov57 nsempem reconstructions  figure   6a b and on the c105-s cryo-em structure  figure 6c  the rbd-binding cov21 fabs and the c105 fab are distant from residue d614  figure 6a c therefore if the cov21 reconstruction reflects the predominant epitope in the cov21 plasma it is unlikely that antibodies elicited in the cov21 individual would be sensitive to the d614g substitution indeed in the absence of large conformational changes all anti-rbd antibodies including c105 robbiani et al 2020 and b38 wu et al 2020c  would be unaffected by this substitution mutations in the sars-cov-2 rbd identified by genome sequencing also include n439k v483a and v367f tables s3s4  but the affected residues are not within the epitopes of the cov21 fabs  figure 6a b or the c105 fab  figure 6c  and residue 483 is disordered in unliganded s protein structures wrapp et al 2020  the predominant epitope in the cov57 fabs is closer to s protein d614 but this residue appears to be outside of the binding interface in addition mutations in the s1 a domain identified by genome sequencing tables s3s4 reside outside of the cov57 fabs epitope  figure 6a b thus in the absence of major conformational changes induced by mutation the observed substitutions particularly the d614g mutation are unlikely to affect antibodies elicited in the cov21 or cov57 individuals or in rbd-binding mabs such as c105 s protein epitopes offer different possibilities for avidity effects during igg and receptor binding iggs contain two identical antigen-binding fabs thus offering the opportunity to bind pathogens with regularly-spaced antigenic sites using avidity effects either through inter-spike crosslinking binding the same epitope on adjacent spikes andor intra-spike crosslinking binding the same epitope on identical subunits of a single multimeric spike klein and bjorkman 2010  to address whether inter-spike crosslinking by anti-sars-cov-2 iggs could occur we modeled adjacent s proteins on a virion membrane assuming a minimum inter-spike separation distance of 15 nm as observed from cryo-electron tomography analyses of sars-cov and other coronaviruses neuman et al 2011  by including a bound fab on each s trimer in the position of the cov21 fabs from the nsempem reconstruction we addressed whether the fabs from a single igg could bind to two adjacent s trimers the modeling predicts that inter-spike crosslinking could occur for the cov21 epitope  figure 7a  by contrast the downward-pointing fabs in the cov57-s nsempem reconstruction appear unlikely to participate in inter-spike crosslinking by an igg due to the fab orientations being unable to accommodate an fc in a position that could join two fabs  figure 7a  these predictions are consistent with elisa results demonstrating diminished binding for cov21 fabs compared with their igg counterparts but less pronounced differences for the fab versus igg comparison for cov57  figure 2  we also used modeling to predict whether avidity effects could influence the interaction between ace2 an integral membrane protein that dimerizes on the target cell surface  with viral s trimers starting with a cryo-em structure of dimeric full-length ace2 associated with the integral membrane protein b o at1 bound to monomeric sars-cov-2 rbds  we modeled bound s trimers from a cryo-em structure of sars-cov s trimers with two rbds in an up position kirchdoerfer et al 2018  assuming there are adjacent ace2-b o at1 complexes in the host cell membrane the modeling predicts that inter-spike crosslinking is possible  figure 7b  in addition intra-spike cross-linking could also occur if the rbds in a two upone down s trimer can each rotate  figure 7c  thus if s trimers can indeed crosslink adjacent ace2 receptors or bind as a single trimer to both ace2 subunits in an ace2 dimer they could take advantage of avidity effects to bind more tightly than predicted from affinity measurements involving the interactions of monomeric ace2 ectodomains to monomeric coronavirus rbds walls et al 2020 wrapp et al 2020  the possibility of avidity effects during the interactions of sars-cov-2 s with ace2 dimers has implications for interpretation of pseudovirus assays to measure coronavirus infectivity in the presence and absence of potential inhibitors such as antibodies in vitro neutralization assays for sars-cov-2 include pseudoviruses based on hiv lentiviral particles crawford et al 2020 ou et al 2020 robbiani et al 2020 wu et al 2020a  murine leukemia virus retroviral particles pinto et al 2020 quinlan et al 2020  and vesicular stomatitis virus hoffmann et al 2020 nie et al 2020 xiong et al 2020  each of these pseudovirus types could potentially incorporate different numbers of spikes in which case the overall spike density would alter sensitivity to antibody avidity in any case the effects of avidity on igg binding to a tethered antigen are a complicated mixture of intrinsic fab-antigen affinity kinetics input concentration and incubation time klein and bjorkman 2010 wu et al 2005  thus neutralization potencies of some but not all iggs could be affected in in vitro neutralization assays in addition when considering therapeutic applications of convalescent plasma or purified antibodies avidity effects would be difficult to predict given uncertainties about antibody concentrations viral titers and potentially different s trimer spacings and densities on infectious virions our results provide a glimpse into diverse antibody responses in neutralizing plasmas from donors who recovered from covid-19 we characterized polyclonal plasma iggs that exhibited different degrees of cross-reactive binding between s proteins from sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov and showed that the plasma iggs also included non-cross-reactive antibodies against common cold virus rbds by mapping sars-cov-2 s epitopes targeted by convalescent plasma iggs we not only observed the expected targeting of the s protein rbd but also discovered an s1 a epitope outside of the rbd which may represent an alternative binding site for neutralizing antibodies the rbd-binding fabs from cov21 plasma resembled binding of s230 a vh3-30 mab isolated from a sars-cov patient that blocks ace2 receptor binding rockx et al 2008  we found another type of ace2 receptor-blocking anti-sars-cov-2 antibody in our analysis of a neutralizing mab derived from the cov107 individual in a 34 cryo-em structure of the sars-cov-2 s protein bound to the c105 mab we observed an epitope on the rbd that overlapped with the binding site for cov21 fabs and closely resembled the binding of b38 another mab isolated from a covid-19 patient wu et al 2020c  like c105 b38 is also derived from the vh3-53 vh gene segment our structural studies support the hypothesis that recurrent classes of anti-sars-cov-2 neutralizing antibodies derived from the vh3-53vh3-66 and vh3-30 gene segments use the distinct rbd-binding modes of the b38c105 and s230 mabs respectively providing valuable information for evaluating antibodies raised by infection or vaccination by sequences alone finally the rbd and s1 a epitopes we mapped by nsempem and singleparticle cryo-em are unlikely to be affected by common mutations in different sars-cov-2 isolates

positive-sense rna genomes four human coronaviruses generally cause mild respiratory illness and circulate annually however sars-cov and mers-cov were acquired by humans via zoonotic transmission and caused outbreaks of severe respiratory infections with high case-fatality rates in 2002 and 2012 respectively12 sars-cov-2 is a novel betacoronavirus that emerged in wuhan china in december 2019 and is the causative agent of the ongoing covid-19 pandemic34 as of may 26 2020 the who has reported over 5 million cases and 350000 deaths worldwide effective vaccines therapeutic antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors are urgently needed and the development of these interventions is proceeding rapidly coronavirus virions are decorated with a spike s glycoprotein that binds to host-cell receptors and mediates cell entry via fusion of the host and viral membranes5 s proteins are trimeric class i fusion proteins that are expressed as a single polypeptide that is subsequently cleaved into s1 and s2 subunits by cellular proteases67 the s1 subunit contains the receptor-binding domain rbd which in the case of sars-cov-2 recognizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor on the host-cell surface810 the s2 subunit mediates membrane fusion and contains an additional protease cleavage site referred to as s2 that is adjacent to a hydrophobic fusion peptide binding of the rbd to ace2 triggers s1 dissociation allowing for a large rearrangement of s2 as it transitions from a metastable prefusion conformation to a highly stable postfusion conformation611 during this rearrangement the fusion peptide is inserted into the host-cell membrane after cleavage at s2 and two heptad repeats in each protomer associate to form a six-helix bundle that brings together the n- and c-termini of the s2 subunits as well as the viral and host-cell membranes attachment and entry are essential for the viral life cycle making the s protein a primary target of neutralizing antibodies and a critical vaccine antigen1213 a stabilized prefusion conformation of class i fusion proteins is desirable for vaccine development because this conformation is found on infectious virions and displays most or all of the neutralizing epitopes that can be targeted by antibodies to prevent the entry process1416 we and others have observed that prefusion stabilization tends to increase the recombinant expression of viral glycoproteins possibly by preventing triggering or misfolding that results from a tendency to adopt the more stable postfusion structure for example structure-based design of prefusion-stabilized mers-cov and sars-cov spike ectodomains resulted in homogeneous preparations of prefusion spikes and greatly increased yields15 these variants s-2p contained two consecutive proline substitutions in the s2 subunit in a turn between the central helix ch and heptad repeat 1 hr1 that must transition to a single elongated -helix in the postfusion conformation prefusion-stabilized spike variants are also superior immunogens to wild-type spike ectodomains15 and have been used to determine high-resolution spike structures by cryo-em1720 importantly the successful transplantation of this double-proline substitution into the sars-cov-2 spike sars-cov-2 s-2p allowed for the rapid determination of high-resolution cryo-em structures and accelerated development of vaccine candidates2122 however even with these substitutions the sars-cov-2 s-2p ectodomain is unstable and difficult to produce reliably in mammalian cells hampering biochemical research and development of subunit vaccines here we employ structure-based design to increase the yield and stability of the sars-cov-2 spike ectodomain in the prefusion conformation we report multiple prolines disulfide bonds salt bridges and cavity-filling substitutions that increase expression andor stability of the spike relative to the s-2p base construct combining four proline substitutions into a single construct termed hexapro stabilized the prefusion state and increased expression 10-fold a high-resolution cryo-em structure of this variant confirms that the proline substitutions adopt the designed conformations and do not disrupt the conformation of the s2 subunit thus preserving its antigenicity this work will facilitate production of prefusion spikes for diagnostic kits and subunit vaccines and has broad implications for next-generation coronavirus vaccine design to generate a prefusion-stabilized sars-cov-2 spike protein that expresses at higher levels and is more stable than our original s-2p construct21 we analyzed the sars-cov-2 s-2p cryo-em structure pdb id 6vsb and designed substitutions based upon knowledge of class i fusion protein function and general protein stability principles these strategies included the introduction of disulfide bonds to prevent conformational changes during the pre-to-postfusion transition salt bridges to neutralize charge imbalances hydrophobic residues to fill internal cavities and prolines to cap helices or stabilize loops in the prefusion state we cloned 100 single s-2p variants and characterized their relative expression levels table s1 and for those that expressed well we characterized their monodispersity thermostability and quaternary structure given that the s2 subunit undergoes large-scale refolding during the pre-to-postfusion transition we exclusively focused our efforts on stabilizing s2 substitutions of each category were identified that increased expression while maintaining the prefusion conformation fig 1 and 2a overall 26 out of the 100 single-substitution variants had higher expression than s-2p table s1 one common strategy to stabilize class i fusion proteins such as the spike is to covalently link a region that undergoes a conformational change to a region that does not via a disulfide bond for instance the q965cs1003c substitution attempts to link hr1 to the central helix whereas g799ca924c aims to link hr1 to the upstream helix these two variants boosted protein expression 38-fold and 13-fold compared to s-2p respectively fig 2b however the size-exclusion chromatography sec traces of both variants showed a leftward shift compared to s-2p indicating that the proteins were running larger than expected which agreed well with negative stain electron microscopy nsem results that showed partially misfolded spike particles fig s1 in contrast s884ca893c and t791ca879c variants eluted on sec at a volume similar to s-2p and were well-folded trimeric particles by nsem fig 2e these variants link the same -helix to two different flexible loops that pack against a neighboring protomer fig 1 notably s884ca893c had two-fold higher expression than s-2p with increased thermostability fig 2f cavity-filling substitutions and salt bridges can also enhance protein stability without disturbing the overall fold cavity filling has been particularly helpful in stabilizing the prefusion conformations of rsv f and hiv-1 env2324 we found many cavity-filling and salt bridge designs that improved protein expression compared to s-2p fig 2g for example l938f and t961d both produced 2-fold increases in protein yield and maintained the correct quaternary structure fig 2c and 2e although the thermostability of both variants as assessed by differential scanning fluorimetry dsf was unchanged compared to s-2p fig 2f previous successes using proline substitutions inspired us to investigate 14 individual variants wherein a proline was substituted into flexible loops or the n-termini of helices in the fusion peptide hr1 and the region connecting them cr table 1 and fig 1g as expected multiple proline variants boosted the protein expression and increased the thermostability fig 2d and 2f two of the most successful substitutions f817p and a942p exhibited 28 and 60-fold increases in protein yield relative to s-2p respectively the a942p substitution further increased the melting temperature tm by 3 c and both variants appeared as well-folded trimers by nsem fig 2e and fig s2 we next generated combination combo variants that combined the best-performing modifications from our initial screen the combo variants containing two disulfide bonds generally expressed 2-fold lower than the single-disulfide variants suggesting that they interfered with each other table s2 adding one disulfide s884ca893c to a single proline variant f817p also reduced the expression level although the quaternary structure of the spikes was well maintained table s2 combo40 the beneficial effect of a disulfide bond was most prominent when combined with l938f a cavity-filling variant combo23 s884ca893c l938f had higher protein yields than either of its parental variants but the tm of combo23 did not increase compared to s884ca893c fig s3b in addition mixing one cavity-filling substitution with one proline substitution combo20 increased the expression compared to l938f alone table s2 combining multiple proline substitutions resulted in the most drastic increases in expression and stability fig 3a combo14 containing a892p and a942p had a 62-fold increase in protein yield compared to a892p alone fig 3b and 3c adding a third proline a899p increased thermostability 12 c tm but did not further increase expression fig 3c combo46 a892p a899p f817p had a 34-fold increase in protein yield and a 33 c rise in tm as compared to a892p the most promising variant combo47 renamed hexapro contains all four beneficial proline substitutions f817p a892p a899p a942p as well as the two proline substitutions in s-2p hexapro expressed 98-fold higher than s-2p had 5 c increase in tm and retained the trimeric prefusion conformation fig 3d fig s2 we focused on this construct for additional characterization to assess the viability of hexapro as a potential vaccine antigen or diagnostic reagent we comprehensively examined large-scale production in freestyle 293-f cells the feasibility of protein expression in expicho cells epitope integrity and protein stability we were able to generate 14 mg of hexapro from 2l of freestyle 293-f cells or 7 mgl which represents a greater than 10-fold improvement over s-2p21 importantly large-scale hexapro preparations retained a monodisperse sec peak corresponding to the molecular weight of a glycosylated trimer fig 4a and were indistinguishable from s-2p by nsem fig 4b industrial production of recombinant proteins typically relies on cho cells rather than hek293 cells we thus investigated hexapro expression in expicho cells via transient transfection expicho cells produced 13 mg of well-folded protein per 40 ml of culture or 325 mgl fig 4c and 4d the binding kinetics of hexapro to the human ace2 receptor were comparable to that of s-2p fig 4e and 4f with affinities of 133 nm and 113 nm respectively hexapro remained folded in the prefusion conformation after 3 cycles of freeze-thaw 2 days incubation at room temperature or 30 minutes at 55 c fig 4g and 4h in contrast s-2p showed signs of aggregation after 3 cycles of freeze-thaw and began unfolding after 30 min at 50 c collectively these data indicate that hexapro is a promising candidate for sars-cov-2 vaccine development to confirm that our stabilizing substitutions did not lead to any unintended conformational changes we determined the cryo-em structure of sars-cov-2 s hexapro from a single dataset we were able to obtain high-resolution 3d reconstructions for two distinct conformations of s one with a single rbd in the up conformation and the other with two rbds in the up conformation this two-rbd-up conformation was not observed during previous structural characterization of sars-cov-2 s-2p2122 while it is tempting to speculate that the enhanced stability of s2 in hexapro allowed us to observe this less stable intermediate validating this hypothesis will require further investigation roughly a third 306 of the particles were in the two-rbd-up conformation leading to a 320  reconstruction the remaining particles were captured in the one-rbd-up conformation although some flexibility in the position of the receptor-accessible rbd prompted us to remove a subset of one-rbd-up particles that lacked clear density for this domain resulting in a final set of 85675 particles that led to a 321  reconstruction fig 5a fig s4 and fig s5 comparison of our one-rbd-up hexapro structure with the previously determined 346  s-2p structure revealed an rmsd of 12  over 436 c atoms in s2 fig 5b the relatively high resolution of this reconstruction allowed us to confirm that the stabilizing proline substitutions did not distort the s2 subunit conformation fig 5c prefusion-stabilized class i viral fusion proteins generally induce more potent neutralizing antibodies and function as better vaccine antigens than their unstabilized counterparts1416 to respond to the urgent need for preventative countermeasures against the covid-19 pandemic we used our prefusion-stabilized sars-cov-2 s-2p structure21 as a guide to design 100 single substitution variants intended to have increased expression or stability we focused on engineering the s2 subunit because it undergoes large-scale refolding to facilitate membrane fusion one of the strategies we employed was the introduction of disulfide bonds wherein at least one cysteine is in a region that changes conformation between the pre- and postfusion states although this method has been successful in the case of hiv-1 env sosip and rsv f ds-cav11423 the disulfides we introduced into s2 generally had detrimental effects for example inter-subunit disulfides eg s659cs698c decreased the protein expression by 60 table s1 and the q965cs1003c substitution led to partially mis-folded spikes fig 2b inter-protomer disulfides have been shown to improve the trimer integrity of hiv-1 env and the stability of rsv f2526 but the inter-protomeric t961cs758c substitution ablated expression table s1 in contrast we found that stabilizing the flexible loops located in the protomer interfaces was beneficial both s884ca893c and t791ca879c increased thermostability or expression and resulted in native trimer structures it is possible that anchoring flexible loops to a relatively rigid -helix favors protomer assembly introducing a salt bridge at the hiv-1 gp120gp41 interface not only boosted the protein expression but also enhanced the binding of trimer-specific antibodies suggesting improved retention of the native quaternary structure24 based on a similar principle the t961d substitution was introduced to form an electrostatic interaction with arg765 from a neighboring protomer fig 1 likewise the g769e substitution was designed to form an inter-protomeric salt bridge with arg1014 both variants increased expression and resembled well-folded trimeric spikes fig 2e fig s2 table s1 in addition to salt bridges filling loosely packed hydrophobic cores that allow the protein to refold can help stabilize the prefusion state as shown by previous cavity-filling substitutions in rsv f and hiv-1 env142327 here the l938f substitution was designed to fill a cavity formed in part by hr1 the fp and a -hairpin fig 1 this variant had a 2-fold increase in expression fig 2c and appeared to have additive effects when paired with disulfide or proline substitutions table s2 among the best single-substitution variants we discovered were f817p and a942p fig 2 by further combining them with a892p and a899p substitutions we generated the highest expressing construct hexapro this result is reminiscent of previous successful applications of proline substitutions to class i fusion proteins including hiv-1 env influenza ha rsv f hmpv f mers-cov s lassa gpc and ebola gp1415232831 solvent accessibility of hydrophobic residues near the fusion peptide was a concern for influenza ha stem-only designs32 and similarly we addressed this issue by replacing the exposed phe817 with pro fig 5c the a942p substitution imposes rigidity to the flexible loop between the connector region and hr1 and is similar to that of the t577p substitution found to be helpful for stabilizing ebola gp28 in our hexapro cryo-em dataset we observed a third of the particles in a two-rbd-up conformation this had not been previously observed for sars-cov-2 spikes until a recent structure was determined of a modified spike containing four hydrophobic substitutions that brought subdomain 1 closer to s233 we hypothesize that the more stable s2 in hexapro allowed us to capture this relatively unstable conformation that may transiently exist prior to triggering and dissociation of s1 this is similar to what was observed in the structures of the mers-cov s-2p spike where even the 3-rbd-up conformation could be observed15 additionally hexapro spikes were able to retain the prefusion state after freeze-thaws room temperature storage and heat stress which should aid in the development of hexapro spikes as subunit vaccine antigens hexapro spikes may also improve dna or mrna-based vaccines by producing more antigen per nucleic acid molecule thus improving efficacy at the same dose or maintaining efficacy at lower doses finally we demonstrate that 32 mg of well-folded hexapro can be obtained from 1l of expicho cells indicating a clear path to industrial-level production to meet global demand for this essential sars-cov-2 protein the sars-cov-2 s-2p variant was used as the base construct for all subsequent designs21 the s-2p base construct comprises residues 11208 of sars-cov-2 s genbank mn908947 with prolines substituted at residues 986 and 987 gsas substituted at the furin cleavage site residues 682685 and c-terminal foldon trimerization motif hrv3c protease recognition site twin-strep-tag and octa-histidine tag cloned into the mammalian expression plasmid ph using this plasmid as a template desired mutations were introduced at selected positions within the sars-cov-2 s2 subunit based on sars-cov-2 s-2p cryo-em structure pdb id 6vsb pairs of residues with c atoms less than 46  apart were considered for disulfide bond designs we particularly targeted the regions that move drastically during the pre- to postfusion transition such as the fusion peptide connector region and hr1 salt bridge variants required that the charged groups of the substituted residues were predicted to be within 40  for residues in loops a slightly longer distance than 40  was allowed core-facing residues with sidechains adjacent to a pre-existing internal cavity were examined for potential substitutions to bulkier hydrophobic residues proline substitutions were designed in the fp connector region or hr1 and placed either in a flexible loop or at the n-terminus of a helix combinations were chosen to test whether pairs of the same type of design eg disulfidedisulfide or different types of designs eg disulfideproline could result in additive effects on spike expression and stability plasmids encoding s variants were transiently

isolde3739  glycans on the sars-cov-2 spike control the receptor binding domain conformation rory henderson robert edwards j katayoun mansouri katarzyna janowska victoria stalls megan kopp barton haynes f priyamvada acharya   the ongoing sars-cov-2 sars-2 pandemic presents an urgent need for the development of a protective vaccine the primary immunogenic target for the vaccines in development is the viral transmembrane s-protein trimer each protomer of the trimer is split into an n-terminal receptor binding s1 subunit and a c-terminal fusion element containing s2 subunit the s1 subunit is further split into an n-terminal domain ntd two subdomains sd1 and sd2 as well as the receptor binding domain rbd that together cap the conserved elements of the s2 subunit the fusion event is marked by the shedding of the s1 subunit and large conformational transitions in the s2 subunit the necessity to maintain a large free energy gradient between the prefusion immune protective state of the molecule and the post-fusion state results in a highly dynamic macromolecular structure the s1 subunit is particularly dynamic presenting the rbd in two distinct states a receptor binding site occluded down state in which the rbds rest against their adjacent protomers ntd and a receptor binding site exposed up state it is this rbd up state to which the majority of neutralizing responses are observed in convalescent sars-2 infected individuals1 as conformational evasion is a well-known virus escape mechanism it is critical to understand the mechanism by which these dynamics are controlled structural studies of the -cov s-protein have focused primarily on a soluble ectodomain construct with and without stabilizing proline mutations 2p this includes structures for sars-212 sars37 mers38 and other human910 and murine11 -cov ectodomains structures for the sars and mers ectodomains revealed the presence of one and two rbd up states with a three rbd up state observed in the mers ectodomain demonstrating the breadth of rbd configurations available to the spike interestingly these states were not observed in the human -covs hku1 and oc43 nor in a murine -cov suggesting mutations in the spike protein can confer dramatic differences in the propensity of the rbd to sample its available conformational space our quantitative examination of the available -cov s-protein structures recently revealed the s1 and s2 subunit domains of different -cov viruses occupy a diverse array of configurations12 based upon this analysis we predicted the s-protein conformation was particularly sensitive to mutations at the interfaces between domains and subunits indeed mutations at these sites had major impacts on the configuration of the protein especially on the rbd updown distribution12 while these and other studies131415 have demonstrated the role of protein-protein contacts in determining the conformation of the s-protein the influence on rbd configuration of glycosylation at or near interfacial domain regions is poorly understood like other class i viral fusion proteins the -cov s-proteins are heavily glycosylated obscuring the spike surface and limiting the targetable area for immune responses a recent site-specific analysis of the glycosylation patterns of the sars-2 s-protein revealed extensive variation in the glycan type indicating marked differences in processing enzyme accessibility at each site16 together the wide variation in spike conformation coupled with the presence of glycans adjacent to the rbd suggests among the many factors affecting the rbd position glycosylation patterns may provide a means by which to control its conformational equilibrium in this study we have investigated the potential for two sars-2 ntd glycans in close proximity to the rbd to influence the conformational distribution of the rbd up and down states analysis of the available sars-2 up state structures suggested n165 and n234 glycans may interact with the up state rbd acting as both direct stabilizers of the up state and as steric blocks to transitions to the down state we combined binding studies by surface plasmon resonance with structural studies using negative stain electron microscopy nsem and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy cryo-em to define shifts in the updown state equilibrium in glycan-deleted mutants of the sars-2 spike ectodomain together our results demonstrate that rbd proximal glycans can influence the propensity of the s-protein adopt multiple configurations suggesting a means for viral escape and therefore the need to consider non-rbd neutralizing responses in vaccine design in order to establish whether glycans may indeed alter the rbd orientation we first examined the sars-2 glycan density at positions 165 and 234 in the cryo-em maps from three previously published sars-2 structures217 in the down state the n234 glycan resides in a cleft formed by the ntd and rbd supplemental figure 1a while in the up state it occupies the region of the rbd down state figure 1a this suggests that the solvated up state configuration is preferred and must be shifted in order to accommodate the down state the presence of this glycan may act as a hinderance to up-to-down state transitions while sterically hindering the down state by limiting rbd to ntd packing an additional glycan at n165 residing toward the apical position of the ntd is in close proximity to the rbd and therefore may also influence the rbd position unlike the n234 glycan the position of the n165 glycan presents no apparent restriction to the rbd positioning in the down state supplemental figure 1b however clear density for this glycan is observed occupying the region the rbd rest in the closed state potentially forming interactions with the up state rbd figure 1a this suggests this glycan may act to stabilize the rbd up state alternatively its presence near the rbd in the down state may confer a degree of stability to the fully closed state together these observations combined with our recent results suggesting remarkable conformational sensitivity to mutations suggest these glycans may act to stabilize the observed rbd updown equilibrium we next asked whether rbd proximal ntd glycans occur in other -covs for which high-resolution structural data is available for this we examined structures for mers sars oc43 hku1 and a murine -cov s-protein ectodomains pdb ids 5w9h 6crw 6ohv 5i08 and 3jcl respectively identifying three mers n155 n166 and n236 two sars-2 synonymous sars n158 and n227 and one oc43 n133 and two hku1 n132 and n19 glycosylation sites proximal to their respective rbds figure 1b no rbd adjacent glycosylation sites were observed in the murine s-protein while the mers and sars glycans display similar extensions into the rbd space in the one up state the lack of up state structures for oc43 and hku1 precludes examination of their rbd adjacent ntd glycans in the absence of the rbd however the hku1 n132 and oc43 n133 glycans extend upward away from the rbd suggesting these glycans are unlikely to exert a strong influence on the rbd conformation supplemental figure 1c interestingly while cryo-em reconstructions for sars-2 mers and sars yield up state rbds these states were not reported for any of the oc43 hku1 or murine datasets together these observations suggest rbd proximal ntd glycans may indeed affect the conformational distribution of updown rbd states in order to examine the extent to which the n234 and n165 glycans influence the conformational distribution of the s-protein we produced di-proline 2p stabilized8 s-protein ectodomain2 n234a and n165a mutants the protein yields after streptactin purification were 20 mg and 08 mg per 1l culture supernatant respectively for the n234a and the n165a mutant supplemental figures 2 and 3 to assess the reactivity of the glycan-deleted spike ectodomain mutants to the ace-2 receptor we tested binding of the spike to an ace-2 ectodomain construct bearing a c-terminal mouse fc tag immobilized on an anti-fc surface spr binding assays showed that while the n165a mutant displayed 1020 increased binding levels to the unmutated construct the n234a mutant showed a decrease of 5060 figure 2a and supplemental figure 2b because ace-2 binding requires the rbd be in the up position the spr data suggests that the n165a mutant displays more up or open states whereas the n2345a mutant displays more down or closed states we next examined the updown state distribution of both mutants via negative stain electron microscopy nsem heterogenous classification of the n234a mutant particles revealed a dramatic shift from a 11 up v down state distribution in the unmutated 2p1217 to a ratio of 14 in the down state figure 2a remarkably the n165a mutant shifted the distribution in the opposite direction displaying a higher propensity to adopt rbd up states yielding a 21 -up state to down state ratio with  17 of the up population being a 2-rbd up class figure 2a together the ace-2 binding and the nsem results demonstrated that both ntd n-glycan deletions have distinct impacts on the rbd distribution we next turned to cryo-em for high resolution structure determination to visualize the impact of the glycan deletions on the local and global configuration of the s-protein domains we collected and processed 7269 and 8068 images for the n165a and n234a mutant respectively to yield particle stacks cleaned by 2d classification and multiple rounds of ab initio classification and heterogenous refinement in cryosparc18 using 20  low pass filtered up state and down state maps generated from available sars-2 structures initial maps for high resolution refinement were generated from sorted particles via ab initio reconstruction supplemental figures 4 and 5 the resulting particle distribution for the n234a mutant was predominantly down with a minor 6 up state population while that of the n165a mutant was 50 down and 50 one up as was observed for the unmutated spike previously1217 we were unable to identify a particle subset corresponding to a two up state in the cryo-em dataset the updown state populations obtained via nsem for unmutated12 glutaraldehyde fixed sars-2 s-protein ectodomain match the previously observed cryo-em distribution17 here using the same approach we find that these distributions are dramatically and differentially shifted with mutation of either the n165 or n234 to alanine with the spr nsem and cryo-em distribution tracking in the same direction with the exception of the n165a cryo-em particles for which a two rbd up state was not observed considering the concordance between the spr and nsem results this may be due to particle processing and the potential for a relatively disordered up state rbds in the two up state with the glycan deletion we next examined the high-resolution details of the cryo-em maps refinement of the n234a mutant down state using c3 symmetry resulted in a 30  map with coordinates fit to this map yielding a structure aligning to the unmutated 2p structure pdb id 6vxx with a 06  rmsd alignment of the s2 subunit revealed the structures to be nearly identical in these regions rmsd 04  examination of the ntd to rbd interface using this alignment revealed a shift of the ntd toward the rbd figure 3ad weak density for the n165 glycan was observed suggestive of an overall similar position relative to that observed previously figure 3b and c the one rbd up state map was refined to 48  resolution using c1 symmetry comparison of the one rbd up state structure fit to this map to its unmutated counterpart pdb id 6vyb suggests a slight shift of the rbd with the n234a mutation figure 3e and f however the limited resolution of this structure limits close examination of this movement nevertheless density for the n165 glycan was observed for the ntd adjacent to the vacant rbd site up adjacent and for the ntd glycan adjacent to the down state rbd proximal to the vacant site down free each occupies a configuration consistent with previous observations in the unmutated form interestingly clear density for the n165 glycan is not observed for the ntd adjacent to the down state rbd contacting the up state rbd down adjacent together the structures show that the while clear differences between the unmutated and n234a mutant are observed the overall configuration of the structures are similar to their respective unmutated counterparts these differences do not appear to have significant impacts on the n165 glycan configuration refinement of the n165a up and down states resulted in maps with resolutions of 36  using c1 symmetry and 33  using c3 symmetry respectively similar to the n234a mutant the n165a mutant structures showed an overall similar arrangement of the various domains alignment of the down state structure of the n165a mutant with that of the unmutated spike yielded an rmsd of 081  with an s2 subunit alignment rmsd of 036  unlike the n234a mutant the n165a mutant ntd is shifted away from the adjacent rbd figure 4ad interestingly clear density for the n234 glycan was not observed the one up state structure of the n165a mutant displayed a similar supplemental figure 6 albeit slightly less shifted arrangement of the ntd in the down adjacent protomer supplemental figure 6b this shift in not observed in either of the other two ntds indicating the ntd shift is sensitive to s1 and s2 subunit arrangements supplemental figure 6c and d the 1-up rbd resides in largely the same position as that of the unmutated spike with only minor differences due potentially to the lower relative resolution of this region figure 4eh density for the n234 glycan was not observed for any of the protomers consistent with the down state map together the results of the n165a and n234a structural analysis results suggest that these two glycans play a differential role in influencing the sars-cov-2 rbd arrangement shifting the ntd toward or away from the adjacent rbds viral fusion proteins are often heavily glycosylated with the sars-2 s-protein being no exception though decorated with fewer glycans than the hiv-1 envelope protein with 22 glycans per protomer16 the sars-2 spike is well shielded from immune surveillance the sars-2 spike protein has proven remarkably sensitive to domain-domain interfacial mutations121519 which led us to ask whether glycans near the ntd-rbd interface might also impact the configuration of the spike here we have investigated the role of two ntd glycans at positions 234 and 165 in modulating s protein conformational dynamics by tracking the shift of rbd disposition in glycan-deleted mutants using binding to ace-2 receptor nsem and cryo-em analysis while the specific magnitudes of differences vary between the different analysis methods the results tend to track in the same direction showing that deletion of glycan 234 shifts the rbd dynamics more toward the down state whereas deletion of glycan 165 appears to slightly enhance the distribution toward more up states the shift in the position of the ntd toward the rbd in the down state n234a mutant suggest the n234 glycan plays a direct role in destabilizing the down state rbd position such that removal allows tighter packing of the rbd to the ntd additionally the observed shift in the position of the up state rbd suggests a role for the n234 glycan in modulating rbd stability this is consistent with a recently released theoretical study investigating up state rbd sensitivity to the presence of n165n234 glycans via molecular simulation20 this investigation found that the absence of these glycans resulted in a comparatively unstable up state rbd the results here confirm the prediction from these simulations that loss of the n234 glycan results in an increased prevalence of the down state deletion of the glycan at position 165 here suggests an opposite effect on the conformation of the spike relative to the n234a mutant with the ntd shifting away from the adjacent rbd though this appears to relieve strain caused by the restriction imposed by the n234 glycan the resultant lack of packing between the rbd and ntd may be sufficient to favor transitions to the up state further this shift suggests the n165 glycan interacts directly with the rbd though direct interactions are not observed in the cryo-em densities here or in previously published sars-2 structures the presence of down state conformational heterogeneity evinced by the poor resolution of the rbd and ntd elements of the spike is consistent with the possibility of such an interaction a more detailed examination of this heterogeneity and the influence of these glycans on the various states of the spike will likely require large datasets with improved orientational sampling to better resolve these apical regions nevertheless the results here demonstrate that the conformational ensemble of the sars-2 spike and likely all -cov spikes is sensitive to glycosylation patterns especially near the ntd-rbd interface the results from this study lend insights into two key questions  what role may the glycans at positions 165 and 234 play in modulating rbd dynamics of the native sars-2 spike and how might these findings impact vaccine design toward the first question we recognize that the results we describe are in the context of a stabilized ectodomain construct and differences between these and what occurs on the spike in its native context can be expected indeed a recent report for a detergent solubilized full-length sars-2 spike suggested greater stability in the down state rbd21 yet our experimental results revealing the role of the n165 and n234 glycans in modulating the conformational landscape of the s protein taken together with the findings from the computational analysis performed in the context of the full-length spike20 and our analysis of the rbd-proximal ntd glycans of diverse -covs figure 1 provides strong support for a role for these glycans in controlling the virion bound s-protein conformation and dynamics the differences in glycosylation in this region in different cov spikes could be a contributor to determining their receptor specificity and thus their transmission toward the second question related to the utility for vaccine design building upon our previous study where we demonstrated conformational control of rbd dynamics in the s protein ectodomain by modulating inter-domain protein-protein contacts here we expand the tools for achieving such control to glycan-protein interactions and demonstrate that rbd dynamics can be modulated by targeting key glycans at interdomain contacts in so doing we create two new ectodomain constructs with differential exposure of the immunodominant rbd for use as immunogens in vaccination regimens taken together these investigations further demonstrate the remarkable plasticity of this conformational machine and suggest the s-protein has a diverse landscape of conformational escape mutations from which to select as genetic drift and host immune pressures direct

wrapp jason mclellan s max crispin   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 the causative pathogen of covid-1912 induces fever severe respiratory illness and pneumonia sars-cov-2 utilizes an extensively glycosylated spike s protein that protrudes from the viral surface to bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 the host cell receptor to mediate cell entry3 the s protein is a trimeric class i fusion protein that is composed of two functional subunits responsible for receptor binding s1 subunit and membrane fusion s2 subunit remarkably the surface of the virally encoded envelope spike is dominated by an array of host-derived glycans with each trimer displaying 66 n-linked glycosylation sites this extensive glycosylation has important implications for vaccine design as obligate parasites many viruses exploit host-cell machinery to glycosylate their own proteins numerous viral envelope proteins including hiv-1 envelope env influenza hemagglutinin ha and lassa virus glycoprotein complex gpc possess genetically encoded n-linked glycan sequons n-x-st motifs where x is any amino acid except proline viral glycosylation has wide-ranging roles in viral pathobiology including mediating protein folding and stability and shaping viral tropism the genetically encoded sequons can be under significant selective pressure as a mechanism for immune evasion by shielding specific epitopes from antibody neutralization however we note the currently reported low mutation rate of sars-cov-2 and as yet that there have been no observed mutations to n-linked glycosylation sites4 surfaces with an unusually high density of glycans can also enable immune recognition57 the role of glycosylation in immune evasion by camouflaging immunogenic protein epitopes has been well studied for other coronaviruses489 as the principal antigen presented on the surface of sars-cov-2 virions the s protein is a key target in vaccine design efforts it is apparent that the viral spike will be targeted by the full assortment of vaccine strategies from nucleic-acid based approaches10 whereby the viral protein is expressed in vivo to recombinant strategies whereby viral glycoproteins are delivered with appropriate adjuvants such strategies aim to elicit neutralizing adaptive immunity with an emphasis on achieving an antibody response at the sites of viral entry understanding the glycosylation of recombinant viral spikes can both reveal fundamental features of viral biology and can guide vaccine design strategies and manufacturing as glycans are enzymatically elaborated in the golgi apparatus some features of processed so-called complex-type glycosylation will necessarily be influenced by the producer cell-line however the presence of glycans typical of the early stages of the secretory pathway on otherwise mature glycoproteins often closely relate to fundamental features of viral spike architecture high viral glycan density or extensive packing of the glycan to the protein surface can impair the normal glycan maturation pathway by steric interference of host enzymes under-processed oligomannose- and hybrid-type glycans are found on the majority of viral envelope proteins such as hiv-1 env influenza ha and lassa virus gpc5 these viral glycoproteins traffic through the secretory system and the glycosylation processing of recombinant material often closely captures the glycan maturation state of the virion this can be particularly important for viruses such as hiv-1 where viral glycans can also be targeted by neutralizing antibodies coronaviruses have been reported to form virions by budding into the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum-golgi intermediate compartments ergic1114 however observations of hybrid- and complex-type glycans on virally derived material suggests that the viral glycoproteins are subjected to golgi resident processing enzymes815 as impaired glycan maturation can be a sensitive reporter of local viral protein architecture16 detailed site-specific analysis has emerged as an indicator of native-like architecture and is increasingly used to compare different immunogens and in the monitoring of manufacturing processes importantly in addition to these structural insights the presence of oligomannose-type glycans on viral spike-based immunogens has also been shown to enhance trafficking of glycoprotein to germinal centers via interaction with lectins such as mannose-binding lectin17 it is therefore of considerable importance to understand the glycosylation of recombinant mimetics of the virus spike here we apply mass spectrometry to understand both the site-specific n-linked glycan composition and the degree of sequon occupancy on a soluble native-like sars-cov-2 s protein the native-like folding of trimeric recombinant material has been recently revealed by detailed structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy1819 we have previously validated our glycopeptide analysis methodology and applied this approach to the study of a range of other viral glycoprotein immunogens42023 which enables cross-viral comparisons of glycosylation to be made we report here the site-specific glycosylation at each of the 22 n-linked glycan sites found on the sars-cov-2 s protomer as observed on other viral glycoproteins there is an elevation in oligomannose- and hybrid-type glycans compared to host-derived glycoproteins although compared to many other viruses there are still a large population of complex-type glycans displayed across the trimer surface we also report that for each of the 22 glycan sites the occupancy is nearly fully complete which means that any epitopes shielded from the immune system on the virus will also likely be shielded on the immunogen site-specific glycan analysis of sars-cov-2 immunogens will help guide vaccine design and manufacturing to resolve the site-specific glycosylation of sars-cov-2 s protein and visualize the distribution of glycoforms across the protein surface we expressed and purified recombinant soluble material in an identical manner to that which was used to obtain the high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy cryo-em structure albeit without glycan processing blockade using kifunensine18 this soluble recombinant variant of the s protein contains all 22 glycans on the sars-cov-2 s protein figure 1a stabilization of the trimeric prefusion structure was achieved using the 2p stabilizing mutations24 at residues 986 and 987 in addition to a c-terminal trimerization motif this ensures that the quaternary structure remains intact during glycan processing as in the case of hiv env mimetics this is known to influence glycosylation of certain sites1625 prior to analysis supernatant containing the recombinant sars-cov-2 was purified using a c-terminal streptag followed by size-exclusion chromatography to ensure only native-like trimeric sars-cov-2 s protein is analyzed figure 1b the trimeric conformation of the purified material was validated using negative stain electron microscopy figure 1c trypsin chymotrypsin and alpha-lytic protease were employed to generate three glycopeptide samples these proteases cleave at different sites and were selected in order to generate glycopeptides that contain a single n-linked glycan sequon the glycopeptide pools were analyzed by lc-ms with high-energy collision-induced dissociation hcd fragmentation and the glycan compositions at each site were determined for all 22 n-linked glycan sites on the sars-cov-2 s protein figure 2 a diverse range of glycan compositions were observed across the different glycosylation sites in order to convey the main processing features at each site the abundances of each glycan are summed into oligomannose- hybrid- and complex-type glycosylation in addition the diverse signals arising from heterogeneous complex-type glycosylation are simplified by the summation of glycan intensities into a more limited range of structural categories there are three sites on sars-cov-2 that are predominantly oligomannose-type n234 n709 and n801 the predominant structure observed at each site with the exception of n234 is man5glcnac2 which demonstrates that these sites are largely accessible to a 12-mannosidases but are poor substrates for glcnact-i which is the gateway enzyme in the formation of hybrid- and complex-type glycans in the golgi apparatus the stage at which processing is impeded is a signature related to the density and presentation of glycans on the viral spike for example the more densely glycosylated spikes of hiv-1 env and lassa virus gpc give rise to numerous sites dominated by man9glcnac2202226 interestingly there are several sites which possess significant populations of hybrid-type glycans most notably at n657 this phenomenon has been observed on other viral glycoproteins such as hiv-1 env2026 and these structures are not particularly prevalent on mammalian glycoproteins2728 such hybrid-type glycans have been shown to be targeted by anti-hiv antibodies29 and could also be important for immunogen trafficking since they have mannose-terminating moieties17 a mixture of oligomannose-type glycans and complex-type glycans can be found at sites n61 n122 n165 n603 n657 n717 and n1074 figure 2 of the 22 sites on the s protein 10 contain significant populations of oligomannose-type glycans highlighting how the processing of the sars-cov-2 s glycans is divergent from host glycoproteins the remaining 12 sites are dominated by processed complex-type glycans the predominant category of complex-type glycans observed on the s protein are fucosylated biantennary structures very similar to those abundant on mammalian glycoproteins a further feature that can be interrogated using this methodology is the extent of unoccupancy of glycosylation sites where a sequon is present but a glycan has not been attached in hiv immunogen research the holes generated by unoccupied glycan sites have been shown to be immunogenic and potentially give rise to distracting epitopes30 while unoccupied glycosylation sites were detected on sars-cov-2 when quantified they were revealed to form a very minor component of the total peptide pool the efficiency of glycan site occupancy of the recombinant sars-cov-2 immunogen versus the counterpart for hiv may well arise due to the somewhat larger spacing of sites along the polypeptide chain the high occupancy of n-linked glycan sequons of sars-cov-2 indicates that recombinant immunogens will not require further optimization to enhance site occupancy using the cryo-em structure of the trimeric sars-cov-2 s protein pdb id 6vsb18 we generated a model to map the glycosylation status of the coronavirus spike mimetic onto the experimentally determined 3d structure figure 3 this combined mass spectrometric and cryo-em analysis reveals how the n-linked glycans occlude distinct regions across the surface of the sars-cov-2 spike glycans were modelled onto each site using predominant glycans observed figure 2 and colored according to the prevalence of oligomannose-type glycans shielding of the receptor binding sites on the sars-cov-2 spike by proximal glycosylation sites n165 n234 n343 can be observed especially when the receptor binding domain is in the down conformation the shielding of receptor binding sites by glycans is a common feature of viral glycoproteins and has been observed for sars-cov s48 hiv-1 env31 influenza ha3233 and lasv gpc21 given the functional constraints of receptor binding sites and the subsequent low mutation rates of these residues it is likely that there has been selective pressure to utilize n-linked glycans as a method to camouflage one of the most conserved and potentially vulnerable areas of their respective glycoproteins3435 it is interesting to note the absence of a specific glycan cluster that is responsible for the presence of the oligomannose-type glycans but rather there is a dispersion of these glycans across both the s1 and s2 subunits this is in significant contrast to other viral glycoproteins for example the density of glycans clusters in hiv have even enabled structural classification of their different modes of interaction36 in sars-cov-2 the oligomannose-type structures are probably protected to some extent by the protein component as exemplified by the n234 glycan which is partially sandwiched between the n-terminal and receptor-binding domains figure 3 we characterized the n-linked glycans on extended loop structures that were not resolved in the cryo-em maps18 n74 and n149 these were determined to be complex-type glycans consistent with the inherent flexibility of these regions and resulting accessibility of these residues to glycan processing enzymes in addition to the site-specific glycosylation of the sars-cov-2 s protein it is also important to consider overall trends in glycosylation across the glycoprotein the averaged compositions across all 22 glycan sites reveals that the two most common type of n-glycans on the protein are man5glcnac2 m5 and fucosylated biantennary fa2fa1b glycans sup fig 1 oligomannose-type glycans comprise 32 of the total glycan pool with hybrid-type and complex-type glycans comprising 7 and 62 respectively sup fig 1 despite the potential impact of different local protein structure on glycan processing the overall glycosylation of sars-cov-2 is comparable with sars-cov-1 s protein and other coronavirus s proteins48915 we have previously reported that a recombinant sars-cov-1 s mimetic also contained 32 oligomannose-type glycans showing a remarkable conservation in glycan processing across these coronaviruses whilst the oligomannose-type glycan content is well above that observed on typical host glycoproteins it is significantly lower than is found on other viral glycoproteins for example one of the most densely glycosylated viral spike proteins is hiv-1 env which contains 60 oligomannose-type glycans2037 this suggests that sars-cov-2 s protein is less densely glycosylated and that the glycans form much less of a shield compared with other viral glycoproteins including hiv env and lasv gpc which may be beneficial for the elicitation of potent neutralizing antibodies in addition to oligomannose-type glycans the processing of complex-type glycans is an important consideration in immunogen engineering across the 22 n-linked glycosylation sites 16 of the glycans contain at least one sialic acid residue and 48 are fucosylated figure 4 these data suggest high levels of fucosylation but low levels of sialylation considering complex and hybrid type glycans make up 69 of the total glycans of sars-cov-2 understanding the distribution of glycan modifications across the viral spike illustrates the differential susceptibility to different processing enzymes while the absolute levels can be heavily influenced by the cellular expression system utilized we have previously demonstrated for hiv-1 env glycosylation that the processing of complex-type glycans is driven by the producer cell but that the levels of oligomannose-type glycans were largely independent of the expression system and is much more closely related to the protein structure and glycan density38 our glycosylation analysis of sars-cov-2 offers a detailed benchmark of site-specific glycan signatures characteristic of a natively folded trimeric spike as an increasing number of glycoprotein-based vaccine candidates are being developed their detailed glycan analysis offers a route for comparing immunogen integrity and will also be important to monitor as manufacturing processes are scaled for clinical use glycosylation will therefore also be an important measure of antigen quality in the manufacture of serological testing kits particularly as some s protein fragments may offer advantages in terms of production yield but lack effective glycan mimicry of the natively folded trimeric spike the lower levels of mannose-terminating glycans on sars-cov-2 compared to many other viral spikes may indicate that glycan engineering should be considered in the scenario where first-generation glycoprotein-based vaccine candidates be poorly immunogenic finally with the advent of nucleotide-based vaccines it will be important to understand how those delivery mechanisms impact immunogen processing and presentation to express the prefusion s ectodomain a gene encoding residues 11208 of sars-cov-2 s genbank

naveen vankadari  17 the sars-cov-2 pandemic is an urgent global public health emergency and 18 warrants investigating molecular and structural studies addressing the dynamics of viral 19 proteins involved in host cell adhesion the recent comparative genomic studies highlight 20 the insertion of furin protease site in the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein alerting possible 21 modification in the viral spike protein and its eventual entry to host cell and presence of furin 22 site implicated to virulence here we structurally show how furin interacts with the sars-23 cov-2 spike glycoprotein homotrimer at s1s2 region which underlined the mechanism and 24 mode of action which is a key for host cell entry unravelling the structural features of 25 biding site opens the arena in rising bonafide antibodies targeting to block the furin cleavage 26 and have great implications in the development of furin inhibitors or therapeutics 27 28  the pandemic corona virus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by severe acute 30 respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is an urgent public health emergency 31 and made a serious impact on global health and economy 1 to date more than 86000 32 deaths and 15 million confirmed positive cases were reported globally making the most 33 contagious pandemic in the last decade wwwcoronavirusgov since the initial reports on 34 2 this pneumonia-causing novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 in wuhan china  mortality and 35 morbidity are increasing exponentially around the globe despite several antiviral and 36 antibody treatments 2 most available neutralising antibodies in use are targeting the sars-37 cov-2 spike glycoprotein which is essential for host cell adhesion via ace2 and cd26 38 receptors 3 4 but infection control is still insignificant meanwhile several antiviral drugs 39 ritonavir lopinavir chloroquine remdesivir and others targeting different host and viral 40 proteins are been clinically evaluating and repurposing to combat sars-cov-2 infection 2 41 5 with the drastic increasing number of the positive cases around the world wwwcdcgov 42 moderate response to antivirals under clinical trials and poor response to antibodies targeting 43 spike sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein is a serious concern and warrants detail understanding 44 of the molecular and structural features of sars-cov-2 structural proteins in native 45 condition and post-viral infection this will abet in understanding the dynamics and 46 mechanism of viral action on the human cell the overall complex structure shows three furin proteases binding to the mid or 89 equatorial region mid region of s1 and s2 domain s1s2 of sars-cov-2 spike 90 glycoprotein homo-trimer at the off-centric and adjacent side of spike trimer  fig 1 r298 w328 and q346 10 11  fig 2 and s2  interestingly these residues are also well-100 positioned to interact with the viral spike protein cleavage site in our complex structure and 101 the entire substrate-binding pocket of furin protease appears like a canyon-like crevice 4 which can accommodate a large portion of target proteinpeptide the results show that the 103 sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein amino acid residues n657 to q690 are the prime interacting 104 residues with the furin protease the position and orientation of these unique residues 105 involved in furin recognition are well exposed and organise in a flexible loop the spike 106 protein residues n657 n658 e661 y660 t678 n679 s680 r682 r683 r685 s689 107 q690 makes the strong interaction with the furin protease  fig 2a  the interaction between 108 the viral spike glycoprotein and furin protease is mediated via several van der waals or by 109 hydrogen bonding furthermore the entire cleavage loop of viral spike protein fits into the 110 canyon-like substrate-binding pocket of furin protease it is quite interesting to notice that 111 none of the previously known coronaviruses had this novel furin protease cleavage site in the 112 spike glycoprotein which accentuates the novelty and uniqueness of sars-cov-2 in 113 addition previous reports on the glycosylation of spike glycoprotein show that furin 114 cleavage site in the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein is not targeted by the glycosylation 115 hence this cleavage loop is completely solvent-exposed 4 this further corroborates the 116 potential attack of furin protease over the s1s2 cleavage site in the sars-cov-2 spike 117 glycoprotein based on the furin binding mode and structural interaction we propose the 118 following supposition the binding and cleaving priming the spike glycoprotein at s1s2 119 region by furin protease might cut the spike glycoprotein into n-terminal s1 domain 120 spike glycoproteins also could make the ace2 and cd26 inhibitors of least effective as 129 upon cleavage the n-terminal s1 domains are not required for the cell penetration this also 130 raises a caution that while making neutralizing antibodies targeting sars-cov-2 spike 131 glycoprotein these cleavage activities need to be considered hence we speculate that 132 antibodies against s2 domain and drugs targeting s1 trimerization could be more promising   dj vu

southan ana puhl c carolina andrade horta   the two major ebola virus outbreaks in africa 1 the zika virus in brazil 2 and the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 3 which was declared by the world health organization who as a pandemic 4 5 have all occurred in the past decade in each case there is a strong sense of dj vu for those scientists involved in drug discovery a lack of available antivirals to treat the infected patients leads to a clamoring to test anything available and some pharmaceutical companies charge in to offer their drugs we also seem to see similar patterns in response across outbreaks there is a rush to be first and this sense of priority might not lead to the best or even any outcome for patients always there is the immediate proposal to create a vaccine and pronouncements that this will be available in a short time or by the end of the year of the actual outbreak in question and it never happens within these optimistic artificial deadlines again we have experienced this with the current outbreak for ebola the vaccine was ready for the second outbreak and has now been approved 6 governments are out to calm their populations while at the same time needing to be seen to do something that will vanquish the virus in the case of sars-cov-2 it results in pneumonia 7 and shares aspects of pathology and pathogenesis with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers 8 sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov belong to the same family coronaviridae and genus betacoronavirus several drug companies immediately made their antivirals available for example abbvie made their hiv approved drug lopinavirritonavir combination available to the chinese government 9 this drug had previously been suggested as promising based on combination study results from a marmoset study 10 publications have already appeared describing the use of this drug in a patient in korea significantly decreasing the viral load 11 simultaneously gilead made available remdesivir which had previously failed in clinical trials for ebola 12 but had recently shown activity against mers in rhesus macaques 13 remdesivir chloroquine and several other drugs were tested in vitro against sars-cov-2 table 1
 and shown to be active 14 some researchers had also suggested as early as january 2020 what treatment options might be most likely and these included lopinavirritonavir remdesivir favilavir arbidol as well as a broad array of nucleoside analogs neuraminidase inhibitors peptides rna synthesis inhibitors anti-inflammatory drugs and traditional chinese medicines 15 16 17 the need for other treatment options will be important as we learn more about its transmission 18 and as we see increases in the number of travel-related infections 19 already in the past weeks we have seen the rapid spread to italy and from there to many other countries including brazil and beyond such virus outbreaks are greatly straining the healthcare systems of affected countries and will test every aspect of our infrastructure supply chains and preparedness 20 this raises the question of what we can learn from our past drug discovery efforts in an attempt to develop additional drugs for sars-cov-2 more efficiently the acceleration of global sars-cov-2 data generation effectively just in a couple of months has been remarkable however scientific information gaps that impede progress toward small-molecule treatments can still be perceived many of these persist from when they were first outlined for ebola back in 2015 21 we can thus make some then-and-now comparisons see supplementary material figs s1s4 and table s1 online as well as share our own experiences of research on these virus outbreaks our efforts in ebola drug discovery initially started in 2014 with a computational pharmacophore analysis of a small number of in vitro ebola active compounds 22 this was followed by identifying and summarizing all the fda-approved drugs that could be used against the virus 23 24 and highlighting various strategies for the next virus outbreak 21 these steps preceded a pivotal point for us in developing machine learning models for the ebola virus derived from in vitro data 25 26 an early drug 22 identified by these screens was the antimalarial amodiaquine which was subsequently shown to be associated with decreased mortality 27 as the drug artesunateamodiaquine was used for malaria treatment in some ebola patients whereas others took a different malaria medicine artemetherlumefantrine 27 our ebola machine learning models were used to select three molecules for in vitro testing 28 we identified pyronaridine tilorone and quinacrine as having good in vitro activity nm against the ebola virus 28 these preliminary data enabled us to obtain funding from the nih to take one of the compounds through in vivo testing we also leveraged nih support to a collaborator to test the other two compounds as well these molecules were then each tested in the mouse model for ebola infection and demonstrated significant efficacy 29 30 31 pyronaridine is currently being pursued in larger animal models of ebola virus infection working on computational models through to in vitro testing happened in the space of a few months whereas it took several years to obtain funding for our first mouse studies this is by no means a streamlined approach to drug discovery but it was cost effective for the amount of data ultimately generated and led to revitalized interest in these molecules in 2016 we pulled together a team of researchers in brazil and the usa to provide some suggestions for an open drug discovery effort for the zika virus these included various computational strategies to repurpose molecules and docking into the zika proteins 32 we also described resources and molecules that could be prioritized for testing this was followed by our homology modeling of every zika virus protein 33 weeks before the first crystal structures for zika proteins were released all of this work was performed in the open and it attracted the attention of the ibm world community grid team who requested we submit a proposal to them for a zika project using their distributed computing facilities this became the openzika project led by our team in brazil and the usa and it involved the docking of millions of molecules from the zinc database in all zika virus and related flavivirus protein crystal structures 34 we have since also performed further modeling of zika proteins 35 and an analysis of the first 2 years following the outbreak 36 our most recent efforts have led to the discovery of an inhibitor for ns3 helicase 37 what we can learn from the openzika project to streamline future open science projects would be as follows we would pick fewer targets to dock molecules into as the openzika project created billions of docking results for tens of targets that will take many years to process we would also suggest that it is best to work with high-resolution crystal structures versus homology models as soon as possible we would also start with a library of commercially available drugs and antivirals this would massively limit the number of molecules docked to a few thousand because we found that docking of the zinc library available at that time led to compounds that were not readily available focused libraries are interesting options to perform target-directed virtual screening examples are chemdiv 38 and asinex 39 databases which have specific subsets for protease inhibitors for example facilitating and accelerating the experimental screening during openzika we learnt that having multiple biology labs committed to doing testing in vitro is also very important to have access to experimental results more quickly to validate the computational approach working with the ibm world community grid did not include any funding we found it very difficult to obtain nih funding to support this project from the very beginning because it was computational and also attempted small business grants with academic collaborators without success even though we were leveraging massive computational resources through the world community grid we would recommend that open efforts like this need some funding for in vitro validation millions of dollars have been invested by the nih to fund other zika research projects since the 2016 outbreak and there is as yet no small molecule of note in the drug discovery pipeline 36 there is still therefore an unmet medical need for treatments for zika virus and computational efforts could aid this and be cost-effective the whole genome sequences for sars-cov-2 were isolated from patients from several countries such as brazil canada china germany korea and usa and were made rapidly available at the global initiative on sharing all influenza data gsaid platform 40 there were 135 genomes sampled between december 2019 and february 2020 the samples were found to be closely related with few mutations relative to a common ancestor preliminary genetic analysis indicates that the brazilian genome differs by three mutations to the wuhan reference strain 41 two of these mutations are shared with its closest sequencethe germany strain 41 in the space of a few weeks after the acknowledgement of the latest coronavirus outbreak several laboratories started to deposit homology models for the main viral protease 42 43 and then for all the sars-cov-2 proteins using the server i-tasser 44 others performed docking in these models 45 or developed their own models to understand how the virus enters cells by modeling the spike s protein and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 protein interaction 46 at the time of writing there were structures available for the sars-cov-2 main protease in complex with an inhibitor n3 pdb id 6lu7 47 and s1 and s2 subunits of spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain up 6vsb the post fusion core subunit 6lxt and the hr2 domain 6lvn 48 49 a useful overview is provided by searching the entire virus sequence against the protein data bank pdb see supplementary material fig s2 online in comparison for zika it took several months from the beginning of the outbreak until there was a single protein available in the pdb 50 the spike glycoprotein is responsible for the fusion of the viral membrane with the host-cell membrane during virus maturation it is cleaved to its subunits s1 which attaches the virion to the cell membrane by interacting with the host receptor and s2 which mediates the fusion of the virion and cellular membranes a recent study reports that sars-cov-2 spike protein binds ace2 with higher affinity than sars-cov 48 because there was only one cryo-em structure of sars-cov-2 spike protein with low resolution 346  without the human ace2 protein 48 at the time of writing this paper we preferred to build a model by homology modeling see supplementary material methods online using our sars-cov-2 spike protein model and the available sars-cov spike protein crystal structure pdb 2ajf we aligned both structures to compare the residues in the spikeace2 interface residues for both viruses as can be seen in fig 1
 the residues for sars-cov are asn473 tyr475 tyr440 tyr436 tyr484 leu472 tyr442 and asn479 and for sars-cov-2 are asn167 tyr169 tyr133 tyr129 gln178 phe166 leu135 and gln173 moreover some sars-cov-2 residues such as gln178 phe166 leu135 and gln173 are not conserved but have the same physicalchemical features except the residues sars-cov-2 gln178 polar and sars tyr484 hydrophobic fig 1 the main protease mpro of coronaviruses is a cysteine protease that participates in the viral replication cleaving the polyprotein mpro is organized into three domains and is active in a homodimer form 51 we aligned the crystal structures of mpro of sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 to compare the structures and the residues of the catalytic site the catalytic site for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 are the same his41cys145 52 whereas for mers-cov it is his41cys148 52 fig 2
 this catalytic site is localized between the interface of domain i residues 8101 and ii 102184 the third domain residues 201303 is c-terminal and consists of a loop region required for the dimerization 53 54 55 56 recently it has been reported that the structures of mpro of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 have high identity of 96 43 the function and the structural equivalence of mpro of sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 demonstrate that the coronavirus proteases are promising targets for development of broad-spectrum antivirals in these viruses drug repurposing offers a potentially faster approach to identify drugs that are already approved for other uses and might work for the disease of interest 57 58 59 this type of strategy was attempted for mers-cov and sars-cov 60 61 and the repurposing of host-based therapies has also been proposed for coronaviruses 62 several studies have screened a few hundred molecules and tested the activity against mers-cov and sars-cov table 2
 63 64 the first screen of 348 fda-approved drugs identified four fda-approved drugs including chloroquine chlorpromazine loperamide and lopinavir 63 at the same time a second study screened 290 compounds and identified 27 fda- and non-fda-approved drugs including chloroquine among the many hits 64 and the abl2 kinase inhibitors such as imatinib which impacts the early stages of infection after internalization and endosomal trafficking this latter molecule appears to work by inhibiting fusion at the viral membrane 65 chloroquine is widely used for malaria and loperamide is used for diarrhea these represent drugs that are readily available in many locations around the world and for which physicians are also familiar with the side-effect profile the ligand datasets from these and other screens can be used to apply machine learning methods to produce predictive models that can then be used to screen compound libraries and suggest new compounds to test as an example we have developed several models for ace2 sars-cov and mers-cov using our assay central software 66 67 68 69 which uses ecfp6 descriptors and the bayesian algorithm fig 3
 the experimental details are described in the supplementary material online the bayesian models are also available at httpmodelscollabchemcom8 the advantage of this approach is that the method is fast does not require crystal structures and it enables small-molecule structures to be scored against many models simultaneously as a well-established principle any sars-cov-2 relevant enzyme assay proteinprotein interaction antagonism or viral infectivity determination can be run against a collection of approved drugs however it is neither trivial to get a definitive list of these structures in silico prepared for docking or to acquire these as a physical collection ready for screening even though there are various repurposing subsets available from vendors notwithstanding an approximation to a definitive approved set can be selected in pubchem as the intersect between curated drug resources such as drugbank drugcentral and the iupharbps guide to pharmacology with totals of 9135 4012 and 7674 molecules respectively the three-way compounds-in-common total is 1119 chemical identifiers cid pubchem indicates that 1197 molecules are available from chemical vendors relaxing the stringency of the repurposing provides triage steps that can certainly be useful for docking andor machine learning or other modeling efforts in this case the union of all three drug curation sources is 16468 other drug-centric solutions include the selection of 9527 international non-proprietary names inn cid the majority of these will have either been progressed to phase i testing or are close to it an alternative to screening every approved drug is to take one class of compounds for example we have now taken the opportunity to dock fda-approved hiv-1 protease inhibitors amprenavir atazanavir darunavir fosamprenavir indinavir lopinavir nelfinavir ritonavir saquinavir and tipranavir and hepatitis c ns34a protease inhibitors asunaprevir boceprevir grazoprevir paritaprevir simeprevir and telaprevir into the mpro structure of sars-cov-2 the docking was performed with two different commercial docking software products biovia discovery studio and schrdinger glide 70 71 72 73 and the best docking results were compared see supplementary material table s2 online the results of both docking approaches indicated that azatanavir and lopinavir could be of most interest for in vitro or in vivo testing fig 4
 atazanavir can interact with mpro by h-bonding at cys145 and the amide group the aromatic ring of atazanavir ligandfit score of 191196 also formed hydrophobic interactions with residues cys44 met49 leu50 tyr54 and cys145 in relation to lopinavir ligandfit score of 175497 h-bonds were established between residues cys145 and glu166 and nitrogen atoms of carbamate groups similar hydrophobic interactions were observed with lopinavir fig 4 in china and south korea lopinavir 200 mgritonavir 50 mg has already been used for the treatment of covid-19 from the day after lopinavirritonavir administration the viral load started to decrease and no detectable or little coronavirus titers have been observed since then 11 lopinavir co-formulated with ritonavir is commercially available and known as kaletra around the worldit is on formularies for hiv by contrast atazanavir is less commonly used kaletra can be widely produced and distributed quickly through existing channels but it will be important to ensure hiv patients do not lose access to the medications they need it is also a medication that clinicians are familiar with in terms of side effects unlike other less commonly used medications a broader analysis of all fda-approved drugs docked in this protease structure could point to further drugs worth testing we have also performed docking calculations of sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein complexed with the host ace2 protein against all fda-approved drugs 2400 molecules using schrdinger glide software 70 71 72 73 because there was only one cryo-em structure of sars-cov-2 spike protein with low resolution 346  without the human ace2 protein 48 at the time of doing this analysis we preferred to build a model by homology modeling because lower-resolution structures 3  or higher show the basic contours of the protein chain and the atomic structure must be inferred we built the sars-cov-2 spike subunit s1 model using the swissmodel server 74 the template used was the sars-cov spike s1 protein pdb id 2ghv 75 which has resolution of 22  and 7322 of sequence identity with sars-cov-2 spike protein after the protein refinement we added the human ace2 protein to the model based on the sars-cov spikeace2 structure pdb id 2ajf 76 and built the full sars-cov-2 spike s1ace2 model see fig s5 in supplementary material online the quality statistics of the modeled sars-cov-2 spikeace2 were good 9653 of the residues lie in the most favorable regions of the ramachandran plot and the molprobity score was 166 our sars-cov-2 spikeace2 model is available see supplemental material pdb file online subsequently we performed docking-based virtual screening with a grid centered at the spikeace2 interface as can be seen in table 3
 docking scores indicated that rizatriptan an antimigraine agent glide score  749 kcal mol1 dasabuvir an antiviral for hepatitis c glide score  792 kcal mol1 pravastatin a lipid-lowering agent glide score  781 kcal mol1 and empagliflozin a hypoglycemic agent glide score  709 kcal mol1 could be of interest for in vitro testing details of intermolecular interactions of these drugs with the interface of spikeace2 are shown in fig 5
 in summary these drugs form -cation interactions with lys31a  interactions with phe170b and h-bonds with his34a asp38a gly176b and ser174b in good agreement with our results a previous study suggests that an early and high dose of a statin such as pravastatin could be crucial to surviving mers-cov infection 77 these suggested molecules could be validated in future in vitro experiments modern drug discovery efforts try to eliminate inefficiency by increasing knowledge through extensive utilization of generated data to guide new experiments therefore we have also taken a drug repurposing approach based on polypharmacology using a method called the molecular and biological signature 78 this is a profiling approach guided by artificial intelligence capable of presenting the complex relationships between the chemical substance with molecular targets cells andor organs this could create a more complete understanding of the multi-biological profile caused by the drug analyzed in response to a disease as an example we have applied the drugs ritonavir 9 favipiravir ribavirin and chloroquine as scaffolds to find new potential molecular and biological signature profiles to search for non-obvious mechanism-of-action-based associations between drugs molecular targets and diseases fig 6
 and supplementary material fig s6 and table s3 online comparing the molecular and biological signature of ritonavir with other drugs we found that the drugs cobicistat carfilzomib and ombitasvir presented the highest matching scores 8171 suggesting that those drugs could be of further interest for sars-cov-2 although there are already several drugs being assessed clinically for sars-cov-2 there is still a need to identify additional treatments as alternatives to offset drug shortages and possibly discover molecules with increased efficacy safety and cost-effectiveness we have previously proposed and applied computational drug discovery approaches such as machine learning and docking to aid in the discovery of new candidate molecules for ebola and zika respectively what we have learnt in these efforts can be applied to sars-cov-2 as we have demonstrated here however the research in this case has moved at a much faster pace initially delivering a first crystal structure in just a few weeks after first public notification of the virus companies have mobilized to bring their drugs to patients and clinicians have used prior in vitro research that proposed compounds active against mers-cov and sars-cov to suggest treatments for sars-cov-2 we currently do not clinically use any broad-spectrum antivirals in the usa but they would be invaluable in situations like this for sars-cov-2 and other viruses identifying medications with side-effect profiles known by clinicians that are already produced at scale and available at local pharmacies around the world will allow more patients to be treated especially as travel restrictions and quarantines could reduce production and distribution of certain drugs it will remain important that those who need these medications at baseline such as hiv patients who take ritonavirlopinavir are able to continue to access the medications they need or else there is a risk of poor clinical outcomes and antiviral resistance in these patients although other viruses such as the flu might have killed more patients in the usa this season so far the crippling financial impact of sars-cov-2 remains to be seen globally if past ebola zikv mers-cov and sars-cov outbreaks are anything to go by this sars-cov-2 pandemic will be far more significant having multiple effective treatments available for sars-cov-2 that can be rapidly delivered to patients could save lives we can also supplement these treatments by a combination of computational screening with machine learning and docking to select additional drugs to test as proposed herein and this can be repeated for future virus outbreaks the sense of dj vu will probably be repeated again and again with the next virus outbreaks until we develop broader-spectrum antivirals each time we hope to be better prepared hope however does not save lives effective antiviral treatments do and we need to have them ready in the future se is founder and owner of collaborations pharmaceuticals dhf kmz and acp are employees of collaborations pharmaceuticals rcb is co-founder and cto of insilicall cs is owner of tw2informatics all other authors declare no conflicts of interest collaborations pharmaceuticals owns the trademark for assay central  impact of thioldisulfide balance on the binding
of covid-19 spike protein with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor sanchita hati sudeep bhattacharyya   the novel coronavirus
known as severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 or simply covid-19 is the seventh member
of the coronavirus family1 the other two
viruses in this family that infect humans are severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome
coronavirus mers-cov these are positive-sense single-strand enveloped
rna viruses the coronavirus particles contain four main structural
proteins the spike membrane envelope and nucleocapsid12 the spike protein protrudes from the envelope of the virion and
consists of two subunits a receptor-binding domain rbd that interacts
with the receptor proteins of host cells and a second subunit that
facilitates fusion of the viral membrane into the host cell membrane
recent studies showed that the rbd of spike proteins of sars-cov and
sars-cov-2 interact with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 ace2
belongs to the membrane-bound carboxydipeptidase family it is attached
to the outer surfaces of cells and is widely distributed in the human
body in particular higher expression of ace2 is observed in organs
such as small intestine colon kidney and heart while ace2 expression
is comparatively lower in the liver and lungs34 the role of oxidative stress on the binding of viral proteins on
the host cell surface receptors is a relatively underexplored area
of biomedical research510 previous studies have indicated that the entry of viral glycoprotein
is impacted by thioldisulfide balance on the cell surface5791112 any perturbations in the thioldisulfide equilibrium are
also found to deter the entry of viruses into their target cells5 the first step of the viral entry involves binding
of the viral envelop protein onto a cellular receptor this is followed
by endocytosis after which conformational changes of the viral protein
help the induction of the viral protein into the endosomal membrane
finally releasing the viral content into the cell these conformational
changes are mediated by ph changes as well as the conversion of disulfide
into the thiol group of the viral spike protein7 several cell surface oxidoreductases9 regulate the thioldisulfide exchange responsible
for conformational changes of viral proteins needed for virus entry
into host cells in the backdrop of a significant mortality
rate for sars-cov-2
hereinafter referred to as cov-2 infection it is important to know
if the thioldisulfide balance plays any role in the binding
of the spike glycoprotein onto the host cell receptor protein ace2
a recent study with the spike glycoprotein of sars-cov hereinafter
referred to as cov has exhibited a complete redox insensitivity7 despite the reduction of all disulfide bridges
of cov to thiols its binding to ace2 remained unchanged7 however this study did not probe the redox sensitivity
of the ace2 receptor thus in the present study we computationally
investigated the redox state of both partners ace2 and covcov-2
on their binding affinities the structure of cov13 and cov-21415 complexed with ace2 are known
and the noncovalent interactions at the proteinprotein interface16 have been reported recently using these reported
structures molecular dynamics simulations and electrostatic field
calculations were performed to explore the impact of thioldisulfide
balance on covcov-2 and ace2 binding affinities the structural and
dynamical changes due to the alteration in the redox states of cysteines
in the interacting proteins were analyzed and their effects on binding
free energies were studied in all cases
the simulation started with an equilibrated structure
that was obtained after minimizing the neutralized solvated protein
complex built from the experimentally determined structures the evolution
of the protein structure along the molecular dynamics md trajectory
was monitored by calculating the root-mean-square deviation rmsd
of each structure from the starting structure as a frame of reference
following the standard procedure17 briefly
during the md simulation the protein coordinates were recorded for
every 10 ps interval and an rmsd of each frame was calculated from
the average root-mean-square displacement of backbone c atoms with respect to the initial structure then the rmsd values
averaged over conformations stored during 1 ns time were plotted
against the simulated time figure 3 compared to the starting structure only a moderate
backbone fluctuation was noted in all protein complexes during 20
ns simulations and the maximum of rmsd was in the range of 2038
 table 2 the
evolution of dynamics was smooth and its stability was demonstrated
by the standard deviation of the computed rmsds which was less than
03  taken together the results of the simulations showed
no unexpected structural deformation of the sars-covcov-2ace2
complex in both reduced thiol groups and oxidized disulfide bonds
states table 2 the md simulation results indicated that
the flexibility of different structural elements of the interacting
proteins altered upon the cleavage of disulfide bridges oxidized
state producing sulfydryl thiol groups reduced state for each
complex the impact of the reduction of the disulfide bridges was
probed by calculating residue-level root-mean-square fluctuations
rmsf of c atoms with respect to the average structure
from its md simulation trajectory changes in the backbone flexibility
due to complete reduction of all disulfides to thiols of both interacting
proteins are shown in figure 4ab where the backbone is color-coded to indicate the magnitude
of thermal fluctuations larger and smaller backbone fluctuations
are shown in red and blue respectively whereas the medium fluctuation
regions are shown in green the backbone fluctuation analysis demonstrated
that the cleavage of disulfide bridges indeed affected the flexibility
of the local regions as they became more dynamic figure 4b a significant alteration
in backbone flexibility was noticed at the interface of cov and ace2
subunits when both proteins are in the fully reduced states ie
all disulfides are changed to sulfydryl groups as it is evident from figure 4b the helix residues
5264 of ace2 became very mobile due to the rupture of the
nearby c344c361 disulfide the second region belongs to the flexible
loop consisting of residues 463474 of the cov subunit residues
478489 of the cov-2 subunit which interacts with the n-terminal
segment of the ace2 the cleavage of the disulfides c467c474 in
cov and c480c488 in cov-2 resulted in higher thermal fluctuation the computed gibbs
binding free energy bindg
of protein complexes table 3 demonstrated that the binding of cov or cov-2 with ace2
occurs because the attractive electrostatic interactions between the
individual subunits prevail over the desolvation due to the complexation
the complex formation results in desolvation from proteins
surfaces at the proteinprotein interface thereby producing
a positive solvgcorr for all protein systems table 3 for the formation of a stable proteinprotein
complex this energy has to be counterbalanced by the negative electrostatic
interactions coulg between the
interacting proteins when the disulfides of
the rbd of cov and cov-2 were reduced to
thiols the impact of reduction on the binding of these two proteins
with ace2 was different the computed bindg for covoxace2ox and covredace2ox are 73
and 112 kcalmol respectively table 3 indicating a slightly tighter binding
of the reduced cov rbd to ace2 the experimentally known kd value for the covoxace2ox system is 325 nm14 which corresponds
to a bindg value of 89
kcalmol therefore the computationally determined bindg for covoxace2ox binding is comparable to the experimental value although
there is no experimentally determined kd available for the covredace2ox system the binding assay with covred rbd was found to
have no redox sensitivity for its binding to ace27 the small favorability of covredace2ox binding as observed from the computation indicates that
the reduction of cov did not have much impact on its binding affinity
for ace2 and could explain the experimentally observed redox insensitivity7 in the case of cov-2 its binding with ace2 became
less favorable when all of the disulfides of rbd were reduced to thiols
the computed gibbs binding free energies were increased by 45
kcalmol for the reduced cov-2 bindgo of cov-2oxace2ox and cov-2redace2ox are 104
and 60 kcalmol respectively in contrast the reduction
of disulfides of ace2 impaired the binding
significantly for both cov and cov-2 proteins the gibbs binding free
energies of viral spike proteins cov and cov-2 with ace2red namely covoxace2red and
cov-2oxace2red are 34
and 38 kcalmol respectively these bindg values are 4 to 6 kcalmol more
positive than what were observed for the oxidized forms of ace2 ie
covoxace2ox and cov-2oxace2ox in table 3 however when all disulfides in covcov-2
as well as ace2 were reduced to thiols the binding became thermodynamically
unfavorable in both cases the binding free energies have positive
values bindg of covredace2red and cov-2redace2red are 520 and 573 kcalmol
respectively these results indicate that the binding will be severely
impacted when the disulfides of both interacting proteins are converted
to thiols this finding is potentially significant as it indicates
that the cleavage of disulfide bridges in ace2 has a significant destabilizing
effect on the spike protein binding the conjoined two helices of
ace2 residues 1953 and residues
5694 form a complementary shape figure 5 that fits into the concave-shaped loop--sheet-loop
motif residues 460490 of cov and residues 475505
of cov-2 of rbd of viral spike proteins the loss of disulfide bridges
in ace2 had a strong impact on the junction of the two conjoined helices
figure 5 covredace2red this region is close
to the disulfide bridge c344c361 and its cleavage has a significant
impact on the shape complementarity at the proteinprotein
interface similarly the loss of c467c474 disulfide in cov c480c488
in cov-2 resulted in a significant conformational change in the loop
region which was displaced away from the proteinprotein interface
by 6  indicating a reduced binding interaction as confirmed
by the binding free energy calculations this conformational change
as well as the alteration in the backbone flexibility figure 4 must have resulted in impaired
binding of covcov-2 with ace2 the study found that the reduction of all disulfides into sulfydryl
groups completely impairs the binding of sars-covcov-2 spike protein
to ace2 this is evident from the positive gibbs energy of binding
bindg obtained for both
covredace2red and cov-2redace2red complexes when the
disulfides of only ace2 were reduced to sulfydryl groups the binding
becomes weaker as bindg
becomes less negative by 46 kcalmol with respect to the fully
oxidized systems on the other hand the reduction of disulfides of
the rbd of cov-2 has comparatively less effect on bindg while the reduction of disulfides in cov
rbd does not impact the binding with ace2 this finding is consistent
with the observed redox insensitivity of the binding between cov and
ace27 the redox environment of cell
surface receptors is regulated by
the thioldisulfide equilibrium in the extracellular region1218 this is maintained by glutathione transporters19 a number of oxidoreductases12 including protein disulfide isomerase8 and several redox switches12 under oxidative
stress the extracellular environment becomes oxidation-prone resulting
in more disulfide formation on protein surfaces12 therefore under severe oxidative stress the cell surface
receptor ace2 and rbd of the intruding viral spike protein are likely
to be present in its oxidized form having predominantly disulfide
linkages this computational study shows that under oxidative stress
the lack of a reducing environment would result in significantly favorable
binding of the viral protein on the cell surface ace2 in terms of
energetics this computational study demonstrates that the oxidized
form of proteins with disulfide bridges would cause more than 50 kcalmol
of decrease in gibbs binding free energy furthermore ace2 which
the viral spike proteins latch on to is known to be a key player
in the remedial of oxidative stress20 binding
of the viral protein will prevent the key catalytic function of ace2
of converting angiotensin 2 a strong activator of oxidative stress
to angiotensin 17 thereby creating a vicious circle of enhanced
viral attack in summary the present study demonstrates that the
absence of or reduced oxidative stress would have a significant beneficial
effect during the early stage of viral infection by preventing viral
protein binding on the host cells setting up of
protein systems and all structural manipulations were carried out

hbuild module of charmm ionic amino acid residues were maintained
in a protonation state corresponding to ph 7 the protonation state
of histidine residues was determined by computing the pka using the propka option of pdb 2pqr the protein structures
were explicitly solvated with water of the tip3p model and neutralized
by adding with 24 sodium atoms the prepared solvated protein complexes
were of dimensions 92   132   104  for
sars-cov and 94   144   100  for sars-cov-2
systems21 all systems were subjected
to equilibration for 50 ps following equilibration 20 ns md simulations
were performed for each system the velocities and positions of atoms

all simulations were run with namd implementation of langevin dynamics32 at a constant temperature of 298 k using periodic

a cutoff of 14  and a pairlistdist of 16  gibbs
free energies of binding between the ace2 and sars-cov or cov-2
proteins were calculated using apbs a standardized method of a treecode-accelerated
boundary integral poissonboltzmann tabi-pb equation solver33 in this method the protein surface is triangulated
and electrostatic surface potentials are computed the discretization
of surface potentials is utilized to compute the net energy due to
solvation as well as electrostatic interactions between the two protein
subunits as outlined in the thermodynamic scheme scheme 1 following scheme 1 the free energy of binding
of the two protein fragments in water can be expressed as a sum of
two components eq 11where coulg represents the coulombic electrostatic
interactions between the
proteins occurring at the proteinprotein interface scheme 1 and solvg is the difference of the solvation energies
between the complex and the corresponding free proteins2however
the solvation calculation used only
part of the entire spike protein as well as the ace2 therefore bindgtabi-pb was calibrated
by correcting solvg using
experimentally known binding free energy of ace2cov-23where kd  37
nm is the experimental dissociation constant16 the corrected free energy of the solvation4using gcorr and eq 4 the corrected
binding free energy bindg
of all protein complexes is expressed by5as shown in eq 4 the combination of the last two terms in eq 5 is equal to solvgcorr therefore eq 5 can be simplified as6  architecture of the sars coronavirus prefusion spike daniel beniac r anton andonov elsie grudeski tim booth f   the surface protein or spike of enveloped viruses is an essential component for infection of the host cell responsible for both binding to cellular receptors and subsequent fusion of viral and cellular membranes cell attachment and entry are crucial functions affecting the host range and cell tropism of viral infections fusion is achieved through conformational changes in the fusion core of the spike molecule1 allowing entry of viral nucleocapsids into the host cell to initiate replication coronaviruses commonly cause relatively mild respiratory infections in humans2 and their spike protein gives these viruses their distinctive crown-like appearance3 coronavirus spikes are trimeric globular proteins approximately 150  in diameter and are attached to the virion envelope by a narrow stalk fig 1 in sars-cov the spike has a mass of about 500 kda3 making it the largest type 1 viral fusion spike protein45 only a small part 18 of the prefusion sars-cov spike structure including the fusion core6 and receptor-binding domain7 has hitherto been solved to atomic resolution the fusion core of sars-cov consists of two heptad-repeat regions and is highly similar to those of other coronaviruses8 and to other type 1 fusion proteins such as hemagglutinin ha from influenza5 gp41 from human immunodeficiency virus4 and the fusion protein of paramyxovirus9 the entire spike gene is highly conserved across all three main coronavirus groups suggesting that these groups are specialized for a common mode of attachment in addition to sharing a similar fusion mechanism with other type 1 fusion proteins8 we set out to delineate the complete sars-cov spike structure using cryo-em and molecular docking to determine the positions of the fusion core and receptor-binding domains for structural investigations we inoculated vero e6 cells with sars-cov purified virus particles from the supernatant using an iodoxanol density gradient supplementary methods and supplementary fig 1 online and analyzed intact virion preparations by cryo-em fig 1 and three-dimensional image processing supplementary figs 2 and 3 online to ensure biological safety specimens were -irradiated and viral inactivation was verified the irradiation dose used 2 mrad caused no obvious changes in virion structure and we observed no radiolysis of viral proteins in sds-page results moreover antigenicity to both patient sera and monoclonal antibodies was retained as measured by elisa and western blotting supplementary fig 1 indicating that epitopes were structurally intact radiation effects are random so no structural changes were expected to appear after image averaging although sars-cov virions appear to be pleomorphic in negative-staining images they are much more regular in shape when observed by cryo-em fig 1 virions average 1185  in diameter including the spikes with a 36--thick lipid bilayer envelope that is approximately spherical and has an average diameter of 865  fig 1 most are rounded and are readily observed in the frozen-hydrated state although some virions are oval or kidney-shaped individual spikes can be seen from both the side-view and end-on perspectives fig 1ad images of spherical virus n  140 were selected aligned and circularly averaged fig 1 giving a maximum average diameter of 864  44  with a gap of about 40  between the envelope and nucleocapsid fig 1ab the inner core or nucleocapsid is a density inside the lipid envelope with radius of approximately 320  fig 1ad image processing showed that the spike has three distinct lobes visible in end-on view with a triangular shape projecting 160  above the viral envelope fig 1e confirming that it is trimeric a three-dimensional reconstruction of the spike of sars-cov fig 1e was generated using projection matching of 8386 individual spike images taken at a range of defocus values from 33 to 127  the envelope-anchored spike has a structure about 180  in diameter with three distinct protuberances or domains 50  thick on each subunit of the trimer similar in appearance to the blades of a propeller and a thin stalk connecting the spike to the viral envelope the blades are twisted at an angle of 30 to the axis of symmetry and are almost certainly composed of the s1 domain of the sars-cov s polypeptide supplementary fig 4 online although the -helices of the hr2 fusion core domain cannot be identified at 16- resolution estimated by fourier shell correlation supplementary fig 3 we were able to dock the hr2 structure6 within the trimer using situs correlation coefficient  0966 fig 2 and supplementary fig 4 the location of the domain is constrained in that it must form the stalk of the spike and the base must contain the transmembrane region to attach to the virion envelope the fusion core must also extend distally away from the virion envelope and be centered on the three-fold axis of symmetry for comparison prefusion ha from influenza pdb entry 1ha010 is shown at the same resolution fig 2b the stalks of both structures are similar in size and shape fig 2ab containing a deep groove green and helical left-handed struts on the vertices orange both stalks have a distinct lobe on one side of the groove the right side in fig 2 that corresponds to the uncleaved fusion peptide in the influenza structure two cell-surface molecules ace-2 and cd209 have been shown to act as receptors for the sars-cov spike protein711 using situs we docked the spike proteins ace-2 receptorbinding domain structure within the spike at the distal end fig 2 and supplementary fig 4 with a high correlation score of 0891 this location for the ace-2binding region on the sars spike is consistent with a cell surfacebinding function and is equivalent to the receptor-binding domain of influenza ha which is also at the distal end of the molecule the average angle between each spike from 145 angle measurements is 238  97 fig 1a this gives an average of 65 trimeric spikes per virus particle fig 1f assuming even spacing on a spherical surface 865  in diameter this is close to the 667 trimeric spikes per virion that has been predicted by biochemical studies12 larger virions with an envelope diameter of 1000  are estimated to have about 100 spikes three different models of the virus with icosahedral distributions of 60 spikes were tested by projection matching against a subset of the data containing the 140 roundest images in all three cases the spikes were blurred in the reconstruction indicating a nonicosahedral distribution or a virion surface that is too irregular to reveal symmetry our findings demonstrate that the sars-cov has an envelope with an inner protein core shell fig 1 enclosing a volume of lower density consistent with an rna content immunogold labeling of disrupted virions resulted in labeled nucleocapsid protein on this internal layer supplementary fig 1 the envelope of sars-cov contains very large club-shaped spikes this may be a functional adaptation allowing multiple receptor specificities for large 45- to 90-kda molecules mutations in the spike gene are correlated with altered pathogenesis and virulence in other coronaviruses1314 thus the coronavirus spike structure may confer redundancy that enhances host range and

classified into four genera alpha-coronavirus beta-coronavirus gamma-coronavirus and delta-coronavirus cui et al 2019 perlman and netland 2009 they are enveloped positive-stranded rna viruses containing the largest genome among all rna viruses ranging from 27 to 32 kb fehr and perlman 2015 after the release of the sars-cov-2 genome sequence it has been classified as beta-coronavirus closely related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov that emerged in 2002-2003 ksiazek et al 2003 peiris et al 2003 the coronaviruses spike protein s forms large protrusions from the virus surface spikes giving the viral particles the appearance of having crowns hence their name coronavirus cui et al 2019 perlman and netland 2009 zumla et al 2016 these spikes represent the first contact with the host and mediate the virus entry into host cells besides the s protein has been linked to host and tissue tropism du et al 2009 li 2016 structurally the coronavirus spikes are clove-shaped trimers of the s protein with the asymmetric unit containing a large ectodomain a single-pass transmembrane anchor and a short intracellular tail kirchdoerfer et al 2016 smith et al 2016 the ectodomain consists of a receptor-binding subunit s1 and a membrane-fusion subunit s2 with the s1 subunit containing distinct n-terminal and c-terminal domains s1-ntd and s1-ctd beniac et al 2006 walls et al 2016 one of the major complexities of coronaviruses is their receptor recognition pattern to date several receptors have been found to be recognized by different coronaviruses li 2015 li 2016 among these receptors zinc peptidases such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 hofmann et al 2005 li et al 2003 and aminopeptidase n apn delmas et al 1993 li et al 2007 dipeptidyl

schwegmann-wessels and herrler 2006 in this report we compared the composition and the structural features of the s protein receptor-binding domains between the sars-cov-2 and related viruses especially the sars-cov and tried to extrapolate the findings to shed some light on possible functioning of this s protein of the new coronavirus especially the receptor-binding domains a total of 1652 sequences of s proteins of sars-cov-2 isolates from 29 countries were retrieved the majority of the sequences were for the usa 1451 followed by china 66 supplementary file 1 the sequence identity to the reference sequence yp0097243901 varied from 997 to 100 indicating thus a high degree of conservation nearly 40 of these sequences were identical to the reference sequence while the other 60 presented mostly single mutations one mutated position in each sequence the mutated positions 77 in total are reported in supplementary file 1 however of these mutated positions three were shared by several sequences position 791 where thr was mutated to ile in 5 of the taiwanese sequences position 829 where ala was mutated to thr in 9 sequences from thailand and more importantly the apparition of gly instead of asp at position 614 in 923 sequences it is to note that all these three positions are located in the s2 subunit the s protein of the sars-cov-2 shares 9741 amino acid similarity with the recently identified bat-cov ratg13 isolate 8032 with a bat sars-like cov and only 7627 identity with the sars-cov gz02 isolate moreover compared to the s1 subunit the s2 subunit of the s proteins was found more conserved in the four strains fig 1
and table 1
 further by comparing segments of 100aa of the sars-cov-2 s protein to the other three coronaviruses fig 1a the results indicated that the region spanning aa1-400 of the s protein was more similar to the new bat isolate 90 than to the sars- or the bat sars-like strains a more pronounced dissimilarity was noted at the regions spanning aa401-500 and aa601-700 which correspond to the c-terminal domain of the s1 subunit s1-ctd the s1-ntd of the sars-cov-2 is highly similar to that of the newly isolated bat coronavirus ratg13 98 but shares roughly 53 and 67 with those of the sars-cov or bat sars-like cov respectively table 1 structurally we used the dali server for aligning the s1-ntd of the sars-cov-2 with other coronaviruses from the different genera table 2
 as expected the s1-ntd of the sars-cov-2 was more similar to those of the beta-coronaviruses especially the sars-cov the highest z-score highest sequence identity and the lowest rmsd however all the ntds were aligned with z-scores ranging from 6 to 221 and rmsds ranging from 11 to 42 this similarity is due to the galectin-like topology of the ntds core structures as previously documented li 2012 the primary sequence alignment also revealed some insertions shared by the sars-cov-2 and bat coronavirus ratg13 but not the sars-cov located at positions aa72-82 aa144-147 aa244-246 and aa255-257 of the sars-cov-2 s protein fig 2
 to further investigate the structural role of these inserts we searched the protein data bank using the largest insert 72gtngtkr78 with 5 amino acids extensions on both n- and c-terminal sides leading to 17aa long segment 67aihvsgtngtkrfdnpv83 then we analyzed the hits to see whether the aligned motifs were engaged in any identified structural function table 3
 when we searched the protein databank using the gtngtkr motif the first hit was the structure of the mengo virus vp1 protein fig 3
a the aligned segment was located on the vp1 gh loop which forms along with the vp3 c-terminal loop a depression on the capsid that has been associated with receptor recognition and binding kim et al 1990 krishnaswamy and rossmann 1990 although the depression described in the mengo virus capsid is absent in the s1-ntd of the sars-cov-2 the target motif 72gtngtkrfdn81 forms a similarly exposed loop with two neighboring loops containing the 255ssg257 motif the identified insert 4 and the n-terminal loop 18ltt20 motif on both sides fig 3b whether this formation could play the same role as the mengo virus vp1 and vp3 loops which would in turn allow the sars-cov-2 to interact with the same receptor need further investigation moreover the mengo virus has been found to bind the murine cellular receptor vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 vcam-1 to enter and infect cells huber 1994 this receptor molecule is restricted to endothelial cells and is subject to upregulation under cytokines stimulation hosokawa et al 2006 singh et al 2005 given the high cytokine amounts stimulated by the sars-cov-2 huang et al 2020 and pre-existing heart disease hypertension and coronary heart disease being one of the major co-morbidities of the fatality cases deng and peng 2020 it is interesting to explore the possibility of the sars-cov-2 binding the vcam-1 receptor via its s1-ntd the mouse hepatitis coronavirus mhv also binds another cell adhesion molecule the murine carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1a mceacam1a using its s1-ntd peng et al 2011 therefore as a next step we compared the mhv and sars-cov-2 s1-ntds we found that the receptor-binding motif of the mhv s1-ntd also presents a motif 168ntngnk173 with some similarity to insert 1 72gtngtkr78 of the sars-cov-2 s1-ntd however when the s1-ntds were compared in the quaternary structures of the s proteins the above motifs seem to occupy opposite positions fig 3c and d besides peng et al identified four receptor binding motifs in the mhv s1-ntd rbm1-4 peng et al 2011 by comparing the mhv-receptor interaction interface and the exposed amino acids on the receptor-binding surface of the sars-cov-2 s1-ntd we found that the n-terminal aa15-21 segments adopt different conformations fig 3d and this segment in the mhv rbm1 contains three residues critical for receptor binding affinity peng et al 2011 therefore it seems unlikely that the sars-cov-2 would bind the same receptor however this observation should be taken with care since it is based on the predicted model of the sars-cov-2 s1-ntd taken all together the presence of the gtngtkr motif in the sars-cov-2 s1-ntd seems to be a potentially evolutionary feature that sars-cov-2 acquired to allow its s1-ntd to bind to protein receptors we believe that the above observations are worth investigating another structure containing the analyzed motif was the tail spike protein 1 of the bacteriophage cba120 podoviridae chen et al 2014 the aligned motif gtngtk was located within the receptor-binding domain in the inverting region connecting the subdomain d3 and d4 interestingly unlike other tail spike proteins where the sugar-binding sites were located on the d3 subdomain barbirz et al 2008 muller et al 2008 steinbacher et al 1996 xiang et al 2009 the d3-d4 inverting region of the cba120 tail spike protein generates a hole that forms the sugar-binding site chen et al 2014 although the target motif was not directly involved in the sugars interactions the binding site hole is formed in the opposite direction of the gtngtk loop and a quite similar orientation of the motif is observed in the sars-cov-2 s1-ntd fig 4
 besides what could be the counterparts of the sugar-binding pocket of the cba120 tail spike protein is one of the two pockets formed in the sars-cov-2 s1-ntd the first situated on the top part of the domain and the other located above the -sandwich core in the opposite direction of the gtngtkr loop fig 4c this latter pocket is also aligned with the sugar-binding site in the ntd of bovine coronavirus bcov fig 5
a and c peng et al peng et al 2012 reported that the pocket above the -sandwich core is the sugar-binding site in bcov ntd and through mutagenesis studies they identified 4 residues critical for the ntd-receptor interaction y162 e182 w184 and h185 and the binding was stabilized by the loop 1011 146ndlnkl151 fig 5c interestingly the corresponding pocket in the sars-cov-2 ntd also contains three amino acids e154 f157 and y160 with the same orientation than the four key residues identified in the bcov ntd moreover the positions of e154 and y160 are strikingly similar to that of y162 and e182 in bcov ntd fig 5d besides a counterpart of the stabilizing loop 10-11 is also present in the sars-cov-2 ntd although shorter but seems to share the nxxn motif these observations suggest that sars-cov-2 ntd might recognize a sugar receptor as well and it is likely to be the same neu59ac2 that bcov ntd binds to peng et al 2012 the tngtrrf motif was also present in the infectious bronchitis coronavirus ibv spike protein despite the low primary sequence identity 11 the pairwise structural alignment revealed that the sars-cov-2 s1-ntd shared a relatively high structural similarity with the s1-ntd of the ibv with a dali z-score of 86 and rmsd of 31 over 159 aligned residues table 2 the aligned motif tngtrrf was located within the s1-ctd of the ibv in the subdomain connecting s1 and s2 shang et al 2018 although no functional features have been described for the subdomains of the s1-ntds and s1-ctds in the coronaviruses spikes the target motif was found protruding from the surface of the trimer fig 6
a suggesting that such protrusion might interact with the surrounding environment the aligned fragment was also located at the c-terminal of the mimivirus cyclophilin but it was missing from the deposited structure thai et al 2008 further the authors did not link any structural function of the segment of interest however it is to note that this is the first virus-encoded cyclophilin but it lacks peptidyl-prolyl isomerase an activity that several viruses such human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and sars-cov exploit the host cyclophilin for chen et al 2005 sorin and kalpana 2006 interestingly the viral cyclophilin was located on the surface of mature mimivirus virions and given the absence of the catalytic activity the authors suggested that the protein may play a structural role yet to be identified in the mimivirus life cycle thai et al 2008 since the mimivirus can cause pneumonia in humans la scola et al 2005 saadi et al 2013 and the exact position of the cyclophilin is yet to be determined a question could be asked whether the 221ngtkrf226 motif could play a role in the virus pathogenesis that could be shared by the sars-cov-2 besides viruses the search for a functional gtngtkr motif in the deposited protein structures revealed a similar motif in the folylpolyglutamate synthetase fpgs of lactobacillus casei an enzyme that catalyzes the mgatp-dependent glutamylation of folate coenzymes fig 6b the aligned motif 42ihvtgtng49 was located on the putative nucleotide-binding p loop gtngkgs that resembles the consensus p-loop sequence found in many other adenylate and uridylate kinase smith and rayment 1996 sun et al 1998 moreover a  loop near the p loop binding site was also suggested to play a role in the activity of the fpgs especially the serine residue interestingly a similarly shaped loop is also found in the sars-cov-2 s1-ntd adjacent to the gtngtkr loop formed by the insert 4 254sssg257 also rich in serine residues fig 6c and d given the severity and the widespread nature of the infection it is safe to assume that the sars-cov-2 has a more efficient way to penetrate and infect cells besides based on the comparison of the sars-cov-2 and sars-cov receptor-binding domains it seems that sars-cov-2 evolved in a way that allowed it to maintain and enhance the binding of the ace2 receptor via its s1-ctd but also acquired a different s1-ntd that according to our analysis might bind other receptors protein or sugar receptor more precisely the acquisition of the gtngtkr motif found at the active sites of structural and nonstructural proteins of other viruses and organisms might allow the sars-cov-2 to recognize other receptorsco-receptors besides the ace2 moreover our results suggest that the apparition of the gtngtkr motif points more toward an evolutionary trait of the sars-cov-2 rather than the hypothesis of an engineered virus under functional constraints proteins tend to evolve in a way that their tertiary structures could perform the needed functions regardless of the changes in their primary sequences goldstein 2008 siltberg-liberles et al 2011 worth et al 2009 and the two main factors driving the evolution of the s proteins are the need for better adaptation to the host receptors and the need to evade the immune system of the host to ensure better infectivity li 2015 li 2016 therefore it is more plausible to assume that the sars-cov-2 acquired the gtngtkr motif during its evolutionary parkour under functional constraints as for the exact mechanism of acquisition and the origin of this motif we believe that further investigations are needed not only in the context of the sars-cov-2 infection but as a pertinent motif for viral proteins activity in general a total of 1652 sars-cov-2 s protein complete sequences available at the ncbi virus portal were retrieved the sequences of sars-cov gc02 isolate ay390556 and two bat isolates a bat sars-like coronavirus mg772934 and the recently isolated ratg13 bat coronavirus mn996532 were also retrieved and their s glycoproteins were compared to that of the sars-cov-2 refseq yp0097243901 first we performed a multiple alignment of the s proteins of the 1652 sars-cov-2 strains to see if any dissimilarities were present and analyzed the occurrence of mutations in comparison to the reference sequence next we compared the similarity of the s glycoprotein of the sars-cov-2 refseq yp0097243901 to that of the selected 4 related coronaviruses strains mentioned above 1 aligning the full-length proteins of the 4 stains altogether 2 aligning the full-length sars-cov-2 s protein to that of each of the related strains separately 3 aligning portions 100aa windows of the sars-cov-2 s protein by to that of each of the related strains separately all sequence alignments were performed using the muscle algorithm implemented in the mega-x software or blastp suite of the us national library of medicine for the search of motifs similar to the gtngtkr motif in the protein data bank deposited structures the blastp suite of the us national library of medicine was used by adjusting parameters to search for a short input sequence three crystal structures of the sars-cov-2 spike protein containing the s1-ntd were retrieved from the protein data bank pdb id 6vyb 6vxx and 6vsb since all of these structures lacks some fragments of

interests to declare  high affinity binding of sars-cov-2 spike protein enhances ace2 carboxypeptidase activity jinghua lu peter sun d  a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 has emerged to a global pandemic and caused significant damages to public health human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2ace2 was identified as the entry receptor for sars-cov-2 as a carboxypeptidase ace2 cleaves many biological substrates besides ang ii to control vasodilatation and permeability given the nanomolar high affinity between ace2 and sars-cov-2 spike protein we wonder how this interaction would affect the enzymatic activity of ace2 surprisingly sars-cov-2 trimeric spike protein increased ace2 proteolytic activity 3-10 fold when fluorogenic caspase-1 substrate and bradykinin-analog peptides were used to characterize ace2 activity in addition the enhancement was mediated by ace2 binding of rbd domain of sars-cov-2 spike these results highlighted the altered activity of ace2 during sars-cov-2 infection and would shed new lights on the pathogenesis of covid-19 and its complications for better treatments  the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 has emerged as an unprecedented global pandemic 1 2 3 and as of june 8 2020  there are nearly 7 million confirmed cases worldwide leading to 400857 deathswho the infection of sars-cov-2 causes fever dry cough severe respiratory illness and pneumonia a disease recently named covid-19 4  pathological studies have revealed all features of diffuse alveolar damage dad with excessive fluid in the lungs and critically ill patients often need ventilators to support oxygen furthermore a frequent complication of covid-19 that blood clotted abnormally is observed in many hospitalized patients 5  therefore there is an urgent need for a mechanistic understanding of the pathogenicity of sars-cov-2 and its concomitant complications to be able to treat hospitalized patients during the sudden emergency and rapid spread of sars-cov-2 global efforts have identified human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2ace2 as the entry receptor for this new coronavirus 2  which was also the entry receptor for sars-cov 6 7 8  structural studies revealed that sars-cov-2 spike s glycoprotein binds ace2 with higher affinity 15-40nm than sars-cov spike protein 9 10 11 12  the overall structure of sars-cov-2 s resembles that of sars-cov s with the rbd domain of one protomer in spike protein trimer tightly interacting ace2 extracellular enzymatic domain physiologically ace2 is a zinc metalloprotease carboxypeptidase a homolog to dipeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme ace but with different substrate specificity 13  ace cleaves the c-terminal dipeptide from ang i to produce the potent vasopressor octapeptide ang ii whereas ace2 further cleaves the carboxylterminus to produce ang 1-7 to deactivate ang ii therefore ace and ace2 together play important roles in regulating vasoconstriction and vasodilatation in the rennin-angiotensin system ras in the meanwhile ace and ace2 plays critical role in kinin-kallikrein system to control vascular permeability and vasodilatation 14  ace deactivates bradykinin nonapeptide the ligand for constitutively expressed bradykinin receptor b2 bradykinin can be further processed by carboxypeptidase n or m to form des-arg9-bradykinin which is a potent ligand for inflammation-inducible bradykinin receptor b1 15  renin-angiotensin and kinin-kallikrein systems ace2 also cleaves other biological peptides such as apelin-13 that activates apelin receptor to cause vasodilatation however there is limited information on the level of these substrates during sars-cov-2 infection given the fact that ace2 is the major entry receptor for this new coronavirus compared to relatively low expression of ace ace2 is predominantly expressed in the lung on pneumocytes ii which explains that lung is the major organ infected by sars-cov-2 critical clinical observations showed that covid-19 patients often had dyspnea and accumulation of fluid in the lungs representing local angioedema which clearly suggests the pathological involvement of vascular permeability and vasodilatation during sars-cov-2 infection however there was no direct assessment of ace2 enzymatic activity during coronavirus infection here we examined how the binding of sars-cov-2 spike protein would affect the intrinsic enzymatic activity of ace2 using one well characterized fluorogenic ace2 substrate the caspase-1 substrate mca-yvadapk-dnp 13  in comparison ace substrate a bradykinin analog mca-rppgfsafk-dnp was also included in the enzymatic activity assessment 16  to our surprise sars-cov-2 spike enhanced ace2 proteolytic activity to cleave mca-yvadapk-dnp which was mediated by ace2 binding of rbd furthermore sars-cov-2 rbd enhanced ace2 activity to hydrolyze the bradykinin-analog better than sars-cov rbd measurements of kinetic constants also showed that sars-cov-2 spike protein altered the binding affinity k m  of ace2 to the caspase-1 substrate or bradykinin-analog we propose that this new line of evidence that sars-cov-2 spike protein significantly alters ace2 activity and specificity could be clinically relevant to the understanding of the pathogenesis of covid-19 genetic analysis revealed that sars-cov-2 was highly homologous to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov that infected human cells with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2ace2 receptor 2 8  after the outbreak of covid-19 ace2 was quickly identified as the entry receptor for sar-cov-2 as well further structural studies demonstrated that both sars-cov-2 and sars-cov utilized their rbd domain to interact with ace2 at a very similar binding mode however sars-cov-2 spike protein displays a much higher binding affinity to ace2 compared with sars-cov given the nanomolar affinity between ace2 and sars-cov-2 s spike protein we wonder how the binding of sars-cov-2 spike protein to ace2 would affect its enzymatic activity since ace2 is a critical component in both the rennin-angiotensin and kinin-kallikrein system as a carboxypeptidase 14 17  as previously reported ace2 efficiently hydrolyzes biological peptides with a consensus sequence of pro-x1-3 residues-pro-hydrophobic at p5-p1 positions 13  with cleavage between proline and the hydrophobic residue as exemplified by ang ii drvyihpf and des-arg 9 -bk rppgfspf ace2 also cleaves peptides with a basic residue at p1 position such as dynorphin a yggflrrirpklk and neurotensin 1-8pe-lyenkpr to rapidly and continuously assess enzyme activity fluorogenic peptide substrates were normally used therefore we monitored ace2 proteolytic activity by measuring the degradation of fluorogenic capase-1 substrate mca-yvadapkdnp 13  in addition a bradykinin figure 1a  similarly sars-cov-2 spike protein enhanced ace2 cleavage of bradykinin analog mca-rppgfsafkdnp-oh to produce 3 times more rfu within 2 hours  figure 1b  previous enzymatic assays showed that ace2 activity increased with the concentrations of nacl between 015m to 1m we then carried out the same enzymatic assays at increased concentration of nacl consistently sars-cov-2 spike protein enhanced ace2 activity at 03m and 1m nacl and enabled ace2 to cleave bradykinin-analog as well supplementary figure 1  indicating the enhancement was resulted by the interaction between sars-cov-2 spike protein and ace2 furthermore the enhancement of ace2 activity by sars-cov-2 spike protein was at a concentration dependent manner in the enzymatic assays we added various concentrations of sars-cov-2 spike protein ranging from 70ugml to 04ugml the dilution of sars-cov-2 spike protein in the assays gradually mitigated the enhancement of ace2 activity with a clear transition between 35ugml and 7ugml of sars-cov-2 spike protein figure 1 c and d  the dose dependent enhancement of ace2 activity by sars-cov-2 spike protein was in line with the binding affinity between ace2 and sars-cov-2 spike protein which was reported to be 147nm equivalent to 7ugml previous studies showed that sars-cov infection may lead to the internalization of ace2 receptor and thus decrease the cell surface level of ace2 6  however examining the lung tissue 3 days post infection of sars-cov-2 virus in ace2 transgenic mice showed colocalization of sars-cov-2 spike protein and ace2 receptor on the cell surface 7 18  further supporting sars-cov-2 spike formed a stable interaction with ace2 for the cell entry in addition the lasting interaction between sars-cov-2 spike and ace2 on the cell surface suggests that the observed enhancement of ace2 activity in solution might happen in vivo as well sars-cov-2 and sars-cov spike protein were highly homologous in their prefusion trimeric architectures with one receptor binding domain rbd for ace2 binding however sars-cov-2 spike protein binds to ace2 at 5-10 fold higher affinity than sars-cov spike 9 11  we then determined whether rbd domain itself would be sufficient to boost ace2 activity the results showed that both sars-cov-2 rbd and sars-cov rbd enhanced ace2 cleavage of caspase-1 substrate figure 2 a and b demonstrating that sars-cov-2 and sars-cov rbd alone is sufficient to enhance ace2 activityace2 the enhancement of ace2 activity by sars-cov-2 rbd protein showed a concentration dependent saturation with half maximal enhancement at 70nm whereas sars-cov rbd protein enhances ace2 activity almost linearly between 63nm and 1000nm with half maximal enhancement at 170nm  figure 2e  nevertheless only sars-cov-2 rbd but not sars-cov rbd could increase the cleavage of mca-rppgfsafkdnp-oh by ace2 figure 2 c d and f as recently reported sars-cov-2 rbd bound to ace2 at nanomolar affinities30-50nm while sars-cov rbd bound to ace2 at sub-micromolar affinities180-400nm the different capabilities of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov rbd proteins to enhance ace2 enzymatic activity suggested that a more stable interaction between rbd and ace2 was necessary for its cleavage of non-optimal substrates such as bradykinin analog to further characterize how efficiently ace2 cleaves fluorogenic caspase-1 substrate and bradykinin analog in the presence of sars-cov-2 spike protein we determined the kinetic constants for ace2 particularly under the physiological condition at ph75 with 150mm nacl the measurements were carried out with 20ng ace2 in the presence or absence of 14ugml sars-cov-2 spike protein and the hydrolysis was limited to 15 product formed as initial velocity conditions michaelis-menten plots showed that sars-cov-2 spike protein resulted in a 4 fold reduction of k m from 10 showed higher activities at 03m nacl as previously reported it is worth mention that k cat k m value for ace2 hydrolysis of bradykinin analog mca-rppgfsafkdnp-oh in the presence of sars-cov-2 spike protein was 755 x 10 3 m -1 s -1  which is slightly higher than that of ace2 hydrolysis of angiotensin i decapeptide drvyihpfhl that was a biological substrate for ace2 13  taken together sars-cov-2 increased the substrate binding affinities and catalytic rate of ace2 from the measurements of kinetic constants of ace2 we revealed that the binding of sars-cov-2 spike protein not only altered the substrate affinity k m  to ace2 but also changed its enzymatic efficiency in the presence of sars-cov-2 spike protein ace2 cleaved bradykinin-analog with a k m of 2um as previously reported ace2 could also cleave des-arg 9 -bradykinin but with a much higher k m 290um therefore we wonder how the binding of sars-cov-2 spike protein would alter the cleavage dynamics among different substrates we then designed substrate competition assays to assess the selectivity and activity of ace2 upon binding of sars-cov-2 rbd in the enzymatic reactions we utilized non-fluorogenic bk desbk or ang ii peptide to compete for ace2 cleavage of fluorogenic substrates figure 4  in the absence of sars-cov-2 rbd binding only ang ii but not bk or desbk inhibited the cleavage of caspase-1 substrate mca-yvadapkdnp-oh with 95 inhibition at 80um which was consistent with the low k m 20um of ang ii and the high k m of desbk or very poor activity of bk figure 4 b d f and h  the competitive ace2 cleavage of the caspase-1 substrate resulted an inhibition constant ki for ang ii to be 35 m and 52 m respectively in the absence and presence of sars-cov-2 rbd suggesting the sars-cov-2 rbd enhanced ace2 activity against ang ii similarly bk and desbk inhibited the ace2 cleavage with ki of 457 m and 1180 m  respectively in the presence of sars-cov-2 rbd figure 4 a c e and g  suggesting that sars-cov-2 also enhanced ace2 binding to bk and desbk as for ace2 cleavage of the bk-analog ang ii competed with a ki constant of 57 m and 45 m in the absence and presence of the sars-cov-2 rbd respectively supplement figure 3  similar to that from the caspase-1 substrate cleavage however bk and desbk failed to inhibit ace2 cleavage of bk-analog as shown before bk-analog bound to endothelin converting enzyme-1 ece-1 much better than bk due to its c-terminal modification 16  it is likely that bk-analog also bound better to ace2 than bk the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 infects human cells via the binding of its spike s glycoprotein to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ace2 here we examined the influence of the high affinity binding of sars-cov-2 spike protein on the enzymatic activity of ace2 surprisingly our enzymatic assay showed that the sars-cov-2 spike protein significantly enhanced the enzymatic activity of ace2 to cleave yvadapk peptide suggesting ace2 upon sars-cov-2 binding would likely cleave more efficiently other substrates with proline at p1 position such as ang ii drvyihpf apelin-13qrprlshkgpmpf similarly binding of sars-cov-2 spike enhanced ace2 to cleave bradykinin analog rppgfsafk in addition bradykinin rppgfspfr competed with yvadapk peptide for ace2 cleavage to a similar extent as des-arg 9 -bradykinin our results showed that sars-cov-2 spike protein not only bound to ace2 as the entry receptor but also hijacked its enzymatic activities we then compared various structures of ace2 to reveal what structural changes on ace2 proteolytic domain might happen upon sars-cov-2 spike binding to affect the enzymatic activity of ace2 the native structure of ace2 extracellular proteolytic domain comprised two subdomains the n terminal and c terminal subdomain with a wide cleft in between for substrate binding and catalysis 19 with rmsd less than 05 figure 5 d and e  however the sars-cov-2 rbd but not sars-cov rbd binding caused the hinge movement between the n-and c-terminal domains reminiscent of a closing clam we then assessed such relative movement by measuring the angle formed by asn136 on the rim of native ace2 c-terminal domain zinc atom at the catalytic center and asn136 of superimposed ace2 bound by rbd of sars-cov-2 or sars-cov compared to sars-cov rbd binding 03 this angle upon sars-cov-2 rbd binding was increased to 5 particularly the binding of a chimeric sars-cov-2 rbd to ace2 11  could cause significant movement up to 12of c-terminal subdomain toward the n-terminal domain of ace2  figure 5f  furthermore this angle caused by inhibitor mln-4760 binding was 29 to form a closed conformation of ace2 suggesting that sars-cov-2 spike binding initiated a progressive conformational change to energetically facilitate ace2 catalysis the comparison of substrate binding pocket on ace2 showed that residues f274 h345 f504 h505 y510 and y515 in sars-cov-2-ace2 complexes moved closer to aligned ang ii or mln-4760 inhibitor suggesting that sars-cov-2 rbd binding to ace2 could increase the substrate binding  figure 5g  this is consistent with our kinetic constant measurement which revealed that the k m values of ace2 hydrolysis were decrease upon sars-cov-2 spike binding in addition in sars-cov-2 rbd bound ace2 h345 residue that was proposed to stabilize the hybridized nitrogen upon catalysis adopted the same conformation as that bound by inhibitor this active conformation of h345 was not observed in native or sars-cov rbd bound ace2 structure suggesting that the tighter binding of sars-cov-2 rbd could also induce a conformation change to position ace2 substrate pocket residues for efficient catalysis with the increasing number of confirmed cases worldwide the major manifestation of sars-cov-2 mediated covid-19 disease and its complications generated critical concerns due to the lack of highly effective antiviral drugs or vaccines our current analysis of ace2 enzymatic activity upon sars-cov-2 spike protein binding would be clinically relevant however a limitation of our study is that we could not systemically measure the levels of various ace2 substrates and their cleaved products in covid-19 patients currently but we would propose that the ratios between vasodilators and vasoconstrictors would change during sars-cov-2 infection due to the high affinity interaction between ace2 and sars-cov-2 spike protein and subsequently altered ace2 enzymatic activity and substrate selectivity compared to previous outbreaks of sars-cov and mers sars-cov-2 is more contagious and clinical symptoms of covid-19 are more variable 4  in addition to the accumulation of fluid in the lung a considerable fraction of critically ill covid-19 patients developed deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism 5  these clinical observations share a common prognostic feature that pointed to the cardiovascular system vasodilation vasoconstriction and permeability are the essential components of the cardiovascular system which are regulated by the crosstalk of many hormones and biological active peptides among them renin-angiotensin system and kinin-kellikrein system have major effects upon the cardiovascular systems 14 17  importantly ace2 catalyzes the conversion of these regulatory peptides in these systems to maintain the homeostatic state among the biological active substrates ace2 cleaves among the peptide components of the rennin-angiotensin system ace2 could efficiently hydrolyze ang ii drvyihpf and partially cleave ang idrvyihpfhl during sars-cov-2 infection the enhancement of ace2 activity could produce more of their cleaved products ang 1-9 and ang 1-7 beside the opposing effects of ang ii and ang 1-7 on vasoconstriction and vasodilatation they regulated the expression of ace2 several in vivo and in vitro studies documented that ang ii decreased the expression of ace2 through activation of mapk pathways whereas ang 1-7 counteracted the inhibitory effect of ang ii to boost the expression of ace2 through mapk phosphatase activation 23 24  previous studies showed that sars-cov infection caused the internalization of ace2 6  however analyzing the lung tissue in ace2 mice 3 days post sars-cov-2 infection showed substantial expression of ace2 7  more importantly ace2 expression was increased in the lungs of severe covid-19 patients with comorbidities compared to control individuals 18 25  the enhanced ace2 activity to cleave ang ii upon sars-cov-2 spike binding might be one of the mechanisms whereby sars-cov-2 utilized to boost the expression of ace2 apelin 1-13qrprlshkgpmpf is the endogenous ligand for the angiotensin ii protein j receptor apjr which is a homolog of the angiotensin receptor at1 26  apelin 1-13 has nanomolar affinity to apjr and the major effect of apelin in vivo was nitric oxide dependent arterial dilatation to counterbalance ang ii effects the cleavage of its carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine of apelin 1-13 cause the loss of critical interactions between phe13 and a large hydrophobic cavity on apjr 27  resulting in 2-5 fold decrease of its potency 28  the enhancement of ace2 activity would accelerate the metabolism of apelin 1-13 further dampening its beneficial effects on overall cardiac functions the proteolysis of bradykinin may be particularly relevant to covid-19 normally ace is responsible for the hydrolysis of bradykinin whereas ace2 hydrolyzes des-arg 9 -bradykinin 14  bradykinin selectively binds to b2 receptors and des-arg 9 -bradykinin selectively binds to b1 receptor compared to the constitutive expression of b2 receptor expression of b1 receptor is upregulated during inflammation in addition previous studies showed that all of the reactions for bradykinin degradation occurred normally but the production rate of des-arg 9 -bradykinin was accelerated fivefold when blood was clotted 29  our results showed that sars-cov-2 spike protein enhanced bradykinin and des-arg 9 -bradykinin binding to ace2 furthermore neuropeptides dynorphin a 1-13yggflrrirpklk and -casomorphinypfvepi are good ace2 substrate which are endogenous ligands for opioid receptors and have antinociceptive effects 30  interestingly dynorphin a 1-13 was also implicated as an appetite stimulant 31  the removal of the c-terminal lysine residue of dynorphin a 1-13 resulted in 90 loss of its potency 32  since symptoms of covid-19 also include body aches and loss of taste it would be intriguing to speculate that altered ace2 hydrolysis of these neuropeptides would affect the homeostatic functions of these opioid receptors as well collectively the homeostatic regulation of cardiovascular system controlled by ace2 would be out of  the vector to express the prefusion s ectodomain a gene encoding residues 1-1208 of sars-cov-2genbank mn908947 was kindly provided by jason s mclellan the university of texas at austin and the protein was expressed as described previously 9  in brief freestyle293 f cells thermo

manufacturers instruction to each well 50ul of 02 or 04ugml ace2 in assay buffer containing 75mm trisph75 plus nacl at 015m 03m or 10m were added respectively then 10ul dialysis buffer or sars-cov-2 s spikerbd domain proteins at various final concentrations ranging from 70ugml to 04ugml were added to wells and incubated for 20min after mixing by shaking the reactions were initiated by adding 50ul of fluorogenic peptides at 40um or with 2-fold serial dilutions ranging from 160um to 06um to determine the kinetic constants for ace2 hydrolysis the relative fluorescence units rfu were read at excitation and emission wavelengths of 320nm and 405nm top read respectively in kinetic mode at 1-minute intervals for 8 hours to calculate specific activity of ace2 the substrate blank adjusted

kinetic constants the hydrolysis was limited to 15 product formed as the initial velocity conditions initial velocities were plotted versus  to compare the relative proteolytic activity of ace2 to

n nianshuang wang jesper pallesen daniel wrapp hannah turner l christopher cottrell a kizzmekia corbett s barney graham s jason mclellan s andrew ward b   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov emerged in humans from an animal reservoir in 2002 and rapidly spread globally causing 8096 cases and 774 associated deaths in 26 countries through july 20031 sars-cov reappeared in a second smaller outbreak in 2004 but has since disappeared from human circulation however closely related coronaviruses such as wiv1 currently circulate in bat reservoirs and are capable of utilizing human receptors to enter cells2 and there are no vaccines or virus-specific treatments available for human use the more recent emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov1 and the likelihood of future zoonotic transmission of novel coronaviruses to humans from animal reservoirs makes robust reagent development for the display of neutralizing epitopes of great importance to human health understanding how coronavirus s glycoproteins are processed and bind to host receptors is key to the development of coronavirus vaccines and therapeutics coronaviruses are enveloped viruses possessing large trimeric spike glycoproteins s required for the recognition of host receptors for many coronaviruses as well as the fusion of viral and host cell membranes for viral entry into cells3 during viral egress from infected host cells some coronavirus s proteins are cleaved into s1 and s2 subunits the s1 subunit is responsible for host-receptor binding while the s2 subunit contains the membrane-fusion machinery during viral entry the s1 subunit binds host receptors in an interaction thought to expose a secondary cleavage site within s2 s2 adjacent to the fusion peptide for cleavage by host proteases47 this s2 proteolysis has been hypothesized to facilitate insertion of the fusion peptide into host membranes after the first heptad repeat region hr1 of the s2 subunit rearranges into an extended -helix810 subsequent conformational changes in the second heptad repeat region hr2 of s2 form a six-helix bundle with hr1 fusing the viral and host membranes and allowing for release of the viral genome into host cells10 coronavirus s is also the target of neutralizing antibodies11 making an understanding of s structure and conformational states pertinent for investigating s antigenic surfaces and designing vaccines the sars-cov s1 subunit is composed of two distinct domains an n-terminal domain s1 ntd and a receptor-binding domain s1 rbd also referred to as the s1 ctd or domain b each of these domains have been implicated in binding to host receptors depending on the coronavirus in question however most coronaviruses are not known to utilize both the s1 ntd and s1 rbd for viral entry12 sars-cov makes use of its s1 rbd to bind to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as its host receptor1314 recent examination using cryo-electron microscopy cryo-em has illuminated the prefusion structures of coronavirus spikes1522 initial examination of hcov-hku1 s showed that the receptor-binding site on the s1 rbd was occluded when the rbd was in a down conformation and it was hypothesized that conformational changes were required to access this site16 subsequent studies of the highly pathogenic human coronavirus s proteins of sars-cov1522 and mers-cov1722 showed that these viral s1 rbd do indeed sample an up conformation where the receptor-binding site is accessible these structural studies also located the positions of the s1s2 and s2 cleavage sites on the prefusion spike the s1s2 site lies within a surface exposed loop in the second subdomain of s116 however the s2 site lies closer to base of the spike and though this region is located on the surface of the spike cleavage at this site is prevented by surrounding protein elements17 coronavirus s transitions from a meta-stable prefusion state to a highly stable postfusion state as part of the s proteins role in membrane fusion the instability of the prefusion state presents a significant challenge for the production of protein antigens for antigenic presentation of the prefusion antibody epitopes that are most likely to lead to neutralizing responses recently we presented the design of two proline mutations 2p for the prefusion stabilization of coronavirus s proteins17 the stabilized mers-cov s 2p ectodomain was shown to maintain the prefusion spike conformation have similar antibody recognition as wild-type s and possess higher immunogenicity here we have used single-particle cryo-em to determine structures of prefusion stabilized sars-cov s 2p ectodomain in uncleaved s1s2 cleaved and ace2-bound states three-dimensional classification of the s1 rbd positions and corresponding atomic protein models revealed that neither ace2-binding nor trypsin cleavage at the s1s2 boundary induced substantial conformational changes in the prefusion stabilized s protein to examine any potential conformational differences in sars-cov s 2p compared to unstabilized wild-type s ectodomains1522 we determined structures of the sars-cov s 2p ectodomain this included a 32  resolution c3-symmetric reconstruction and several asymmetric reconstructions 3945  see below fig 1 and supplementary tables s1 s4 and figs s1 s2 the s1 ntd and some of the s1 rbd while clearly present appear poorly resolved in the cryo-em maps precluding a de novo build of these regions for this reason available sars-cov s crystal structures2223 of corresponding domains were placed into these densities overall the sars-cov s 2p structure resembles that of other coronaviruses particularly those of the betacoronavirus genus16171922 and the previously published sars-cov wild-type prefusion ectodomains1522 the s1 domains surround the helical s2 subunits and interdigitate at the membrane-distal apex of the trimeric spike the structure of the s2 subunit appears to be highly conserved across coronavirus genera182021 the sars-cov prefusion wild-type and 2p structures are nearly identical in most regions including regions proximal to the 2p mutation site fig 1bc although the overall structures of sars-cov s are similar we were able to build several s2 protein regions excluded from the wild-type sars-cov s models including a fusion-peptide-adjacent region as well as additional amino acids in the s2 c-terminal connector domain the region c-terminal to the fusion peptide known as fp2 has been suggested to act as the second part of a bipartite fusion peptide for sars-cov s24 comparison of this fp2 region in the structures presented here with the mhv19 hcov-hku116 mers-cov1722 hcov-nl6320 and porcine deltacoronavirus1821 s structures indicates that sars-cov adopts a unique conformation in this region fig 2 whereas most other coronaviruses possess two short -helices with a cross-linking disulfide bond in sars-cov a similar disulfide bond bridges the two strands of a beta-hairpin the unique sars-cov s conformation of fp2 and the lack of cross-group sequence conservation beyond the disulfide bond in this region suggest that sars-cov may use a distinct mechanism of fp2 membrane insertion the trimeric sars-cov s 2p adopts two distinct conformations related to each of the s1 rbd up and down the delineation of two distinct conformations for each s1 rbd is consistent with observations made for mers-cov1722 as well as one of the studies of wild-type sars-cov s22 gui et al15 however observed a gradient of conformations in wild-type sars-cov s which has not been observed in other structural studies of coronavirus spikes nor the work presented here some possibilities for these different observations may be the differences in spike expression system yielding alternate glycosylation patterns or alternate protein constructs but the true source remains unclear the down conformation caps the s2 helices and makes extensive contacts with the s1 ntd the up conformation of the s1 rbd exposes the s1 rbd receptor-binding site it has been previously reported that for wild-type sars-cov s 56 of the particles contained three down rbd conformations while 44 contained a single up s1 rbd conformation22 to examine the conformation of the s1 rbd among our sars-cov s 2p ectodomains we used a local masking image sutraction and 3-d sorting strategy17 to more accurately classify the conformations as being either down or up at each of the three s1 rbd positions within the trimer this analysis revealed that the majority of the s 2p proteins were in the single-up conformation 58 with lesser amounts of double- and triple-up conformations 39 and 3 respectively and with no all-down conformation observed the increased propensity to adopt the up s1 rbd conformation may indicate a difference in the coronavirus s containing the 2p mutations however other differences in sample preparation cannot be fully ruled out to examine the structural consequences binding ace2 to the stabilized sars-cov s 2p we combined sars-cov s 2p ectodomain with an excess of soluble human ace2 with subsequent purification by size-exclusion chromatography and immediate cryo-em specimen preparation supplementary fig s1 initial sorting of particle heterogeneity indicated spikes could be split into ace2-bound 45 and unbound 55 classes using a similar masking and 3-d sorting strategy as above we sorted the unbound s class further into classes with s1 conformations of one or two up s1 rbds fig 3 and supplementary tables s2s4 and figs s3s5 we did not observe an all-down class nor a three up s1 rbd class indicating a low prevalence of these conformations among the unbound s 2p proteins expanding our 3d sorting strategy we classified our ace2-bound particles at each s1 rbd position and identified single double and triple ace2-bound s we were further able to identify s1 rbd conformations at the non-ace2 occupied rbd positions to represent each population of s1 rbd conformations among ace2-bound s as hypothesized by previous structural work151722 the s1 rbd of the stabilized spike recognizes ace2 with an up s1 rbd conformation the proportion of total up s1 rbd conformations within the ace2-bound and -unbound classes is nearly identical within this dataset 58 up s1 rbd this strongly suggests that binding of a single ace2 receptor does not induce adjacent s1 rbds to transition from a down to up conformation within the context of the stabilized s hence ace2 is more likely to bind to an already up s1 rbd rather than inducing the conformational changes that are required for the s1 rbd to become accessible to ace2 though the proportion of up s1 rbd in the ace2 dataset 58 is similar to the proportion of up s1 rbd in the sars s 2p ectodomain dataset 48 there is a large difference in the distributions of one up and two up conformational states between these datasets the significance of this difference remains unclear despite prolonged co-incubation and an excess of ace2 we had difficulties in saturating the s1 rbd with ace2 in the context of stabilized trimeric s ectodomain this poor saturation is illustrated by the small proportion of triple-bound ace2 and the majority of spikes that are unbound by receptor in contrast isolated recombinant s1 rbd easily binds ace2 and is capable saturating ace2 on target cells to block s-mediated entry14 our observed sub-stoichiometric ace2 binding to trimeric spikes is consistent with the difficulty in using soluble ace2 receptor to neutralize sars-cov s pseudotyped onto vsv25 the reduced binding of ace2 to trimeric spikes is likely due to the incomplete exposure and conformational flexibility of the s1 rbd in contrast mhv which binds ceacam1a via its s1 ntd but does not undergo conformational changes exhibits complete neutralization by soluble receptor1926 similar to recently published mers-cov s structures17 the ace2-bound s1 rbd of sars-cov s 2p adopts a much more extended and rotated conformation compared to s1 rbd modeled in previous wild-type sars-cov s structures22 supplementary fig s6 this difference is likely due to poor density in the hinge regions between the s1 rbd and subdomain 1 sd-1 in these previous reconstructions1522 rather than the presentation of a unique receptor-bound conformation or the influence of the stabilizing mutations indeed the bound ace2 receptor and s1 rbd for all reconstructions here show poorer density quality than the less mobile regions of the sars-cov s fig 4 to improve the density for ace2-bound s1 rbd we used focused refinement with image subtraction on this region to overcome the flexibility of these domains relative to the rest of sars-cov s 2p this yielded a 79  resolution reconstruction with improved local density quality fig 4bc we successfully placed the crystal structure of the sars-cov s1 rbd bound to ace2 2ajfpdb23 into this density as a rigid body indicating that the previously determined crystal structure accurately recapitulates the conformation between the ace2-bound s1 rbd in the prefusion stabilized trimeric spike given that the s1 rbd in its up conformation is well separated in space and sequence from the 2p stabilizing mutations we do not anticipate that the introduction of these prefusion stabilizing mutations influences the molecular interactions between the s1 rbd and ace2 beyond perhaps increasing the prevalence of the s1 rbd up conformations as noted above indeed both the wild-type and 2p-stabilized sars-cov s ectodomains demonstrate similar affinities for ace2 by spr 185 and 150 nm respectively supplementary fig s7 the ace2-bound s1 rbd extends upwards and rotates away from contacts with nearby amino acids hence any conformational changes induced by receptor binding to the s1 rbd are more likely to be caused by the absence of the s1 rbd contacts in the up conformation rather than the formation of additional intra-spike contacts in a receptor-bound state supplementary fig s8 indeed movement of the s1 rbd to the up conformation disrupts molecular interactions with the s2 central -helices which may play a role in receptor-induced conformational changes in wild-type spikes the observation that host-receptor engagement of the s1 rbd disrupts interactions within spike in a manner independent of direct receptor-spike contacts suggests a flexible mechanism for how different coronavirus spikes may bind to diverse protein receptors with their s1 rbd and facilitate fusion with host cells several biochemical and virological studies have suggested that binding of a host protein receptor to coronavirus spikes induces conformational changes leading to fusion and exposure of the s2 protease site for cleavage46 comparison of our ace2-bound 2p-stabilized spike structures with those of both the wild-type sars-cov s and the 2p-stabilized sars-cov s indicate that overall these structures are similar and do not exhibit large conformational differences the absence of conformational changes includes regions near the s2 cleavage site fusion peptide and s2 heptad repeat 1 hr1 however fine examination of the ace2-bound s structure revealed a modest conformational change in the s2 central helix where the s2 had been uncapped by a receptor-bound rbd in both the wild-type1522 and 2p unbound structures the central helix presents as an -helix in each protomer of the trimer however in the ace2-bound structure the upper portion of the s2 helix uncapped by the ace2-bound s1 rbd has transitioned to a 310-helix fig 4de the - to 310-helix transition is unique to the s2 protomer uncapped by the ace2-bound s1 rbd and is not observed in the other two copies of the trimeric spike this subtle transition may indicate that conformational changes towards fusion are initiated in the central helix n-terminal to the central helix are the 2p mutations that stabilize the spike in its prefusion conformation these stabilizing mutations may block the propagation of conformational changes beyond the subtle change to a short 310-helix providing a possible mechanism for their prefusion stabilizing effect unlike some other coronavirus spikes such as mers-cov s sars-cov s lacks an amino acid sequence capable of recognition by host furin proteases at the s1s2 cleavage site however sars-cov s can be cleaved in vitro by exogenous trypsin at an equivalent site and it has been proposed that a similar cleavage event may occur in vivo by trypsin-like proteases during viral entry2728 moreover trypsin cleavage of the sars-cov s potentiates s for more efficient membrane fusion2729 for mers-cov s cleavage at s1s2 enables more efficient receptor recognition6 in addition coronaviruses possess a secondary cleavage site in s2 called s227 this site is thought to be cleaved by host proteases after receptor recognition46 and liberates the viral fusion peptide to insert into host membranes in a s2 pre-hairpin intermediate30 the s2 cleavage has been proposed to occur after an arginine residue conserved across coronavirus genera sars-cov s arg79731 to examine the trypsin protease sensitivity of our prefusion-stabilized coronavirus spikes we carried out limited proteolysis experiments of both wild-type and 2p sars-cov s ectodomains in the presence and absence of soluble ace2 receptor a time course of the proteolysis revealed that all four samples are cleaved to s1 and s2 products at equivalent rates at similar sites supplementary fig s9 nearing the end of the time course additional lower molecular weight bands are observed which we interpret to be degradation of the s1 subunit regardless of whether wild-type or prefusion-stabilized s was used or whether ace2 was bound to the s ectodomains there is no prominent band that corresponds to a s2 cleavage product approximately 52 kda to analyze the cleavage products in detail we performed cryo-em analysis on the trypsin-cleaved sars-cov s 2p ectodomain using all-particles and c3 symmetry yielded a reconstruction at 33  resolution fig 5 supplementary tables s1 s4 and fig s10 the short loop containing the s1s2 cleavage site is disordered in the uncleaved s 2p reconstruction and remains disordered in the s 2p trypsin cleaved reconstruction moreover examination of the structure models indicates no significant differences between the trypsin-cleaved and uncleaved sars-cov s 2p fig 5b fine sorting of s1 rbd positions of the trypsin-cleaved s reveals a very similar distribution of up s1 rbd conformations available for receptor binding as in the uncleaved samples although we additionally observe a small proportion of s1 rbd in the all-down conformation fig 5c these results indicate that trypsin-cleavage at s1s2 does not impart large conformational changes on the prefusion-stabilized sars-cov s 2p and justifies the removal of s1s2 cleavage sites for the production of more homogeneous material as vaccine immunogens in agreement with the in vitro limited proteolysis experiments the s2 site remains uncleaved in the trypsin-cleaved s 2p ectodomain structures the arginine at the proposed s2 cleavage site in all coronavirus spike structures published to date and presented here is blocked from cleavage by a loop protruding from just n-terminal to the fusion peptide and by an n-terminal helix of s2 hr1 fig 6 exposure of this site for cleavage may require remodeling of this penultimate loop or hr1 beyond the conformation observed in the prefusion state and hence possibly not accessible in our prefusion-stabilized s 2p ectodomains here we present the first structures of a trimeric coronavirus spike ectodomain bound to a protein receptor as well as the first structures of prefusion s1s2 cleaved coronavirus spikes our structures of the sars-cov s 2p ectodomain bound to a soluble form of human ace2 receptor show that any conformational changes induced in s by receptor binding are more likely to be due to the disruption of protein-protein interactions rather than the formation of additional contacts between the s1 rbd and other regions of s supplementary fig s8 the only conformational change that we observe in the ace2-sars-cov s 2p structures is the transition to a short 310-helix at the top of the s2 central -helix when uncapped by receptor-bound s1 rbd suggesting that more extensive conformational changes may be initiated here 310-helices have been hypothesized to act as intermediates in coil-to--helix transitions32 transitions between 310-helices and -helices has also been hypothesized for the voltage sensing domains of potassium channels where it has been proposed that the transition plays a role in changing from a resting or activated state to a relaxed state33 though more extensive changes are likely to drive conformational rearrangements accompanying membrane fusion the 2p prefusion stabilizing mutations adjacent to the short 310-helix may block these changes from occurring however both wild-type and 2p sars-cov s ectodomains bound to ace2 were cleaved equally by trypsin indicating that at least at the level of trypsin protease susceptibility these two receptor-bound complexes appear equivalent strategies similar to those we have used have been employed to stabilize hiv envelope glycoprotein env trimers in prefusion conformation3435 hiv env which like sars cov s also engages a protein receptor cd4 undergoes a large conformational change on the viral surface upon binding36 similarly the soluble stabilized versions of env undergo large conformational changes upon cd4 binding3739 conversely the ebola virus glycoprotein gp undergoes only modest conformational changes upon binding its receptor npc-14041 thus these class i fusion machines likely have fundamental differences in the fusion process that requires further study these structural and biochemical data show that the introduction of the 2p prefusion-stabilizing mutations does not interfere with receptor binding or recognition by trypsin-like proteases our structural examinations of both receptor-bound and trypsin-cleaved prefusion-stabilized sars-cov s 2p proteins indicate that neither receptor binding nor trypsin cleavage induce large conformational changes in stabilized spikes additionally these structures and accompanying limited proteolysis experiments show that neither receptor binding nor trypsin cleavage expose the s2 cleavage site for proteolysis within the stabilized spike ectodomains this work increases the body of knowledge surrounding these prefusion-stabilized spikes as presenting native surfaces for interactions with host factors while maintaining their

attachment summary there are as yet no licenced therapeutics for the covid-19 pandemic the causal coronavirus sars-cov-2 binds host cells via a trimeric spike whose receptor binding domain rbd recognizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 initiating conformational changes that drive membrane fusion we find that monoclonal antibody cr3022 binds the rbd tightly neutralising sars-cov-2 and report the crystal structure at 24  of the fabrbd complex some crystals are suitable for screening for entry-blocking inhibitors the highly conserved structure-stabilising cr3022 epitope is inaccessible in the prefusion spike suggesting that cr3022 binding would facilitate conversion to the fusion-incompetent post-fusion state cryo-em analysis confirms that incubation of spike with

therapeutically possibly in synergy with an antibody blocking receptor attachment 2 3  incursion of animal usually bat-derived coronaviruses into the human population has caused several outbreaks of severe disease starting with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 3 in 2002 menachery et al 2015  in late 2019 a highly infectious illness with cold-like symptoms progressing to pneumonia and acute respiratory failure resulting in an estimated 6 overall death rate baud et al 2020  with higher mortality among the elderly and immunocompromised populations was identified and confirmed as a pandemic by the who on 11 th march 2020 the etiological agent is a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 belonging to lineage b betacoronavirus and sharing 88 sequence identity with bat coronaviruses lu et al 2020a  the heavily glycosylated trimeric surface spike protein mediates viral entry into the host cell it is a large type i transmembrane glycoprotein the ectodomain alone comprises over 1200 residues wrapp et al 2020  it is made as a single polypeptide and then cleaved by host proteases to yield an n-terminal s1 region and the c-terminal s2 region spike exists initially in a pre-fusion state where the domains of s1 cloak the upper portion of the spike with the relatively small 22 kda s1 rbd nestled at the tip the rbd is predominantly in a down state where the receptor binding site is inaccessible however it appears that it stochastically flips up with a hinge-like motion transiently presenting the ace2 receptor binding site roy 2020 song et al 2018 walls et al 2020 wrapp et al 2020  ace2 acts as a functional receptor for both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 binding to the latter with a 10 to 20-fold higher affinity k d of 15 nm possibly contributing to its ease of transmission song et al 2018 wrapp et al 2020  there is 73 sequence identity between the rbds of sars-cov and sars-cov-2  figure s1  when ace2 locks on it holds the rbd up destabilising the s1 cloak and possibly favouring conversion to a postfusion form where the s2 subunit through massive conformational changes propels its fusion domain upwards to engage with the host membrane casting off s1 in the process song et al

through mainly polar interactions the s 4 protein is an attractive candidate for both vaccine development and immunotherapy potent nanomolar affinity neutralising human monoclonal antibodies against the sars-cov rbd have been identified that attach at the ace2 receptor binding site including m396 cr3014 and 80r ter meulen et al 2006 sui et al 2004 zhu et al 2007  for example 80r binds with nanomolar affinity prevents binding to ace2 and the formation of syncytia in vitro and inhibits viral replication in vivo sui et al 2004  however despite the two viruses sharing the same ace2 receptor these ace2 blocking antibodies do not bind sars-cov-2 rbd wrapp et al 2020  in contrast cr3022 a sars-cov-specific monoclonal selected from a single chain fv phage display library constructed from lymphocytes of a convalescent sars patient and reconstructed into igg1 format ter meulen et al 2006  has been reported to cross-react strongly binding to the rbd of sars-cov-2 with a k d of 63 nm tian et al 2020  whilst not competing with the binding of ace2 ter meulen et al 2006  furthermore although sars-cov escape mutations could be readily generated for ace2blocking cr3014 no escape mutations could be generated for cr3022 preventing mapping of its epitope ter meulen et al 2006  furthermore a natural mutation of sars-cov-2 has now been detected at residue 495 y n gisaid shu and mccauley 2017  accession id epiisl429783 wienecke-baldacchino et al 2020 which forms part of the ace2 binding epitope finally cr3022 and cr3014 act synergistically to neutralise sars-cov with extreme potency ter meulen et al 2006  whilst this work was being prepared for publication a paper reporting that cr3022 does not neutralise sars-cov-2 and describing the structure of the complex with the rbd at 31  resolution was published yuan et al 2020  here we extend the structure analysis to significantly higher resolution and using a different neutralisation assay show that cr3022 does neutralise sars-cov-2 but via a mechanism that would not be detected by the method of yuan et al yuan et al 2020  we use cryo-em analysis of the interaction of cr3022 with the full spike ectodomain to confirm 5 this mechanism taken together these observations suggest that the cr3022 epitope should be a major target for therapeutic antibodies to understand how cr3022 works we first investigated the interaction of cr3022 fab with isolated recombinant sars-cov-2 rbd both alone and in the presence of ace2 surface plasmon resonance spr measurements methods and figure s2  confirmed that cr3022 binding to rbd is strong although weaker than the binding reported to sars-cov ter meulen et al 2006  with a slight variation according to whether cr3022 or rbd is used as the analyte k d  30 nm and 15 nm respectively derived from the kinetic data in table s1  an independent measure using bio-layer interferometry bli with rbd as analyte gave a k d of 19 nm methods and figure s2  these values are quite similar to those reported by tian et al tian et al 2020  66 nm whereas weaker binding k d  115 nm was reported recently by yuan et al yuan et al 2020  using spr to perform a competition assay revealed that the binding of ace2 to the rbd is perturbed by the presence of cr3022  figure s3  the presence of ace2 slows the binding of cr3022 to rbd and accelerates the dissociation similarly the release of ace2 from rbd is accelerated by the presence of cr3022 these observations are suggestive of an allosteric effect between ace2 and cr3022 a plaque reduction neutralisation test using sars-cov-2 virus and cr3022 showed an nd50 of 1201 for a starting concentration of 2mgml calculated according to grist grist 1966  superior to that of mers convalescent serum nd50 of 1149 used as a nibsc 6 international standard positive control see methods and table s2  this corresponds to 50 neutralisation at 70 nm 105 ugml this is similar to the neutralising concentration 50 neutralisation at 11 ugml reported by ter meulen et al ter meulen et al 2006 for sars-cov however as discussed below it is in apparent disagreement with the result reported recently by yuan et al yuan et al 2020  we determined the crystal structure of the sars-cov-2 rbd-cr3022 fab complex see methods and table s3  to investigate the relationship between the binding epitopes of ace2 and cr3022 crystals grew rapidly and consistently two crystal forms grew in the same drop the solvent content of the crystal form solved first was unusually high ca 87 with the ace2 binding site exposed to large continuous solvent channels within the crystal lattice  figure s4  these crystals therefore offer a promising vehicle for crystallographic screening to identify potential therapeutics that could act to block virus attachment the current analysis of this crystal form is at 44  resolution and so to avoid overfitting refinement used a novel real-space refinement algorithm to optimise the phases vagabond hmg unpublished see methods this together with the favourable observation to parameter ratio resulting from the exceptionally high solvent content meant that the map was of very high quality allowing reliable structural interpretation  figure s5  methods full interpretation of the detailed interactions between cr3022 and the rbd was enabled by the second crystal form which diffracted to high resolution 24  and the structure of which was refined to give an r-workr-free of 02130239 and good stereochemistry methods table s3 figure   s5  the high-resolution structure is shown in figure 1a  there are two complexes in the crystal asymmetric unit with residues 331-529 in one rbd 332-445 and 448-532 in the other rbd well defined whilst residues133-136 of the cr3022 heavy chains are disordered the rbd has a very similar structure to that seen in the complex of sars-cov-2 rbd with ace2 rmsd for 194 ca atoms of 06  2 pdb 6m0j lan et al 2020  and an rmsd of 11  2 compared to the sars cov rbd pdb 2ajf li et al 2005  only minor conformational changes are introduced by binding to cr3022 at residues 381-390 the rbd was deglycosylated methods to leave a single saccharide unit at each of the n-linked glycosylation sites clearly seen at n331 and n343  figure s5  cr3022 attaches to the rbd surface orthogonal to the ace2 receptor binding site there is no overlap between the epitopes and indeed both the fab and ace2 ectodomain can bind without clashing  figure   1d  tian et al 2020  such independence of the ace2 binding site has been reported recently for another sars-cov-2 neutralising antibody 47d11  the fab complex interface buries 990  2 of surface area 600 and 390  2 by the heavy and light chains respectively figure 2a and figure s6  somewhat more than the rbd-ace2 interface which covers 850  2 pdb 6m0j lan et al 2020  typical of a fab complex the interaction is mediated by the antibody cdr loops which fit well into the rather sculpted surface of the rbd figure 1b  c the heavy chain cdr1 2 and 3 make contacts to residues from  2  2 and  3 residues 369-386 while two of the light chain cdrs 1 and 2 interact mainly with residues from the  2-3 loop  3 380-392 and the  5-4 loop 427-430 figures 1 s1 s7 a total of 16 residues from the heavy chain and 14 from the light chain cement the interaction with 26 residues from the rbd for the heavy chain these potentially form 7 h-bonds and 3 salt bridges the latter from d55 and e57 cdr2 to k378 of the rbd whilst the light chain interface comprises 6 h-bonds and a single salt bridge between e61 cdr2 and k386 of the rbd the binding is consolidated by a number of hydrophobic 8 interactions  figure s7b  of the 26 residues involved in the interaction 23 are conserved between sars-cov and sars-cov-2  figure 2b and figure s1  the cr30222 epitope is much more conserved than that of the receptor blocking anti-sars-cov antibody 80r for which only 13 of the 29 interacting residues are conserved hwang et al 2006  in-line with the lack of cross reactivity observed for the latter the reason for the conservation of the cr3022 epitope becomes clear in the context of the complete pre-fusion s structure pdb ids 6vsb wrapp et al 2020  6vxx 6vyb walls et al 2020  where the epitope is inaccessible  figure 3  when the rbd is in the down configuration the cr3022 epitope is packed tightly against another rbd of the trimer and the n-terminal domain ntd of the neighbouring protomer in the structure of the pre-fusion form of trimeric spike the majority of rbds are down although presumably stochastically one may be up walls et al 2020 wrapp et al 2020  the structure of a sars-cov complex with ace2 ectodomain shows that this up configuration is competent to bind receptor and that there are a family of up orientations with significantly different hinge angles song et al 2018  however the cr3022 epitope remains largely inaccessible even in the up configuration modelling the rotation of the rbd required to enable fab interaction in the context of the spike trimer showed a rotation corresponding to a  60 further declination from the central vertical axis was required beyond that observed previously walls et al 2020 wrapp et al 2020 figure 3i  although this might be partly mitigated by more complex movements of the rbd and if more than one rbd is in the up configuration this requirement would be relaxed somewhat since locking the up state by receptor blocking antibodies is thought to destabilise the pre-fusion state walls et al 2019 binding of cr3022 presumably introduces further destabilisation leading to a premature conversion to the post-fusion state inactivating the virus cr3022 and ace2 blocking antibodies can bind 9 independently but both induce an up conformation presumably explaining the observed synergy between binding at the two sites ter meulen et al 2006  to test if cr3022 binding destabilises the prefusion state of spike the ectodomain construct described previously wrapp et al 2020 was used to produce glycosylated protein in hek cells methods cryo-em screening showed that the protein was in the trimeric prefusion conformation spike was then mixed with an excess of cr3022 fab and incubated at room temperature with aliquots being taken at 50 minutes and 3 hours aliquots were immediately applied to cryo-em grids and frozen methods for the 50 minutes incubation collection of a substantial amount of data allowed unbiased particle picking and 2d classification which revealed two major structural classes with a similar number in each i the prefusion conformation and ii a radically different conformation methods  table s4 and figure s8  detailed analysis of the prefusion conformation led to a structure at a nominal resolution of 34  fsc  0143 based on a broad distribution of orientations that revealed the same predominant rbd pattern one up and two down previously seen wrapp et al 2020 with no evidence of cr3022 binding figure 4a  figure s9  analysis of the other major particle class revealed strong preferential orientation of the particles on the grid  figure   s10a  despite this a reconstruction with a nominal resolution of 39  within the plane of the grid and perhaps 7  resolution in the perpendicular direction  figure s10b  could be produced which allowed the unambiguous fitting of the cr3022-rbd complex figure 4b  note that in addition there is less well defined density attached to the rbd in a suitable position to correspond to the spike n-terminal domain wrapp et al 2020  these structures are no longer trimeric rather two complexes associate to form an approximately symmetric dimer however application of this symmetry in the reconstruction process did not improve 1 0 the resolution the interactions responsible for dimerisation involve the ace2 binding site on the rbd and the elbow of the fab however the interaction does not occur in our lowresolution crystal form and is therefore probably extremely weak and not biologically significant since conversion to the post-fusion conformation leads to dissociation of s1 which includes the n-terminal domain and rbd these results confirm that cr3022 destabilises the prefusion spike conformation further evidence of this is provided by analysis of data collected after 3 h incubation by this point there were no intact trimers remaining and a heterogeneous range of oligomeric assemblies had appeared which we were not able to interpret in detail but which are consistent with the lateral assembly of fabrbd complexes  figure s11  note that the relatively slow kinetics will not be representative of events in vivo where the conversion might be accelerated by the elevated temperature and the absence of the mutations which were added to this construct to stabilise the prefusion state kirchdoerfer et al 2018 pallesen et al 2017 wrapp et al 2020  until now the only documented mechanism of neutralisation of coronaviruses has been through blocking receptor attachment in the case of sars-cov this is achieved by presentation of the rbd of the spike in an up conformation although not yet confirmed for sars-cov-2 it is very likely that a similar mechanism can apply here we define a second class of neutralisers that bind a highly conserved epitope  figure s1  and can therefore act against both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 cr3022 was first identified as a neutralising antibody against sars-cov ter meulen et al 2006  we find that binding of cr3022 to the isolated rbd is tight 20 nm and the crystal structure of the complex reveals the atomic detail of the interaction despite the spatial separation of the cr3022 and ace2 epitopes we find an allosteric effect between the two binding events the role of the 1 1 cr3022 epitope in stabilising the prefusion spike trimer explains why it has to date proved impossible to generate mutations that escape binding of the antibody ter meulen et al 2006  whilst in our assay cr3022 neutralises sars-cov-2 a recent paper yuan et al 2020 reported an alternative assay that did not detect neutralisation the difference is likely due to their removal of the antibodyvirus mix after adsorption to the indicator cells before incubating to allow cytopathic effect cpe to develop this would be in-line with the distinction previously seen between neutralisation tests for influenza virus by antibodies which bind the stem of hemagglutinin and therefore do not block receptor binding thomson et al 2012  these antibodies did not appear to be neutralising when tested with the standard who neutralisation assay in which a similar protocol is used to that adopted by yuan et al in which the inoculum of virusantibody is washed out before development of cpe neutralisation was observed however when the antibodies were left in the assay during incubation to produce cpe by analogy we would expect antibodies to the rbd that block attachment to ace2 to behave in a similar way to antibodies against the globular head of ha whilst antibodies such as cr3022 that neutralise by an alternative mechanism to blocking receptor attachment may need to be present throughout the incubation period with the indicator cells to reveal neutralisation this agrees with our observation that in the absence of ace2 the cr3022 fab destroys the prefusion-stabilised trimer t 12 1h at room temperature as measured by cryo-em with monoclonal antibodies now recognised as potential antivirals lu et al 2020b salazar et al 2017 our results suggest that cr3022 may be of immediate utility since the mechanism of neutralisation will be unusually resistant to virus escape in contrast antibodies which compete with ace2 whose epitope on sars-cov-2 is reported to have already 1 2 shown mutation at residue 495 gisaid accession id epiisl429783 wienecke-baldacchino et al 2020 shu and mccauley 2017  are likely to be susceptible to escape furthermore with knowledge of the detailed structure of the epitope presented here a higher affinity version of cr3022 might be engineered alternatively since the same mechanism of neutralisation is likely to be used by other antibodies a more potent monoclonal antibody targeting the same epitope might be found for instance by screening for competition with cr3022 additionally since this epitope is sterically and functionally independent of the well-established receptor-blocking neutralising antibody epitope there is considerable scope for therapeutic synergy between antibodies targeting the two epitopes indeed this type of  to further validate the spr results the k d of fab cr3022 for rbd was also measured by bio-layer interferometry kinetic assays were performed on an octet red 96e fortebio at 30

binding of 2019-ncov yun chen yao guo yihang pan zhizhuang zhao joe   a mysterious pneumonia illness was first reported in late december 2019 in wuhan china and has rapidly spread to a dozen of countries including the united states with thousands of infected individuals and hundreds of deaths within a month 1 scientists in china have isolated the virus from patients and determined its genetic code the pathogen responsible for this epidemic is a new coronavirus designated 2019-ncov by the world health organization 2019-ncov belongs to the same family of viruses as the well-known severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov which have killed hundreds of people in the past 17 years coronaviruses consist of a large diverse family of viruses they can be classified into four genera alpha- beta- gamma- and delta coronavirus 23 representative alphacoronaviruses include human coronavirus nl63 hcov-nl63 while the betacoronaviruses include the best-known sars-cov and mers-cov based on nucleic acid sequence similarity the newly identified 2019-ncov is a betacoronavirus the entry of all coronaviruses into host cells is mediated by spike glycoprotein that gives coronaviruses a crown-like appearance by forming spikes on their surface the amino acid sequence of spike glycoprotein consists of a large ectodomain a single-pass transmembrane anchor and a short c-terminal intracellular tail 3 the ectodomain contains a receptor-binding unit s1 and a membrane-fusion unit s2 electron microscopic imaging illustrated that spike glycoprotein forms a clove-shaped spike with three s1 heads and a trimeric s2 stalk for a virus to enter a host cell s1 binds to a specific cell surface receptor via its receptor-binding domain rbd and s2 fuses the host cell and viral membranes enabling the entry of viral genomes into host cells specific rbd-receptor binding determines if a cell or animal can be infected and also serves as a target for therapeutic inventions to treat diseases caused by coronaviruses previous studies have identified angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a functional receptor for sars-cov 45 in this study we analyzed the structure of spike glycoprotein rbd of 2019-ncov and identified a unique feature that potentially allows a high affinity binding to ace2 in human cells we further discussed potential candidates for natural hosts of 2019-ncov routes of transmission and strategies to inhibit virus entry for therapeutic applications the genomic sequence of 2019-ncov as deposited by wang et al was downloaded from the genbank database mn9089473 dna and protein sequences were compared by using the blast program multiple sequence alignment was performed by using the clustal omega program three-dimensional structure was analyzed by using the cn3d program from the ncbi protein structure simulation was performed by using swiss-model based on the co-crystal structure of human ace2 with the sars-cov spike glycoprotein rbd 6 pdb id 2ajf ace2 and rdb interaction was analyzed by molecular docking using the patchdock and firedock programs by using the initially reported sequence mn9089473 a blast search of the ncbi database revealed 6 inputs for the virus with essentially identical sequences accession nc0455122 mn9089473 mn9752621 mn9853251 mn9887131 and mn9383841 the closest homolog of 2019-ncov is a sars-like coronavirus isolated from bat mg7729331 with a sequence identity of 8799 at 99 coverage fig 1
a it also shows 80 sequence identity with sars coronavirus isolated from human patients or civet with 98 coverage throughout the entire 29903bp genome of 2019-ncov the least conserved region encodes for the spike glycoprotein with sequence identity of 7483 spike glycoprotein forms spikes on the surface of coronaviruses and is responsible for entrance of the viruses into the host cells the rbd in the spike glycoprotein molecule directly binds receptors on the surface of host cells 3 in the case of sars-cov and batcivet sars-like cov the receptor is ace2 an exopeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin i to the nonapeptide angiotensin1-9 or the conversion of angiotensin ii to angiotensin1-7 3 4 5 6 7 at the protein level the whole spike glycoprotein and its rbd share 76 and 72 sequence identity with sars-cov respectively sars-cov spike glycoprotein is known to be glycosylated a total of 22 predicated n-glycosylation sites is found in spike glycoprotein of 2019-ncov which are shared by sars-cov except that the latter contains an extra glycosylation site at n370 a detailed sequence alignment of the rbd of sars-cov spike glycoprotein with those from closely related coronaviruses at the protein level is shown in fig 1b the crystal structure of sars-cov rbd in complex with its receptor human ace2 has been solved 6 by performing molecular simulation we obtained a ternary structure for rbd of 2019-ncov that is essentially superimposable with that of sars-cov fig 2
ac except for a noted structural variation in a loop loop 2 the backbone of the deduced rbd structure consists of 7 beta sheets peptide segments involved in the formation of this secondary structure are all highly conserved without the presence of secondary structure breakers four cysteinyl residues that form disulfide bonds corresponding to c366c418 and c467c474 of sars-cov are also conserved see also fig 1b we furthermore performed molecular docking to examine the binding of rbd with ace2 the deduced complex structure reveals similar mode of extensive interaction as seen with sars-cov with a more favorable binding energy 2182 21 vs 1338 kcalmol fig 2df the contact between ace2 and rbd involves two -sheets and three loops see fig 1 fig 2a there are 16 amino acid residues in sars-cov rbd that are directly in contact with ace2 of which 8 are conserved in 2019-ncov see fig 1b presumably the substituted amino acids can either reduce or enhance the interaction to define the contribution of the variant amino acids to the rbdace2 interaction we compare the sequences of rbd from three other sars-cov-associated viruses fig 1b these include coronaviruses isolated from patients during a short weak sars outbreak in 20032004 denoted sarsv here and from palm civets and bats possible sources of sars-cov found in humans 8 9 10 11 recombinant proteins containing rbd of these 3 viruses are all known to bind to human ace2 1112 in comparison with sars-cov responsible for the major sras outbreak during the 20022003 binding with sarsv and civet rbds is substantially weaker 12 while quantitative binding affinity with bat rbd has been not been determined 11 amino acid residues in the rbdace2 binding interface plays a crucial role in determining the binding affinity among the 16 amino acid residues in rbd of sars that are in contact with ace2 14 14 7 and 8 are shared by sarsv civet bat and 2019-ncov respectively fig 1b n479 found in both sars viruses isolated from human patients is changed to k and r in civet and bat respectively an earlier study demonstrated that an n479 to k substitution resulted in significantly lower affinity 30-fold increase in kd values 12 interestingly this amino acid is substituted by a similar amino acid glutamine q493 in 2019-ncov which also contains an amide group but at an extended position which can potentially carry out similar functions in comparison with sars-cov t487 is changed to asparagine n501 in 2019-ncov but alanine or serine in the other viruses it has been shown that a t487 to s substitution increased kd by 20-fold suggesting the methyl group rather than the hydroxyl group in this threonine residue is more important for the interaction 12 it is hard to predict if n501 with an amide group can confer a better interaction hydrophobic amino acid l472 is also important for interaction between rbd and ace2 interestingly it is substituted by proline in sarsv and phenylalanine in 2019-ncov corresponding to f486 l472 is located in a loop formed by disulfide bond c467c474 interestingly this loop with ctppalnc in sars-cov is replaced by cngvegfnc in 2019-ncov containing one extra amino acid residue and totally different amino acid compositions the replacement of two proline residues by two flexible glycine residues converts a rigid structure to a very flexible one further examination of the deduced rbdace2 complex structure reveals that this unique phenylalanine f486 in the flexible loop can penetrate deep into a hydrophobic pocket in ace2 formed by f28 l79 y83 and l97 fig 2f the presence of two aromatic amino acids in the pocket may provide additional binding force via -stacking interactions 13 taken together 2019-ncov likely has a stronger binding to ace2 via its spike glycoprotein glycosylation may also affect the interaction of rbd with ace2 among the 23 glycosylation sites on spike glycoprotein two are in rbd fig 1b glycosylation has been detected on one of these residues asn330 6 n330 corresponds to n343 in the spike glycoprotein of 2019-ncov and is a conserved glycosylation site since it is well separated from the rbdace2 interaction interphase glycosylation at this site is unlikely to interfere with the interaction 6 it should be noted that another potential glycosylation site corresponding to n357 in sars-cov is not conserved in 2019-ncov because of substitution of t by a in the 2 position lack of this glycosylation is not expected to affect the receptor binding the 2019-ncov outbreak is thought to be initiated from a seafood market that also carried many other wild live animals including snakes birds and various mammals interestingly a study by ji et al suggests that snakes might serve as a likely reservoir for the novel ncov-2019 based on the observation that the codon usage of ncov-2019 was more similar to snakes than other potential hosts they investigated 14 while the data and premise are being debated we sought to address the problem by analyzing the structure of ace2 in different animals ace2 is widely expressed in the animal kingdom from fish amphibians reptiles birds to mammals remarkably its structure is highly conserved comparison of human ace2 with that of a civet paguma larvata aax637751 a bat rhinolophus sinicus adn934751 a bird nipponia nippon kfq924251 a snake protobothrops mucrosquamatus xp0291405081 a frog xenopus laevis xp0181043111 and a fish callorhinchus milii xp0078898451 revealed amino acid sequence identity of 83 81 83 61 60 and 59 respectively fig 3
aligns parts of ace2 sequences that contain all the interaction sites in contact with sars-cov rbd according to the published co-crystal structure 6 the interaction involved mainly two -helices of ace2 out of 20 amino acid residues involved in the direct interaction 4 of them are shared by all seven species of animals analyzed in the study including f28 that supposedly interacts with f486 of spike glycoprotein from 2019-ncov fig 2f many of the remaining resides in the contact are conserved or replaced by amino acids of similar chemical properties it is interesting to note that bird ace2 shares as many conserved contacting amino acid residues as bat and civet ace2 ace2 molecules from any of these has the potential to interact with rbd of 2019-ncov with high affinity therefore it would not be a surprise if any of these wild animals is found to be a primary or secondary host of 2019-ncov sars-cov-like coronaviruses have been found in many bats that are considered as natural reservoirs for the viruses they may well be the host for 2019-ncov however the possibility that cold-blooded animals like snakes can serve as a host cannot be ruled out the flexible interacting loop identified in our study may allow the virus to adapt to both the cold-blooded and warm-blooded hosts by performing immunostaining earlies studies have demonstrated the expression of ace2 in lung alveolar epithelial cells as well as arterial and venous endothelial cells arterial smooth muscle cells renal tubular epithelium and epithelia of the small intestine 1516 the lung expression provides strong support for infection of sars-cov and 2019-ncov through the airways of the lung however by searching the human protein atlas database we found that ace2 mrna is mainly detected in small intestine colon duodenum kidney testis and gallbladder its expression level in the lung is minimal fig 4
 furthermore by examining data from two single-cell rna-seq studies 1718 we only identified 2 out of 4599 and 13 out of 540 lung epithelial cells expressed a detectable level of ace2 wwwebiacukgxasc this confirms that the overall expression of ace2 in the lung is low and may also suggest the presence of selected cells with upregulated ace2 expression under certain conditions the tissue expression pattern of ace2 suggests other modes of virus transmission that may involve the functions of intestine kidney testis and other tissues particular attention should be paid to the intestines which expressed the highest level of ace2 earlier studies have demonstrated that diarrhea was present in up to 70 of patients infected with sars-cov 19 more importantly a recent case report demonstrated the presence of 2019-ncov in feces of a patient with an initial diarrhea episode 20 while this finding has been noted in other reports tests of feces and urine samples for the presence of 2019-ncov is warranted which may help to reveal alternative routes of virus transmission since its initial outbreak the 2019-ncov infection is much more contagious than it was originally thought we know that the virus is capable of spreading quickly from human to human and that people can spread the virus even before they become symptomatic 1 this makes it harder to contain the virus and many are concerned about the possibility of a new pandemic our study suggests unique structural features of the spike glycoprotein rbd of 2019-ncov that confers potentially higher affinity binding for its receptor than found with sars-cov with a higher affinity binding capability the number of viruses required to infect a cell is much reduced this partly explains why 2019-ncov appears to be more aggressive than sars-cov this also reminds us of a lesser-known coronavirus hcov-nl63 that also uses ace2 also as a receptor hcov-nl63 was initially isolated from a child with bronchiolitis in the netherlands 21 it belongs to the alphacoronavirus subfamily the rbd of sars-cov shares no structural homology with that of sars-cov but recognizes the same region in ace2 however co-crystal structure reveals that rbd of nl63-cov has a narrower contact with ace2 involving fewer amino acids 22 this presumably results in a weaker interaction evidently nl63-cov does not spread aggressively and only causes mild to moderate respiratory infections 23 the exact mode of transmission for 2019-ncov has not been firmly established sars-cov is thought to be transmitted by respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes 19 the respiratory droplets spread can occur only through direct person-to-person contact or at a close distance presumably 2019-ncov can be transmitted through respiratory droplets it may also be transmitted more effectively through the air over a long distance airborne spread or by other ways considering the predominant expression of ace2 in intestines and kidney 2019-ncov may infect cells in these tissues and find its way into feces and urine this makes transmission through the fecal-oral route and bodyfluids urine possible the presence of 2019-ncov in feces supports such a notion 20 specific rbd-receptor binding determines if a cell or animal can be infected and also serves as a target for therapeutic inventions to treat diseases caused by coronaviruses by binding directly to ace2 on the surface of host cells spike glycoprotein plays an essential role in virus infection an obvious way to stop the virus infection is to block the rbd and ace2 interaction this can be achieved by using antibodies or small molecular inhibitors naturally antibodies and inhibitors that can disrupt the interaction of rbd with ace2 is of therapeutic importance by using a molecular docking approach an earlier study identified n-2-aminoethyl-1 aziridine-ethanamine as a novel ace2 inhibitor that effectively blocks the sars-cov rbd-mediated cell fusion 24 this has provided a potential candidate and lead compound for further therapeutic drug development meanwhile biochemical and cell-based assays can be established to screen chemical compound libraries to identify novel inhibitors on the other hand many ace inhibitors are currently used to treat hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases 25 among them are captopril perindopril ramipril lisinopril benazepril and moexipril although these drugs primarily target ace a homolog of ace2 with 42 sequence identity and 61 sequence similarity in the catalytic domain they may be effective toward ace2 as well 26 it should be noted that ace inhibitors bind to the catalytic center rather than rbd binding site nonetheless these enzymatic inhibitors may indirectly alter conformation of the rbd binding site and thereby affect the interaction of ace2 with rbd it is certainly worthwhile to test these drugs for their ability to block the rbdace2 interaction the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper  critical differences between the binding features of the spike proteins of
sars-cov-2 and sars-cov chen bai arieh warshel   the 2019 coronavirus disease covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has been spread globally since its first outbreak in wuhan china
in december 201913 common symptoms of
sars-cov-2 infected patients involve fever cough and fatigue with an estimated death rate
of 354 it has already caused more than 7 million confirmed
cases and more than 400000 deaths all over the world at the time this work is written in
addition to health concerns the disease also brought severe economic and social
issues5 while the situation of wuhan has been stepped down europe and
the united states are experiencing a major epidemic thus it is crucial to understand the
infection and spreading process and find measures to mitigate the epidemic situation the sars-cov-2 is a member of the beta-coronavirus genus6 which also
includes the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and the middle-east
respiratory syndrome virus mers the sars-cov-2 virus appears to be optimized for binding
to the human receptor ace27 and the binding patterns between ace2 and
sars-cov-2 or sars-cov at the receptor binding domain rbd are thought to be almost
identical8 more specifically sars-cov-2 shares 7678
sequence identity with sars-cov for the whole protein and 7376 for the rbd9 the trimeric spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 is comprised of three s1s2
units and the rbd locates at s1 one variation the s1s2 cleavage site of sars-cov-2 is a
unique rrar furin recognition site10 while in sars-cov
it is a single arginine11 the three s1s2 units undergo a hingelike
conformational switch between up and down states only at
the up state the rbd is exposed and is able to bind to the receptor while
at the down state the rbd is hidden and is inaccessible by the
receptor12 for sars-cov the spike trimer with two
down and one up is the most populated state13 this could very likely be the case for sars-cov-2 but to our knowledge no
experimental statistical measurement has been reported yet a recent study pointed out the
possibility of two spike proteins binding with the same ace214 after
binding to the receptor the following cascade of events is triggered the spike protein
undergoes a large conformational change the s1 with the receptor is shed s2 is transformed
to a more stable postfusion state and finally the viral membrane is fused with the cell
membrane1516 despite the similarities in structures and binding patterns between the two viruses
sars-cov-2 spreads faster than sars-cov and this might be due to the stronger binding of the
ace2-sars-cov-2 complex12 the range of experimental binding affinities
of the two ace2-virus is wide with reports of 15 nm12 and 150185
nm13 for the ace2-sars-cov-2 and the ace2-sars-cov complexes
respectively and also reports of 47 nm and 31 nm8 and 12 nm and 50
nm17 for both systems respectively in all cases the ace2-sars-cov-2
complex shows a larger binding affinity than ace2-sars-cov on the other hand although the
sequences and epitope have been studied extensively it is still unclear what is the
structuralenergetic basis for the difference between the two complexes moreover the
receptor binding is a crucial step for drug and antibody interference with the infection
process thus this work will focus on understanding the detailed differences between the
binding features of the two coronaviruses and the human receptor ace2 recent works yielded high-resolution structure of sars-cov-2 at its prefusion state14 as well as the complex of its rbd domain and ace28 these
emerging structures provide an opportunity to use computational modeling to investigate the
underlying mechanism behind the differences in binding strengths of the two ace2-virus
complexes however such a task is very challenging for example recent theoretical work18 analyzed the number of contacts interface area and fluctuations and
concluded that different viruses have different strategy for binding however this work
could not obtain the correct order of binding affinity between the ace2-sars-cov-2 and
ace2-sars-cov complexes obviously the main issue is the differences in interaction of free energies between the
two types of viruses and the receptor as this energy is essential for understanding the
binding process evaluating the binding energy of a very large protein complex is an
enormous challenge for fully atomistic models and thus we chose here to use our
coarse-grained cg model1921 to study the energetics of
the complexes our cg model has been consistently developed and systematically calibrated to
account for proper evaluation of electrostatic free energies of proteins and membranes
including of course solvation and hydrophobic effects the model was applied extensively
to many systems calculating protein-folding free energies and related
properties2224 here we use the model to
evaluate the binding of the virus to ace2 our analysis of the binding patterns found that the substitutions of residues near the rbd
of sars-cov in the conversion to sars-cov-2 is not the reason for the increase in binding
energy it is found that the major contribution actually comes from the body of the spike
protein that is away from the rbd it is also found that the antibody of sars-cov that did
not show cross-reactivity might be partially due to the fact that the binding interface is
partially covered compare to the situation in the ace2-sars-cov-2 complex in this work we used modeler25 to perform homology modeling in
constructing the binding complexes of ace2-sars-cov-2 and m396-sars-cov-2 the sars-cov-2
structure was taken from the recent cryo-em study pdb id 6vsb12 with an incomplete receptor binding
domain for the binding domain we used the crystal structure of sars-cov-2 rbd that is
bound to ace2 pdb id 6m0j8 the binding between m396 and sars-cov-2 was modeled using the m396-sars-cov
structure as a template pdb id 2dd826 subsequently we utilized our cg model to calculate the free energy of each structure and
the relevant binding energies our cg model is focused on the electrostatic free energy of
the protein that involves the solvation energy and the interactions between charged and
polar residues the full cg treatment includes membrane terms see si which are not included in the present case since the membrane is out of
the system studied the total cg energy is defined as follows20 see also
si the terms on the right are the side chain van der waals energy main chain solvation
energy main chain hydrogen bond energy side chain electrostatic energy side chain polar
energy side chain hydrophobic energy main chainside chain electrostatic energy and main
chainside chain van der waals energy respectively the scaling coefficients
c1 c2 and
c3 are taking values of 010 025 and 015 in this work before the evaluation of the free energy we used a monte carlo proton transfer mcpt
method20 to determine the charge configuration of all ionizable
residues in the system in the mcpt approach the mc procedure controls proton transfer
moves between ionizable residues or between one ionizable residue and the bulk the
acceptance probability of the move is determined by standard metropolis criteria see
si by such calculations we are able to get the cg free energy of each
protein configuration and also the electrostatic contribution of each residue when they are
either in the ace2-virus complex or in the unbound state note that the cg already
represents the free energy of the system and not the potential energy all calculations and
simulations were carried out using the molaris-xg package2728 for more details see si we started by trying to evaluate the binding energy differences between the two complexes
ace2-sars-cov-2 and ace2-sars-cov and to determine where the difference is coming from
this study utilized the recently published cryo-em structure of sars-cov-2 pdb id 6vsb12 and the crystal
structure of its rbd and ace2 pdb id 6m0j8 and performed homology-modeling in order to obtain
the structure of the ace2-sars-cov-2 complex the structure of ace2-sars-cov has been taken
from a previous work pdb id 6cs213 after getting the structures we performed energy
minimization and molecular dynamics for structural relaxation this procedure was followed
by the mcpt algorithm20 that determines the optimal charge distribution
of the ionizable residues and obtained the cg energies of the ace2-sars-cov-2 and
ace2-sars-cov complexes with the same treatment we obtained the cg energies of the ace2
sars-cov and sars-cov-2 monomers at infinite distance separation the ace2-virus binding
free energy was then calculated by gbinding 
gcomplex  gace2 
gvirus even though the binding mode of the two ace2-virus complexes figure 1b were argued to be almost identical8 we still
obtained binding energy of 707 kcalmol for ace2-sars-cov-2 and 664 for
ace2-sars-cov respectively as expected the major difference come from electrostatic
contributions at this point the binding energy difference could either be an effect of the
nonconserved residues or the change in structures of the two complexes near or outside the
rbds to understand this issue in a more quantitative way we evaluated the electrostatic
contributions of each residue to the total binding free energy of the two complexes see
figure 2a it was found that some residues give
positive contributions while others give negative contributions this finding is consistent
with the results that show some interactions at the binding interface strengthen while
others weaken the binding14 to see whether the difference in binding
comes from the rbd we further classified the free energy contributions based on their
distances from the binding site thus we plotted in figure 2b the contributions of the residues within given range to the total
free energy this was done according to the distances to the n501 residue of ace2-sars-cov-2
or to t487 of ace2-sars-cov to our surprise if we consider the residues within 60 
of the binding site it is found that the ace2-sars-cov complex has a stronger binding
affinity its curve is below that of the ace2-sars-cov-2 curve apparently the residues
between 60 and 120  are the residues that switched the trend this result indicates
that the binding to the receptor in a remote position from the binding site possibly leads
to a stronger binding in ace2-sars-cov-2 than in ace2-sars-cov interestingly the three
s1s2 cleavage sites also locate within the 60120  range in view of the above conclusion we tried to examine whether the finding of long-range
interactions is coincidental thus we tested the influence of effective dielectric constant
in the cg model using a constant between 60 and 90 and also use a function of the form
eff  1  1 
exprij where we used
  80 and   08 it was found that the trend stayed similar to the
different dielectric constants it is still possible that including the effect of the ionic
strength would reduce the binding difference at the long distance but the sign is very
unlikely to change it should be noted that the value of the overall calculated binding energy is most probably
an overestimate one missing effect is the entropy contribution of the separate parts of the
complex which is equal for the two systems another missing effect is the above-mentioned
effect of the ionic strength that would reduce the electrostatic interaction to illustrate the contributions of each residue we plot their contributions in figure 2cd the figure assigns each residue one color
by its free energy contribution both complexes have residues with relatively large energy
changes near the binding site red and yellow colors and according to figure 2b these contributions are more negative for
ace2-sars-cov-2 however when we move outside the rbd more residues of this type appear in
the thinner spike protein body of sars-cov2 compared to the fatter spike protein body of
sars-cov it suggests that for both ace2-virus complexes some residues at the rbd region
strengthen the binding while others weaken it figure 2a however the interactions change between 60 to 120  at the binding site
makes the binding affinity of sars-cov-2 stronger figure 2b and may indicate an effective evolution of the spike protein body of the novel
virus this larger binding affinity might explain why sars-cov-2 spreads faster than
sars-cov because of the structural homology and similar binding patterns several rbd-directed
monoclonal antibodies m396 s230 80r of sars-cov have been tested for sars-cov-2 but
none of them could show cross-reactivity812 another antibody cr3022 that was obtained from a
convalescent sars-cov patient could bind to sars-cov-2 but still could not neutralize the
virus even at a concentration as high as 400 gml and its cross-reactivity was
attributed to the high percentage of targeted epitope residues 8629 in this work we tried to understand the absence of cross-reactivity by studying the binding
pattern between sars-cov-2 with one of the sars-cov antibody m396 we used homology
modeling to generate a structure of the m396-sars-cov-2 complex from sars-cov-2 pdb id
6vsb12 and
m396-sars-cov rbd pdb id 2dd826 structures for the antibody-virus complexes we
used gbinding  gcomplex
 gm396  gvirus
figure 3a shows the overlapped structures of the
ace2-sars-cov-2 and m396-sars-cov-2 complexes that are aligned toward the virus body
visually the m396 antibody only covers part of the ace2-sars-cov-2 binding interface as
before we analyzed the distance-dependent electrostatic energy contributions of the
m396-virus complex as seen from figure 3b the
binding of m396 and sars-cov-2 does not result in structuralenergetic differences that can
lead to an increase of interactions in the range between 60 and 120  as was observed
in the ace2-sars-cov-2 complex the energy contribution near the rbd 60  is also
weaker in comparison to the corresponding contribution in the ace2-virus complex overall
m396 shows an ineffective binding pattern that misses part of the epitopes of ace2 that
could trigger the following structural changes and this might also be the case for other
antibodies that did not show cross-reactivity to mimic the ace2-sars-cov-2 binding pattern
zhang et al synthesized a 23-mer peptide fragment of the ace2 peptidase domain 1
helix30 however the binding affinity was not strong this might be an
effect of the instability of a small helix fragment structural analysis shows that there are 14 key residues that participate in the binding
between ace2 and sars-cov17 among them eight are conserved in
sars-cov-2 and the other six are mutated the six mutated residues are n439r426
sars-cov-2sars-cov l455y442 f486l472 q493n478 q498y484 and n501t487 figure 4a to understand how the substituted residues
would affect binding energy we performed mutation calculations for the two ace2-virus
complexes the residues of ace2-sars-cov-2 were mutated to the one in the corresponding
position in ace2-sars-cov and vice versa after introducing the mutation we performed
another relaxation run before the cg mcpt free energy evaluation as shown in table 1 all mutated ace2-sars-cov-2 constructs are
less stable compared to the wild-type system while the mutated ace2-sars-cov shows the
opposite results this is consistent with our previous distance-dependent binding energy
contributions near the rbd where we find that the ace2 and sars-cov complex gives a more
favorable binding pattern than in the ace2-sars-cov-2 complex figure 2b the mutation calculation suggests that the effective binding of
the novel virus might happen at the remote part the current work explored the structuralenergetic basis of the difference in binding
energy between the sars-cov-2ace2 and the sars-covace2 complexes it was found that the
binding of sars-cov-2 is more favorable not because its rbd has been optimized but because
the sars-cov-2 glycoprotein trimer body has been evolved to bind stronger at distanced sites
in fact if we just consider the rbd then sars-cov is more favorable it is not very clear
if this stronger binding is converted to conformational changes cleavage and subsequent
fusion events however if this is the case we have an interesting explanation of the reason
why the novel coronavirus spreads faster and easier the results also suggest to use the
novel virus as a template during drugantibody design with the whole spike protein as a
binding template instead of a fraction of the rbd that might neglect the essential changes

 according to the findings of walls et al 2020 it is found that 3-d structures of the receptor-binding domain of spike proteins of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov are strikingly similar 11 molecular interactions studies and crystal structure analysis also confirms that spike protein of sars-cov-2 binds to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor and readily infects ciliated bronchial cells and type ii pneumocytes found in lungs unfortunately sars-cov-2 has more affinity for ace2 receptors than sars-cov due to a single n501t mutation in the s protein of sars-cov-2 25 which aids in their transmission from host to host it is noteworthy that the expression level as well as allele frequency of ace2 receptors varies among populations these factors may correlate the disease susceptibility and sequence polymorphism the binding of the viral s protein to ace2 induces a negative feedback loop as the level of ace2 drops its counterpart enzyme ace picks up its role of converting substrate angiotensin i to angiotensin ii elevated levels of angiotensin ii results in the profound binding to its receptor agtr1a resulting in the increased pulmonary vascular permeability 26 a study of 99 patients infected with sars-cov-2 showed that females were less susceptible to infection than males and older males with comorbidities were more likely to be infected with sars-cov-2 and highlighted insights into the role of ace2 in the sars-cov-2 pandemic 2728 advance research in the field of structural and molecular biology shall reveal the complexities of the molecular mechanism that prompts coronavirus s-mediated membrane fusion sars-cov-2 the seventh member of the coronavirus family has the characteristic manifestation of both lower and upper respiratory tracts with symptoms like dry or productive cough sore throat lassitude followed by fever serious cases develop pneumonia pulmonary edema sepsis respiratory distress or septic shock elderly people or persons already suffering from comorbidities such as diabetes cardiovascular disease hypertension chronic respiratory illness etc are more prone to severe complications children are found to be at a lower risk for serious illness with the symptomatic illness being rare and mild infections in pregnant women appear to be like non-pregnant women there is no concrete evidence to support the risk of vertical transmission however alzamora et al reported a severe covid-19 disease in a 41- year-old pregnant woman with risk factors of diabetes mellitus and obesity with respiratory distress mechanical invasive ventilation and preterm delivery the neonate tested positive on rt-pcr for nasal swab 16 h post caesarean section 29 the sterility of a c-section coupled with isolation measures immediately after rule out the possibility of infection during or after birth strongly raising the suspicion of in utero transmission of the virus the neonate needed external ventilator support for 12 h then he was extubated and put on cpap the outcome was favourable and he did not require antibiotic support lab tests and imaging were found to be normal throughout 30 infected patients have shown high leukocyte counts abnormal respiratory functioning or boosted pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnf- mip1 interleukin-2 7 and 10 additionally c-reactive protein erythrocyte sedimentation rate and d-dimer formation also peaks with infection 31 covid-19 showed some unique clinical features that include the targeting of the lower airway as is evident by symptoms like rhinitis sneezing and sore throat fig 4
 also patients infected with covid-19 were found to have developed intestinal symptoms like diarrhoea 32 while only a few of mers or sars patients had diarrhoea 31 upon entering the host sars-cov-2 has been reported to stay in the respiratory tract for a few days which is the asymptomatic period it has been found that the virus persists for up to 14 days in severe cases and 8 days in non-severe cases the viral load profile is found to peak at the time of onset of symptoms and so is transmissible easily at an early stage of infection a high viral load is found in severe cases and can be potentially used as a marker of case severity and prognosis the viral rna particle is found in the faeces for 5 days after the onset of the symptom and persists up to 4 to 5 weeks as well as in total blood urine serum and saliva 32 the main mode of transmission is through fomites and respiratory droplets rates of transmission appear to be similar for asymptomatic and symptomatic patients according to the data revealed by european centre for disease prevention and control the environmental sustainability of active sars-cov-2 is up to 3 h in the air after aerosolization around 24 h on chipboard and almost 3 days on stainless steel or plastic based on the assessment made by the chinese government the who indicated that about 80 of affected individuals have symptoms similar to those of mild seasonal influenza the remaining 20 however develop viral interstitial pneumonia requiring hospitalization in approximately 5 of these patients the pneumonia is critical and requires intensive care overall mortality ranges between 05 and 5 with a clear positive correlation with age and other comorbidities 33 as mentioned earlier the covs typically have 4 conserved structural proteins classified as the matrix m the small envelope e proteins the trimeric spike s glycoproteins and the nucleocapsid n proteins 23 fig 5
 an additional glycoprotein called hemagglutin esterase he is often present in betacoronaviruses including sars-cov-2 34 homology modelling enables to reveal of the tentative structure of various structuralnon-structural proteins based on previously known proteins of sars coronavirus fig 5 the n protein or nucleocapsid protein of coronavirus is a subnuclear structure it is generally found in abundance in primary host cells as well as virions carrying plasmids that express n protein 35 n protein plays a key role in forming a long helical nucleocapsid structure or ribonucleoprotein rnp complex composed of viral rna and n-terminal domain of n protein n-ntd 36 these proteins release the viral genomes into the membranous network of the endoplasmic reticulum-golgi intermediate compartment ergic where they assemble with other structural proteins to form the mature virion it is discovered in immunological experiments that the rnp complex is involved in maintaining stable rna conformation required for the replication and transcription of the viral genome 37 structurally n proteins comprise of three domains arranged as a n-terminal rna-binding domain ntd followed by a serarg sr-rich central linker region and a c-terminal dimerization domain ctd 37 the ntd and ctd of the n proteins execute the binding and oligomerization of rna respectively whereas the central linker region of the n protein is the rna-binding sites as it is chief phosphorylation site 37 the previously published structural analysis showed that the ntd is a fist-shaped structure rich in basic amino acids while the core is composed of loops of -sheets providing flexibility there 37 lin et al 2014 carried out research to identify ribonucleotide-binding sites using ribonucleoside monophosphate instead of rna it showed that arg122 tyr124 tyr126 and arg164 side chains participate in the formation of ribonucleotide-binding pocket and also reach out to rna via covalentnon-covalent interactions these critical residues of n protein are conserved in another human coronavirus also few other identified amino acid residues in the n protein involved in rna binding are y124 r122 and r164 35 the n protein is employed in regulating viral rna replication transcription and genome packaging 37 during virion assembly n protein and rna compacts to form the helical nucleocapsid 35 they regulate cellular processes like cell cycle cytoskeleton reorganization or host cell apoptosis 35 they are also capable of eliciting protective immune responses from the host due to its highly immunogenic phosphoprotein 37 previous studies proposed that n proteins have a big role to play in the life cycle of coronaviruses thus can positively be seen as antiviral drug targets 37 mutation in the rna-binding sites at the n terminal domain may result in a reduced affinity for rna binding 37 thus it would be reasonable to target the rna-binding domain of coronavirus n protein for broad range anti-coronavirus drugs competitive inhibitors of this site may be employed to combat cov infection further by the virtue of the conservation of n protein sequence and its strong immunogenicity the n protein can be seen as a diagnostic tool viral copy numbers can be quantified in the test sample via quantitative real-time rt-pcr qrt-pcr followed by determination of n protein expression in the cells using immunofluorescence microscopy after 48 h of infection 30 the spike protein of coronaviruses is a glycoprotein it contains clove-shaped protrusions that can bind only to their unique receptors present on the host cell surface the spike protein has three segments i ectodomain ed region ii transmembrane tm region and iii intracellular ic domain which comprise the intracellular short tail part 38 it is a large trans membrane protein consisting of two subunits s1 trimeric stalk and s2 trimeric stalk on c-terminal together comprise the ed 39 both are crucial for the successful entry of coronavirus into a host cell s1 initiates the first step of viral entry as it contains the receptor-binding domain s2 later mediate the fusion of the cell and viral membranes the critical step of cleavage of s protein is generally mediated by host protein convertase that allows for the fusion sequences to be exposed as required for the fusion cleavage of s protein at s1s2 site mediates cell-cell fusion and is an essential step for the entry of s protein into human lung cells this vital step is governed by cellular protease furin that performs this cleavage sars-cov-2 like mers-cov depends on this furin-mediated pre-cleavage of s proteins at the s1s2 site for the activation of s protein by tmprss2 in lung cells which fail to express robust levels of cathepsin l inhibitors of furin and tmprss2 can serve as possible therapeutic options in covid-19 a recent study reported that the inhibitor of tmprss2 blocks sars-cov-2 infection 40 however an interesting point that should be noted is that furin is needed for normal development unlike tmprss2 and hence obstructing furin for longer periods can be associated with unwanted toxic effects 40 genomic analysis of the novel coronavirus revealed that its spike protein differs from those of close bat cov relatives in the sense that it has a specific site which gets activated by an enzyme called furin protease and three adjacent o-linked glycans although few commonalities have also been proved between sars-cov-2 and mers-cov stressing on their furin-mediated cleavage of s protein at specific site and subsequent activation by tmprss2 of host cell furin belongs to subtilisin-like proprotein convertase family which facilitate the conversion of precursor proteins into their biologically active form structurally furin is a type i trans membrane protease expressed by various host tissues including humans the s1s2 cleavage site is the target for furin during infection the reported furin cleavage sequence found to be polybasic predominantly arginine residues prrarsv but the function is still unclear 4142 since furin is present in various human organs like the lungs small intestines or liver it aids virus to metastasize in the body says li hua a structural biologist at huazhong university of science and technology viruses that reach target sites like respiratory tract convert and activate their own surface glycoproteins using furin this makes their role in viral protein processing significant there is an implied possibility of cleavage of sars-cov-2 s glycoprotein once it exits from lung epithelial cells and consequently can efficiently infect other cells 43 this aspect makes sars-cov-2 more dangerous than its other counterparts in the same genus acquisition of the furin cleavage site can be expressed as gain of function that allowed a bat cov to infect humans 41 it can also transmit between different hosts through gene recombination or mutations in the receptor-binding domain leading to a higher mortality rate the sars-cov-2 virus can enter human bronchial epithelia through contact with the ace2 receptors on them making this virus highly host-specific recently the crystal structure of the spike proteins receptor-binding domain of sars-cov-2 in complex with human ace2 was released by wang and zhangs group 25 interestingly a study conducted revealed that ace2 expression is higher in males than females supporting this notion 618 deaths were reported in males in a sample study carried out in new york additional findings suggest that the binding of sars-cov-2 to ace2 is synergistic to the expression of ace2 44 the main components of the s1 domain are the n-terminal domain ntd and the c-terminal domain ctd this s1 domain is marked as a major antigen on the surface of the coronavirus receptor binding domain rbd at the head region of s1 recognizes the host cell receptor ace2 it is reported that the glutamine 394 and lysine 31 are the key residues of rbd and ace2 respectively that are involved in this interaction 25 initiating the membrane fusion between viral particles and the hosts receptor there are 18 residues of ace-2 that interact with the rbd contain 14 amino acids of spike protein and for this contact k341 of ace-2 and r453 residue of rbd play the most important role 38 a small section of the s1 region formed between 318 and 510 amino acid residues are plenty for strong attachment to the peptidase domain of ace2 25 according to another report six rbd residues l455 f486 q493 s494 n501 and y505 are actively involved in ace2 receptor binding and determining host range of sars-cov-2 45 s2 contains basic elements like hydrophobic fusion peptide needed for membrane fusion fig 6
 x-ray crystallographic analysis demonstrates that hr1 and hr2 domains combinedly form the 6-hb fusion core in the s2 subunit of sars-cov-2 the structure is crucial for membrane fusion in sars-cov-2 pathogenesis 46 fig 6 below shows the structure of sars-cov-2 6-hb as cartoon and surface representation with hr1 colored in red and hr2 in green using the wimley-white interfacial hydrophobic interface scale it was reported that fusion peptide sars-cov is a part of n-terminal domain which is conserved across the coronaviridae 47 the spike protein of sars-cov-2 mediates the binding of the virus particle to the host cell surface initiating the infection process 39 it has a key role in neutralizing antibody and t-cell responses of the host thus compromise its immunity 47 these proteins define the range of host specificity of the virus ie they determine the host tropism and transmission capacity the spike s glycoprotein is a promising target for the development of entry inhibitor drugs currently the best-characterized antibodies against coronaviruses target the receptor-binding domain rbd of the s protein and prevent binding to host cells 30 the rbd however is the most variable part of the spike protein and antibodies that target this domain are unlikely to be cross-reactive point mutations on d454 or r441 site of rbd said to disturb the binding pocket for ace2 39 or another option is an anti-ace-2 antibody that could block viral entry and its replication in host cells 48 the 6-helices or a 5-helices structure is used as a receptor for protein or peptide docking 39 scientists are also looking at molecules that could block furin which could be investigated as possible therapies 4149 50 51 it is the smallest membrane protein with only 8412 kda size 52 two distinct domains comprise e protein ie the hydrophobic domain and the charged cytoplasmic tail it forms pentamers and functions as an ion channel thus named as e channel or viroporin it is found near the er and golgi body regions 52 the e protein has a special role in viral morphogenesis especially during assembly and viral progress 53 e protein also helps in increasing viral titre and mature progenies 53 many other studies infer that the e protein acts in coordination with other intracellular proteins and modulates the activity of those proteins 53 e protein can also act as a virulence factor 54 as e protein is reported to be involved in intracellular protein trafficking and regulation it would be an excellent approach to devise drugs to intervene in its expression according to an in-vivo study on the mammalian cell line hexamethylene amiloride drug blocks the ion channel 53 m protein is the most abundant structural protein responsible for providing the framework to the virion particle 55 it spams the envelope thrice with a long c terminal and short n terminal at both ends m protein co-operates with other essential proteins namely spike proteins and nucleocapsid in special assembly 55 m protein aids in protein-protein interaction viral intracellular homeostasis is also maintained by m protein 55 it acts as an epitope in humoral responses 55 since m protein is determined as a recognisable antigen the development of antibody therapy against is a good option among several proteins encoded by the sars-cov-2 genome 16 nsps are encoded by replicase scattered between two polyproteins set ie pp1a and pp1ab there are two kinds of cysteine proteases namely chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease or 3clpro and papain-like protease plpro act on these pps to release the nsps 56 they cleave at the c-terminal end and the n-terminal end of these pps respectively 57 the first three cleavage sites of the pps are cut by plpro releasing four nsps and the rest 12 nsps are released after clpro by cleaving the remaining 11 sites 57 mpro also called chymotrypsin-like protease 3clpro and the presence of cys-his dyad on the active site is responsible for its protease activity 47 the most commonly found recognition sequence of mpro is leuglnseralagly where  denotes the cleavage site 58 mpro is majorly involved in the cleavage of pps to generate nsps which later compile into the replicase-transcriptase complex rtc 59 mpro exists as a homodimer having a molecular mass of 33797 kda as determined by mass spectroscopy 59 the 21  high-resolution crystal structure reveals the two-fold symmetry of the mpro molecule where the two subunits are held together by a salt-bridge interaction between glu290 of one protomer and arg4 of the other 59 fig 7
 each monomer has three distinct domains domains i and ii display antiparallel -barrel structures whereas domain iii is a large antiparallel globular structure made up of 5 -helices arranged domains ii and iii are connected using a long loop like segment of domain iii the substrate binds to a pocket created between domains i and ii it is highly conserved among all the covs on the other hand the most variable regions were -helices and surface loops domain iii 59 the two monomers are arranged in a perpendicular orientation such that the domain ii of one is in contact with the nh2-terminal residues aka n-finger of others this dimerization is essential for the formation of substrate binding sites thus also affect catalytic efficiency of the protease and thereby maintain the shape of the substrate-binding pocket of s1 protein 59 sars-cov-2 mpro is made up of 306 amino acid residues crystal structure analysis suggests that thr25 thr26 leu27 his41 ser46 met49 tyr54 phe140 leu141 asn142 gly143 cys145 his163 met165 glu166 leu167 pro168 phe185 asp187 gln189 thr190 ala191 and gln192 are found in the active site pocket 60 plpro cleaves at the borderlines of nsp12 nsp23 and nsp34 it works in association with mpro to cleave the poly protein into nsps 56 plpro at its catalytic core domain contains 316 amino acids which is responsible for cleaving replicase substrates and a consensus sequence at cleavage sites usually found to be lxgg 59 fig 8
 major antiviral drugs are designed against mpro and plpro proteases inhibiting the activity of these enzymes could hamper viral replication many studies have recently reported that drugs targeting the main protease can be possible therapeutics in covid-19 a recent literature used repurposing of fda approved drugs to identify potential leads that inhibited the sars-cov-2 mpro and can play a key role in covid-19 therapeutics 60 the absence of any similar human protease makes mpro an easy target for antiviral drug development 59 nonetheless care should be taken to avoid the chances of host toxicity by ensuring that the cleavage sequence for the host protease should be different 59 another approach could be to mutate ser139 and phe140 positions which are crucial sites involved in the dimerization of 3clpro 58 the helicase unwinds the double-stranded rna segment into single strands by hydrolysing ntps this enzyme prefers atp datp and dctp as substrates due to its sequence conservation in all coronaviruses this helicase is an easy target to develop antiviral drugs 61 the adp binding site and the nucleic acid binding site of nsp 13 are considered in molecular docking studies while designing inhibitors but a serious limitation is the non-specificity of inhibitors that may cause host toxicity rdrp is the structurally conserved rna polymerase that executes rna replication and transcription with the help of its cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 fig 9
 this complex forms the largest 160 kda unit involved in rna synthesis it also possesses the characteristic nidovirus nsp12 n-terminal domain having kinase-like structural fold 62 it is involved in the various steps of the central dogma of novel coronavirus it has two main domains the n-terminal exoribonuclease exon domain has an important part to play in proofreading and preventing any fatal mutations and the other is the c-terminal domain act as a guanine-n7 methyltransferase n7-mtase required for mrna capping 63 it is one of the rna-processing enzymes encoded by the coronavirus genome it forms a six-unit endoribonuclease that cleaves 3 end of uridines 64 nsp16 is a s-adenosylmethionine sam dependent nucleoside-2-o methyltransferase activation of mtase required binding with nsp10 along with the presence of a bivalent cation mostly mg2 fig 10
 it regulates cellular processes like toxin neutralization signal transduction chromatin remodelling or other post-transcriptional mechanisms it acts as a cofactor and forms an assembly with nsp14 and nsp16 in the heterodimer conformation nsp16 is positioned over the nsp10 monomer nsp 10 has an overall conserved structure comprising of a n-terminus made up of two -helices a central -sheet domain and a c-terminus domain having various loops and helices 65 this he enzyme when present is localized in the envelope of cov usually in betacoronavirus both the spike proteins and hes moiety bind to o-acetylated-sialic-acids where the hemagglutin esterase domain encourages virus elution by destroying the receptor for attachment nonetheless this action of binding of o-acetylated-sialic-acids is reversible 66 this prevents the permanent damage of receptors in the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract moreover he also helps in the freeing of nascent virus particles from the infected host cells 66 according to the study of hoffman et al trans membrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 mediated priming of spike protein is required for the efficient entry of virus particles into the host cell it eventually leads to the infection of other cells that possess ace2 receptors 4065 camostat mesylate serine protease inhibitor is well known for its action against tmprss2 activity which makes it a potential drug candidate to test for sars-cov-2 65 as per centres for diseases control and prevention cdc two types of tests are available for covid-19 viral test confirms current infection state at the time of testing it is primarily based on reverse transcribed quantitative pcr analysis of the sample of patient along with serological analysis for reliable results primer sets for diagnosis should be cautiously designed since rapidly occurring variants would affect the performance of the rt-qpcr another antibody test that detect if a person had any infection history an antibody test may not detect current infection as it takes 1520 days make antibodies after infection it should be noted that having antibodies against infection do not necessarily protect a person from getting infection again with the virus elisa based immunoassays are also engaged along with viral testing to increase detection sensitivity early detection by the means of radiological examinations such as chest x ray cxr and chest computed tomography ct scan are also employed in the testing of covid-19 26 currently approved treatment modalities consist of supportive care teamed with oxygen supplementation performed via non-invasive ventilation or through mechanical ventilation severe cases may also be treated with antibiotics against bacterial infection and vasopressor support clinicians from the usa and italy have reported several other complications such as acute myocardial damage thromboembolic phenomena such as pe and sudden death around 12 trials are in progress to test possible treatments against covid-19 wang et al from wuhan institute of virology screened some of the fda approved anti-virus or anti-infection drugs and found that remdesivir and chloroquine could effectively prevent the viral growth in cell-based assay with ec50 of 077 and 113 m respectively 67 repurposing these drugs happens to be the most practical approach in response to rapidly increasing positive cases other antiviral drugs monoclonal antibodies and antibody-rich plasma from recovered patients are also under trials on-going therapies can be broadly classified into two on the basis of their targets first approach targets the virus entity by blocking the key enzyme responsible for viral life processes replication translation etc or by preventing the entry of virus particle into human cells the other approach stress on immune system functioning either by boosting innatehumoral immunity or by inhibiting inflammatory response that led to pulmonary failure 26 on 20 march who announced the launch of solidarity a coordinated effort to collect scientific data rapidly the study design has been kept simple so that even hospitals with an overwhelming number of patients can participate the physician simply records the date the patient left the hospital or died the duration of the entire stay and whether the patient required ventilation or oxygen the design is not blinded and the who website randomizes the patient to one out of four drug regimes or local standard care for this study who has chosen an experimental antiviral remdesivir the antimalarial drug  hydroxychloroquine a combination of antiretroviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir and this combination plus ifn kong et al recently introduced a docking server for docking small molecules peptides and antibodies against potential targets of covid-19 this can be very useful for researchers across the world for predicting target-ligand interactions for covid-19 68 the evolution of novel coronavirus and the eventual outbreak of covid-19 has put the burden on the medical fraternity and the scientific community to identify the components of this viral entity including its genome replication cycle proteome as well as modes of transmission this can only be achieved with collaborative efforts backed up by advances in molecular and structural virology viral proteins are identified as potential targets since they are involved in each phase of the viral life cycle in the present review we discussed the structure function and host-virus interactions of various sars-cov-2 proteins based on a thorough review of the latest literature available we hope our review will give a useful groundwork for the devising new drugs against covid-19 although many potential therapies are under clinical trial no pharmaceutical products have yet been offered to be reliable as well as effective against covid-19 who 31st march 2020 we need to focus on bridging the gaps in knowledge of covid-19 biology and pathogenesis this can be achieved by application of newer approaches like metagenomics sequencing 3d cryo-em structures and extensive in-vivo experimentation along with molecular docking for anti-viral drugs which may provide basis for devising new safe drugs and reliable testing kits this will greatly contain the spread and survival of sars-cov-2 on the other hand this whole ordeal of covid-19 indicates the possibility of the evolution of new pathogens that can cross the species barrier and causing serious damage to mankind in conclusion we must have an open-eyed approach in our progress against such pandemics the authors declare no conflict of interest  journal pre-proof neutralisation of sars-cov-2 by destruction of the prefusion spike

binding domain rbd recognises angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 initiating conformational changes that drive membrane fusion we find that the monoclonal antibody cr3022 binds the rbd tightly neutralising sars-cov-2 and report the crystal structure at 24  of the fabrbd complex some crystals are suitable for screening for entry-blocking inhibitors the highly conserved structure-stabilising spike suggesting that cr3022 binding facilitates conversion to the fusion-incompetent post-fusion state cryo-em analysis confirms that incubation of spike with cr3022 fab leads to destruction of the prefusion trimer presentation of this cryptic epitope in an rbd-based vaccine might advantageously focus immune responses binders at this epitope may be useful therapeutically possibly in synergy with an antibody blocking receptor attachment  incursion of animal usually bat-derived coronaviruses into the human population has caused several outbreaks of severe disease starting with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2002 menachery et al 2015  in late 2019 a highly infectious illness with cold-like symptoms progressing to pneumonia and acute respiratory failure resulting in an estimated 6 overall death rate baud et al 2020  with higher mortality among the elderly and immunocompromised populations was identified and confirmed as a pandemic by the who on 11 th march 2020 the etiological agent is a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 belonging to lineage b betacoronavirus and sharing 88 sequence identity with bat coronaviruses lu et al 2020a  the heavily glycosylated trimeric surface spike protein mediates viral entry into the host cell it is a large type i transmembrane glycoprotein the ectodomain alone comprises over 1200 residues wrapp et al 2020  it is made as a single polypeptide and then cleaved by host proteases to yield an n-terminal s1 region and the c-terminal s2 region spike exists initially in a pre-fusion state where the domains of s1 cloak the upper portion of the spike with the relatively small 22 kda s1 rbd nestled at the tip the rbd is predominantly in a down state where the receptor binding site is inaccessible however it appears that it stochastically flips up with a hinge-like motion transiently presenting the ace2 receptor binding site roy 2020 song et al 2018 walls et al 2020 wrapp et al 2020  ace2 acts as a functional receptor for both sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 binding to the latter with a 10 to 20-fold higher affinity k d of 15 nm possibly contributing to its ease of transmission song et al 2018 wrapp et al 2020  there is 73 sequence identity between the rbds of sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2  figure 1  when ace2 locks on it holds the rbd up destabilising the s1 cloak and possibly favouring conversion to a postfusion form where the s2 subunit through massive conformational changes propels its fusion domain upwards to engage with the host membrane casting off s1 in the process song et al 2018 wrapp et al 2020  structural studies of the rbd in complex with ace2 lan et al 2020 wang et al 2020 yan et al 2020 show that it is recognised by the extracellular peptidase domain pd of ace2 through mainly polar interactions the spike protein is an attractive candidate for both vaccine development and immunotherapy potent nanomolar affinity neutralising human monoclonal antibodies against the sars-cov-1 rbd have been identified that attach at the ace2 receptor binding site including m396 cr3014 and 80r ter meulen et al 2006 sui et al 2004 zhu et al 2007  for example 80r binds with nanomolar affinity prevents binding to ace2 and the formation of syncytia in vitro and inhibits viral replication in vivo sui et al 2004  however despite the two viruses sharing the same ace2 receptor these ace2 blocking antibodies do not bind sars-cov-2 rbd wrapp et al 2020  in contrast cr3022 a sars-cov-1-specific monoclonal selected from a single chain fv phage display library constructed from lymphocytes of a convalescent sars patient and reconstructed into igg1 format ter meulen et al 2006  has been reported to cross-react strongly binding to the rbd of sars-cov-2 with a k d of 63 nm tian et al 2020  whilst not competing with the binding of ace2 ter meulen et al 2006  furthermore although sars-cov-1 escape mutations could be readily generated for ace2-blocking cr3014 no escape mutations could be generated for cr3022 preventing mapping of its epitope ter meulen et al 2006  furthermore a natural mutation of sars-cov-2 has now been detected at residue 495 y n gisaid shu and mccauley 2017  accession id epiisl429783 wienecke-baldacchino et al 2020 which forms part of the ace2 binding epitope finally cr3022 and cr3014 act synergistically to neutralise sars-cov-1 with extreme potency ter meulen et al 2006  whilst this work was being prepared for publication a paper reporting that cr3022 does not neutralise sars-cov-2 and describing the structure of the complex with the rbd at 31  resolution was published yuan et al 2020  here we report crystallographic analysis to significantly higher resolution use a different neutralisation assay to show that cr3022 does neutralise sars-cov-2 and use cryo-em analysis of the interaction of cr3022 with the full spike ectodomain to demonstrate a mechanism of neutralisation not seen before for coronaviruses taken together these observations suggest that the cr3022 epitope should be a major target for therapeutic antibodies to understand how cr3022 works we first investigated the interaction of cr3022 fab with isolated recombinant sars-cov-2 rbd both alone and in the presence of ace2 surface plasmon resonance spr measurements methods and figure s1  confirmed that cr3022 binding to rbd is strong although weaker than the binding reported to sars-cov-1 ter meulen et al 2006  with a slight variation according to whether cr3022 or rbd is used as the analyte k d  30 nm and 15 nm respectively derived from the kinetic data in table s1  an independent measure using bio-layer interferometry bli with rbd as analyte gave a k d of 19 nm methods and figure s1  these values are quite similar to those reported by tian et al tian et al 2020  66 nm whereas weaker binding k d  115 nm was reported recently by yuan et al yuan et al 2020  using spr to perform a competition assay revealed that the binding of ace2 to the rbd is perturbed by the presence of cr3022  figure s1  the presence of ace2 slows the binding of cr3022 to rbd and accelerates the dissociation similarly the release of ace2 from rbd is accelerated by the presence of cr3022 these observations are suggestive of an allosteric effect between ace2 and cr3022 a plaque reduction neutralisation test using sars-cov-2 virus and cr3022 showed a probit mid-point prnt 50 of 111966 95 confidence interval 5297-23038 for a starting concentration of 136mgml calculated according to grist grist 1966  superior to that of the nibsc international standard positive control used by public health england mers convalescent serum which gives a prnt 50 of 1874 95 confidence interval 663-1220 see methods figure 2 and table s2  this corresponds to 50 neutralisation at 0114 gml  1 nm exceeding the 11 gml reported by ter meulen et al ter meulen et al 2006 for sars-cov-1 however as discussed below it is in apparent disagreement with the result reported recently by yuan et al yuan et al 2020  in light of this discrepancy further neutralisation tests were performed to rule out differences in the assay with regard to antibodyvirus contact time repeated prnt tests deliberately using three different batches of cr3022 gave similar results table s2  and leaving the virusantibody mix in place throughout the incubation on the plate and removing the antibody after one hour also gave similar results prnt 500 values of 14666 and 16504 respectively methods figure s2  in summary all of these results taking into consideration the different cr3022 starting concentrations were within the same confidence levels following these experiments a commercial source of antibody cr3022 creative biolabs was tested using the same method and on the same date as the above wash and leave experiment with a starting concentration of 1 mgml this gave markedly weaker neutralisation prnt 50 127 leaving the antibody on the plate and 1285 washing it off note that in both cases the neutralisation was slightly higher when the antibody was washed off although the differences were within the confidence levels of the experiments it is possible that this reflects unbound virus remaining in the inoculum being washed off we determined the crystal structure of the sars-cov-2 rbd-cr3022 fab complex see methods and table s3  to investigate the relationship between the binding epitopes of ace2 and cr3022 crystals grew rapidly and consistently two crystal forms grew in the same drop the solvent content of the crystal form solved first was unusually high ca 87 with the ace2 binding site exposed to large continuous solvent channels within the crystal lattice  figure s3  these crystals therefore offer a promising vehicle for crystallographic screening to identify potential therapeutics that could act to block virus attachment the current analysis of this crystal form is at 44  resolution and so to avoid overfitting refinement used a real-space refinement algorithm to optimise the phases vagabond hmg unpublished see methods  this together with the favourable observation to parameter ratio resulting from the exceptionally high solvent content meant that the map was of very high quality allowing reliable structural interpretation  figure s4  methods full interpretation of the detailed interactions between cr3022 and the rbd was enabled by the second crystal form which diffracted to high resolution 24  and the structure of which was refined to give an r-workr-free of 02130239 and good stereochemistry methods table s3 figure s4  the structure is similar to that reported by yuan et al 2020  the rmsd in cs for the rbd is 05  whilst for the cr3022 heavy chain it is 11  and for the light chain 07  there are also some differences in the overall interaction compared to that structure after overlapping the rbd the angular differences for the variable domains are 55 and 8 the high-resolution structure is shown in figure 3  there are two complexes in the crystal asymmetric unit with residues 331-529 in one rbd 332-445 and 448-532 in the other rbd well defined whilst residues 133-136 of the cr3022 heavy chains are disordered the rbd has a very similar structure to that seen in the complex of sars-cov-2 rbd with ace2 rmsd for 194 c atoms of 06  2 pdb 6m0j lan et al 2020  and an rmsd of 11  2 compared to the sars cov-1 rbd pdb 2ajf li et al 2005  only minor conformational changes are introduced by binding to cr3022 at residues 381-390 the rbd was deglycosylated methods to leave a single saccharide unit at each of the n-linked glycosylation sites clearly seen at n331 and n343  figure s4  cr3022 attaches to the rbd surface orthogonal to the ace2 receptor binding site there is no overlap between the epitopes and indeed both the fab and ace2 ectodomain can bind without clashing  figure   3d  tian et al 2020  such independence of the ace2 binding site has been reported recently for another sars-cov-2 neutralising antibody 47d11 okba et al 2019  the fab complex interface buries 990  2 of surface area 600 and 390  2 by the heavy and light chains respectively figure 4 and figure s5  somewhat more than the rbd-ace2 interface which covers 850  2 pdb 6m0j lan et al 2020  typical of a fab complex the interaction is mediated by the antibody cdr loops which fit well into the rather sculpted surface of the rbd  figure 3b  c the heavy chain cdr1 2 and 3 make contacts to residues from 2 2 and 3 residues 369-386 while two of the light chain cdrs 1 and 2 interact mainly with residues from the 2-3 loop 3 380-392 and the 5-4 loop 427-430  figures 1 3  5  a total of 16 residues from the heavy chain and 14 from the light chain cement the interaction with 26 residues from the rbd for the heavy chain these potentially form 7 h-bonds and 3 salt bridges the latter from d55 and e57 cdr2 to k378 of the rbd the light chain interface comprises 6 h-bonds and a single salt bridge between e61 cdr2 and k386 of the rbd the binding is consolidated by a number of hydrophobic interactions  figure 5  there are slight differences in the interactions between these and those reported by yuan et al 2020  for instance the contact area for the light chain-rbd differs by 125 between the two structures of the 26 residues involved in the interaction 23 are conserved between sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 figures 1  4  the cr30222 epitope is much more conserved than that of the receptor blocking anti-sars-cov-1 antibody 80r for which only 13 of the 29 interacting residues are conserved hwang et al 2006  in-line with the lack of cross reactivity observed for the latter the reason for the conservation of the cr3022 epitope becomes clear in the context of the complete pre-fusion s structure pdb ids 6vsb wrapp et al 2020  6vxx 6vyb walls et al 2020  where the epitope is inaccessible  figure 6  when the rbd is in the down configuration the cr3022 epitope is packed tightly against another rbd of the trimer and the n-terminal domain ntd of the neighbouring protomer in the structure of the pre-fusion form of trimeric spike the majority of rbds are down although presumably stochastically one may be up walls et al 2020 wrapp et al 2020  the structure of a sars-cov-1 complex with ace2 ectodomain shows that this up configuration is competent to bind receptor and that there are a family of up orientations with significantly different hinge angles song et al 2018  however the cr3022 epitope remains largely inaccessible even in the up configuration modelling the rotation of the rbd required to enable fab interaction in the context of the spike trimer showed a rotation corresponding to a  60 further declination from the central vertical axis was required beyond that observed previously walls et al 2020 wrapp et al 2020 figure 6i  although this might be partly mitigated by more complex movements of the rbd and if more than one rbd is in the up configuration this requirement would be relaxed somewhat since locking the up state by receptor blocking antibodies is thought to destabilise the pre-fusion state walls et al 2019 binding of cr3022 presumably introduces further destabilisation leading to a premature conversion to the post-fusion state inactivating the virus cr3022 and ace2 blocking antibodies can bind independently but both induce an up conformation presumably explaining the observed synergy between binding at the two sites ter meulen et al 2006  to test if cr3022 binding destabilises the prefusion state of spike the ectodomain construct described previously wrapp et al 2020 was used to produce glycosylated protein in hek cells methods cryo-em screening showed that the protein was in the trimeric prefusion conformation spike was then mixed with an excess of cr3022 fab and incubated at room temperature with aliquots being taken at 50 minutes and 3 h aliquots were immediately applied to cryo-em grids and frozen methods for the 50 minutes incubation collection of a substantial amount of data allowed unbiased particle picking and 2d classification which revealed two major structural classes with a similar number in each i the prefusion conformation and ii a radically different structure methods table s4 and figure s6  detailed analysis of the prefusion conformation led to a structure at a nominal resolution of 34  fsc  0143 based on a broad distribution of orientations that revealed the same predominant rbd pattern one up and two down previously seen wrapp et al 2020 with no evidence of cr3022 binding  figure 7a  analysis of the other major particle class revealed strong preferential orientation of the particles on the grid  figure s6c  despite this a reconstruction with a nominal resolution of 39  within the plane of the grid and perhaps 7  resolution in the perpendicular direction  figure s6g  could be produced which allowed the unambiguous fitting of the cr3022-rbd complex  figure 7b  note that in addition there is less well defined density attached to the rbd in a suitable position to correspond to the spike n-terminal domain wrapp et al 2020  these structures are no longer trimeric rather two complexes associate to form an approximately symmetric dimer however application of this symmetry in the reconstruction process did not improve the resolution the interactions responsible for dimerisation involve the ace2 binding site on the rbd and the elbow of the fab however the interaction does not occur in our low-resolution crystal form and is therefore probably extremely weak and not biologically significant since conversion to the post-fusion conformation leads to dissociation of s1 which includes the nterminal domain and rbd these results confirm that cr3022 destabilises the prefusion spike conformation further evidence of this is provided by analysis of data collected after 3 h incubation by this point there were no intact trimers remaining and a heterogeneous range of oligomeric assemblies had appeared which we were not able to interpret in detail but which are consistent with the lateral assembly of fabrbd complexes  figure s7  note that the relatively slow kinetics will not be representative of events in vivo where the conversion might be accelerated by the elevated temperature and the absence of the mutations which were added to this construct to stabilise the prefusion state kirchdoerfer et al 2018 pallesen et al 2017 wrapp et al 2020  until now the only documented mechanism of neutralisation of coronaviruses has been through blocking receptor attachment in the case of sars-cov-1 this is achieved by presentation of the rbd of the spike in an up conformation although not yet confirmed for sars-cov-2 it is very likely that a similar mechanism can apply here we define a second class of neutralisers that bind a highly conserved epitope  figure 1  and can therefore act against both sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 cr3022 was first identified as a neutralising antibody against sars-cov-1 ter meulen et al 2006  we find that binding of cr3022 to the isolated rbd is tight 20 nm and the crystal structure of the complex reveals the atomic detail of the interaction despite the spatial separation of the cr3022 and ace2 epitopes we find an allosteric effect between the two binding events the role of the cr3022 epitope in stabilising the prefusion spike trimer explains why it has to date proved impossible to generate mutations that escape binding of the antibody ter meulen et al 2006  whilst in our assay cr3022 strongly neutralises sars-cov-2 a recent paper yuan et al 2020 reported an alternative assay that did not detect neutralisation we tested whether the removal of the antibodyvirus mix after adsorption to the indicator cells performed by yuan et al before incubating to allow cytopathic effect cpe to develop would explain this difference this would be in-line with the distinction previously seen between neutralisation tests for influenza virus by antibodies which bind the stem of hemagglutinin and therefore do not block receptor binding thomson et al 2012  these antibodies did not appear to be neutralising when tested with the standard who neutralisation assay in which similar to yuan et al the inoculum of virusantibody is washed out before development of cpe neutralisation was observed however when the antibodies were left in the assay during incubation to produce cpe performing side-by-side prnt experiments leaving the antibodyvirus mix in place and washing it off did not however show a significant difference in fact the neutralisation was marginally stronger when excess antibody and virus was washed off to check if there were issues related to the reproducibility we performed neutralisation tests on three separate batches of cr3022 all gave essentially indistinguishable results table s2  however when we tested commercially sourced cr3022 creative biolabs usa cat mro-1214lc the neutralisation was markedly reduced perhaps improperly folded antibody it is possible the loss of neutralisation ability with commercial antibody may be related to the report that cr3022 does not neutralise sars-cov-2 yuan et al 2020  in addition we note that in all the prnt tests performed cr3022 appears to give strong but incomplete 90 plaque reduction neutralisation such partial neutralisation has been reported before for antibodies against ebola virus which nonetheless confer profound protection rijal et al 2019 saphire et al 2018  given the mechanism of neutralisation we rationalise that this arises from the kinetic limitation of antibody binding and spike destruction as seen by cryo-em where in the absence of ace2 the cr3022 fab destroys the prefusion-stabilised trimer with t 12 1h at room temperature this might also lead to slightly higher neutralisation when antibody and non-inactivated virus is washed off the cells after one hour in summary cr3022 neutralises sars-cov-2 but via an unusual mechanism that some assays appear to detect poorly as observed by yuan et al 2020  it is now important to establish how effective this mechanism is at controlling viral infection with monoclonal antibodies now recognised as potential antivirals lu et al 2020b qiu et al 2014 salazar et al 2017 our results suggest that cr3022 may be of immediate utility since the mechanism of neutralisation will be unusually resistant to virus escape in contrast antibodies which compete with ace2 whose epitope on sars-cov-2 is reported to have already shown mutation at residue 495 gisaid accession id epiisl429783 wienecke-baldacchino et al 2020 shu and mccauley 2017  are likely to be susceptible to escape furthermore with knowledge of the detailed structure of the epitope presented here a higher affinity version of cr3022 might be engineered alternatively since the same mechanism of neutralisation is likely to be used by other antibodies a more potent monoclonal antibody targeting the same epitope might be found for instance by screening for competition with cr3022 additionally since this epitope is sterically and functionally independent of the well-established receptor-blocking neutralising antibody epitope there is considerable scope for therapeutic synergy between antibodies targeting the two epitopes indeed this type of synergy has been described for sars-cov-1 ter meulen et al 2006  moreover it has been reported wan et al 2019 residue numbers are those of sars-cov-2 rbd conserved amino acids have a red background secondary structures are labelled

sars-cov spike-rbd structure and receptor binding comparison and potential implications on neutralizing antibody and vaccine development chunyun sun long chen ji yang chunxia luo yanjing zhang jing li jiahui yang jie zhang liangzhi xie  sars-cov-2 and sars-cov share a common human receptor ace2 protein-protein interaction structure modeling indicates that spike-rbd of the two viruses also has similar overall binding conformation and binding free energy to ace2 in vitro assays using recombinant ace2 proteins and ace2 expressing cells confirmed the two coronaviruses similar binding affinities to ace2 the above studies provide experimental supporting evidences and possible explanation for the high transmissibility observed in the sars-cov-2 outbreak potent ace2-blocking sars-cov neutralizing antibodies showed limited cross-binding and neutralizing activities to sars-cov-2 ace2-non-blocking sars-cov rbd antibodies though with weaker neutralizing activities against sars-cov showed positive cross-neutralizing activities to sars-cov-2 with an unknown mechanism these findings suggest a trade-off between the efficacy and spectrum for therapeutic antibodies to different coronaviruses and hence highlight the possibilities and challenges in developing broadly protecting antibodies and vaccines against sars-cov-2 and its future mutants various estimates and analyses suggest sars-cov-2 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov may have similar transmissibility with an estimated reproductive number r 0  of 377 223-482 for sars-cov-2 and between 29-33 for sars-cov 8  sars-cov-2 and sars-cov share a common host-cell receptor protein angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 expressed on epithelial cells in the respiratory track system and various human organs such as the lung 910  receptor recognition by coronaviruses is the first and essential step for infecting host cells 1112  an envelope-anchored trimeric spike s protein mediates the binding of the two coronaviruses to human ace2 1314  and is cleaved by the host protease into two separate polypeptides as s1 which contains the receptor binding domain rbd and s2 which is responsible for the homotrimer formation and mediates fusion of the virion with cellular membranes 15  the receptor binding motif rbm in rbd is responsible for direct binding to ace2 and its binding affinity may directly affects the virus infectivity and transmissibility 16 17  the amino acid sequence homology between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 approximates to 75 for the spike proteins and are 737 and 500 for rbds and rbms respectively  in december 2019 outbreak of sars-cov-2 infection has brought back the attention of pathogenic coronavirus to the spotlight 1 2 3 4 5  sars-cov-2 is spreading rapidly causing severe covid-19 symptoms and life-threatening diseases in some infected patients 6  numbers of infected cases reached over 60000 in less than 3 months 7  the prominent sequence differences between the crucial rbms of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov raise a critical question of whether the binding affinity of sars-cov-2 spike protein to human ace2 is comparable to that of sars-cov a recent study by computational modeling suggested that sars-cov-2 has a lower binding affinity to human ace2 as a result of the loss of one hydrogen bond interactions 18  however another publication using structure analysis suggested similar binding affinities to sars-cov 9  by using biolayer interferometry binding assay tian et al 9 measured the sars-cov-2 rbds binding affinity to human ace2 protein to be 152 nm which is comparable to previously published affinity data for sars-cov spike protein 19  the above comparison of spike proteins binding affinities to human ace2 between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov were inconclusive or indirect hence a direct head-to-head comparison is desired for the understanding of the infectivity and transmissibility of sars-cov-2 virus neutralizing antibody nab is expected to be one of the most promising treatments against coronavirus infection among the existing therapeutic options 20 21  several nabs targeting sars-cov exhibit significant in vivo antivirus activities by reducing virus titers in lung tissues of animal models 22 23 24 25 26  however coronavirus is a single-stranded rna virus prone to rapid mutations during transmission nabs without cross-reactivity to a broad spectrum of viral mutants could lead to treatment failure 10 27 28 29  therefore highly potent and cross-protective nabs and prophylactic vaccines against sars-cov-2 are in urgent needs here we investigated the optimized complex structure conformations between the rbds of sars-cov-2 wuhanivdc-hb-012019 gisaid accession id epiisl402119 and sars-cov cuhk-w1 genbank accession id ay278554 with ace2 by computational modeling and binding free energy analysis we also used the recombinant s1 proteins of the two viruses to compare their binding curves to both recombinant ace2 protein and ace2 expressing cells the above studies confirm that both sars-cov-2 and sars-cov have similar binding affinities to the human receptor ace2 due to the relatively low homology of the spike rbds between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov it is of significant interest to investigate whether sars-cov neutralizing antibodies possess cross-reactivity to sars-cov-2 sars-cov polyclonal antibodies and ace2 blocking and non-blocking nabs were tested with sars-cov-2 pseudovirus psv for cross neutralizing activities the structure model for sars-covrbd-ace2 complex was optimized based on the complexs crystal structure pdb id 2ajf httpwwwrcsborg the structure model for sars-cov-2 rbd-ace2 complex was constructed by homology modeling using the optimized sars-cov rbd-ace2 complex crystal structure as a template based on a 737 amino acid sequence homology between the two viruses root-mean-square deviation rmsd of c atoms between the two complex structures is 0703  indicating an almost identical structural conformation figure1b there are subtle differences in the rbd-ace2 interfaces between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov at the loop 469-470 numbered according to sars-cov rbd arising from a one-residue insertion after residue 469  figure 1a  on the other hand the interaction patterns in both complex structures interfaces are somewhat different  figure 1a and table s2  four residues in sars-cov-2 rbd ie n439 g476 q498 and n501 lost their interactions with ace2 as compared with the corresponding residues in sars-cov rbd ie r426 d463 y484 and t487 four replacing residues in sars-cov-2 rbd ie k417 v445 e484 and f486 form new interactions with ace2 which are absent in the sars-cov rbd corresponding to v404 s432 p470 and l472  figure 1ac  it is noteworthy that although a strong salt-bridge presented between r426 of sars-cov rbd and e329 of ace2 is missing in the interaction involving sars-cov-2 rbd however a new strong salt-bridge interaction between e484 of sars-cov-2 rbd and k31 of ace2 compensates for that loss the rbd-ace2 binding free energies of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 are estimated to be -4042 and -4496 reu rosetta energy unit respectively table s1 by rosetta interface analyzer 30  the insignificant difference in binding free energies suggests that sars-cov-2 and sars-cov viruses have similar binding affinities to human ace2 recombinant s1 protein of sars-cov-2 showed similar binding to human ace2 in both protein and cellular forms as compared with sars-cov the rbd containing s1 protein resulted from cleavage of the spike protein on the virus membrane is responsible for the binding of the virus to human receptor on cell membrane which is important for viral infectivity 31  binding curves of recombinant s1 proteins of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov to human ace2 were measured by elisa results confirmed that both viruses have similar s1-ace2 protein-protein binding curves and ec 50 figure 2a  binding curves of s1 protein to ace2 expressing 293t cells was further assessed using facs again similar binding curves and ec 50 values were obtained for the two viruses  figure 2b  the above experimental results are consistent with our structure modeling analysis which indicates that sars-cov-2 virus likely infects human cells through similar mechanisms as sars-cov virus by binding to human ace2 with comparable affinities and hence may possess similar transmissibility a serial diluted recombinant s1 proteins of sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov were coated on 96 well plates incubated with the recombinant fc-tagged ace2 ace2-fc for binding evaluation b recombinant s1 proteins of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov were incubated with 293t-ace2 cells and subjected to facs evaluation for binding coronavirus mutation and emergence of escape mutants to neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and vaccines are a major concern sars-cov-2 and sars-cov are two different coronaviruses with modest level of sequence homology in their spike proteins understanding whether antibodies raised from sars-cov spike protein immunization have cross-reactivity to the new sars-cov-2 will offer important insights and guidance to therapeutic antibody and prophylactic vaccine development sars-cov nabs were generated by immunizing mouse or rabbit with sars-cov s1 or rbd protein two sars-cov s-protein rabbit polyclonal antibodies table 1  and four monoclonal antibodies  table 2  were analyzed for cross-reactivity to sars-cov-2 s1 protein and cross-neutralizing activities to sars-cov-2 psv as expected the polyclonal antibodies showed weaker binding to sars-cov-2 s1 protein ec 50 100ngml as compared to sars-cov s1 protein ec 50 25ngml neutralizing activities against sars-cov-2 psv were lower by more than two-orders of magnitudes than sars-cov psv table 1  presenting a pessimistic forecast for the probability to identify highly potent and cross-reactive nabs to sars-cov-2 from sars-cov antibodies or antibody libraries sars-cov monoclonal nabs with strong s1 binding ec 50 50ngml k d 20e-10 m and potent ace2-blocking activities exhibited potent neutralizing activities against sars-cov minimum dose to reach 100 neutralization at 01gml but almost no cross-binding to sars-cov-2 s1 protein ec 50 15gml and no cross-neutralizing activities against sars-cov-2 psv 50 neutralizing activity at 100gml figure3 table 2 figure s1  s2 interestingly three ace2-non-blocking monoclonal antibodies showed modest binding activities to sars-cov s1 protein ec 50 100ngml and neutralizing activities to the sars-cov psv minimum dose to reach 100 neutralization at  10 gml although these nabs were less potent than the ace2-blocking nabs to sars-cov but could evidently cross-bind to the sars-cov-2 s1 protein ec 50 3gml and cross-neutralize sars-cov-2 psv 50 neutralizing activity at 100gml  table 2  rp01 polyclonal antibody from rabbit immunized with sars-cov s1 protein t51 polyclonal antibody from rabbit immunized with sars-cov rbd

neutralization of sars-cov nabs against sars-cov-2 psv d antibody competition with sars-cov rbd binding to ace2 recombinant sars-cov rbd protein was coated on plates nabs and recombinant ace2 were then added for rbd binding competition measurements  as suggested by the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 rbd sequence alignment analysis figure 1a  the 50 rbm sequence homology is much less than the 737 rbd sequence homology structure similarity analysis confirms the presence of significant local structure differences in the rbm regions while the rest of the rbd regions have significantly higher similarities figure 4  moreover three glycosylation sites in sars-cov rbd ie n318 n330 and n357 32 was conserved although one of the glycosylation sites n357 may not be glycosylated in the corresponding residue of sars-cov-2 as predicted by netnglyc 33  taking the two viruses rbd structure similarities and glycosylation sites into account we predict that there are two possible conserved regions in rbd where epitopes for cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies reside these regions probably do not overlap with the ace2 binding sites figure 4  we speculate that it is more likely to obtain cross-reactive and non-blocking neutralizing antibodies targeting the conserved regions outside the rbm region the neutralization mechanism for these non-blocking but cross-reactive antibodies is likely unrelated to ace2 blockage rbd is shown in a space-filled model with colored surface ace2 is shown as gray tube model the three glycosylation sites in sars-cov are labeled note that n 357 st in sars-cov is changed to n 370 sa in sars-cov-2 which is different from the nxst pattern required for glycosylation and hence this site is more likely to be unglycosylated the two possible cross-reactive regions are marked with yellow circles coronavirus spike protein has been shown to be responsible for interacting with host cell receptors to initiate infection both sars-cov and sars-cov viruses use human ace2 for cell entry 10  due to the nature of rna virus rapid mutation rates changes in the s-proteins amino acid sequence especially in the rbds receptor binding motif could have significant impact on virus infectivity pathogenicity transmissibility and cross-protection from previous coronavirus infection as well as therapeutic antibody and prophylactic vaccine development hence understanding the differences between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 and their implications may offer significant scientific and practical value though it is difficult to assess the virus-host-cell interactions with real virion we studied the new sars-cov-2 in head-to-head comparisons with sars-cov using multiple methods measurements of recombinant sars-cov-2 and sars-cov spike proteins to recombinant ace2 protein and ace2 expressing 293t cells confirmed the two coronaviruses similar binding affinities to human ace2 figure 2ab  which provided direct molecular based evidences to support and possibly explain the observation that the new sars-cov-2 coronavirus has similar transmissibility to sars-cov virus since sars-cov-2 and sars-cov are both coronaviruses with over 70 sequence homology and share the same human receptor ace2 analyzing sars-covs antibodies cross-reactivity to sars-cov-2 may provide useful information on whether neutralizing epitopes were conserved on the two coronaviruses two rabbit polyclonal antibodies produced with sars-cov s1 and rbd proteins had potent binding and neutralizing activities to sars-cov but only modest cross-binding and cross-neutralizing activities to the new sars-cov-2 virus four highly potent ace2 blocking sars-cov monoclonal antibodies showed binding affinities to sars-cov s1 protein in the range of 02 nm to 87 pm and very high neutralizing activities to sars-cov as low as 02 ugml nab can lead to 100 neutralization of sars-cov psv however virtually no cross-binding or cross neutralizing activities against the novel sars-cov-2 virus were detected with the four ace2 blocking monoclonal antibodies we then screened non-ace2-blocking antibodies raised from sars-cov rbd for neutralizing activities three such monoclonal antibodies were identified although binding affinities to sars-cov s1 protein was significantly lower with ec 50 between 55 to 224 gml as compared to 16 to 42 gml ec 50 for the four ace2-blocking nabs significant cross-binding activities to sars-cov-2 s1 protein and modest cross-neutralizing activities against sars-cov-2 psv were detected the observation that these three antibodies bind to and neutralize both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 without blocking ace2 suggest the following first the epitope or epitopes for these three antibodies are conserved across the two significantly different coronaviruses hence it is possible but maybe challenging to identify antibodies with potent neutralizing activities to both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 and ideally to their mutant virus strains as well second the epitope or epitopes for the three nabs are likely located outside the rbm motif due to their non-ace2 blocking features and the fact that homology in the rbm motif between the two viruses is significantly lower than the rest portion of the rbd an analysis on the mutations in rbd was also conducted we analyzed 68 sequences of sars-cov-2 variants in gisaid and found 4 variants with mutations in rbd one has n354dd364y two have v367f and one has f342l alignment of 111 sars-cov rbd sequences collected by blast via ncbi website 34  was used for consurf analysis 35  as shown in figure 5  the sars-cov rbm region is highly variable making it more challenging to develop cross-reactive antibodies with broad spectrum of neutralizing activities against mutant strains on the other hand significant portions of rbd marked in pink outside the rbm motif are highly conserved neutralizing antibodies targeting epitopes in these regions could potentially have cross-protective activities against different mutant strains it is also noteworthy that the three non-blocking antibodies neutralizing activities are significantly lower than the four blocking antibodies due to the limited number of antibodies obtained it is difficult to conclude whether there is a consistent pattern between ace2 blockage and neutralizing potency but one can speculate that neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved epitopes outside the rbm region may be cross-protective but may also be less potent due to the lack of ace2 blocking activities in a recent article 9  a sars-cov rbd neutralizing antibody cr3022 with an epitope outside the rbm motif was also shown to be non-blocking but cross-binding to sars-cov-2 rbd with a relatively low k d of 63 nm the neutralization mechanism of these non-blocking antibodies is not clear yet it is known that antibodies targeting the s2 region could block s2 proteins configuration change and hence interfere with virus entry into host cells whether these non-blocking rbd antibodies also interfere with s2 proteins configuration change remains to be investigated in summary the above findings suggest that sars-cov-2 and sars-cov bind to human ace2 with similar affinities and hence may have similar transmissibility antibodies targeting the rbm regions may be more potent due to their ace2 blocking activities but cross-protecting antibodies targeting the rbm regions may be more difficult to obtain because of the lower degree of sequence conservation antibodies to the more conserved regions outside the rbm motif may possess cross-protective neutralizing activities but may be less potent due to the lack of ace2 blocking activities mechanism of neutralization for the non-blocking rbd antibodies remains to be investigated developing potent and cross-protective therapeutic antibodies and vaccines is possible but could be challenging rbd is shown as colored surface ace2 is shown as

novel coronavirus 2019-ncov and sars coronavirus sars-cov swatantra kumar vimal maurya k anil prasad k madan bhatt l shailendra saxena k   coronaviruses are the large family of viruses that belongs to coronaviridae family on the basis of genomic structures and phylogenetic relationship the subfamily coronavirinae comprises of four genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus 1 the transmission of alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses are limited to mammals and causes respiratory illness in humans such as sars coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov whereas the gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses infect birds as well as infect mammals 2 coronaviruses have the largest rna genome of 2632 kilobases kb with positive sense the genome encodes four major structural proteins including spike s nucleocapsid n membrane m and envelope e which required to make complete virus particle 3 upon entry into host cells the viral genome translates into two large precursor polyproteins namely as pp1a and pp1ab which get processed into 16 mature nonstructural proteins nsp1-nsp16 by orf 1a-encoded viral proteinases 3c-like proteinases 3clpro and papain-like proteinase plpro these nonstructural proteins nsps perform crucial function during viral rna replication and transcription 4 rna recombination without proof-reading mechanism among the existing coronaviruses is mostly responsible for the evolution and emergence of novel coronaviruses 5 the frequency of recombination has been proposed to be higher in the s gene which codes for viral spike s glycoprotein on 21st january 2020 chinese authorities have confirmed around 200 human cases and three deaths due to the novel coronavirus 2019-ncov from wuhan city china according to the world health organization who as of 11th february 2020 a total of 43103 cases have been confirmed with 1018 deaths with case fatality rate of 236 around 42708 cases and 1017 deaths were reported from china alone in addition to china other south-east asian countries including singapore thailand republic of korea japan taiwan malaysia vietnam india philippines nepal sri lanka cambodia have reported cases of 2019-ncov moreover countries like united arab emirates germany france united kingdom italy spain russia sweden finland belgium usa canada and australia have also reported with 2019-ncov cases 6 however the route of transmission of 2019-ncov has not been yet identified the average age of the patients reported with 2019-ncov infection is 56 years where more than 50 of the cases are from men health care professionals and hospitalized patients are at the highest risk for the 2019-ncov transmission patients were mainly reported with pneumonia like symptoms as fever fatigue dry cough lymphopenia elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase and prolonged prothrombin time in addition patients had difficulty in breathing where chest radiographs showing bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in all patients including invasive pneumonic infiltrates in few cases 7 8 the 2019-ncov in china is suspected to emerge from closely related predecessors sars-cov and may spread further especially due to ongoing yearly migration and worldwide travelling to characterize the virus and its genetic material bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in few patients and the collected fluid samples or cultured viruses were used for next-generation sequencing all the samples have been found to be closely related to bat sars-like betacoronavirus 9 the sequenced virus wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolates wuhan-hu-1 of 29875 bp ss-rna with the accession number of mn908947 is available on ncbi database 10 the length of the 2019-ncov encoded proteins were found to be almost similar among 2019-ncov and bat sars-like coronaviruses however a notable difference was found in the longer spike protein of 2019-ncov when compared with the bat sars-like coronaviruses and sars-cov 9 the infection of coronavirus is initiated via the interaction of viral envelope with host cellular membrane 11 the internalization of virus also depends upon the potential glycosylation sites present on viral glycoprotein viral envelope comprises of three proteins where spike s and membrane m are the two major glycoproteins and envelope e is the non-glycosylated protein the m protein comprises of short n-terminal glycosylated ectodomain with three transmembrane domains tm and a long c-terminal ct domain 12 the m and e proteins are required for virus morphogenesis assembly and budding s glycoprotein is a type 1 fusion viral protein that comprises of two heptad repeat regions known as hr-c and hr-n which forms the coiled-coil structures surrounded by protein ectodomain 13 s protein cleaved into two subunits s1 and s2 where s1 comprises of minimal receptor-binding domain 270510 that helps in receptor binding and s2 facilitates membrane fusion 14 s protein is crucial for receptor binding membrane fusion internalization of the virus tissue tropism and host range and therefore is the crucial targets for vaccine development 15 therefore in the present study we analyzed the s glycoprotein of 2019-ncov considering its importance for virus attachment to the host cell receptor and compared it with its predecessor reference sars-cov strain for sequence variation glycosylation pattern structural and antigenic divergence for a better understanding of viral pathogenesis and antigenicity for comparison between spike gene s of current circulating novel coronavirus 2019-ncov and its predecessors we have used wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate wuhan-hu-1 2019-ncov mn9089473 wuhan seafood market

sequences were used and tree was generated by molecular evolutionary genetic analysis mega x software 16 and tree was generated by upgma unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean method which is a simple agglomerative hierarchical clustering method 17 for further comparison between s glycoprotein of current circulating 2019-ncov and sars-cov we have used wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus 2019-ncov submitted to ncbi by wu f et al 17 jan 2020 with accession number qhd434161 and sars coronavirus gd03t0013 sars-cov submitted to ncbi by song h d et al 22 dec 2003 with accession number ay5256361 18 for analyzing the variation among the spike glycoprotein sequences we have aligned the complete spike glycoprotein sequences of 2019-ncov and sars-cov standard single-letter abbreviations for the amino acids were used the collinear sequences were aligned by online use of clustal omega httpswwwebiacuktoolsmsaclustalo this data was validated further by alignment using emboss needle pairwise sequence alignment tools with eblosum62 matrix gap penalty of 10 and extended penalty of 05 19 mismatches and gaps were identified as  small positive scores were identified as  scores  1 were identified as  and identities were identified as i in addition we have specifically analyzed the sequence variation in the minimal receptor-binding domain 270510 of s glycoproteins to determine the differences in the viral attachment sites of spike glycoproteins to the host cell surface a glycosylation sites of 2019-ncov and sars-cov spike glycoproteins were determined by netnglyc 10 software httpswwwcbsdtudkservicesnetnglyc 20 in addition the glycosylation sites were validated by another software n-glyde httpsbioappiissinicaedutwnglydehelphtml 21 the antigenic variation among the spike glycoproteins of 2019-ncov and sars-cov were determined using netctl 12 server httpswwwcbsdtudkservicesnetctl 22 the server predicts the peptide mhc class i binding proteasomal c terminal cleavage and transporter associated with antigen processing tap protein transport efficiency cytotoxic t lymphocyte ctl epitopes of these two spike glycoproteins were determined separately and results were compared for the epitopes with score  07 the ctl epitopes were validated by another software mhc-i binding predictions from iedb analysis resource httpstoolsiedborgmhci 23 to determine the structural divergence the protein homology modeling was performed by using the spike glycoprotein sequences of 2019-ncov and sars-cov using hhpred server httpstoolkittuebingenmpgdetoolshhpred 24 the generated models for s glycoproteins of 2019-ncov pdba and sars-cov pdbb were based on cryo-em structure of the sars coronavirus spike glycoprotein pdb id 6acc the generated models were superimposed to determine the structural divergence using superpose version 10 httpswishartbiologyualbertacasuperpose which calculates the protein superposition using a modified quaternion approach deviation between the structural divergences was calculated according to the local and global rmsd values 25 our phylogenetic analysis exhibits that a 2019-ncov is closely related with bat sars-like coronavirus however both 2019-ncov and bat sars-like coronavirus emerged from the sars coronavirus fig 1 suggesting that 2019-ncov is newly spilled coronavirus into humans in china is closely related to sars-cov further complete sequence alignment data suggested that spike glycoprotein sequences of 2019-ncov and sars-cov exhibits 762 identity 872 similarity and 2 gaps fig 2a this data suggests that spike glycoprotein of 2019-ncov exhibits higher sequence similarity with 128 of difference with sars-cov additionally we looked into the sequence variation of minimal receptor-binding domain rbd from 270 to 510 amino acids which are required for its interaction with cellular receptors we have found that spike glycoproteins exhibits 733 identity 839 similarity and 04 gaps suggesting 161 difference and the tertiary structure of minimal rbd has been shown in fig 2b the significant variation in minimal rbd of s-glycoprotein suggests that 2019-ncov may have alteration in virus binding capacity and infectivity into the host cell receptor the potential glycosylation sites among both the spike glycoproteins were compared and presented in table 1 as compared with the sars-cov we have found that spike glycoprotein of 2019-ncov exhibits novel glycosylation sites such as ngtk nfti nltt and ntsn that may be the results of sequence variation in addition we have also found that the 2019-ncov spike glycoprotein exhibits common glycosylation sites that were also present in sars-cov such as nitn ngti nitn nfsq nesl nctf and nntv table 1 our glycosylation data suggests that the 2019-ncov may interacts with host receptor using novel glycosylation sites that may affect the internalization process and associated pathogenesis the antigenic variation in both spike glycoproteins of 2019-ncov and sars-cov were compared to determine the antigenicity we have found that most of the ctl epitopes are novel from the sars-cov however six epitopes risncvady cvadysvly rsfiedllf rvdfcgkgy mtsccsclk and vlkgvklhy were found to be identical represented in italics in both the spike glycoproteins table 2 in addition some of the epitopes were identified with change in single amino acid represented in italics the antigenicity data suggested that the 2019-ncov exhibits few antigenic similarities with sars coronavirus that might be associated with the similar antigenic response and therefore can be considered as the one of preventive strategies based on s glycoprotein peptide based vaccine designed for sars-cov in addition the novel epitopes may be used to design newer effective vaccines the overall difference of 128 in s glycoprotein sequences and 236 difference in the minimal receptor-binding domain influenced us to look for the structural divergence in spike glycoproteins of 2019-ncov and sars-cov the generated models were compared for the structural divergence we have found that two glycoproteins exhibits 138 local rmsd value in angstrom fig 3 which showed that in spite of 128 variation in the sequences there was an insignificant structural divergence among the spike glycoproteins this results suggests that the attachment inhibitors designed for sars-cov may be used as the current choice of therapy for 2019-ncov the outbreak of 2019-novel coronavirus 2019-ncov in china has raised alarm due to its associated global risk the management of 2019-ncov human infections depends on characteristics of the virus including the transmission capability the severity of resulting infection and availability of vaccines or medicines to control the impact of the coronavirus disease covid-19 coronaviruses are zoonotic in nature that means they transmit from animals to humans 26 however the exact source of 2019-ncov has not been yet identified the evolution of 2019-ncov may be the result of rna recombination among the viruses as previously reported in the case of sz3 strain of sars-cov which arose from the recombination of existing rf4092 and wiv16 bat strains likewise the wiv16 bat strains generated likely from the two other prevalent bat sars-cov strains 27 the most frequent breakpoint for recombination exist in the s gene of coronavirus that encodes for spike s protein which comprises of minimal-binding domain and orf8 upstream that encodes an accessory protein 28 considering the prevalence and large genetic diversity of existing coronaviruses their close proximity and frequent recombination has expected the emergence of novel variants our phylogenetic analysis revealed that a 2019-ncov arises from the predecessors strains of sars-coronaviruses in the present study we have shown the sequence divergence differences and similarity in the glycosylation sites and antigenic variation in spike glycoprotein of 2019-ncov and compared with the sars-cov strain our amino acid sequence alignment data suggests a significant variation of 128 in addition we have found 236 difference in minimal receptor-binding domain of s glycoprotein the significant variation in minimal receptor-binding domain of s-glycoprotein suggests that 2019-ncov may have alteration in virus binding capacity and infectivity into the host cell receptor 29 we have found novel glycosylation sites in the spike glycoprotein of 2019-ncov suggesting that virus may utilize different glycosylation to interact with its receptors we have also found that the glycosylation sites in minimal receptor-binding domain exhibits similar sites to other coronaviruses 30 while comparing the antigenic sites we have found that 2019-ncov exhibits novel ctl epitopes that may results in distinct antigenic response as compared to sars coronavirus these novel ctl epitopes may impart opportunities for the development of peptide based vaccine for the prevention of 2019-ncov however some of the epitopes were found to be similar in both the glycoproteins suggesting that sars-associated peptide based vaccine might be used for the prevention of 2019-ncov in the current scenario in this regard we have found one of the ctl epitope rvdfcgkgy has been used to design peptide based vaccine for sars-cov and was found to be effective in various animal models 31 furthermore we have found insignificant structural divergence between two glycoproteins which suggests that the attachment inhibitors designed for sars-cov may be used as the current choice of therapy for 2019-ncov variation in amino acid sequences and distinctive antigenicity of 2019-ncov suggests that although the current virus infection is not severe it has a potential to become pandemic moreover we identified an insignificant structural divergence in the spike glycoproteins that suggests that although the virus has changed its sequence its structure remains the same the data also suggests the scope of coronavirus specific attachment inhibitors as the choice of therapy in the current pandemic situation collectively for the first time our results exhibit the emergence of human 2019-ncov is closely related to predecessor sars-cov consequently it should be renamed as sars-cov-2 and owing its pandemic potential it should be declared as a public health emergency of international concern at the earliest  foremost our data  provide the evidence that 2019-ncov uses various novel glycosylation sites as sars-cov and may have a potential to become pandemic owing its antigenic discrepancy further demonstration of novel ctl epitopes may impart opportunities for the development of peptide based vaccine for the prevention of 2019-ncov additionally our revelation of similar antigenic sites in both 2019-ncov and sars coronavirus suggests the scope of sars-associated peptide based vaccine for the prevention of 2019-ncov the similarity in the spike glycoprotein structures suggests the use of coronavirus specific attachment inhibitors as the current choice of therapy for 2019-ncov  n and o glycosylation of the sars-cov-2 spike protein miloslav sanda lindsay morrison radoslav goldman  covid-19 pandemic outbreak is the reason of the current world health crisis the development of effective antiviral compounds and vaccines requires detailed descriptive studies of the sars-cov-2 proteins the sars-cov-2 spike s protein mediates virion binding to the human cells through its interaction with the ace2 cell surface receptor and is one of the prime immunization targets a functional virion is composed of three s1 and three s2 subunits created by furin cleavage of the spike protein at r682 a polybasic cleavage sites that differs from the sars-cov spike protein of 2002 we observe that the spike protein is o-glycosylated on a threonine t678 near the furin cleavage site occupied by core-1 and core-2 structures in addition we have identified eight additional o-glycopeptides on the spike glycoprotein and we confirmed that the spike protein is heavily n-glycosylated our recently developed lc-msms methodology allowed us to identify lacdinac structural motifs on all occupied n-glycopeptides and polylacnac structures on six glycopeptides of the spike protein in conclusion our study substantially expands the current knowledge of the spike

ace2 hace2 are glycoproteins and their glycosylation affects their interactions or vaccine design covid 19 spike glycoprotein forms a trimeric structure on the surface of the virus envelope 6  each spike protein consists of an s1 and an s2 subunit the s1 subunit mediates binding of the virus to the ace2 receptor while the s2 subunit enables fusion of the virion with the cell membrane and initiates viral entry sars-cov-2 has 10 to 20 times higher affinity for the ace2 receptor than the sars-cov 3 which may be in part related to glycosylation of the proteins sars-cov-2 s glycoprotein carries 22 n-glycosylation sequons 4 6 and at least 3 sites of mucin-type o-glycosylation were predicted 7 but were not yet observed experimentally the latest analysis shows that 20 out of the 22 n-glycosylation sequons are occupied by complex hybrid and oligomannosidic structures some of the sequons are predominantly occupied by oligomannose structures which could have influence on the trimeric structure the studies also detected one o-glycopeptide occupied at sites distinct from the predicted furin cleavage site at the s1s2 boundary 6 8 9  in this study we report analysis of the site-specific glycoforms with focus on the resolution of structural motifs of the identified o-and n-glycopeptides to this end we used high-resolution lc-msms with hcd fragmentation and modulated nce

each of the 5-pass methods using major mix byonic software protein metric was used for the identification of summary formulas of glycans associated with the glycopeptides independent searches were performed on the data with different collision energy ce settings all spectra of the identified glycopeptides were checked manually for the presence of structure-specific fragments analysis of the ion mobility data was performed using driftscope v29 by manual extraction of the retention ranges associated with the glycopeptides we have identified 17 tryptic n-glycopeptides of the sars-cov-2 spike protein occupied by high mannose hybrid and complex glycans we have determined their site occupancy by pngasef deglycosylation in 18 o water as described 11 and we find majority of the sequons fully occupied table 1  we have found that two sequons are not glycosylated n17 n603 that n234 is almost exclusively occupied by high mannose glycans the remaining 17 sequons are dominated by complex glycans in addition we confirmed the presence of core fucosylation on 15 of the occupied sequons table 1  we used our recently described workflows using modulation of collision energy ce for selective fragmentation of the glycopeptides 10 to identify structural motifs of the nglycosylated peptides of the sars-cov-2 s protein we identified the lacdinac structural motif on all the occupied sequons of the sars-cov-2 s expressed in the hek293 cells table 1 table 1 and we resolved extensive fucosylation of the core as well as the outer-arms of the n-glycopeptides as described previously 10  the presence of core fucose was confirmed on 15 sequons and we confirmed the presence of outer arm fucosylation 11 14 on 7 sequons which is in contrast to the previously published data 8  this might be a result of slight differences in the hek293 expression systems used or differences in the analytical methods for example our study analyzed a modified full-length protein not cleaved by convertases which could potentially cause some differences it is however more likely that the energy optimized workflows improve the structural resolution we do not achieve complete assignment of all linkages or quantification of the isobaric structures but the presence of these structural motifs frequently associated with specific biological functions is clearly established the overall results show that 6 glycopeptides carry polylacnac motifs that all sequons occupied by complex glycans carry lacdinac to some degree and that the lacdinac structures constitute majority 50 of the glycoforms on n165 and n1098 this may not necessarily reflect the n-glycoforms of a virion but the hek293 expression system is commonly used for functional studies of the s glycoprotein or the production of vaccine candidates which means that resolution of the structures is highly relevant previously published data describes one o-glycopeptide occupied at s323 and t325 6 8  we identified the same o-glycopeptides but in addition we have identified 8 o-glycopeptides occupied by core-1 and core-2 structures  table 2  occupancy of the sites varies from 1 to 9 57 and is very low for at least three of the glycopeptides however we detect approximately 13 occupancy with core-1 and core-2 structures at the t678 figure 2 and 3  located near the polybasic furin cleavage site between the s1 and s2 subunits which evolved in the sars-cov-2 s protein 7 this is relevant because o-glycans proximal to the convertase cleavage sites of protein substrates regulate proteolysis 15  exoglycosidase digestion and ethcd fragmentation was used to determine exact sites occupied by glycans we have identified 9 o-glycopeptides occupied by o-glycans table 2  figure 3 shows a typical etdethcd fragmentation spectrum of an o-glycopeptide in this case simplified by non-specific neuraminidase the fragmentation shows that t687 is the major occupied site as the z6 carries a glycan but the z4 does not thepeptide is occupied by core-1  figure 3a  as well as core-2  figure 3b structures in addition we used a combination of neuraminidase 1-3 and 1-4galoctosidasesto resolve the hexnac attachment on the o-glycopeptide even in the hcd spectra supplemental figure 3  we chose cims 18 of oxonium ions to determine the structural features of o-glycopeptides of the sars cov-2 glycoprotein we choose to use cims on the fragment to reduce influence of the peptide backbone on the structural resolution we were able to confirm the presence of core-2 structures by the dihexnac fragment mz 407 in the hcd spectra using the orbitrap fusion lumos figure 2a inset  the tandem mass spectra obtained from the cims instrument preserve large oxonium ions such as the intact detached glycan mz 1022  figure 5  which confirms that a hexasacharide occupies the o-glycopeptide agccamligaehvnndeasyeccamdipigagiccamasyqtqtnspr but using beam type fragmentation we could not determine which serine or threonine is occupied we cannot fully exclude the possibility of contribution from a second glycan at this peptide but neither the etd not the hcd spectra show evidence of another occupied site besides the t678 of this peptide we have also confirmed the presence of an extended core-1 structure associated with this glycopeptide by the fragments 528 and 819 observed in the spectra  figure 5b  we have used cims to separate isomeric oxonium ion fragments of the glycopeptides we have used the mz 657 ion to assign sialylation of the core-2 monosialylated structures we used an optimized procedure based on a hemopexin glycopeptide standard which we described previously 12  and we determined ccs of the fragment 657  figure 6  observed by fragmentation of the glycopeptide with sialyl-t antigen with linkage 2-3 ccs 2349 and by fragmentation of an nglycopeptide with sialyl-lacnac with 2-6 linkage ccs 2328 data not shown this is in agreement with the previously published results on the linkages of the sialylated glycans 6 8  we resolved two major ims peaks in the cims of the fragment mz 657 using a one pass method  figure 7a  with 5 passes the first peak was partially separated into two analytes with determined ccss of 2328 and 2349  2 and a second peak ccs 2485  2  this is reproducible for all 2hexnac containing structures supplemental figure 2  the ccs of the first peak fits exactly the previously observed ccs of sialylated 2-6 lacnac while the ccs of the second peak fits the gal-2-3sa in the mono-sialylated core-2 structure figure 7 panel a  we used the cims of the fragment mz 731 2hexnac2hex to determine the ratio of the core-2 structure and the extended core-1 structure we obtained 2 major peaks using 5 passes of the cims data not shown the first peak drift time6970 ms ccs 2388  2  is consistent with a core-2 structure and the second peak 7684 ms ccs 2515  2  with a linear core-1 extended structure with terminal galnac1-3gal as described previously 22  the ratio of the core-1 with terminal galnac1-3gal and the core-2 structure is 2575 we  research reported in this publication was supported by the national institutes of health under awards s10od023557 u01ca230692 and

glycoproteins between mers-cov sras-cov and sars-cov-2 the spike proteins of sars-cov-2 from wuhan zhejiang and guandong in china and other countries of the united states france australia and germany were nearly 100 conserved  supplementary fig 2  next alignment and phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences of spike proteins in sars-cov-2 mers-cov and sars-covs showed the difference of sequence conservancy  fig 1a and supplementary fig 1  as spike proteins of those five sars-covs had approximately 995 homologous aa sequence  supplementary fig 2  we used sars-ns1 as a representative sars-cov for further analysis currently bioinformatic approaches of epitope analysis are welldeveloped and successfully proved to identify both weak and strong epitopes that might be experimentally ignored 8 in our study using antibody epitope bioinformatic tools supplementary materials and methods we computed sequence-based antibody epitope scores in spike proteins of mers-cov sars-cov and sars-cov-2 fig 1b  the sars-cov-2 had significantly lower antibody epitope score compared with mers-cov p  00001 fig 1c  and significantly higher antibody epitope score compared with sars-cov p  001 fig 1c  indicating the spike proteins have significantly variable antigenicity next we conducted sequence alignment to acquire the conserved and nonconserved regions of spike proteins  fig 1d and supplementary  fig 1  compared with the conserved regions the non-conserved regions had significantly higher antibody epitope score fig 1e f  indicating the non-conserved regions of spike proteins are more antigenic as the surface accessibility of epitope is also important for the interaction of antibody and antigen we evaluated the surface epitope accessibility of spike proteins fig 1g  no significant difference was observed in the total protein level fig 1h  however non-conserved regions showed significantly higher surface epitope accessibility score fig 1i j  indicating the nonconserved regions of spike proteins are more available for antibody recognition furthermore we identified the antibody epitopes considering both the antibody epitope and surface epitope accessibility scores  fig 1k and supplementary materials and methods the antibody epitopes of spike proteins were compared between mers-cov sars-cov and sars-cov-2  fig 1l  and the unique shared and public epitopes were identified fig 1m  no public epitope could be found although five epitopes were shared between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 there were apparent dominances of unique epitopes in sras-cov 839 and sras-cov-2 853 fig 1n  moreover among these unique epitopes 927 of them were derived from the non-conserved regions and the combinations of the conserved and non-conserved regions fig 1o  indicating the divergence of spike proteins could lead to major changes in the antibody epitopes next according to the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the sars-cov spike protein complexed with human ace2 protein pdb accession 6acj 9 we used swiss-model bioinformatic tool 10 to model the three-dimensional complex structure of the sars-cov-2 spike protein binding to its host cell receptor novel antibody epitopes dominate the antigenicity of spike glycoprotein   m zheng and l song ace2 fig 1p  we discovered that the sars-cov-2 spike rbd was in the interaction interface with ace2 fig 1p  in the rbd of sars-cov-2 spike protein we found seven epitopes and only one of them was from the conserved region homologous to sars-cov yet the rest are novel epitopes using the combinations of conserved and non-conserved regions fig 1q  furthermore we identified the high-score epitopes with both high epitope and surface accessibility score  fig 1r and supplementary fig 3  finally we found 11 high-score epitopes for sars-cov-2 and only 1 of them was from the conserved region but located outside rbd nevertheless we identified two novel high-score epitopes located in rbd fig 1s  which might be used to block the spike-ace2 interaction to inhibit the sars-cov-2 infection in summary our study showed that although sars-cov-2 spike protein displayed high 755 homology toward that of sars-cov the novel epitopes contributed to 853 of all the antibody epitopes 857 of the rbd antibody epitopes and 909 of the high-score antibody epitopes in sars-cov-2 implying remarkable alterations in the antigenicity notably these results might explain why the most of the antibodies against sras-cov spike protein were invalidated for sars-cov-2 in the previous study 5 and indicate the necessity to develop new antibodies and vaccines specific for sars-cov-2 importantly we discovered novel and high-score antibody epitopes for sars-cov-2 spike protein and analyzed their rbd locations which should be potent and specific targets for developing antibody drugs and vaccines of sars-cov-2 in the future taken together our study found that the antigenicity of sars-cov-2 spike protein is remarkably dominated and altered by novel antibody epitopes which provides promising leads for the research and development of vaccine for sars-cov-2 fig 1 antibody epitope analysis

medicinal chemists sk amin abdul tarun jha   coronaviruses covs typically cause mild to severe respiratory and intestinal infections in mammals including humans 1 2 it belongs to the family coronaviridae which comes under the order nidovirales 3 4 covs are classified into four genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus the first two genera ie alpha- and betacoronavirus mainly infect mammals whereas gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses foul avian species more than 60 years have passed since the identification of first human cov hcov was documented as a respiratory tract modulator 5 6 in december 2019 several clusters epidemiologically associated with a seafood and animal market in wuhan china of patients suffering fever illness severe respiratory tract infections and pneumonia of unknown origin were reported 7 8 9 10 11 12 this finally leaded to the isolation of a novel coronavirus 2019-ncov and the disease recently named as covid-19 world health organization who already characterized covid-19 as world pandemic 13 this infection has spread over to 216 countries and territories 14 before covid-19 outbreak there were six species of hcovs that were reported for their association with respiratory tract infections table 1
 these six hcovs strains are - a hcov-229e b hcov-oc43 c hcov- hong kong university 1 hcov-hku1 d hcov-nl63 e severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov sars-cov and f middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov mers-cov 15 the seventh strain of hcov is novel coronavirus 2019-ncov aka sars-cov-2 which is taxonomically belongs to the betacoronavirus genre and possesses high nucleotide sequence similarity with sars-cov and mers-cov 16 17 18 19 20 sars-cov-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses surrounded by an envelope figure 1
 sars-cov-2 about 30000 bp single-stranded rna virus utilizes host cellular components to accomplish its physiological affairs such as viral entry the assembly and budding of virions genomic replication and protein synthesis subsequently executes pathological damage to the host 21 22 23 thus punctuating any juncture of viral life cycle by small molecules peptides vaccines or physical elements may potentially gain therapeutic benefit to host depending on several viral targets figure 1 related to the stages of viral life cycle novel anti-viral agents may be designed and discovered nonetheless different structure-based modeling techniques and numerous ligand-based computational techniques may be fruitful strategy to design newer inhibitors against sars-cov-2 24 25 26 meanwhile the hefty menace posed by current outbreak of covid-19 it is obvious that the scientific community is looking for effective drugs within plausible time the coherent development and well organised strategies remains the only hope to triumph the battle against partially known sars-cov-2 now repurposing of existing anti-viral drugs based on previous ground work of closely related coronavirus and rapid screening of drug databases is one of the strategic and economic ways to eradicate covid-19 pandemic 27 28 29 the traditional bioinformatics and chemo-informatics approaches readily generated new data into sars-cov-2 research at an explosive pace considering the severity of the spread of covid-19 this study is in-line with the concept of finding the chemo-types to expedite the process of anti-hcov drug discovery here an exquisite picture of the recent research including target-based and biological screening is provided we includes virtual in silico as well as experimental in vitro screening approaches in response to sars-cov-2 reported until april 2020 the main aim is to provide the scientific community with an overview of the medicinal chemistry of sars-cov-2 to allow the rapid development of anti-viral agents this work a part of our rational drug design and discovery 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 is an initiative to pave the way of anti-sars-cov-2 drug discovery paradigm that could help to facilitate the global efforts to fight against covid-19 the details structural biology of the sars-cov-2 virus is yet to be discovered it contains a 30000 bp single-stranded positive sense rna genome encapsulated within a membrane envelope figure 1 37 38 39 it recruits multi-subunit replication machinery 40 the genome of sars-cov-2 comprises about 30000 nucleotides with ten open reading frames orfs the 3 terminal regions encodes for several structural proteins including spike s membrane envelope e and nucleo-capsid n proteins figure 1 whereas the 5 terminal orf1ab responsible for two viral replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1b upon proteolytic cleavage of these two viral replicase polyproteins fabricate sixteen non-structural proteins nsp figure 2
 37 currently there are no broad spectrum inhibitors of sars-cov-2 viral proteins are reported mainly five sars-cov-2 targets are being investigated including receptor binding domain rbdspike protein n protein e protein 3clpro and rdrp figure 2 41 42 43 however most of the viral proteins would be potential future targets and detailed understanding of their role is required to stimulate chemotherapeutic arbitration against hcovs a comparative list of reported crystal structures of 2019-ncov is depicted in table 2
as available from protein data bank 44 see table 3 the spike glycoprotein of coronavirus is the main conciliator of entry into the host cells 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 this spike glycoprotein contains i a large ecto-domain ii a single-pass transmembrane anchor and iii a short c-terminal intracellular tail 44 the ecto-domain consists of a receptor-binding unit s1 and a membrane-fusion s2 stalk basically the receptor-binding unit s1 binds to a specific cell surface receptor via its receptor binding domain rbd whereas the trimeric s2 fuses the viral membranes and host cell to enable the entry of viral genomes into host cells figure 2 researchers already identified angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a functional receptor for sars-cov 48 49 50 51 the crowned shaped spike glycoprotein of covs binds directly to ace2 on the host cells surface and plays critically in virus infection ace2 is expressed widely with conserved primary structures throughout the animal kingdom ace2 from fish amphibians reptiles birds to mammals can potentially interact with rbd of sars-cov-2 44 therefore blocking of the rbd and ace2 interaction is an obvious therapeutic intervention to treat diseases caused by covs specific antibodies or small molecular inhibitors can disrupt the interaction of rbd with ace2 among the set of sixteen non-structural proteins nsp5 is identified to play a pivotal role in the life cycle of sars-cov-2 replication as well as maturation figure 2 being a key component the nsp5 is termed as main protease mpro like other rna viruses the functional significance of this mpro or chymotrypsin-like protease 3clpro of sars-cov-2 emerges as an attractive drug target for the development of anti-viral agents recently the 3d structure of 3clpro of sars-cov-2 was reported 1 like other coronaviruses mpro it also consists of three domains the domain i comprising of 8-101 amino acids and ii 102-184 amino acids are anti-parallel -barrels resembling the chymotrypsin besides the domain iii 201-306 amino acids essentially comprehended of five -helices and arrayed into a antiparallel globular cluster interestingly a long loop region 185200 residues bridged domain ii and iii the substrate-binding pocket of sars-cov-2 virus mpro is located in a cleft between domain i and ii 1 the binding site possesses a cys-his catalytic dyad with other crucial amino acid residues including f140 l141 n142 g143 s144 m165 e166 q189 and t190 the nsp12 of sars-cov-2 encoded viral rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp together with co-factors nsp7 and nsp8 boasts polymerase activity figure 2 rdrp is a pivotal enzyme in the life cycle of all rna viruses including cov human immune deficiency virus hiv hepatitis c virus hcv and zika virus zikv gao and co-workers 40 reported the cryo-em structure of full-length nsp12 of sars-cov in complex with cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 the active site domain of the sars-cov-2 rdrp is set up by conserved polymerase motifs a-g in the palm domain 40 rdrp active site is appointing two successive aspartate residues projected from a beta-turn structure making them surface accessible through the nucleotide channel as configured to sars-cov the rdrp of sars-cov-2 contains a larger n-terminal extension and polymerase domain multiple sequence alignment msa of sars-cov-2 rdrp disclosed percent sequence identity against different hcov strains such as the alpha-coronavirus 229e 4855 and nl63 4879 and the beta-coronavirus oc43 5507 hku1 4816 mers-cov 5676 and sars-cov 9018 thus the sars-cov rdrp is the closest strain to the rdrp of sars-cov-2 53 this structural information may furnish a basis for the design of new anti-covid-19 agents or drug repurposing against viral proteins chen and co-workers 44 suggested unique structural features of the spike glycoprotein rbd of sars-cov-2 however the rbds of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 share 72 amino acid sequences identity and disclose highly similar ternary structures on the contrary sars-cov-2 exhibits a distinct loop with flexible glycyl residues replacing rigid prolyl residues in sars-cov molecular modeling study unfolded that a phenylalanine moiety phe486 in the flexible loop involves critically in its penetration into a deep hydrophobic pocket of ace2 this observation may partially confer a stronger interaction between sars-cov-2 and ace2 of the host cell moreover spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 exhibits higher binding affinity for its receptor in comparison to other covs 44 these suggest the aggressiveness of sars-cov-2 than sars-cov-1 this observation was in line with the analysis of xu et al 44 where the computational model of rbd domain of the sars-cov-2 s protein established strong interaction with human ace2 robson 54 performed a preliminary bioinformatics studies to propose a synthetic vaccine and peptidomimetic antagonist against the spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 the author employed q-uel language to perform the bioinformatics approach krsfiedllfnkv was identified as a well conserved sequence motif that corresponds to the known cleavage sites of the sars virus this sequence motif formed the basis for design of specific synthetic vaccine epitope and peptidomimetic agent 54 a group of scientists from the cairo university egypt predicted covid-19 spike binding site to a cell-surface receptor namely glucose regulated protein 78 grp78 by employing structural bioinformatics in combination with protein-protein docking 55 firstly a homology model of sars-cov-2 spike protein was built by using sars-cov spike pdb 6acd chain c as a template further sequence and structural alignments with the pep42 cyclic peptide hypothesized four cyclic region starting and ending with cysteine residues connected by a disulfide bond of sars-cov-2 spike protein as possible binding sites to grp78 the protein-protein docking by haddock software revealed the involvement of the substrate binding domain  sbd  of grp78 pdb 5e84 and the receptor-binding domain of the sars-cov-2 spike protein in recognition of the host cell receptor moreover the favourable binding was observed between regions iii c391-c525 and iv c480- c488 of sars-cov-2 spike protein model and grp78 notably the region iv was supposed to be a pivotal driving force for grp78 binding predicted binding affinity -98 kcalmol prediction of this binding site sheds light on the mode of envelope protein recognition by the grp78 substrate-binding domain for future endeavours 55 in a molecular modeling study to explore potential inhibitors of rna binding to n terminal domain ntd of nucleocapsid protein n protein sarma et al 56 pointed out two potential hits namely zinc000003118440 and zinc000000146942 figure 3
 the authors employed two ntd structures of n proteins namely 2ofz and 1ssk firstly a set of diverse compounds from asinex and maybridge library were docked then 15 compounds for each of the targets were prioritized with significant docking scores further mm-gbsa binding free energy pharmacokinetic properties qikprop drug-likeness swissadme and molecular dynamics md studies were performed to screen the compounds out of these two potential hits one compound was a theophylline derivative since theophylline derivative is commonly used as a bronchodilator hence the author further screened approved bronchodilators against the n protein rna binding site of covid-19 56 the approved bronchodilators showed mm-gbsa binding affinity in the following order formeterol terbutaline  ipratropium bromide tiotropium bromide  theophylline  salbutamol recently native or non-native protein-protein interactions ppis are emerged as a target for structure-based screening of small molecule it may be an alternative drug design paradigm which could accelerate anti-viral drug discovery against various pathogens 57 58 59 since the orthostaticallosteric stabilization of non-native ppis of sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid protein results abnormal protein oligomerizaion and finally leading to loss of viral activity scientists from national chung hsing university taiwan acclaimed non-native ppis of n-terminal domain of the mers-cov nucleocapsid protein mers-cov n-ntd 60 they reported a crystal structure of mers-cov n-ntd in a non-native dimeric configuration which turned a target for virtual screening of orthosteric stabilizers from acros and zinc drug databases this finding provides valuable insight and further motivations into the design of new anti-virals based on stabilizing a non-native protein interaction interface of n protein 60 gupta and co-workers 61 employed computational techniques to explore the best possible structure of the sars-cov2 e protein present in the pdb database the author reported that e protein of sars-cov-2 is a pentameric protein comprised of 35 -helices and 40 loops near about 8000 compounds were docked whereas 700 compounds were prioritized with significant affinities or docking scores the docking study with e protein of sars-cov-2 and phytochemicals like belachinal macaflavanone e vibsanol divulged that amino acids such as v25 and f26 play crucially in the binding interactions the functional behaviour of e protein of sars-cov-2 after 200ns molecular dynamics studies revealed that -helix and loops of e protein escapades random movement and modulates normal ion channel activity to succour the pathogenesis in human and other vertebrates unlikely the random manoeuvre of the e protein of sars-cov-2 gets reduced after binding with inhibitors 61 khan et al 62 pinpointed three fda-approved drugs such as remdesivir saquinavir and darunavir and two small molecules flavone and coumarin derivatives as possible inhibitors of 3clpro by target-based virtual screening a number of 8000 compounds were docked and top 700 primary hits were distinguished by significant affinities or docking scores then the binding interaction between the active site residue of 3clpro and the selected compounds were extensively scrutinized using the plif module in moe further md simulation and binding free energy calculations were recorded to evaluate the dynamic behaviour stability of protein-ligand contact and binding affinity of the hit compounds 62 kandeel and al-nazawi 63 reported statistics of pairwise sequence comparison matrix among the main protease mpro of covs a high pairwise sequence alignment identity 9608 was found between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-1 mpro whereas only 5161 identity was exposed for sars-cov-2 and mers-cov mpro in consequence the number of amino acid differences between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-1 mpro was only 12 while it was 153 between sars-cov-2 and mers-cov mpro an early virtual screening vs study of fda approved drugs retrieved from selleckchem inc against the first resolved sars-cov-2 mpro crystal structure pdb 6lu7 was performed that helps the repurposing of already approved drugs to

maestro software package schrodinger llc ny usa the standard precision sp docking of schrodinger glide docking module was employed for vs depending on the highest docking score top 20 fda approved drugs were highlighted including chromocarb a vasoprotective ribavirin antiviral agent telbivudine anti-hepatitis b virus vitamin b12 and nicotinamide vitamin aminophylline bronchodilator triflusal

propylthiouracil antithyroid agent cysteaminehcl nephropathiccystinosis methoxamine hydrochloride alpha-adrenergic agonist zonisamide anticonvulsant --octopaminehcl adrenergic agonist amiloride hydrochloride diuretic detailed scanning of the binding mode of these drugs with sars-cov-2 mpro conferred that hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions were the main imperators for binding interestingly telbivudine figure 3 an anti-hepatitis b virus agent bind with the sars-cov-2 mpro through hydrogen bond interactions with amino acid residues s49 and q189 moreover a broad spectrum antiviral agent ribavirin figure 3 interacted with the sars-cov-2 mpro by forming hydrogen bonds with side chain amino acid residue q189 and the backbone amino acid residue t25 ribavirin is officially approved against respiratory syncytial virus rsv infection it is also used in combination with interferon 2b against hepatitis c virus moreover it also exhibited potency against sars-cov infection 63 in a study to distinguish potential active herbs against 2019-ncov ma et al 64 performed molecular docking based virtual screening of traditional chinese medicine database tcmd 2009 by cdocker program

may be emerged as a new hits against sars-cov-2 66 a scientist from cairo university egypt performed homology modelling of sars-cov-2 rdrp by the aid of swiss model a automated homology modelling web server using sars-cov-1 rdrp pdb 6nur chain a as a template 52 the resulted sars-cov-2 rdrp homology model expressed 9708 sequence identity to the template the model was validated based on the ramachandran plot which showed 100 of the residues in the allowed regions 975 in the most favoured region further the molecular docking was employed by utilizing autodock vina to test some direct-acting antiviral daa drugs including sofosbuvir ribavirin remidisvir idx-184 against covid-19 rdrp a grid box was chosen at the sars-cov-2 rdrp by utilizing the autodock tools using x y z coordinates of 1421 1387 1500 respectively in 30  30  30  dimensions the active site aspartates d255 and d256 were kept flexible during the docking study the optimization of the ligands were performed using mm3 and pm6 force field after that further optimization was carried out through b3lyp functional of density functional theory dft based quantum mechanics the binding energies and interaction complexes formed after docking conferred that idx-184 sofosbuvir and ribavirin can tightly bind to the rdrp of sars-cov-2 interestingly guanosine derivative idx-184 sofosbuvir and ribavirin interacted with rdrp through multiple hydrogen bonding additionally sofosbuvir and idx-184 form metal interaction through the mg2 with e702 and d652 respectively sofosbuvir exhibit two hydrophobic interactions with d651and y510 whereas idx-184 form a salt bridge d514 which referred for the increased stabilization of the interactions hence strong binding with sars-cov-2 rdrp these agents can contradict the function of rdrp in the life cycle of 2019-ncov viruses leading to viral eradication 52 in another study elfiky 67 reported sars-cov-2 rdrp targeted molecular docking study of some anti-polymerase drugs which have been approved for use against various viruses not surprisingly ribavirin remdesivir sofosbuvir galidesivir and tenofovirexhibited promising binding affinity against sars-cov-2 rdrp these results were also consistence with previous one 52 guanosine derivative idx-184 setrobuvir yak has potential to block the sarscov-2 strain since these drugs have already passed the adme and toxicity measurements these may be used as a new therapeutic drug candidate against sars-cov-2 lung and co-workers 68 identified theaflavin a polyphenolic constituent present in black tea against rdrp after screening eighty-three chemical structures from traditional chinese medicinal compounds along with their similar structures retrieved from zinc15 database the three-dimensional rdrp structures of sars-cov-2 ncbi yp0097253071 sars-cov np8288691 and mers-cov yp0090472231 were modelled using modeller 7 after molecular docking with idock httpsgithubcomhongjianliidock the theaflavin showed promising binding energy against rdrp of sars-cov-2 idock score -911 kcalmol mers-cov idock score -826 kcalmol and sars-cov idock score -803 kcalmol hydrophobic interactions were found to be the driving force in binding theaflavin formed hydrogen bonds with d452 r553 and r624 of sars-cov-2 rdrp additionally a -cation interaction was found with r553 68 calligari et al 69 cashed in the molecular docking technique to examine the affinity of several inhibitors previously developed for another viral pathogen to sars-cov-2 viral proteins the main 3c-like protease s protein rdrp

hcv inhibitors faldaprevir db11808 vina scoring 84 kcalmol and asunaprevir db11586 vina scoring 81 kcalmol surprisingly hcv ns34a protease inhibitor simeprevir db06290 autodockvina scoring 100 kcalmol was recognised as the best autodock vina scoring drug in spite of hcv main protease measure very low identity with the sars-cov-2 homolog only 75 thus this finding was thunderbolt 69 therefore it may be inferred that the similar topology of active site of both proteases was the main driving force in binding of simeprevir it fitted well into the two hydrophobic pockets fringed the catalytic dyad h41-c145 of sars-cov-2 mpro it was also fitted into the hydrophobic loop f181-f185 moreover the binding of simeprevir to sars-cov-2 protease was anchored by three hydrogen bonding interactions with e166 g143 and n142 69 in the same article the homology modelling of sars-cov-2 s protein by the aid of itasser server was done by using sars-cov spike pdb 5wrg 5  58 5xlr as a template global pairwise

covid-19 wu et al 70 predicted some potential drugs acting on a certain target or multiple targets of sars-cov-2 bioinformatics based homology modelling was utilised to build possible targets such as viral mpro plpro rdrp helicase spike etc next these modelled proteins and human relative proteins including human ace2 and type-ii transmembrane serine protease enzymes were forwarded to systematically analyse and screen zinc drug database zdd along with database of traditional chinese medicine and natural products and the database of commonly used 78 anti-viral drugs 70 this study seems to be very interesting due to its deep discussions and vast target predictability the lead candidates emerged from this study required in vitro and in vivo studies for further conformations the new drug discovery and development takes more than five to ten years of investigations as well as cost billions of dollars thus drug repositioning is the only cheap strategy to respond immediately fda-approved drugs justify safe alternatives if at least modest anti-sars-cov-2 activity can be achieved currently academia and industry personnel are involved in the testing of  i approved drugs andor ii drug candidates in clinical trials the in vitro screenings of fda approved drugs as well as the compounds which are currently under clinical trials phases were well documented 71 72 73 74 75

 a molecular docking study with pdb 6lu7 suggested that the ligand ie cinanserin a serotonin antagonist figure 7 adequately fitted into the substrate-binding site and formed two cation- interactions with his41 and glu166 of sars-cov-2 mpro this in silico observations was found in agreement with the in vitro sars-cov-2 inhibition assay where cinanserin exhibited ic50 value of 12493 m further a combination of sars-cov-2 mpro structure-based vs and high-throughput screening of more than 10000 compounds containing approved drugs clinical trials compounds and other pharmacologically active compounds picked six lead molecules as promising sars-cov-2 mpro inhibitors ic50 range 067 to 214 m among these identified inhibitors disulfiram and carmofur are fda-approved drugs whereas ebselen tideglusib shikonin tdzd-8 and px-12 are undergoing currently in preclinical studies figure 7 besides ebselen also possessed effective anti-viral activity in cell-based assays this interesting study done by jin et al 1 not only demonstrated a robust screening strategy but also open a new panorama to rapid discovery of lead molecules targeting sars-cov-2 mpro an attempt was made by su and collaborators to introduce the first sars-cov-2 mlpro crystal structure complied with a non-covalent inhibitor named baicalein 43 this compound exhibited promising sars-cov-2 mpro inhibitory activity ic50  094 m along with a dose-dependent inhibition on the replication of sars-cov-2 ec50  169 m at the receptor binding site baicalein forms interaction with catalytic glu166 and oxyanion loop residues 138145 more interestingly it exhibited very distinct binding mode than the other covalent or peptidomimetic 3clpro inhibitors 43 
in vitro screening of 48 drugs was screened against hcovs infection 71 immunofluorescence analysis with an antibody specific for the viral n protein of sars-cov-2 was scored for each drug treated cells the dose-response curve drc was developed after analysing the confocal microscope images of both viral n protein and cell nuclei remdesivir sars-cov-2 ic50  1141 m lopinavir sars-cov-2 ic50  912 m and chloroquine sars-cov-2 ic50  728 m were used as reference drugs consequently 24 drugs showed good activities with ic50 ranges of 01 to 10 m an anti-helminthic drug niclosamide and a corticosteroid used to treat asthma and allergic rhinitis ciclesonide emerged as sars-cov-2 inhibitors with ic50 of 028 m and 433 m respectively notably niclosamide reduces mers-cov replication by inhibiting skp2 activity leading to enhancement in autophagy 86 thus a similar mechanism may be introduced by niclosamide to hamper sars-cov-2 infection 71 zhang et al 87 reported structure-based design synthesis and activity assessment of -ketoamides as broad-spectrum inhibitors of coronavirus and enterovirus replication these showed good inhibitory properties against the isolated proteases viral replicons virus-infected huh7 cells near-equipotency against the enteroviruses alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses was observed upon optimization of the p2 substituent of the -ketoamides the cyclopentylmethyl and cyclohexylmethyl at the p2 substituent disposed low-micromolar ec50 values against the three virus genera in cell cultures compound 11r was found promising against mers-cov in virus-infected huh7 cells 87 by dint of high similarity among the 3clproteases of coronavirus it is awaited that compound 11r is expected to display good anti-viral activity against covid-19 in near future meanwhile the clinical trial studies of some molecules have been started against covid-19 mainly through drug repurposing 88 those are depicted in table 2 the medicinal chemistry of sars-cov-2 infection is still in its infancy with target specific lead molecules are yet to identify this study deals with the information currently available on potential targets for therapeutic invention and screening of new compounds or drug repurposing against sars-cov-2 figure 8
 as the 3d structure of the sars-cov-2 3c-like protease bears 96 identity with its ortholog from sars-cov interestingly the residues involved in the catalysis substrate binding and dimerization of 3clpro are 100 conserved in addition the polyprotein pp1ab sequences are highly similar 86 identity depending upon the alike substrate specificities and high identities we are of the opinion that the previous progress of specific sars-cov inhibitors development can undertaking a course of action on the design and discovery of inhibitors against sars-cov-2 our group have already explored the structural properties important for sars-cov viral 3clike protease inhibitors 30 recently in a collaborative work our research team suggested the implications of naphthyl derivatives against sars-cov-2 plpro enzyme though in-depth ligand-receptor interaction analysis 89 we have already predicted some in-house glutamine-based molecules to use as a seed for drug design and optimization against plpro of sars-cov-2 90 in fact some other anti-viral drugs can also be taken into consideration in this regards target-based vs is one of the most important approaches used for drug repurposing the computational analyses are not subordinate but are a right choice to enrich the basal knowledge during the long process leading to drug development figure 8 until any clear-cut treatment approach is prescribed for covid-19 the use of already approved drugs is only alternative strategy howbeit relatively limited computational resource or biased in silico screening may scattered the linearity of drug discovery of novel coronavirus in the near future the virtual hits may serve as a promising drug like molecule against sars-cov-2 after details in vitro and in vivo laboratory investigations moreover the availability of x-ray crystal structures of the important viral proteins will trigger more exhaustive docking calculation of diverse chemotypes it is crystal clear that the prevention of covid-19 requires strong and sustainable global collaborative work 91 data sharing is exigent to fill the knowledge gaps on this global pandemic further progress of the scientific understanding regarding the structural and molecular biology of sars-cov-2 will legitimate the shape of lead compounds to achieve therapeutic goals the development of medicinal chemistry through bioinformatics and chemo-informatics studies remains indispensable with a bit of savoir faire the authors have no conflict of interests  bcr-abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib as a potential drug for covid-19 nirmitee mulgaonkar haoqi wang samavath mallawarachchi daniel ruzek byron martina sandun fernando  the rapid geographic expansion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the infectious agent of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic poses an immediate need for potent drugs that can help contain the outbreak enveloped viruses infect the host cell by cellular membrane fusion a crucial mechanism required for virus replication the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein due to its primary interaction with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 cell-surface receptor is considered as a potential target for drug development based on in silico screening followed by in vitro studies here we report that the existing fda-approved bcr-abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib inhibits sars-cov-2 with an ic50 of 130 nm we provide initial evidence that inhibition of virus fusion may explain the antiviral action of imatinib this finding is significant since pinpointing the mode of action allows evaluating the drugs affinity to the sars-cov-2-specific target protein and in turn helps make inferences on the potency of the drug and evidence-based recommendations on its dosage to this end we provide evidence that imatinib binds to the receptor-binding domain rbd of sars-cov-2 spike protein with an affinity at micromolar ie 232  09 m levels we also show that imatinib inhibits other coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov possibly via fusion inhibition based on promising in vitro results we propose the abl kinase inhibitor atki imatinib to be a viable repurposable drug candidate for further clinical validation against covid-19  in early december 2019 the chinese health authorities reported several cases of pneumonia of unknown cause that had originated in wuhan a city in the hubei province of china the causative agent of this outbreak was identified to be a virus that belonged to the sarbecovirus subgenus orthocoronavirinae subfamily which was previously referred to by its interim name 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov 1 2 and was later named as sars-cov-2 3  due to the rapid spread of covid-19 the world health organization who declared it a global pandemic in march 2020 4  by mid-june 2020 over 7 million cases have been confirmed across 188 countries resulting in more than 400000 deaths 5  unfortunately there is no approved antiviral treatment or preventive vaccine for coronaviruses in humans since supportive care is the only recommended interim treatment it is imperative to identify repurposable lead compounds to treat covid-19 until a sars-cov-2-specific drug and a vaccine is developed although the coronavirus genome consists of numerous conserved druggable enzymes including papain-like protease plpro 3c-like protease 3clpro non-structural proteins rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp and helicase development of clinically approved antiviral therapies has proven to be a difficult task 6  the surface structural spike glycoprotein s a key immunogenic cov antigen essential for virus and host cell-receptor interactions is an important target for therapeutic development the spike protein consists of an n-terminal s1 subunit receptor binding and a c-terminal s2 subunit membrane fusion the s1 subunit contains the receptor-binding domain rbd which attaches to the host membrane thus playing an important role in viral entry sars-cov-2 utilizes the ace2 receptor for entry and the transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 for spike protein priming 7  crystallographic studies have shown that sars-cov-2 binds to the ace2 receptor with a binding mode nearly identical to that of sars-cov 8 9 10 11  the binding affinity of the ace2 receptor to the rbd of the sars-cov-2 spike protein is reported to be significantly higher as compared to sars-cov 10 11  based on the importance of virus membrane fusion events in the viral life cycle and its infectivity the spike protein of sars-cov-2 was targeted for drug screening this study utilizes a virtual compound screening methodology to identify potential small molecule inhibitors specific to the rbd of the spike protein of sars-cov-2 the primary objective here was to screen existing fda-approved drugs in silico followed by experimental validation to identify repurposable drugs targeting further clinical validation a model for sars-cov-2 spike protein was constructed using the crystal structure 6vsbchain a to correct missing residues the amino acid sequence identity between the target sequence genbank qhd434161 and template 6vsbchain a was 9958 the sars-cov-2 model showed an rmsd of 04683  relative to the crystal structure 6vsbchain a structure assessment of the predicted model using the ramachandran plot showed 9004 residues in the most favored regions with 203 outliers none of the outliers contained the residues present at the active site of the protein the predicted model was further used for in-silico studies initial docking simulations resulted in seven compounds with three compounds antiviral825 antiviral2083 and antiviral 2981 with docking scores of -630 -620 and -600 kcalmol from the enamine antiviral library and four compounds ponatinib imatinib ergotamine and glecaprevir with docking scores of -847 -750 -800 and -710 kcalmol from the zinc15 fda library respectively the above libraries were chosen to help identify a repurposable drug that can potentially inhibit the sars-cov-2 the screened compounds had the highest affinities within their respective sets and had one or more binding conformations at the ace2 binding domain of the spike protein the binding poses for the seven screened compounds at the rbd are shown in fig 1a  and structures and descriptions of the screened drugs are given in table s3 under supplementary data further verification of binding affinity for these compounds was done via molecular dynamics md simulations the stability of the md simulations was evaluated using rmsd and rmsf diagrams the rmsd diagram of protein rbd-ligands simulations provided under fig s3  showed that the simulations for all compounds remained stable after 8ns also the rmsds for all the seven simulations were around 4-6  fig s3  the rmsf diagram showed that the structural fluctuations in the protein at the ligand binding site was stable fig s4  free energy calculations with the mm-gbsa method fig 1b indicated that the compounds in the fda-approved drug library had significantly lower binding free energies ie higher affinities than the drugs in the enamine library which is in agreement with the docking scores ponatinib an abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat leukemia 12  displayed the most negative binding free energy -43199  3467 kcalmol while imatinib glecaprevir and ergotamine also show binding free energies within a close range to ponatinib the high affinity of the screened compounds is visible when compared with the negative control dimethyl sulfoxide dmso which is ineffective against coronaviruses 13  interactions and the binding free energies of all the seven compounds with the spike protein are provided in fig s2 and table s2 under supplementary data among the screened drugs abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib was selected for in vitro studies since it has also shown to inhibit sars-cov and mers-cov by blocking endosomal fusion at the cell-culture level 6 13 14 15  as shown in fig 1a inset and md simulation video supplied under supplementary information imatinib is predicted to bind strongly to the rbd of spike protein forming hydrogen bonds and pi-pi stacking interactions with tyr 449 and pi-pi stacking interactions with tyr 489 both of which are critical for interaction with ace2 11 16  it has been suggested that tyrosine-kinase inhibitors do not affect the cleavage of the spike protein but inhibits spike-mediated endosomal fusion 6 13 14  the high affinity of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors towards the spike protein is deduced from the initial docking results where both imatinib and ponatinib have shown highly negative binding free energies based on promising in silico data and initial viral plaque assay results fig s1  imatinib was chosen to be advanced for further experimental validation first we evaluated the toxicity of imatinib when incubating the compound on vero cells for one hour or eight hours in the experiments where the compound remained on the cells for eight hours toxicity was measured at concentrations of 25 m 125 m 63 m and 32 m however in the 1-hour design no toxicity was observed next we evaluated the ability of imatinib to inhibit replication and entry at concentrations as low as 02 m the compound was effective in suppressing 50 of plaque formation in the 8-hr design and the ic50 value determined using linear regression was 130 nm consistent with the toxicity data toxicity was observed between 25 and 32 m the compound also showed efficacy in the 1-hour design with higher ic50 values these data indicate that imatinib inhibits virus replication in vitro as shown in fig 2a and 2b to evaluate if imatinib inhibits viral entry we performed two fusion assays endosomal vero and plasma membrane vero-tmprss2 as shown in fig 2c and 2d respectively based on cytotoxicity at concentrations below 15 nm no toxicity was observed microscopically red arrow in the graph vsv-g control revealed 100 infectivity cytopathic effect at every concentration below this suggesting the inhibitor did not affect vsv-g entry vsv-g particles cells do not carry spike proteins and thus no significant entry inhibition occurred suggesting that entry inhibition is likely mediated through the spike protein however the effect on vero-tmprss2 cells was less clear for any of the coronaviruses used when compared to the vsv-g control a similar level of toxicity was observed in these cells it is worth noting that toxicity is probably the result of incubating cells with imatinib for 16 hours in the assay taken together there is evidence that imatinib binds to the spike and prevents viral entry possibly by preventing endosomal entry the binding kinetics of imatinib to the rbd of sars-cov-2 spike protein was evaluated using biolayer interferometry bli the analysis showed that imatinib binds to the sars-cov-2 rbd protein with an on-rate kon as 322  045  10 3 m -1 s -1 and dissociates with an off-rate koff as 707  187  10 -3 s -1  this resulted in an equilibrium affinity constant kd 232  09 m which is calculated as a ratio of the koff and kon rates the affinity values indicate that 50 of the rbds on the surface spike glycoproteins will be occupied at micromolar concentrations of imatinib the affinity of imatinib for the sars-cov-2 spike rbd protein is still higher than the previously published values of nanomolar range ligand id bdbm13530 17 for imatinib on abl tyrosine kinase 18 and in range with the micromolar affinities of imatinib to the src-family kinases frk and fyn 19 indicating that our calculated binding affinity results are realistic as shown in fig 2e  there is an urgent need for finding a treatment against the current pandemic of the sars-cov-2 health experts across the globe are trying to use existing clinically approved drugs to treat patients until a specific drug is developed the present study using a combination of computational techniques followed by in vitro studies identified imatinib an fda approved anti-cancer drug as a potential treatment of sars-cov-2 infection the data indicate inhibition of sars-cov-2 replication at ic50 of 130 nm also docking experiments show that imatinib forms strong interactions with the rbd of sars-cov-2 and has shown in-vitro inhibition our results suggest that imatinib prevents viral replication and that in analogy with other studies using coronaviruses the most likely mode of action of imatinib is via inhibition of the spike protein nevertheless we cannot completely exclude that inhibition of tyrosine kinase also resulted in significant inhibition of virus replication 13 14  therefore it is likely that imatinib causes both inhibition of cellular kinase and virus fusion resulting in inhibition of virus replication the results provide further evidence supporting the recent clinical trials clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04346147 nct04357613 nct04356495 nct04394416 and nct04422678 in covid-19 patients with imatinib a swiss-model server 20 was used to construct a homology model of the sars-cov-2 spike protein using the crystal structure of the sars-cov-2 spike protein pdb6vsbchain a as the template 10  the genome sequence wuhan-hu-1 genbank mn9089473 was used as a representative of the sars-cov-2 spike protein sequence genbank qhd434161 was used as the target sequence 21  the swiss-model structure assessment tool was used to validate the quality of the predicted model around

command the docking file of the protein model was prepared with mgltools v154 24 and the molecules were docked at the rbd of the spike protein via autodock vina 112 25  the grid box of 406030 size

processing of docking and data collection was performed using an in-house script data were analyzed statistically using r studio 26 and graphs were constructed with ggplot in r 27 the ligand-receptor interactions were studied using schrdinger maestro 28 and molecules with high docking scores were selected from each screening library for further studies most stable conformations of the selected molecules from docking simulations were further analyzed through md simulations which were performed using schrdinger-desmond 29  the protein-ligand complexes were prepared by schrdingers protein preparation wizard 30  structures were refined by capping the c and n termini of the protein adding missing hydrogens optimizing hydrogen bonds and were finally minimized using the opls3e force field 31  a molecular dynamics system was built for each of the processed ligand-receptor complexes the system was solvated in an orthorhombic box using the spc solvent model with a buffer distance of 10  the system charge was neutralized with na  or clions using a 01m concentration of nacl all simulations were performed using desmonds default relax protocol with the opls3e force field heavy atoms in the system were initially minimized with restraints under 10 k then further restrained by increasing the temperature to 300 k and lastly relaxed under 300 k npt ensemble to get the equilibrium status for the system after relaxation the simulation systems were performed under a 300 k npt ensemble at 101325 bar pressure for 1000ns trajectories and related energy terms were recorded at an interval of 20 ps post simulation analysis including complex root mean square deviation rmsd and ligandprotein root mean square fluctuation rmsf were performed via schrdinger simulation interaction diagrams the molecular mechanism-general born surface area mm-gbsa binding energies 32 were calculated based on the last 5 ns of the simulation trajectories twenty-six frames one every 10 frames were selected from 250 frames for mm-gbsa calculation for each molecule prime mm-gbsa used the vsgb 21 solvation model 33 with the opls3e force field the free binding energy g was calculated with the equation below

rumi hasan  hossain zonaed siddiki adnan mannan  hasan mahbub  the newly identified sars-cov-2 has now been reported from around 183 countries with more than a million confirmed human cases including more than 68000 deaths the genomes of sars-cov-2 strains isolated from different parts of the world are now available and the unique features of constituent genes and proteins have gotten substantial attention recently spike glycoprotein is widely considered as a possible target to be explored because of its role during the entry of coronaviruses into host cells we analyzed 320 whole-genome sequences and 320 spike protein sequences of sars-cov-2 using multiple sequence alignment tools in this study 483 unique variations have been identified among the genomes including 25 nonsynonymous mutations and one deletion in the spike protein of sars-cov-2 among the 26 variations detected 12 variations were located at the n-terminal domain and 6 variations at the receptor-binding domain rbd which might alter the interaction with receptor molecules in addition 22 amino acid insertions were identified in the spike protein of sars-cov-2 in comparison with that of sars-cov phylogenetic

2019 the death toll rose to more than 68000 among 1250000 confirmed cases around the globe until april 4 2020 1  the virus causing covid-19 is named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 based on the phylogenetic studies the sars-cov-2 is categorized as a member of the genus betacoronavirus the same lineage that includes sars coronavirus sars-cov 2 that caused sars severe acute respiratory syndrome in china during 2002 3  recent studies showed that sars-cov-2 has a close relationship with bat sars-like covs 4 5 7  interestingly s glycoprotein is characterized as the critical determinant for viral entry into host cells which consists of two functional subunits namely s1 and s2 the s1 subunit recognizes and binds to the host receptor through the receptor-binding domain rbd whereas s2 is responsible for fusion with the host cell membrane  8  9  10  mers-cov uses dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp4 as entry receptor 11 whereas sars-cov and sars-cov-2 utilize ace-2 angiotensin converting enzyme-2 12  abundantly available in lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes suggesting s glycoprotein as a potential drug target to halt the entry of sars-cov-2 13  according to recent reports neutralizing antibodies are generated in response to the entry and fusion of surface-exposed s protein mainly rbd domain which is predicted to be an 4 important target for

multiple domains possibly plays a major role in sars-cov-2 pathogenesis viral entry to the host cell is initiated by the receptor-binding domain rbd of s1 head upon receptor-binding proteolytic

available genomes are key to understanding the biology of sars-cov-2 infection developing antiviral treatments and vaccines in this study we have analyzed 320 genomic sequences of sars-cov-2 to identify mutations between the available genomes followed by the amino acid variations in the glycoprotein s to foresee their impact on the viral entry to host cell from structural biology viewpoint

likewise a number of studies targeting sars-cov-2 spike protein have been undertaken for the therapeutic measures 41  but the unique structural and functional details of sars-cov-2 spike protein are still under scrutiny we also found a variant r408i at receptor binding domain rbd that mutated from positively charged arginine residue to neutral and smaller sized isoleucine residue fig 4 i  this change might alter the interaction of viral rbd with the host receptor because the r408 residue of sars-cov-2 is known to interact with the ace2 receptor for viral entry 42  similarly alterations of rbd g476s v483a h519q and a520s also could affect the interaction of sars-cov-2 spike protein with other molecules which require further investigations qia98583 and qis30615 variants were found to have an alteration of alanine to valine a930v and aspartic acid to tyrosine d936y respectively in the alpha helix of the hr1 domain previous reports have indicated that hr1 domain plays a significant role in viral fusion and entry by forming helical bundles with hr2 and mutations including alanine substitution by valine a1168v in hr1 region are predominantly responsible for conferring resistance to mouse hepatitis coronaviruses against hr2 derived peptide entry inhibitors 43  this study hypothesizes the mutation a930v found in that of sars-cov-2 might also have a role in the emergence of drug-resistance virus strains also the mutation d1168h found in the heptad repeat 2 hr sars-cov-2 could play a vital role in viral pathogenesis the sars-cov-2 s protein contains additional furin protease cleavage site prrars in s1s2 domain which is conserved among all 320 sequences as revealed during this study  supplementary fig 3  this unique signature is thought to make the sars-cov-2 more virulent than sars-cov and regarded as novel features of the viral pathogenesis ref 11 according to previous reports the more the host cell protease can process the coronavirus s can accelerate viral tropism accordingly in influenza virus 9  44  45  46  apart from that this could also promote viruses to escape antiviral therapies targeting transmembrane protease tmprss2 clinicaltrialsgov

nicole andr m joshua chappie s jean millet k gary whittaker r   coronaviruses are zoonotic pathogens that are well known to evolve environmentally and infect many mammalian and avian species 1 these diverse viruses often have effective transmission and immune evasion strategies especially when outbreaks occur within dense human populations in the past two decades coronavirus outbreaks have arisen in human populations around the world each with unique features but also sharing several similarities severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov emerged in 2002 in guangdong province china causing an outbreak that spread to 26 countries with more than 8000 infections and 774 deaths and a case fatality rate of 95 2 more recently the ongoing middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov outbreak that originated in 2012 in saudi arabia has spread to 27 countries with 2494 infections and 858 deaths with a case fatality rate of 344 3 the recent surfacing of the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 first identified on december 12th 2019 was initially detected in wuhan hubei province china and has now spread globally via travelers and breached the boundaries of 182 countriesregions 45 on march 11th 2020 the world health organization officially declared a global pandemic the rapidly evolving situation has prompted most affected countries to impose tight restrictions on border movements and unprecedented statewide lockdown measures at the time of writing april 06th 2020 over 12 million cases and approximately 70000 fatalities have been reported globally 5 similar to sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 infections in the early stages of the outbreak were observed in family clusters and hospital personnel 46 7 8 the outbreak occurring during the winter is another commonality between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 9 currently sustained community-based spread is occurring which would make sars-cov-2 a community-acquired respiratory coronavirus along with the other less pathogenic human community-acquired respiratory coronaviruses 229e oc43 hku-1 and nl63 10 clinical signs associated with sars-cov-2 include pneumonia fever dry cough headache and dyspnea which may progress to respiratory failure and death 7911 the incubation period for sars-cov-2 seems to be longer than for sars-cov and mers-cov which have a mean incubation time of 5 to 7 days leading to challenges in contact tracing 12 preexisting conditions and comorbidities such as hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disease or kidney disease affect the severity of pathogenesis attributed to sars-cov and mers-cov and thus far similar patterns seem to exist with sars-cov-2 711 sars-cov and mers-cov seem to exhibit deleterious morbidity and mortality on the elderly population  60 years of age with most deaths occurring in this age group and sars-cov-2 is currently portraying a comparable trend 7 the coronaviruses belong to the coronaviridae family and the orthocoronaviridae subfamily which is divided in four genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 are all betacoronaviruses a genus that includes many viruses that infect humans bats and other domesticated and wild animals 13 betacoronaviruses have many similarities within the orf1ab polyprotein and most structural proteins however the spike protein and accessory proteins portray significant diversity 14 mers-cov has maintained a stable genome since its emergence in 2012 unlike other coronaviruses that readily evolve and can undergo notable recombination events 15 alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses including sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 and other human coronaviruses like hcov-nl63 are thought to have originated in bats 14 15 16 gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses are reported to have an avian origin but are known to infect both mammals and avian species 17 human infections of bat-origin viruses typically occur through intermediate hosts for sars-cov these hosts are palm civets paguma larvata and racoon dogs nyctereutes procyonoides for mers-cov the known host is the dromedary camel camelus dromedarius 1418 sars-cov antibodies were first detected in palm civets and the animal handlers in wet markets 14 mers-cov is thought to have been circulating for at least 30 years within the dromedary camel population based on retrospective antibody testing of serum from 1983 14 the source of the sars-cov-2 outbreak has been linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market in wuhan where it was initially confirmed that the majority of cases with onset prior to january 1st 2020 were linked to the market 19 the market sells many species including seafood birds snakes marmots and bats 7 the market was closed on january 1st 2020 and sampling and decontamination have occurred in order to find the source of the infection origination of sars-cov-2 from bats has been strongly supported but the presumed intermediate host remains to be identified recent reports have suggested the malayan pangolins manis javanica as a possible intermediate host for sars-cov-2 with putative recombination signals found between pangolin bat and human coronavirus sequences 7920 21 22 however the direct precursor sequence to the currently circulating human sars-cov-2 and putative intermediate host remain to be identified the coronavirus spike protein s is the primary determinant of viral tropism and is responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion it is a large approx 180 kda glycoprotein that is present on the viral surface as a prominent trimer and it is composed of two domains s1 and s2 23 the s1 domain mediates receptor binding and is divided into two sub-domains with the n-terminal subdomain ntd often binding sialic acid and the c-terminal subdomain also known as c-domain binding a specific proteinaceous receptor 24 the receptor for sars-cov has been identified as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 similar to what has been recently identified with sars-cov-2 91425 hela cells transfected to express or not the ace2 receptor from either human chinese horseshoe bat mouse civet and pig were infected with sars-cov-2 and it was reported that the virus was able to use all receptors except mouse ace2 9 sars-cov-2 was not found to use dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 the receptor for mers-cov 91425 following receptor binding the s2 domain mediates viralmembrane fusion through the exposure of a highly conserved fusion peptide 2627 the fusion peptide is activated through proteolytic cleavage at a site found immediately upstream s2 which is common to all coronaviruses in many but not all coronaviruses additional proteolytic priming occurs at a second site located at the interface of the s1 and s2 domains s1s2 28 the use of proteases in priming and activation combined with receptor binding and ionic interactions eg h and ca2 together control viral stability and transmission and modulate the conformational changes in the s protein that dictate the viral entry process into host cells 232629 specifically sars-cov and mers-cov both infect type ii pneumocytes in vivo however they individually infect ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and non-ciliated bronchial epithelial cells respectively 14 sars-cov-2 can infect ex vivo with the same range of cell culture lines as sars-cov and mers-cov eg vero e6 huh-7 cells though primary human airway epithelial cells have been reported to be its preferential cell type 152530 overall how cell tropism of sars-cov-2 reflects a balance of receptor binding endosomal environment and protease activation and the specifics of these mechanisms remain to be determined the rapid dissemination and sharing of information during the sars-cov-2 pandemic has surpassed that of both mers-cov and sars-cov where the latter virus was only identified after several months and with a genome available a month later 7 the sars-cov-2 was identified and a genome sequence was available within a month from the initial surfacing of the agent in patients 7 initial reports identified that sars-cov-2 contains six major open-reading frames in the viral genome and various accessory proteins 9 the sars-like sl virus batcov-ratg13 also named bat-sl-ratg13 was observed to have a remarkably high degree of genomic sequence identity with that of sars-cov-2 at over 96 overall sequence identity and with two other bat sars-like viruses bat-sl-cov-zc45 and bat-sl-cov-zxc21 both having around 88 sequence identity compared with sars-cov-2 on a genome-wide level 9 when sars-cov-2 is compared to the clinically relevant human coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov pairwise percent identities fall to around 796 and 50 on a genomic level respectively 49 the s protein of sars-cov-2 was found to be approximately 75 homologous to the sars-cov spike 79 in this study we perform phylogenetic bioinformatic and homology structural modeling analyses of sars-cov-2 s in comparison with closely related viruses we identify a distinct four residue insert featuring two arginine residues that maps to the s1s2 priming loop of sars-cov-2 which is missing from all other sars-cov-related viruses but present in mers-cov s and in many other coronaviruses we discuss the importance of this extended basic loop for s protein-mediated membrane fusion and its implications for virus transmission to obtain an initial assessment of shared andor specific features of the sars-cov-2 spike s envelope glycoprotein a protein sequence alignment was performed to compare the sequence of the wuhan-hu-1 strain of the novel coronavirus with that of the closely related human sars-cov s strain tor2 sequence supplementary figure 1 the overall percent protein sequence identity found by the alignment was 76 figure 1a a breakdown of the functional domains of the s protein based on the sars-cov s sequence reveals that the s1 receptor-binding domain was less conserved 64 identity than the s2 fusion domain 90 identity within s1 the ntd was found to be less conserved 51 identity compared to the receptor binding domain rbd 74 identity which is part of the c-terminal subdomain figure 1a the relatively high degree of sequence identity for the rbd is consistent with the view that sars-cov-2 like sars-cov may use ace2 as its host cell receptor 92531 interestingly when the more defined receptor binding motif rbm was analyzed ie the region of sars-cov s containing residues that were shown to directly contact the ace2 receptor the identity between the two sequences drops to 50 figure 1a in this case hinting at possible differences in binding residues involved in the interaction with the receptor andor binding affinities 31 32 33 as expected within the well-conserved s2 domain subdomain identities were high for the fusion peptide region fp 93 identity high for the heptad-repeat 1 region hr1 88 identity identical for hr2 100 identity and high for both the transmembrane and the c-terminal endodomain tm 93 identity e 97 identity figure 1a early phylogenetic studies on sars-cov-2 genomic sequences revealed that it clustered closely with sequences originating from sars-like sequences from bats within lineage b of the betacoronavirus genus lineage a groups prototypical coronaviruses such as murine hepatitis virus mhv and human coronaviruses hcov-hku1 and hcov-oc43 the other highly pathogenic coronavirus mers-cov is found within lineage c along with related camel-derived mers-cov lineage c also groups viruses from bats and other mammals such as hedgehogs lineage d contains viral species infecting bats to gain a better understanding of both shared and specific features of sars-cov-2 s protein a phylogenetic analysis centered on s protein sequences of representatives of the four betacoronavirus lineages was carried out figure 1b fifteen sequences of sars-cov-2 s sequences obtained from ncbi and gisaid from china and various export locations worldwide were analyzed along with representative members of lineages ad betacoronaviruses the analysis confirmed that all sars-cov-2 s sequences clustered very closely with bat sars-like sequences with the closest matching sequence corresponding to a bat coronavirus bat-cov strain named bat-sl-ratg13 other closely related sequences found were from bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 the sub-clade that groups sars-cov-2 bat-sl-ratg13 bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 is distinct from the one grouping human and civet sars-cov along with other related bat sars-like viruses such as bat-sl-lyra3 while bat coronaviruses are the established reservoir for sars-cov-2 the presumed intermediate host remains to be determined based on the high degree of sequence identity in the rbd of sequences found in malayan pangolins m javanica it was proposed that these mammals could be intermediate hosts 20 21 22 subsequent whole-genome analysis revealed 85592 identity to sars-cov-2 which is less than what is observed for bat-sl-ratg13 963 34 to explore the relationship of pangolin covs to sars-cov-2 we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the spike gene of pangolin covs isolated from animals smuggled into china in 2017 guangxi province gx and 2019 guangdong province gd compared to sars-cov-2 batcov-ratg13 and other betacoronaviruses figure 2
 pairwise comparison between sars-cov-2 s protein and that of batcov-ratg13 and representative sequences from guangxi pangolin 2017 abbreviated gx here and guangdong pangolin 2019 abbreviated gd confirm that overall batcov-ratg13 had the highest identity 97 overall 96 and 100 for s1 and s2 respectively figure 2a the analysis reveals that pangolin s protein sequences are more divergent overall 92 identity for gx and 89 identity for gd with most of the divergence concentrating in the s1 domain notably while the ntd domain of both gx and gd pangolin sequences fell to 88 and 67 identity respectively the rbd domain of the gd domain was confirmed to be remarkably well conserved compared to sars-cov-2 97 identity compared to 87 identity for gx pangolin and 89 for batcov-ratg13 these observations are in line with previously reported putative recombination events occurring between pangolin bat and human betacoronavirus sequences 22 phylogenetically pangolin spike sequences from 2017 gx form a subclade that groups with ratg13 figure 2b interestingly the 2019 pangolin gd sequence appears to branch off early ie it could represent an s protein sequence that diverged earlier and forms its own subclade distinct from the ratg132017pangolin and sars-cov-2environmental subclades an s protein sequence alignment focusing on the rbd region of sars-cov-2 sars-cov and bat-sars-related viruses reveals that the n-terminal half of the rbd is relatively well conserved whereas the c-terminal half which contains the rbm exhibits more variation figure 3a notably bat-sl-cov-zc45 and bat-sl-cov-zxc21 both have two deletions of 5 and 14 residues within the rbd the composition of residues found at the two known coronavirus s cleavage sites was performed using alignment data figure 3b and c the region around arginine 667 r667 of sars-cov s the s1s2 cleavage site aligned well with sars-cov-2 and the bat sars-related sequences 56 notably an arginine at the position corresponding to sars-cov r667 is conserved for the other five sequences analyzed the alignment shows that sars-cov-2 contains a four amino acid insertion 681prra684 that is not found in any other sequences analyzed including the closely related bat-sl-ratg13 figure 3b together with the conserved r685 amino acid found in sars-cov-2 at the putative s1s2 cleavage site the insertion introduces a stretch of three basic arginine residues that could potentially be recognized by members of the pro-protein convertase family of proteases 3536 this insertion was conserved for all 15 sars-cov-2 sequences analyzed supplementary figure 2 within the betacoronavirus genus the presence of a basic stretch of residues at the s1s2 site is found for a number of species from lineages a hcov-hku1 mhv hcov-oc43 and c mers-cov batcov-hku5 the four-amino-acid insertion feature appears unique among lineage b viruses as all other species analyzed in the extended alignment none contained the stretch of basic residues identified in sars-cov-2 s supplementary figure 2 as expected from previous analyses the s2 cleavage site located immediately upstream of the fusion peptide and corresponding to the residue position r797 in the case of sars-cov was strictly conserved for sars-cov-2 and closely related bat sars-related sequences figure 3c of note the leucine l residue found at position 792 of the sars-cov sequence is substituted to serine s residue for sars-cov-2 s as well as the bat sars-related sequences the fusion peptide sequence was found to be well conserved for all sequences analyzed notably protein alignment analyses show that pangolin sequences as for other viruses in betacoronaviruses lineage b do not show the presence of the predicted proteolytically sensitive s1s2 fusion activation site present in sars-cov-2 figure 4
 only environmental samples taken from the huanan seafood market appear to also harbor the s1s2 insert interestingly the 2019 pangolin sequence shares the same motif immediately upstream of the s1s2 insert found in sars-cov-2 s 675qtqtns680 sars-cov-2 numbering this is also shared with batcov-ratg13 but not with the other pangolin sequences from 2017 which harbor a distinct motif 673hsmsslf678 betacovpangolinguangxip4l2017  epiisl410538 numbering to gain a deeper understanding of common and possibly distinguishing structural features found in sars-cov-2 s protein homology modeling was undertaken the analysis of modeled proteins provides a powerful tool to identify predicted structural characteristics which can translate into structurefunction changes in the studied protein our laboratory has previously taken advantage of these tools for structurefunction studies of other covs s proteins 233738 to perform the modeling it is first necessary to identify a suitable protein structure to be used as template which will determine the accuracy of the predicted model the s protein structure of several covs including the following have been reported previously alphacoronavirus hcov-nl63 and feline coronavirus uu4 fcov-uu4 betacoronavirus hcov-hku1 mhv sars-cov and mers-cov gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus ibv and deltacoronavirus porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 considering that genome and s protein alignments have showed that the sars-cov-2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genus we focused our analysis on the s structures from viruses belonging to this genus to select the template structure the s protein amino acid sequences from four representative betacoronaviruses hcov-hku1 mhv sars-cov and mers-cov were aligned and the solved s protein structures were compared to determine their amino acid identity and the overall structural organization similarities among these proteins supplementary figure 3a we observed an average of  30 identity among the four viral s proteins at the amino acid level with the exception of hcov-hku1 and mhv which share an amino acid identity of 59 at the s protein supplementary figure 3a despite the differences at the amino acid level the overall structure of the four betacoronavirus s proteins showed a similar folding pattern supplementary figure 3b and major differences can only be spotted at specific sections of the functional domains where flexible loops are abundant eg rbd and cleavage sites considering this we used modeller v 923 university of california to build a first set of models for the sars-cov-2 s protein based on each of the above-mentioned structures supplementary figure 4 interestingly we found no major differences at the secondary structures among the sars-cov-2 s protein-predicted models depending on the s structure that was used as template for the modeling construction however extended flexible loops at the rbd andor clashes between s monomers at the s2 domain level were observed in the sars-cov-2 s models based on hcov-hku1 mhv and mers-cov supplementary figure 4 first three panels in contrast the predicted sars-cov-2 s model based on the sars-cov s structure displayed a much better organized folding and no major clashes were observed between the s monomers supplementary figure 4 last panel as we described previously the identity between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov at the s protein amino acid level was 76 and phylogenetic analyses grouped sars-cov-2 in the lineage b of the betacoronavirus genus closely related to sars-cov as well as to other covs originating in bats figure 1b these two considerations in addition to our preliminary modeling results suggested sars-cov s as the most suitable template for modeling the sars-cov-2 s protein taking an alternative approach the s protein sequence of sars-cov-2 was submitted to two structure homology modeling servers phyre 2 and raptorx 4647 for both cases the structural models with highest homology scores were based on the sars-cov s template structure pdb id 5x58 data not shown confirming the choice of using sars-cov s as template for generating structural models of sars-cov-2 to better compare the predicted structural characteristics of the sars-cov-2 we also performed homology modeling of four s proteins from bat-covs belonging to lineage b in our phylogenetic analysis which are closely related to sars-cov-2 the modeled s proteins from the bat-covs ratg13 covzc45 covzxc21 and lyra3 were compared to the predicted structure of sars-cov-2 s and to the template structure of sars-cov figure 5
 the amino acid homology of the modeled s proteins in comparison to the template sars-cov s was  71 for all the bat-cov s with the exception of the lyra3 s which shares a homology of 847 with the template s overall all the modeled s proteins shared a similar folding pattern in comparison to sars-cov s and both s1 and s2 domains showed a uniform organization figure 5 as expected differences were mostly observed at the flexible loops forming the head of the s1 domain especially at the ntd region rbd region where most of the amino acid variation was observed figures 3a and 5 the s protein amino acid identity among the bat-cov including sars-cov-2 ranged between 753 and 967 with lyra3 and ratg13 s proteins having the lowest and highest identity to sars-cov-2 respectively despite amino acid variability no major changes in the secondary structures and the overall folding of the proteins were observed among the modeled s structures of these viruses suggesting a conserved organization for all the s proteins of the lineage b including sars-cov-2 nevertheless differences at the flexible loops in both domains were observed and their impact in the sars-cov-2 s protein function must be further studied it was recently reported that the sars-cov-2 binds ace2 as a receptor to infect target cells 9253348 this finding appears to agree with previous reports describing the ability of bat-covs to successfully bind and use ace2 as a cellular receptor for infection 49 50 51 this conservation in the receptor usage among sars-cov and sars-like bat-covs contrasts with the high variability that are observed at the amino acid sequence of the rbm figure 3a considering this high variability we compared the predicted rbm structure of the sars-cov-2 and bat-covs to the one of sars-cov interestingly despite the variability the modeled sars-cov-2-predicted rbm displayed a similar organization to sars-cov figure 6
 top panel this was also observed in the ratg3 and lyra3-predicted rbm structures figure 6 middle left and bottom right panels suggesting that the rbm organization is well conserved among these viruses in contrast the predicted rbm of the covzc45 and covzxc21 viruses showed a different folding at this region in comparison to sars-cov figure 6 middle right and bottom left panels these two last viruses showed a 5- and a 14-amino-acid deletion respectively in the rbm sequence figure 3a which can explain the differential folding in the modeled proteins the alignment in figure 3b shows a four-amino-acid insertion 681prra684 as well as a conserved arginine corresponding to r685 at the s1s2 site of the sars-cov-2 this insertion which appears to be unique among lineage b betacoronaviruses suggests a differential mechanism of activation for the sars-cov-2 compared to other sars-cov and sars-like batcov at the structural level the s1s2 site has been shown to be difficult to solve for most covs structures resulting in either incomplete structures missing the complete s1s2 site or structures with an altered ie mutated s1s2 site 424445 solving the structure of the s1s2 site was also found to be an issue in the sars-cov s structure we used for our modeling analyses we have previously shown that the s1s2 site can be modeled in other cov s proteins and it appears to be organized as a flexible exposed loop that extends from the s structure and suggest it could be easily accessible for proteolytic activation 37 to better study the s1s2 site structural organization we modeled the sars-cov s protein based on the s structure of mhv s1s2 site mutated in the structure and mers-cov and sars-cov s1s2 site missing in the structure to see if the predicted structure of the s1s2 site was similar despite the template structure we observed no differences in the modeled sars-cov s protein at the s1s2 site predicting an exposed flexible loop in all the three models data not shown based on this we proceeded to compare the s1s2 site as well as other major functional elements of the s2 domain ie s2 site and fusion peptide in the predicted structure in our sars-cov sars-cov-2 and bat-cov s models figure 7
 remarkably two features appear to exhibit distinctive characteristics in the sars-cov-2 s model the fusion peptide which is predicted to be organized in a more compact conformation for sars-cov-2 s than in sars-cov s figure 7 surface models and the region corresponding to the s1s2 cleavage site which contains r667 in the case of sars-cov figure 7 s1s2 alignment box and ribbon models for sars-cov and the bat-cov proteins the s1s2 site forms a short loop that appears flanking closely to the side of the trimeric structure in the case of sars-cov-2 s the s1s2 site is predicted to form an extended loop that protrudes to the exterior of the trimer figure 7 this feature suggests that the s1s2 loop in sars-cov-2 s could be more exposed for proteolytic processing by host cell proteases as mentioned before solving the structure of the s1s2 site appears to present difficulties for most of the reported cov s structures figure 8
 top panel however the exposed loop feature has been demonstrated in both modeled and cryo-em cov s structures with similar amino acid sequences at the s1s2 site ie fcov and ibv respectively figure 8 top panel interestingly fcov viruses do not always display a s1s2 site figure 8 top panel which results in distinct cell entry mechanisms we also performed an analysis of the s2 site of the sars-cov-2 in comparison to sars-cov and bat-cov s proteins as expected differences in the modeled s2 site structure were not predicted in any of the studied spikes figure 7 s2 ribbon models this agrees with the fact that the s2 site appears to be conserved in the studied sequences figure 7 s2 alignment box and as we described previously the sars-cov functional r797 residue at the cleavage position 1 p1 as well as the serine at position 798 cleavage position p1 are conserved in the sars-cov-2 and among the compared bat-covs this feature also appears to be conserved in other covs figure 8 bottom panel however mutations in the residues immediately upstream of the sars-cov r797 residue or equivalent in each virus have been shown to result in changes in the proteolytical requirements in other covs 28 we observed mutations l to s and t to s which are located upstream of the p1 arginine at positions p3 and p6 in the s2 site of the sars-cov-2 in comparison to sars-cov these mutations are not predicted to alter the structure of the s2 in the sars-cov-2 figure 7 s2 ribbon models the current covid-19 pandemic caused by sars-cov-2 is evidence of the potential of coronaviruses to continuously evolve in wild reservoirs and jump to new species our study aims to contribute to our understanding of the sars-cov-2 from a phylogenetic and structural point of view focusing on the functional and the proteolytically sensitive sites of the s protein using phylogenetic analysis we showed that the sars-cov-2 s protein is closely related to other sars-like viruses originating in bats figure 1b which agrees with early similar reports 34 the identity of the s protein of batcov-ratg13 strain of bat coronavirus was shown to be 9665 suggesting this virus as the closest relative to sars-cov-2 while the origin of the novel coronavirus appears to be in bat reservoirs there is still no definitive evidence of the possible intermediate host that could transmit the virus to humans recent reports have suggested the malayan pangolins as an intermediate host for the sars-cov-2 in our analysis we found that the pangolin spike sequences grouped in a subclade branching from ratg13 we additionally observed that the 2019 guangdong pangolin sequence appeared to branch off early in a distinct subclade from ratg13 based on these findings we hypothesize that despite of having a common origin in bats the phylogenetic relationship between pangolin covs and sars-cov-2 is not sufficient to support the claim that pangolins harbor the direct precursor to the currently circulating human sars-cov-2 in fact our analysis suggests that both humans and pangolins could be considered final hosts of their respective coronavirus in this study we show the presence of a distinct insert that maps to the s1s2 priming loop of the sars-cov-2 spike protein and is not shared with sars-cov or any sars-related viruses in betacoronavirus lineage b during the preparation of this manuscript the cryo-electron microscopy structures of sars-cov-2 s have recently been determined 335253 these studies have revealed in detail the structure of the sars-cov-2 spike rbd and how it contacts the ace2 host cell receptor with notable differences compared to sars-cov 54 it has been described that the sars-cov rbm down conformation packs more closely to the ntd of the s protein 33 in the same report the sars-cov-2 rbd was shown to be angled to the center of the trimmer in its down conformation which differs to the sars-cov rbm structure interestingly we observed in our models that the rbd is predicted to pack similarly to sars-cov and the rbm is also predicted to organize as a flexible loop with similar structure despite the lower amino acid identity between these two proteins figure 6 in a more recent report it has been shown that ace2-binding mode of both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 rbds is nearly identical which supports the claim that the flexibility in the rbm is key to compensate the amino acid differences between the two covs proteins and agrees with our predicted models 54 one of the common difficulties of the covs s protein cryo-em studies is the difficulty to solve proteolytically sensitive regions in the protein 3955 since the s1s2 region is proteolytically sensitive it is common to introduce mutations in this site to prevent proteolytic priming and to allow efficient heterologous expression and purification 42 this has resulted in a difficulty to solve the s1s2 region in most of the available cov s protein structures with a few exceptions for the s proteins of viruses belonging to the alphacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus genera 4044 considering that this region is proteolytically sensitive and has been shown to play a major role in the s protein function in other covs the use of in silico modeling tools has become a useful alternative to study this region in the context of the structural organization of the protein 3738 the sars-cov-2 s protein is not an exception to this issue and the recently reported structures do not allow resolution of the s1s2 priming loop andor have the loop mutated we used the structural modeling approach to better understand the organization of this region which is not only suggested to be functionally active but has been reported as one of the major differences between the sars-cov-2 and its closest relative ratg13 2533 we observed that the sars-cov-2 s1s2 site is predicted to be organized as an exposed flexible loop suggesting that the site is easily available for protease cleavage and suggesting a major role in sars-cov-2 s function figure 7 the significance of the sars-cov-2 spike protein s1s2 priming loop is yet to be explored experimentally but we consider it may fundamentally change the entry pathway of this virus compared to other known viruses in betacoronavirus lineage b the presence of the extended s1s2 priming loop containing paired basic residues predicts that sars-cov-2 s would most likely be cleaved by golgi-resident proprotein convertases such as furin during virus assembly and delivery to the cell surface indeed analysis of western blots of vsv-pseudoparticles containing sars-cov-2 s have shown the presence of cleaved s in contrast to pseudoparticles containing sars-cov s 25 in the case of mers-cov but not sars-cov it is known that priming of s by pre-cleavage occurs at the s1s2 site giving sars-cov-2 cleavage activation properties more in line with mers-cov than sars-cov 2556 57 58 the extended structural loop may also allow enhanced priming by trypsin-like proteases ttsps or even cathepsins sars-cov-2 is currently believed to be highly sars-cov-like with respect to its receptor binding and the modeling studies reported here are broadly in line with this finding despite the relatively low amino acid identity in the rbm however it is important to remember that changes in protease usage may allow coronaviruses to undergo receptor-independent entry viruscell fusion as well as affect syncytia formation cellcell fusion and tissue pathology 59 60 61 our study provides a structural context to the s1s2 insert which has also been reported by others 5262 the presence of a distinct insert containing paired basic residues in the s1s2 priming loop is common in many coronaviruses in betacoronavirus lineage c eg mers-cov as well as in lineage a eg mouse hepatitis virus mhv and lineage d and is universally found in gammacoronavirus s eg ibv 40 it is noticeably absent in most alphacoronaviruses with the clear exception of type i canine and feline coronaviruses 2837 one feature of the distinct insert for of sars-cov-2 that warrants attention relates to potential changes as the virus evolves an equivalent loop is present in influenza ha in this case adjacent to the fusion peptide and insertions of basic residues into the loop are a primary marker of conversion from low pathogenicity to highly pathogenic avian influenza virus eg h5n1 63 in coronaviruses such loop modifications are known to affect mhv pathogenesis and to modulate neurovirulence and neuroinvasiveness of hcov-oc43 6465 the fcov is another example where s1s2 loop modifications appear to lead directly to changes in viral pathogenesis 376667 in the case of fcov the equivalent proteolytically sensitive structural loop is within a hypervariable region of the spike gene suggesting that this region of spike is a significant driver of virus evolution 67 at present sars-cov-2 is behaving in a distinct manner compared to sars-cov we believe our findings are of special importance considering that the available data indicates ace2 as a suitable cellular receptor for sars-cov-2 entry 4868 in our modeling analysis we observed that the rbm of the sars-cov-2 predicted a similar organization as sars-cov and that deletions at this rbm region in other bat-covs are reported to not impact its ability to bind ace2 49 50 51 this suggests that instead of receptor binding the s1s2 loop is a distinctive feature relevant to sars-cov-2 pathogenesis and marks a unique similarity to mers-cov we would predict that the distinct insert in sars-cov-2 s would give the virus biological properties more in line with mers-cov and not sars-cov especially with regard to its cell entry pathway however it may also impact virus spread and transmission while many epidemiological features of sars-cov-2 still need to be resolved there are many features of transmission that appear to align more with mers-cov than sars-cov one component of transmission is the reproductive number r0 which is currently thought to be approximately 2030 for sars-cov-2 broadly in line with than for sars-cov and while mers-cov has a low r0 in humans  1 it is high in camels and in outbreak situations  3 69 70 71 72 73 another study has reported that the serial interval time from the disease onset in a patient to the onset of the disease in secondary case can be estimated to be below 4 days suggesting that transmission can occur before the onset of clinical signs 74 these two parameters highlight the high transmissibility of the sars-cov-2 one notable feature of the s protein s1s2 cleavage site was first observed during the purification of the mhv s protein for structural analysis 42 mhv with an intact cleavage loop was unstable when expressed and so we consider that the s1s2 loop controls virus stability likely via access to the down-stream s2 site that regulates fusion peptide exposure and activity as such it will interesting to monitor the effects of s1s2 loop insertions and proteolytic cleavability in the context of virus transmission in addition to virus entry pathogenesis and evolution amino acid sequences

 sarscov2 is the third human coronavirus that appeared for the first time in the 21st century one of the other two coronaviruses is sars which appeared in november 2002 in china and caused nearly 100 000 infections worldwide and more than 800 deaths sars was effectively contained because the virus although causing high degree of mortality in infected people was apparently not effectively transmitted from one person to the other

 the second human coronavirus middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers cov appeared in 2013 and caused a limited epidemic of few thousand people but high death rates of approximately 36 predominantly in the middle east saudi arabia the primary source of infection was found to be dromedary camels although the virus was transmitted from person to person in close contact in hospital settings

 all coronaviruses specify a spike s glycoprotein which is embedded in viral envelopes in trimeric forms giving them their characteristic corona structures the s glycoprotein is a major antigen responsible for both receptorbinding and membrane fusion properties
9
 angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 has been identified as the cell receptor for sars
10
 and also sars cov2 while other unknown human receptors may be responsible for its wider infectious spread than sars spike is cleaved into two major components s1 and s2 by cellular proteases virus entry into cells is mediated after binding of a receptorbinding domain rbd located within the s1 ectodomain cleavage of the s glycoprotein to produce s1 and s2 proteins is mediated by cellular proteases at the s1s2 junction as well as at s2 site located downstream of the s1s2 proteolytic cleavage the fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes is mediated by the s2 protein that contains a putative fusion peptide region the mechanism of membrane pore formation that leads to membrane fusion involves the formation of a sixhelix bundle fusion core by two heptad repeats hr1 and hr2 domains found in each s monomer forming the initial pore that results in membrane fusion
11
 the cellular serine protease tmprss2 has been implicated in priming s2 cleavage as well as ace2 cleavage both required for initiation of the membrane fusion event
12
 
13
 
14
 also the sars spike s glycoprotein can be cleaved by the cellular protease cathepsin l at the low ph of endosomes thereby exposing the s2 domain of the spike protein for membrane fusion

 cell surface expression of s mediates sinduced cell fusion and the formation of syncytia which is a phenomenon similar to virus entry requiring the presence of ace2 virusinduced cell fusion is a mechanism by which the virus can spread from celltocell by a phindependent mechanism avoiding the extracellular space and potentially evading neutralizing antibody
21
 
22
 it has been demonstrated that the rbd domain of sars cov2 spike snew sn has a higher binding affinity for the ace2 receptor than that of sars spike sold so while the s2 proteins of these two viruses are nearly 90 identical

23

 nelfinavir mesylate was developed as an antihuman immunodeficiency virus hiv protease inhibitor
24
 
25
 also it was reported that nelfinavir mesylate inhibited sars replication and cytopathic effects in cell culture
26
 in addition to its potent activity against the hiv protease nelfinavir mesylate was found to produce multiple effects on cellular processes including the induction of apoptosis and necrosis as well as induction of cellprotective mechanisms including cell cycle retardation and the unfolded protein response
27
 
28
 
29
 these nelfinavir mesylate effects have been exploited for anticancer purposes

32

 previously we investigated the structure and function of the sars s glycoprotein in transient transfectionmembrane fusion assays
33
 
34
 based on these initial studies we undertook screening of a number of compounds that may inhibit smediated fusion after transient expression in african green monkey kidney cells vero we report herein that the sars cov2 s sn causes extreme smediated membrane fusion in comparison to cell fusion caused by transient expression of sars s so importantly we report that nelfinavir mesylate inhibited smediated fusion at micromolar ranges insilico docking experiments revealed the possibility that nelfinavir binds to the s2 amino terminus within the s trimer and thus may directly inhibit the formation of the heptadrepeat complex that causes smediated membrane fusion based on these results further research of nelfinavirs effect in human covid19 patients is warranted african green monkey kidney vero cells were maintained in dulbeccos modified eagles medium dmem with 10 fetal bovine serum fbs and 2 primocin invitrogen inc carlsbad ca nelfinavir mesylate was bought from rd systems inc mn and dimethyl sulfoxide dmso was bought from sigma inc st louis mo the primary antibodies used were as follows mouse antimyc antibody abcam mouse antiflag antibody abcam goat antimouse antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase hrp was used as a secondary antibody the vector nova red peroxidase hrp substrate kit vector laboratories burlingame ca was used for imaging goat antimouse antibody conjugated with alexa fluorophore 647 and goat antirabbit antibody conjugated with alexa fluorophore 488 invitrogen inc were used for immunofluorescence assay irdye goat antimouse and goat antirabbit antibody licor biotechnology lincoln ne were used for immunoprecipitation assay the sars and sars cov2 spike expression plasmids used in the present study were constructed in a very similar manner both s genes were placed under the control of the human cytomegalovirus cmv immediate early promoter and were engineered to contain either 3xflag or nmyc epitope tags at their amino terminal ends respectively these sn and so genes were cloned into p3xflagcmv9 sigma mo and pcmv3spnmyc sino biological pa parental vector plasmids respectively the s1 subunit of the sn expression construct contained the same amino terminus up to aa700 gly the nterminal domain of the sn s2 subunit was engineered to be exactly as in s1 containing the nmyc tag at its amino terminus and encompassing the s2 sn amino acid sequence 7011273 vero cells were grown on 24well plates and transiently transfected with either pcmv3spnmyc sn or p3xflagcmvs so using lipofectamine 2000 reagent approximately 2 l of lipofectamine and 05 g of plasmid dna was used for transfection of vero cells appropriate controls were also used following 48 hours the plates were examined by phase contrast microscopy for fused cells and images were taken under live conditions as well as either after formalin or methanol fixation cells were stained for flag so mouse antiflag12500 or nmyc sn mouse antimyc1500 with hrp vector nova red stain kit for phase contrast microscopy similarly cells were stained for fluorescent microscopy using antimouse antibody conjugated with alexa fluorophore 647 1100 and antirabbit antibody conjugated with alexa fluorophore 488 1100 nelfinavir mesylate was dissolved in dmso at a 10 mm concentration stock and a series of dilutions was made in serumfree dmem following transfection 500 l of nelfinavir mesylate solution was added to each well vero cells transfected with either so or sn and incubated with the drug for 48 hours at 37c with 5 co2 the tissue culture plates were observed for fused cells and then phase contrast and fluorescent images were taken under either formalin or methanol fixed conditions docking of the nelfinavir mesylate to the spike protein of sars cov2 was performed using autodock
35
 crystal structure of nelfinavir was obtained from the complex of hiv protease nelfinavir crystal structure from the protein data bank pdb id 2q64
36
 structure of the s protein of sars cov2 was reported by wrapp et al
23
 pdb id 6vsb the trimer structure of the spike protein was used for docking as protein structure of the spike protein exists under dynamic condition while binding to the receptor and fusion to host cell grid for docking was created on the spike protein structure at particular docking site as the center but covering a grid box of 102 or 126 in x y z directions from the center of the grid one grid site was created around protease cleavage site s1s2 and another covering the hr1 region of the protein in the trimer figure s1 docking calculations were performed using the lamarckian genetic algorithm with 150 starting conformations and 10 million energy evaluations fifty low energy docked structures were used for final analysis structures within 2 kcalmol from the lowest energy docked structures were represented as final possible docked structures using pymol software schrodinger the lowest energy docked structure was bound near the helices of hr1 region with a docking energy of 1057 kcalmol although the docking grid was created to cover the s1s2 cleavage site the low energy docked structure of nelfinavir was bound in the pocket between the helices of fusion peptide and hr1 region and lower part of ntd region figure s2 the docking energy of the nelfinavir bound structure was 998 kcalmol in the lowest energy docked conformation the nelfinavir sars cov2 spike complex was stabilized by three hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions t768 from s protein fusion peptide formed two hydrogen bonds and q957 of hr1 helix formed one hydrogen bond with nelfinavir hydrophobic interaction was dominated by aromatic functional groups of nelfinavir with tyr313 leu303 and q314 side chains alkyl group in the s protein figure s2 olympus ix71 fluorescent microscope was used for live and phase contrast images using cellsens software zeiss axio observer z1 fluorescent microscope was used for fluorescent images using zen software virus entry is facilitated by smediated fusion between the viral envelope and either cellular plasma membranes or endosomal membranes smediated cell fusion is caused by cell surface expression of s and it is thought to be a surrogate model of both virus entry and cell fusion previously we reported a detailed analysis of the functional domains of the sars spike s glycoprotein that are important for smediated membrane fusion and the formation of multinucleated cells syncytia including delineation of domains important for synthesis cell surface expression and endocytosis from cell surfaces 14 15 to compare the so vs snmediated cell fusion both genes were cloned into the traexpression vectors as codonoptimized genes carrying a 3xflag or nmyc epitope tags at their amino termini figure 1abef in addition the s1 and s2 domains of sn were cloned independently into the transient expression vector pcmv3 encompassing amino acid domains for s1 aa16aa700 and s2 aa701aa1273 both s1 and s2 domains were expressed with an myc epitope tag at their amino termini figure 1cd the s1 domain included the s1s2 cleavage site figure 1c vero cells were transfected with the sn or soexpressing plasmids and were detected at 48 hours posttransfection hpt using antimyc and antiflag antibodies in conjunction with secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase see section 2 vero cells were also transfected with plasmid vehicle controls or mocktransfected expression of both sn and so was readily detected by immunohistochemistry while there was no signal obtained from the vero mocktransfected and hrpstained control cell monolayers phase contrast microscopy revealed the presence of extensive syncytia formation in sn but not sotransfected cells while the remaining monolayer of cells did not exhibit any cellular toxicity figure 2a further examination of transfected vero cells by immunofluorescence staining for cellular tubulin antialpha tubulin antibody nuclei dapi and antinmyc and antiflag antibodies followed by antimouse fluorescent antibody provided additional support that untransfected monolayers appeared normal while sn expression produced large syncytia in contrast to much smaller syncytia formed after so transient expression figure 2b coexpression of s1 and s2 was performed to test whether the snmediated cell fusion could be reconstituted by coexpression of both domains expression of either s1 s2 or s1  s2 domains of sn was readily detected by immunohistochemistry with the antinmyc antibody however there was no cell fusion observed at 48 hpt as evidenced by only welldefined single cells that were stained with the antimyc antibody figure 3 as well as at later times not shown suggesting that the s1 and s2 domains have to be part of the entire molecule to be processed correctly for induction of smediated cell fusion transiently transfected vero cells were treated with either dmso or a series of dilutions 1000001 m of nelfinavir mesylate following 48 hpt the cells were fixed with methanol and stained for either nmyc sn or flag so to detect sn and so expression in transfected cells nelfinavir mesylate treatment did not inhibit overall sn and so expression as evidenced by the efficient expression and detection of both proteins via immunohistochemistry figure 4ab both sn and so mediated fusion was significantly inhibited by nelfinavir at a dosedependent manner with complete inhibition observed at the lowest effective concentration of 10 m compared with the untreated control figure 4ab to determine the effect of nelfinavir on the surface expression of spike we transiently transfected vero cells with plasmids expressing either the so or sn glycoproteins tagged with the 3xflag and nmyc epitopes at their amino termini respectively and treated these cells with either nelfinavir 10 m or dmso control for 48 hours at 37c with 5 co2 the cells were observed for characteristic syncytia formation and then fixed with either formalin or methanol to detect surface expression or endogenous expression of the spike glycoprotein following nelfinavir treatment respectively although there were significant differences in the number of fused cells size of syncytia following drug treatment no apparent difference was visible in the surface expression of spike compared to total spike expression between sn and sotransfected cells these experiments revealed that nelfinavir at concentrations that drastically inhibited cell fusion did not affect sn or so cell surface expression figure 5 recently it was shown that a peptide that targeted the sn hr1 domain s inhibited sarscov2 virus replication virus entry and virusinduced cell fusion
37
 therefore we performed insilico docking experiments to investigate the possibility that nelfinavir may directly bind near this s region these theoretical docking experiments revealed that nelfinavir may bind near the hr1 helix and in between the hr1 and hr2 helices figures s1 and s2 virusinduced cell fusion and the formation of multinucleated cells syncytia is the hallmark of many different viral infections including retroviruses herpesviruses coronaviruses and other viruses these membrane fusion phenomena are caused by expression of fusogenic glycoproteins on infected cell surfaces celltocell fusion mediated by viral glycoproteins is similar to fusion of viral envelopes with cellular membranes that typically occur at the plasma membrane at physiological ph or after endocytosis of virion enveloped particles within endosomes followed by fusion of the viral envelope with endosomal membranes to release the nucleocapsid protein in the cytoplasm
38
 virusinduced cell fusion is an important cytopathic phenomenon because the virus can spread from celltocell avoiding extracellular spaces and exposure to neutralizing antibodies
39
 virusinduced cell fusion can also cause hyperinflammatory responses producing adverse effects in the infected host herein we show that the sars cov2 spike sn glycoprotein causes drastically more cell fusion and syncytia formation in comparison to the sars spike so glycoprotein following transient expression in vero cells importantly we show that nelfinavir mesylate a currently prescribed antihiv protease inhibitor drastically inhibited both sn and somediated cell fusion these results indicate that it is highly likely that increased sars cov2 virulence over sars may be attributed to the enhanced fusogenicity exhibited by sn in comparison to the so glycoprotein importantly the fact the nelfinavir drastically inhibited sn and somediated cell fusion suggests that it should be used as an antisars cov2 antiviral especially at early times after first symptoms are exhibited in infected individuals transient expression of sn and so glycoproteins produced drastic differences in cell fusion while their overall protein expression was similar as evidenced by immunohistochemistry signals obtained at 48 hpt the enhanced fusogenicity of sars cov2 vs sars cov was recently noted in infection of vero cells
37
 further validating that our transient transfection results reflect spikemediated virusinduced cell fusion differences between sars and sars cov2 cell surface expression of sn and so was comparable suggesting that the observed differences in membrane fusion was due to inherent differences in the structure and function of sn vs so glycoproteins interestingly independent expression of s1 and s2 domains of sn did not cause any cell fusion it is not clear whether these two domains could be processed and expressed on cell surfaces although the s2 domain could be detected via immunohistochemistry not shown these results suggest that the entire s glycoprotein needs to be expressed in an uncleaved form that may be proteolytically processed either within endosomes or at cell surfaces by proteases such as tmprss2 which is known to be required for spike activation during virus entry
12

 we utilized the sn and so transient expression system to screen for currently available drugs that may inhibit smediated cell fusion and the formation of syncytia these drugs included cardiac glycosides such as ouabain and digoxin the antihiv fusion inhibitor fuzeon enfuvirtide and kinase inhibitors including gleevec imatinib mesylate these drugs did not substantially inhibit smediated cell fusion even at concentrations of 100 m however we found that nelfinavir mesylate a known and currently prescribed antihiv drug drastically inhibited sn and somediated cell fusion at micromolar concentrations the 10 m concentration used in our tissue culture experiments is approximately 10fold lower than the observed auc24 area under the plasma concentrationtime curve during a 24hour period at steady state
40
 fda reference document viracept id2910197 therefore it may be possible that nelfinavir can be used at even lower concentrations than those prescribed for patients with hiv these results are significant because nelfinavir did not appear to inhibit overall sn or so synthesis and cell surface expression we considered the possibility that nelfinavir may act not as a protease inhibitor but as a direct inhibitor of spikemediated membrane fusion computational modeling revealed that nelfinavir may directly bind to the trimeric form of sn and so near the putative fusogenic domain and thus it may directly inhibit smediated cell fusion figures s1 and s2 nelfinavir has been reported to have pleotropic effects on multiple cellular processes including inducing apoptosis an er stress under certain conditions and has been investigated for anticancer purposes
32
 
41
 
42
 thus it is possible that cellular signaling processes are affected that alter to posttranslational processing of sn and so without affecting their cell surface expression it is also possible that nelfinavir may inhibit cellular proteases including tmprss2 that may be required for sn and so fusion activation other protease inhibitors are currently being investigated for their ability to inhibit sars cov2 replication and spread however there are no concrete results that have been obtained in clinical trials yet
43
 preliminary experiments indicate that sn and so may be cleaved in vero cells in the presence of nelfinavir although it is not currently known whether this cleavage occurs efficiently in addition transfected cells expressing sn or so in the presence of nelfinavir did not appear to exhibit morphologies indicating of cellular cytotoxicity suggesting that nelfinavir is not cytotoxic at the concentrations used in this study overall these experiments suggest that nelfinavir should be used to combat sars cov2 infections early during the first symptoms exhibited by infected patients to minimize virus spread and give sufficient time to infected patients to mount a protective immune response  emergence and reemergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronaviruses shailendra saxena k preeti baxi shailendra saxena k   reported phylogenetic analysis revealed the close relationship between covid-19 and bat sars-like coronavirus lu et al 2020 kumar et al 2020 although both emerged from the sars coronavirus suggesting the newly spread 2019-ncov into human is very much related to sars-cov kumar et al 2020 figure 132 represents the evolutionary relationship between different lineage of betacoronavirus and their respective cellular receptors through which they interact with the host cell as per sequence alignment data the sequence of spike glycoprotein of covid-19 and sars-cov shows 762 individuality 872 resemblance and 2 gaps this data indicates that covid-19 spike glycoprotein exhibits higher sequence similarity with 128 of variation with sars-cov the study performed by kumar et al 2020 on variation of sequences of minimal receptor-binding domain rbd revealed 733 uniqueness 839 matches and 04 gaps suggesting a difference of 161 and tertiary structure of minimal receptor-binding domain covid-19 may have changes in virus-binding capacity shift and infectivity into the receptors of the host cell due to notable deviation in minimal rbd of s-glycoprotein

 coronavirus sars-cov-2 is positive ssrna and enveloped virus genome encodes 16 nonstructural proteins nsps and 4 essential structural proteins and several accessory proteins the comparison of the glycosylation sites between covid-19 and sars-cov of the spike glycoproteins unveiled the presence of novel glycosylation sites in covid-19 such as ngtk nfti nltt and ntsn kumar et al 2020 the presence of novel glycosylation sites in covid-19 might be due to the variation in sequence along with the deviation in reported four glycosylation sites ie ngtk nfti nltt and ntsn covid-19 spike glycoprotein exhibits the similar glycosylation sites also present in sars-cov nitn ngti nitn nfsq nesl nctf and nntv there is a possibility of interaction between covid-19 and host receptor through novel glycosylation sites which may have an effect on the process of internalization and linked pathogenesis kumar et al 2020 a study carried out to determine the antigenicity by comparing the antigenic variations in both spike glycoproteins of covid-19 and sars-cov revealed the individuality of most of the ctl epitopes in covid-19 compared to the sars-cov however six identical epitopes risncvady cvadysvly rsfiedllf rvdfcgkgy mtsccsclk and lkgvklhy are present in spike glycoprotein of covid-19 and sars-cov kumar et al 2020 in covid-19 some epitopes are identified with difference in single amino acid change as per available information and research data of antigenicity covid-19 shows little antigenic similarities with sars coronavirus it is possible that antigenic similarity may cause similar antigenic response and therefore it can be used as one of the precautionary approach variation and similarity in spike glycoprotein and epitopes may be useful to design newer and effective vaccines kumar et al 2020 the length of encoded proteins in covid-19 and sars-like coronaviruses was found nearly same guo et al 2020 however longer spike protein of covid-19 showed a notable difference compared to the bat sars-like coronaviruses and sars-cov on the whole 125 of difference in sequences of s glycoprotein and difference in minimal rbd with 236 may cause structural differences in spike glycoproteins of covid-19 and sars-cov kumar et al 2020 the studies performed to measure the average distance between the molecules of superimposed proteins ie rmsd depict the 138  local rmsd value between two glycoproteins this illustrates regardless of 128 sequence variation that there is an insignificant structural divergence among the spike glycoproteins of sars-cov and covid-19 the absence of structural divergence in spike glycoproteins of sars-cov and covid-19 raises a hope for the treatment of brutal covid-19 as there is structural similarity in sars-cov and covid-19 the previously trialed and tested attachment inhibitor used for sars-cov can be used as the present choice of treatment for covid-19 kumar et al 2020 
the third epidemic of the twenty-first centurysars-cov was reported as the first epidemic of the twenty-first century in 2003 following by mers-cov in 2012covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 is the third epidemic which is declared pandemic by the who
severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 portray a number of similaritiesvirus homology as per sequence alignment data the spike glycoprotein sequence of covid-19 and sars-cov shows 872 resemblance sequences of minimal receptor-binding domain rbd show 839 similaritypresence of similar glycosylation sites and similar epitopesroutes of transmission of both the viruses ie contact droplets and fomite
along with the similarities severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 depict a number of dissimilarities alsosuch as 125 of difference in s glycoprotein sequence and difference in minimal rbd with 236other behavioral differences such as rate of transmission and severity of covid-19 is much higher than sars-cov
the emergence of novel coronavirus 2019 covid-19 might be due to rna recombination as the positive-sense rna viruses are well reported for their ability of rna recombination which make them potent to cross the species barrierthe structural similarity of covid-19 with sars-cov could be encashed in terms ofuse of available treatment for the inhibition of attachment with the host cell this could be an effective way to control the spread of diseasecan use some drugcompound to block the entry into host cell by binding to the receptor

 the newly emerged coronavirus sars-cov-2 is strongly related to the predecessor sars-cov sars-cov is becoming pandemic which is declared as public health emergency of global concern the presence of novel glycosylation sites in sars-cov-2 makes it possible to become pandemic due to its antigenic divergence at this time it is important to understand and educate the mass to follow the instructions given by the authorities and avoid any social gathering by this at least we can delay the transmission in widespread community slowdown of transmission rate will provide time to the researchers and scientists to prepare well and develop vaccine and treatment for this novel coronavirus the similarity of sars-cov-2 to sars-cov in terms of antigenic sites proposes the scope of sars-linked peptide-based vaccine to prevent covid-19 the structural similarity of sars-cov-2 to sars-cov suggests the use of attachment inhibitor specific to coronavirus as the current option of the treatment although the mechanism of species to species transfer of the sars coronavirus is difficult to understand sars-cov 2003 epidemic makes it clear that animal coronaviruses are budding threats to the human community still researches are going on covid-19 limited information on novel coronavirus makes some boundaries to explain the complete antigenicity and structure of covid-19 complete genome analysis is required to understand the similarities and differences of sars-cov-2 with the previously reported viruses complete genome analysis also helps in the development of vaccines and medicines

stephens jonathan stuckey shuishu wang richard friesner a david ho d john mascola r lawrence shapiro peter kwong d   to provide insight into the stability of the spike over the course of virus-cell entry we used differential scanning calorimetry dsc to measure the unfolding enthalpy of the soluble trimeric ectodomain spike which included gsas and pp mutations and the t4 phage fibritin trimerization domain416 as a function of ph notably at physiological ph we observed spike to be at a minimum of unfolding enthalpy 733 kcalmol or 10 the normalized unfolding enthalpy of the average globular protein17 fig 1a left the amount of folding energy increased rapidly as ph dropped increasing 10-fold by ph 6 before decreasing as ph reduced further analysis of melting curves fig 1a right indicated three distinct peaks a peak at 48c which dominated under basic conditions and decreased at acidic conditions a peak at 65c which was barely present at physiological ph but rapidly increased to dominate as ph dropped to 55-60 and a peak at 55c which first appeared as a shoulder at ph 6 but then increased to dominate and shifted to lower temperature at ph lower than 55 in sharp contrast to spike analysis of the spike n-terminal domain ntd and rbd as separate proteins indicated each of them to have typical unfolding enthalpies 90 that of the average normalized globular protein extended data fig 1 to understand how the reduced folding enthalpy might influence spike structure we used negative stain-electron microscopy em to visualize the spike as a function of ph extended data fig 2 at ph 74 we observed the spike to be mostly disordered however when ph decreased we observed well-formed trimers which showed some clustering at ph 55-60 before resolving into separate particles at ph 40-45 overall we observed concordance between the presence of well-formed trimers and folding enthalpy measured by dsc with mostly unfolded trimers at physiological ph and substantially increased folding at endosomal ph for variation in ph over the course of virus entry to impact the binding of antibody the antibody would need to allow spike recognition of the ace2 receptor thereby enabling the virus to enter the endosome8 we used isothermal titration calorimetry itc to determine whether binding of cr3022 to spike was compatible with ace2 interaction we chose to use a monomeric version of ace2 to test more sensitively the impact of antibody inhibition first we titrated ace2 into soluble spike and observed 19 ace2 molecules to bind per spike trimer with an affinity of 94 nm fig 1b left next we fully titrated the antigen-binding fragment fab of cr3022 into soluble spike extended data fig 3a and further titrated ace2 into the spike-cr3022 complex formed to observe 23 ace2 molecules to bind each spike-cr3022 complex with an affinity of 130 nm fig 1b right the sars-cov-2 spike thus appears capable of recognizing ace2 even in the presence of antibody cr3022 indicating that cr3022-bound spikes could enter the endosomal compartment to gain insight into the impact of ph on ace2 and cr3022 interactions with spike we characterized their affinities both to spike and to rbd expressed as a separate molecule at physiological and endosomal ph we chose to use dimeric ace2 to more closely mimic native interactions with spike at endosomal phs surface plasmon resonance spr-determined ace2 binding affinities to both spike and rbd were somewhat reduced from 082 nm to 70 nm and from 10 nm to 14 nm at ph 45 for spike and rbd respectively extended data fig 3b with cr3022 igg affinities were high to both spike and rbd at physiological ph though with a 10-fold difference 049 and 0052 nm to spike and rbd respectively fig 1c at ph 55 this 10-fold difference in affinity was retained 17 and 023 nm respectively however at ph 45 cr3022 still bound to rbd 11 nm but affinity to spike was dramatically reduced with a kd  1000 nm  an affinity difference of at least 1000-fold fig 1c extended data fig 3c because cr3022 still bound strongly to the isolated rbd we attribute the dramatically reduced affinity of cr3022 for spike at low ph to conformational constraints of the spike fig 1d structures of ace2 and cr3022 have been determined in complex with rbd as a separate domain618-20 but less is known about their interactions with trimer to provide structural insight into the recognition between ace2 and spike trimer we mixed soluble ace2 with spike trimer at a 61 molar ratio at ph 74 and collected single-particle cryo-em data on a titan krios we observed spike binding ace2 at stoichiometries of 11 12 and 13 with prevalences of 15 43 and 38 respectively fig 2a while the membrane-proximal region of the spike in these complexes remained 3-fold symmetric the ace2-binding regions showed asymmetry with for example superposition of the double-ace2-bound complex onto itself based on membrane-proximal regions leading to displacement of ace2 molecules by almost 13  fig 2b however we could see no evidence of coordinated movement with the rbd domain on each protomer appearing to engage ace2 without significantly impacting the up or down motion of the neighboring protomers thus ace2 receptor engagement required rbd movement that did not appear to destabilize the spike nor to trigger a substantial structural rearrangement beyond raising of the rbd to provide insight into the impact of endosomal ph we again mixed soluble ace2 with spike trimer at a 61 molar ratio but this time at ph 55 and determined the structure of the complex using cryo-em similar to physiological ph we observed spike binding ace2 at stoichiometries of 11 12 and 13 with prevalences of 27 32 and 27 respectively fig 2c we superposed triple-ace2-bound complexes determined at ph 74 and ph 55 and observed the membrane-proximal regions of the spike to align closely while ace2 molecules showed displacements of 31 60 and 108  fig 2d overall structures of the spike with ace2 showed about equal distribution of single- double- and triple-ace2-bound states at both physiological and endosomal ph in light of the similarity of ace2 complexes at ph 74 and 55 fig 2 but substantial differences at these phs observed for ligand-free spike by negative stain em extended data fig 2 we analyzed the structure of the spike at ph 55 by single-particle cryo-em we determined a consensus structure from 1083554 particles at a resolution of 27  in which most of the spike was well resolved except for a lone rbd for which reconstruction density was poor fig 3a extended data fig

conformations with the rbd in the up or down position or without a defined position for this domain extended data fig 5c panel b interestingly unlike for ace2-bound complexes no double- or triple-rbd-up conformations were observed two classes with prevalences of 23 conformation 1  29  resolution and 26 conformation 2  29  resolution corresponded to two different single rbd-up conformations a third prevalent class representing 10 of the particles had all rbds down for all three of these prevalent classes  and unlike in the consensus structure  density for all rbd domains was well resolved extended data fig 5c panel c indicating multiple different orientations of rbd in the spike at ph 55 in the remaining classes the rbd did not assume a defined position suggesting mobility of this domain even at endosomal ph to determine how even lower ph affected conformational heterogeneity and since cr3022 retained binding to spike at ph 55 we sought to obtain a cryo-em structure of the ligand-free spike at ph 40 single particle analysis of a dataset comprising 911839 particles resolved an all-rbd-down conformation fig 3b extended data fig 6a-b the map was refined to 24  resolution enabling individual water molecules to be observed fig 3c and 89 additional residues to be modeled which were undefined in published cryo-em structures34 to identify critical components responsible for the reduction of conformational heterogeneity between ph 55 and ph 40  and to shed light on the mechanism locking rbds in the down position  we analyzed root-mean square deviations rmsds between the ph 55 structures and the all-down ph 40 conformation with an 11-residue sliding window to identify regions that refold fig 4a
top and
extended data fig 7 as each of the protomers in the trimer displayed a different conformation in each of the ph 55 structures we defined protomer b as the one with rbd in the up position in each of the single rbd-up conformations with protomers a-c appearing counter-clockwise when viewed along the trimer 3-fold axis toward the membrane we observed significant rmsd peaks for short stretches around residue 330 in protomers a and b and around residue 525 in protomer b only and most substantially in a region comprising residues 825-858 extended data fig 7b this region which for reasons described below we named the switch region was fully defined in protomer b and partially resolved in protomer a residues 825-829 and 849-858 and protomer c residues 825-840 and 851-858 notably this region was almost entirely unresolved in our structures with ace2 and in published spike structures34 fig 4a bottom the asymmetry in distribution of refolding regions in the trimer between single-up and all-down structures fig 4b suggested the up rbd to require concerted adjustments throughout the trimer to delineate these we determined angles and rigid-body translations between each of the subdomains extended data fig 8 for ph 55 single rbd-up and 40 all rbd-down structures for clarity we specify by subscript the protomer of each subunit or of each residue starting with the sd1a -entrance loop of protomer a and moving laterally around the trimer fig 4c supplementary video 5 we observed slight refolding in the 313-325a stretch allowing a 17 rotation of the sd1a domain to accommodate the switch region on the neighboring b protomer switch b at ph 55 switch b interacted with sd2a buried surface area of 2968 2 and this key inter-protomer contact coupled with sd1a rotation and 28- translation resulted in the 88- lateral displacement of ntdb towards the next rbd-switch the displaced ntdb induced consecutive shifts of sd2b and sd1b domains which culminated in the 228- up translation 649 rotation of rbdb versus its down-equivalent the up positioning of rbdb was accommodated in part by a 51  mostly downwards displacement of ntdc towards the viral membrane which  continuing to the next rbd-switch  induced minor shifts of sd2c and sd1c domains and yielded rbdc and switch a in conformations that closely resembled those of the all-down ph 40 structure at ph 40 each of the rbd-switches closely resembled each other the most dramatic refolding relative to the switches at ph 55 occurred in switch b where the guanidinium of residue arg847b swivels over 25  from interacting in an inter-protomer manner with sd2a to interacting in an intra-protomer manner with ntdb of the same protomer this swiveling breaks the coordinated displacements of domains across the protomer-protomer interface reducing the sd2a interaction with switch by half buried surface area of 1651 2 notably refolding regions were observed to reside at critical inter-protomer contacts or at key joints between domains especially the sd2 to sd1 joint which cradles the switch of the neighboring protomer and the sd1b joint with up-rbdb made up of refolding residues 522-530b the switch domain which included aspartic acid residues at 830 839 843 and 848 and a disulfide linkage between cys840 and cys851 was located at the nexus of sd1 and sd2 from one protomer and hr1 and ntd from the neighboring protomer this region showed dramatic refolding pairwise rmsd comparisons extended data fig 9a indicated 9 of the 12 cryo-em-determined switch structures  with at least half of their residues ordered  to segregate into two conformations unprotonated-switches and protonated-switches unprotonated-switches were exemplified by switches b and c at ph 55 and perhaps best by switch b in the ph 55 single-rbd up structure fig 5a left
supplementary video 5 continuing from fusion peptide fpb the n terminus of switch b formed several helical turns 833-842 extending laterally from hr1b to sd2a a turn 843-848 provided extensive contacts with sd2a before returning in helical turns 849-855 back to hr1b unprotonated-switches were stabilized by a hydrophobic core comprising the disulfide and residues phe833 tyr837 ala846 leu849 and phe855 extended data fig 9b notably all four of the unprotonated-switch aspartic acids faced solvent and appeared to be negatively charged protonated-switches were exemplified by switch a at ph 55 and by all switches at ph 40 including switch b in the ph 40 structure fig 5a left
supplementary video 5 these switches reoriented their n-terminal helical turns to point towards sd1 swiveling the c-position of arg847 over 15  to interact with ntd extended data fig 9b before finishing the rest of the domain with a few helical turns 848-855 protonated switches were stabilized by a hydrophobic core comprising tyr837 and aliphatic portions of side chain from gln836 and lys854 on one side of the disulfide and ala846 and phe855 on the other notably two of the switch domain asp residues that appeared most likely to be protonated based on hydrogen bonding patterns in the ph 40 structure d830 and d843 also had higher calculated pkas compared to the unprotonated switch conformation consistent with their observed hydrogen bonds and their apparent protonation at ph 55 extended data fig 10 additionally three asp residues from the neighboring protomer d574 d586 and d614 had higher pkas in protonated-switch conformations than in unprotonated-switch conformations in general our pka calculations and structural analyses both indicated increased asp residue protonation in the protonated-switch conformation and reflected the expected trend of increasing numbers of protonated asp or glu residues at lower ph extended data fig 10c analysis of switch domain conformations and rbd positions fig 5b indicated a concordance between switches interacting with ntd breaking coordinated interprotomer interactions and the locking of rbds in the down position thus at ph 55 the unprotonated-switches in protomers b and c interacted with the sd2 domain of the neighboring protomer to transmit lateral displacements of domains at ph 40 the protonated-switches interrupt this interprotomer interaction resulting in the locking of rbds in the down position analysis of sars-cov-2 variant sequences identifies an asp614gly mutation to be associated with more transmissible viral variants721-24 our structures revealed asp614 to be located at the key interprotomer juncture between sd2 domain and switch forming a hydrogen bond with tyr837 of unprotonated-switches fig 5a left and recognizing a backbone carbonyl in protonated-switches fig 5a right to test the impact of this mutation on unfolding enthalpy we performed dsc measurements at ph 74 55 and 40 fig 5c while the enthalpies at ph 55 and 40 were similar to those of wild-type spike the unfolding enthalpy at ph 74 was dramatically increased with the appearance of a high melting temperature peak for the variant fig 5d seen for the wild-type only at low ph the dramatic difference in melting enthalpy demonstrated the substantive energetic effect of altering a interprotomer-switch interface to test the influence of this increased unfolding enthalpy on ace2 interaction we performed biolayer interferometry bli on dimeric ace2 recognizing spike or the asp614gly variant at ph 74 we observed higher binding of the wild-type spike than the asp614gly variant to dimeric ace2 fig 5e left consistent with dsc showing more unfolding enthalpy for the variant spike thereby reducing its ability to bind dimeric ace2 with avidity we next tried to understand the impact of the asp614gly mutation on the switch-based mechanism locking rbd in the down position at low ph as switches with disorder in the region contacting sd2 were associated with up rbds we hypothesized that mutation of asp614 to gly would more closely mimic the loss of interaction between sd2 and switch as exemplified by rbdb and switch c indeed bli measurements at ph 40 showed dimeric ace2 to bind the asp614gly variant with greater apparent affinity fig 5e right consistent with the higher probability of rbds adopting the up position and providing an explanation for its increased infectivity25 to test the impact on antibody binding we used bli to measure the affinity of cr3022 to spike and asp614gly variant similar to what we observed with dimeric ace2 cr3022 bound wild-type spike more tightly than gly variant at physiological ph with this behavior inverting at low ph where folding and ph switch induced antibody shedding from wild-type but less so from variant spike fig 5f lastly we tested the ability of antibody cr3022 to neutralize the asp614gly variant using a pseudovirus format the asp614gly variant showed a modest increase in neutralization sensitivity to cr3022 fig 5g indicating its conformational masking to be mostly intact with the observed increase in spike binding to cr3022 at low ph perhaps compensated with respect to neutralization by altered spike interactions with ace2 viral spikes are prime targets for neutralizing antibody and many have evolved immune evasion some of which resemble aspects of the ph-dependent conformational masking described here receptor binding-site masking with endosomal cleavage for example occurs with the ebola virus glycoprotein trimer26 and conformational masking has been previously described for the hiv-1 envelope trimer27 which is labile and elicits antibodies of little neutralization capacity with sars-cov-2 the low folding enthalpy of the spike allows antibodies like cr3022 to bind bivalently with high affinity though also of little neutralization capacity we show here how a ph-dependent switch locks spike in an all-rbd-down conformation and in the process sheds antibodies like cr3022 which recognize cryptic epitopes not accessible in the all-down state the functional purpose of the up-down positioning of rbd domains in coronaviruses has been a point of debate since structures of rbd-up and rbd-down have been determined28-36 we propose sars-cov-2 to use mobile rbds coupled with spike unfolding to evade affinity-based mechanisms of antibody maturation by allowing tight avidity-based affinity for non- or weakly neutralizing antibodies the impact of such evasion would be a lower neutralizing response relative to the titer of spike-binding antibody the striking difference in unfolding enthalpy between the emerging asp614gly variant and its more stealthy parent may allow for comparative insight how in the face of spike conformational masking  to neutralize sars-cov-2 we envision three scenarios first antibodies that block ace2 interaction if the spike can be prevented from binding ace2 it will not be able to start the endosomal entry pathway second antibodies with extremely high affinity we show that conformational masking reduces affinity of cr3022 at ph 45 by 1000-fold so that it no longer neutralizes however antibodies with orders of magnitude tighter affinity might still bind and neutralize despite a 1000-fold reduction in affinity at low endosomal ph in this context we note that cr3022 does have 100-fold higher affinity to the sars-cov spike and is able to neutralize sars-cov virus6 third antibodies that bind to the all-rbd down state could neutralize by locking the spike in the all-rbd down conformation perhaps relevant to this many recently identified potent neutralizing antibodies appear to recognize the all-rbd down conformation37-39 we propose the all-down ph 4-locked conformation of the spike as a vaccine target along the lines of what has been done to surmount evasion for other viral type 1 fusion machines such as from rsv4041 hiv42-44 and others45-47 including sars-cov-248-50 which use alterations in conformation to elude the humoral immune response sars-cov-2 spike4 and its d614g mutant were expressed by transient transfection in 293 freestyle cells briefly 1 mg of dna was transfected into 1l of cells using turbo293 transfection reagent

and fab of cr3022 were prepared and exhaustively dialyzed against pbs ph 74 prior to the experiments any dilution steps prior to the experiments were made using the dialysate to avoid any unnecessary heats of dilution associated with the injections all reagents were thoroughly degassed prior to the experiments for the direct determination of the binding to the spike protein the solution containing either ace2 or cr3022fab was added stepwise in 10 l aliquots to the stirred calorimetric cell  14 ml containing spike protein at 04  05 m expressed per trimer the concentration of titrant in the syringe was 12  14 m for both ace2 and cr3022fab the effect of cr3022 on ace2 binding to spike protein was studied by first titrating the spike protein with cr3022 until complete saturation was reached and then performing a complete titration of the complex with ace2 despite the thorough dialysis the heat of dilutioninjection associated with the injection of ace2 into the complex was considerable during the course of the titration and needed to be accounted for in the analysis the heat evolved upon each injection was obtained from the integral of the calorimetric signal and the heat associated with binding was obtained after subtraction of the heat of dilution the enthalpy change h the association constant ka and the stoichiometry n were obtained by nonlinear regression of

ace2 binding experiments to avoid the difficulty in surface regeneration that arises with slow dissociation we used single-cycle kinetics binding experiments cr3022 igg was tested at analyte concentrations 36-133 nm prepared in running buffer at each ph using a three-fold dilution series in addition cr3022 igg was tested over the spike at higher analyte concentrations ranging 108-4 nm 360-1333 nm and 1000-3704 nm at ph 45 only to confirm the absence of binding to the spike at ph 45 dimeric ace2 was tested at 90-333 nm prepared in running buffer at each ph using a three-fold

steps were performed using relion 30 ref 59 unless otherwise stated for spike at ph 40 a small particle set was selected manually and used to obtain 2d classes which were utilized as templates to select a larger set of particles an initial 3d model was obtained using eman 2162 from the 2d classes generated from this extended particle set this 3d model was then subjected to 3d auto-refinement and the resulting map was used to generate low-pass filtered picking templates for the entire dataset for spike at ph 55 particle picking was performed with cryolo 1563 using a general network model

selected from the final particle set at ph 55 was exported into cryosparc 215 54 and a homogeneous refinement was performed without imposing symmetry the 3d variability analysis was set up to use three eigenvectors of the 3d covariance and 20 frames were used for visualization of results the eigenvectors describing movements of the rbd were identified via examining the resulting volume series and corresponding variability movies supplementary videos 1-4 the structural heterogeneity of the consensus ph 55 map in the rbd region was analyzed using local 3d classification to obtain an accurate mask encompassing the conformational space of the dynamic rbd the four 3d variability volumes corresponding to the beginning and the end of the trajectories defined by eigenvectors 0 and 2 were first aligned to the consensus cryo-em map for each of the four volumes the density corresponding to the dynamic rbd was isolated by performing volume segmentation in ucsf chimera 69 these rbd sub-volumes were added together and a soft mask was created from the resulting composite volume by low-pass filtering the density to 15  extending the resulting volume by 2 pixels and adding a soft edge of 5 pixels using relionmaskcreate local 3d classification of the consensus dataset within this mask was performed without particle alignment in relion 3 59 followed by global 3d refinement of each of the resulting six maps we used a sliding window of 11 amino acids and 21 amino acids respectively to align and calculate backbone c ca o n rmsd values between the ph 4 structure protom er b and ph 55 single-rbd-up or ph 55 all-rbd-down structures respectively using pymol version 234 calculation was omitted if the specified residue range had less than 22 backbone atoms the average rmsd values of ph

virus infection 1 2  antibodies from sars-cov and sars-cov-2 patients however showed limited cross neutralization in spite of the high sequence similarity between two viruses 3  other vaccine approaches include the production of live attenuated whole virion vaccines inactivated whole virion vaccines recombinant protein vaccines and mrna based vaccines 4  sars-cov-2 was found to enter cells through binding of the host cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 via its spike glycoprotein soon after its outbreak in china 3  later the cryo-em revealed the structure of sars-cov-2 s-rbd complexed with its receptor human ace2 5 6 7 8  the s1 subunit of spike glycoprotein undergoes a hinge-like conformational transition from down conformation to up conformation before binding to ace2 8  the receptor-binding motif rbm 72 amino acid in total of spike glycoprotein in close contact of ace2 receptor was identified for its sequence between 437 -508 9  and this rbm was consistent with the identified s-rbd 8  this conformational transition state has become the target for antibody-mediated neutralization and the atomic-level understanding of this transitional state and the identification of s-rbm would facilitate the vaccine design and development against sars-cov-2 ferritin is a 24-mer protein assembly consisting of heavy chain 21 kd and light chain 19 kd  it has a cage-like structure in a way similar to sars-cov-2 because of its unique structure ferritin is a promising nanoplatform for antigen presentation and immune stimulation 10 11 12 13  its spherical architecture has an outer diameter of 12 nm suitable for rapid tissue penetration and draining to lymph node 14  in this work we engineered a human ferritin heavy chain hftn by fusing and presenting the rbm of its spike glycoprotein as potential vaccine of sars-cov-2 human ace2his tag 10108-h08h ace2 rabbit antibody 10108-rp01 goat anti-rabbithrp secondary antibodyssa004 and sars-cov-2 2019-ncov and rbd of spike glycoprotein mfc tag40592-v05h were purchased from sino biological beijing china  the refolding solution was concentrated and buffer exchanged to 25 mm tris-hcl buffer ph 80 with a millipore lab scale tangential flow filter tff system after buffer exchange rbm-hftn was found to have a typical soluble ferritin structure the fusion protein with its right space structure was further purified by using anion exchange chromatography flow through mode followed with a size-exclusion chromatography to remove aggregates and other low molecule impurities the physico-chemical properties of fusion rbm-hftn were analyzed by sec-hplc overnight after blocking with 5 bsa ace2 protein concentration 05 gml was allowed to bind to the surface coated proteins for 2 h at 37c followed by washing with washing buffer three times anti-ace2 antibody dilution 11000 was incubated for 15 hours at 37c followed by washing for three times secondary antibodyhrp 15000 dilution in 5 bsa was incubated 37c for 05 h followed by washing for three times the tmb substrate was added and incubated for 30 min and then the absorbance was read at 650 nm wavelength ferritin heavy chain protein has found many biological applications in nanomedicines and molecular diagnostics 15 16 17  lately a few constructs based on ferritin have been developed as antivirus and anticancer vaccines 10 11 13  because ferritin heavy chain protein is derived from a natural occurring protein in human itself has low immunogenicity its 24-mer assembly cage-like structure has four different symmetries six 4-fold axes eight 3-fold axes twelve 2-fold axes and twenty-four c3-c4 interfaces by presenting a fusion protein at the 3-fold axes ferritin was able to display eight trimers of fused protein resulting in enhanced immunogenicity of protein on display 18  in this work we engineered a human ferritin heavy chain fused with the rbm of spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 at its nterminus with ggggs3 short peptide linker  figure 1a  we chose a short polypeptide sequence 72 amino acid of spike glycoprotein rbm s-rbm based on latest 3-d cryo-em studies of spike glycoprotein-ace2 complex 8 9  because this sequence doesnt appear to have a stable 3-d structure we engineered it at the n-terminus so that the fused s-rbm subunits are distant from each other and wont affect the formation 24-mer assembly for the same reason we chose a minimal size of rbd so that it is properly displayed on the surface of ferritin in spite of those considerations the rbm-hftn fusion protein was found mainly in the inclusion bodies instead of in soluble form hypothetically the designed rbm-hftn fusion protein may involve in two different pathways against virus infection first and most importantly the rbm-hftn may act as vaccine against sars-cov-2 and antibodies responsive to spike glycoprotein rbm may subsequently neutralize sars-cov-2 followed by removal of virus by immune system  figure 1b upper pathway  two antibodies found in covid-19 patients were shown to block the binding between virus s-protein rbd and cellular receptor ace2 19  their therapeutic effect was validated in mouse model by reducing virus titer in infected lungs 19  those findings supported our hypothesis that by properly presenting s-protein rbdrbm the designed rbm-hftn has great potential as an anti-sars-cov-2 vaccine thus inducing the production of antivirus antibodies the second pathway more obvious and direct is to block the cellular entry of sars-cov-2 by preoccupy the ace2 receptor with rbm-hftn and suppress the virus proliferation  figure 1b  lower pathway the first pathway is more effective for prevention of virus infection the second pathway is valuable for treatment after virus infection as antagonist of ace2 receptor the expressed rbm-hftn was found in the form of inclusion bodies in the bacteria lysis precipitates supplementary figure s2  rbd of spike glycoprotein mfc tag and rbm-hftn of varied concentration in 100 l was incubated in maxisorp plate and ace2 was allowed to bind to the surface coated proteins their binding was detected by ace2 antibody followed by its secondary antibody in this indirect elisa the maximum binding intensity correlates with the binding site on surface as indicated by the results in figure 3  s-rbd showed higher plateau than rbm-hftn suggesting more binding sites are available in s-rbd coated wells than in rbm-hftn coated wells the ec50s of the binding between ace2 and s-rbd rbm-hftn were estimated to be 6066 nm and 2336 nm respectively apparently rbm-hftn has higher binding affinity than s-protein in binding to their same ace2 receptor the apparent higher binding affinity may attribute to the cage-like structure of rbm-hftn which presents multiple copies 24 copies of rbm on the surface this result suggested that the rbm is properly presented on surface of heavy chain human ferritin and is recognizable by the ace2 receptor its potential as sars-cov-2 vaccine and as antagonist of ace2 receptor is being further studied in animal experiments the receptor-binding motif rbm of sars-cov-2 a 72-amino acid polypeptide was fused with n-terminus of human heavy chain ferritin hftn through a proper linker the constructed rbm-hftn was found in inclusion bodies of bacterial lysis and was able to refold by gradual dialysis the purified rbm-hftn was found to be in good purity expected size and morphology its biological activity towards ace2 receptor was confirmed by elisa and the fusion protein rbm-hftn bodes well as potential vaccine and therapeutics against sars-cov-2 as ace2 receptor antagonist t ke holds ownership interest including patents in kunshan xinyunda biotech co ltd no potential conflicts of interests were disclosed by the other authors   molecular mechanisms behind anti sars-cov-2 action of lactoferrin mattia miotto lorenzo rienzo di leonardo b alberto boffi giancarlo ruocco edoardo milanetti  despite the huge effort to contain the infection the novel sars-cov-2 coronavirus has rapidly become pandemics mainly due to its extremely high human-to-human transmission capability and a surprisingly high viral charge of symptom-less people while the seek of a vaccine is still ongoing promising results have been obtained with antiviral compounds in particular lactoferrin is found to have beneficial effects both in preventing and soothing the infection here we explore the possible molecular mechanisms with which lactoferrin interferes with sars-cov-2 cell invasion preventing attachment andor entry of the virus to this aim we search for possible interactions lactoferrin may have with virus structural proteins and host receptors representing the molecular iso-electron surface of proteins in terms of 2d-zernike descriptors we i identified putative regions on the lactoferrin surface able to bind sialic acid receptors on the host cell membrane sheltering the cell from the virus attachment ii showed that no significant shape complementarity is present between lactoferrin and the ace2 receptor while iii two high complementarity regions are found on the n-and c-terminal domains of the sars-cov-2 spike protein hinting at a possible competition between lactoferrin and ace2 for the binding to the spike protein  lactoferrin lf is a versatile glycoprotein which plays a key role in many biological functions 1  in this work we focus on the lf as a crucial player in natural immunity since it has been proposed to play a strong antiviral activity against a wide range of rna and dna viruses 2 3 4 5 6  lf is composed of a single chain of about 700 residues folded into two symmetrical lobes each lobe possesses a metal-binding site able to bind iron but also other ions like cu 2  zn 2 and m n 3 7 8  this protein is present in saliva tears seminal fluid white blood cells and milk of mammals 9  from its discovery in 1939 10 11 lactoferrin has been identified as the most important iron-binding protein in milk besides in recent years lactoferrin has been found involved in a multitude of biological processes in fact despite the name the iron cargo capacity of lf is not the prominent activity exerted by this molecule instead it performs antioxidant anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities 8 12  together with a broad antimicrobial action against bacteria and fungi the latter activity in particular is due to lfs ability to reversibly bind two atoms of iron with high affinity in the presence of bicarbonate the iron-free form of lf apo-lactoferrin apolf deprives bacteria of iron thus inhibiting their metabolic activities in vivo besides all the aforementioned activities lf has been demonstrated to prevent infection of a wide range of diverse viral species 13  many viruses make use of glycans such as sialic acid sia or glycosaminoglycan like heparan sulfate hf as attachment factors see for example 14 for details on glycans when the contact between the virus particle and these receptors is established they roll toward their spe-cific viral receptor and subsequently enter the host cell for instance by fusing with the host cell membrane 15  while the interaction between lf and hf has been observed 16  studies on its interaction with sialic acid derivatives are still missing on the other hand lf has been reported to interact with virus structural proteins s m and e 17  in general depending on the specifics of the virus lactoferrin prevents infection of the target cell by either i interfering with the attachment factor or ii by binding to host cell molecules that the virus uses as a receptor or co-receptor competition or iii by direct binding to virus particles as described for herpesvirus 18  polioand rotavirus 19 20  and possibly human immunodeficiency virus 21  see for example 22 for a more detailed discussion while we are writing this article a novel virus first observed in the autumn of 2019 has rapidly become pandemic this virus called sars-cov-2 belongs to the coronavirus family and causes severe acute respiratory syndrome 23 24  somewhat similar to those caused by two other coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov which crossed species in 2002-2004 25 26 and 2012 27  in fact sars-cov-2 similarly to sars-cov and mers-cov attacks the lower respiratory system thus provoking viral pneumonia however this infection can also lead to effects on the gastrointestinal system heart kidney liver and central nervous system 24 28 29  as for sars-cov 30 31 32  recent in vivo experiments confirmed that also sars-cov-2 cell entry is mediated by high-affinity interactions between the receptorbinding domain rbd of the virus s glycoprotein and the human-host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor 33  the spike protein is located on the arxiv200707341v1 q-biobm 14 jul 2020 virus envelope and promotes the host attachment and fusion between the viral and cellular membrane 34 35  structural studies determined the structures of such protein both in free form and bound to ace2 36  further studies investigate the possible interaction of sars-cov-2 to sialic acids 37 38 39 40 or heparan surfate receptors 39  both considered involved in sars-cov-2 as well as in other coronavirus infections 14 16 41 42 43  while the use of lf as an antiviral against previous coronaviruses infections has been poorly investigated except for 16  where evidence of an effect in the attachment process is shown new studies are proving the antiviral effect of lactoferrin against the novel sars-cov-2 infection in particular administration of a liposomal formulation of lf to a significant sample of covid-19 positive patients has been shown to provide an immediate beneficial effect 44  here we computationally investigate the possible molecular mechanisms behind the observed antiviral action of lactoferrin in particular we make use of a recently developed computational protocol based on the 2d zernike polynomials able to rapidly characterize the shape conformation of given protein regions 37  in this framework using a simple pairwise distance it is possible to evaluate the similarity between 2 protein pockets or the shape complementarity between the binding regions of 2 interacting proteins in order to assess whether lactoferrin could influence the attachment factors we investigated the ability of lt to bind to sialic acid sia or heparan sulfate hs receptors 14  both considered involved in sars-cov-2 infection 37 38 39 40 as well as to other coronavirus infections 16 41 42 43  we moreover checked for a possible direct interaction between lf and ace2 receptor which could inhibit the interplay between spike and ace2 binding necessary to the virus infection finally we investigate the possible interaction between lf and the 3 proteins present on the sars-cov-2 membrane ie the spike s membrane m and envelope e proteins the entry of the virus inside the host cells requires the occurrence of a sequence of molecular interactions sialoside sia andor heparan sulfate hf chains mediate the attachment of the virion to the cell surface once in the proximity of the cellular receptor ace2 sars-cov-2 spike protein binds to the receptor and initiates the internalization process figure 1a shows a sketch of the mechanism the observed antiviral action of lf may consist of interference in one or more of those steps we thus investigate in the next three sections the possibility of direct binding between lactoferrin and sia ace2 and sars-cov-2 spike protein respectively see figure 1b  possible binding regions for sialic acid the terminal molecule of the sia receptors on human lactoferrin are investigated on the basis of the procedure described in 37  ie we select the portion of the molecular surface of the mers-cov spike protein in interaction with sialic acid experimentally solved in 45 figure 2a  and we search for similar patches on the lf molecular surface within the same strategy we search for similar patches on the surface of human lactoferrin in the 2d zernike framework the geometrical shape of a protein surface patch is compactly summarized in a set of ordered numerical descriptors whose number -121 in our case -modulate the detail of the description dealing with ordered numerical descriptors the comparison between different protein patch can be performed with a euclidean distance figure 2b and c show the four most geometrically similar patches identified in the apo and holo form of lf an a posteriori check of the electrostatic potential on the patches allows us to select only some of the possible solutions identified based on the shape comparison analysis ie the ones having also a similar electrostatic surface with the sia binding site on the mers-cov spike the region on lf surface identified as the most similar to the mers region interacting with sialic acid both in shape and in electrostatics is the one centered on val 346 to check whether the action of lactoferrin can be ascribed to a competition with the virion spike proteins in binding directly the ace2 receptor  figure 1  we performed a blind search of the molecular surfaces of both ace2 and human lf to identify possible binding regions having a meaningful shape complementarity under this hypothesis if the interaction between the lf and the ace2 receptor occurs lf could hinder the molecular binding between the spike protein of sars-cov-2 and the corresponding ace2 receptor figure 3 shows the molecular surface of the ace2 receptor colored according to its propensity to bind regions of the lf protein the redder the region the greater the shape complementarity between that region and another one found on the surface of the putative molecular partner ie holo lactoferrin as one can see from figure 3  a complementary region is indeed present however it is located far from the binding site of the spike grey in the figure and in a part of ace2 that looks toward the membrane to better visualize the result we have represented two points of view of the binding between spike and ace2 one rotated 180 o with respect to the other on the other hand we can see that the ace2 region interacting with the sars-cov-2 spike protein has no low shape complementarity with lf regions 1 competition for the binding with glycan chains andor 2 competition for binding ace2 receptor andor 3 direct interaction with one of the proteins in the virion envelope ie with s m or e proteins a third possible mechanism at the basis of the observed antiviral activity of lf could be ascribed to a direct interaction with the membrane proteins present on the virion envelope in particular sars-cov-2 presents three different kinds of proteins on its membrane ie s m and e proteins 46 47  while the 3d structure of the s protein has been determined -even if some loop regions in the s1 sub-unit are not solved -unfortunately no structures are available for the e and m proteins thus the molecular surfaces of lf were compared with those of the three proteins in order to check whether an interaction with lactoferrin is possible for this analysis we adopted the same computational procedure used in the previous paragraph for both s m and e proteins we sample their whole molecular surface and compared all the possible patches with those of lf in this way all molecular surfaces both membrane proteins and lf ones are colored according to the corresponding binding propensity e and m presented a possible region of interactions located in the intra-membrane region data not shown the most robust and relevant result of this analysis regards the compatibility between the spike and lactoferrin according to our findings lf presents two regions of high complementarity with one portion of the c-terminal domain of the spike s1 subunit and another located in the n-terminal part to test the reliability of the found signals we performed a molecular dynamics simulation of the spike trimer see methods for details and sampled 5 configurations for each of the three chains at equilibrium see in particular for each chain we performed a principal component analysis pca on the frames of the dynamics and thus projected them on the plane identified by the two principal components upon clustering these points we obtain 5 subgroups for each subgroup we extract the centroidal configuration since distant points in the pca plane correspond to the different 3d structure picking one point from each identified cluster assured that the selected configurations have high structural differences between them in the explored configuration space see figure 4b  remarkably repeating the blind search for complementarity regions on the 15 surfaces of the extracted spike monomers we found conservation of the signal over the conformational noise figure 4c shows the identified regions and their conservation in the different sampled frames among the found regions the one involving the spike c-terminal domain is the one with higher shape complementarity in particular according to our method human lactoferrin could interact with the spike protein with the surface region centered in residue ala 539 alternatively the spike protein may interact with the lf pro-tein using a molecular patch centered in the residue phe 490 it must be pointed out that the complementarity achieved by these patches is comparable with those of experimentally solved complexes indeed analyzing the shape complementarity of over 4600 x-ray protein-protein complexes see methods for details we have the distribution shown in figure 4d  where the lower the distance the higher the complementarity of the binding region red dotted line shows the complementarity found between the spike and lt as it is evident the proposed patch is characterized by values of shape complementarity typical of experimental complexes finally to further support this result with an independent and external methodology to our approach we performed a completely blind molecular docking analysis between the spike protein and the lf protein to this end zdock server was used as a state of the art of molecular docking software 48  as per default settings only the first 10 docking poses have been selected and the predicted contacts analyzed in particular five out of ten poses show bindings involving the spike region involve the region we found with our protocol when the residues are defined in contact if their c-alpha atoms have a distance less than 8  in the last decade the zernike formalism has been widely applied for the characterization of molecular surfaces 49 50 51 52 53  very recently we developed a new representation based on the 2d zernike polynomials which allows an extremely efficient fast and completely unsupervised description of the local geometrical shape allowing for easy comparison between different regions of molecules through this compact description it is possible both to analyze the similarity between 2 different regions -suggesting for example a similar ligand for binding regions -and to study the complementarity between interacting surfaces 37  here we used our novel method to shed some light on the molecular mechanisms ruling the observed antiviral action human lactoferrin exerts against sars-cov-2 infection 44  in particular we focused on the early stages of the infection ie the attachment and entry of the virus to the host cell when lactoferrin can interfere with the virushost interaction without the need to be internalized in the cell we thus tried to establish whether lactoferrin could compete with the virus in binding to sialic acid the sticky end of sialoside chains which has been suggested to mediate the attachment of sars-cov-2 to the host cell interestingly comparing the binding region of sialic acid in the mers-cov coronavirus with patches on the lactoferrin surface we found possible spots on both apo and holo forms of lf which could compete in forming low affinity but high avidity interactions we then proceeded to test the hypothesis of an inter-action between lactoferrin and the primary sars-cov-2 protein receptor ace2 a blind search for complementarity regions highlighted a hot-spot in a region that in physiological conditions is oriented toward the membrane while no significative complementarity is present in the ace2 region involved in the interaction with the virus spike protein at last we analyzed the three membrane proteins on the virus envelope ie the e m and s ones similarly to ace-2 both e and m presented possible interacting regions in portions of the surface that are buried in the virion membrane under normal conditions data not shown on the other hand the spike protein showed two main hot spots one in the n-terminal domain of the s1 subunit and another in the c-terminal one those two regions are robust to molecular noise as the signal endures using different configurations sampled from a molecular dynamics simulation and each of the three chains of the trimer notably the most complementary region is the one in the c-terminal region the one involved in the spike-ace2 interaction thus our finding suggests a possible competition between ace2 and lactoferrin for the binding of the sars-cov-2 spike which may explain the observed antiviral action the protein whose structures are analyzed in this paper are  human lactoferrin in the apo pdb id 1cb6 and holo pdb id 1lfg forms  ace2 in its apo state pdb id 1r42  sars-cov-2 s protein modeled using i-tasser 54   sars-cov-2 m protein modeled using i-tasser 54   sars-cov-2 e protein modeled using i-tasser 54  to set a reference for the measured complementarities a dataset of protein-protein complexes experimentally solved in x-ray crystallography is taken from 55  we only selected pair interactions regarding chains with more than 50 residues the protein-protein dataset is therefore composed of 4605 complexes for each complex the binding region is identified as the portions of the two protein molecular surfaces distant less than 3 for each protein of the dataset x-ray structure in pdb format 56  we use dms 57 to compute the solventaccessible surface using a density of 5 points per 2 and trimer chains rmsd each residue of the proteins is colored from white to red according to its increasing shape complementarity with the partner d comparison between the complementarity score red dashed line of the best binding site zernike disks and the distribution of complementarity scores belonging to 4600 binding regions of experimental complexes a water probe radius of 14 the unit normals vector for each point of the surface was calculated using the flag n a molecular surface is represented by a set of points in the three-dimensional space we define a surface patch as the group of points that fall within a sphere of radius r s  6 centered on one point of the surface once the patch is selected  we fit a plane that passes through the points and reorient the patch in such a way to have the z-axis perpendicular to the plane and going through the center of the plane  we define the angle  as the largest angle between the perpendicular axis and a secant connecting a given point c on the z-axis to any point of the patch c is then set in order that   45   r is the distance between c and a surface point  build a square grid and associate each pixel with the mean r of the points inside it this 2d function can be expanded on the basis of the zernike polynomials see next section once a patch is represented in term of its zernike descriptors the similarity between that patch and another one can be simply measured as the euclidean distance between the invariant vectors the relative orientation of the patches before the projection in the unitary circle must be considered in fact if we search for similar regions we must compare patches that have the same orientation once projected in the 2d plane ie the solventexposed part of the surface must be oriented in the same direction for both patches for example as the positive z-axis if instead we want to assess the complementarity between two patches we must orient the patches contrariwise ie one patch with the solvent-exposed part toward the positive z-axis up and the other toward the negative z-axis down each function of two variables f r  polar coordinates defined inside the region r  1 unitary circle can be decomposed in the zernike basis as with being the expansion coefficients while the complex functions z nm r  are the zernike polynomials each polynomial is composed by a radial and an angular part where the radial part for any n and m is given by since for each couple of polynomials the following relation holds z nm z n m   n  1  nn  mm 5 the complete set of polynomials forms a basis and knowing the set of complex coefficients c nm  allows for a univocal reconstruction of the original image with a resolution that depends on the order of expansion n  maxn since the modulus of each coefficient z nm  c nm  does not depend on the phase ie it is invariant for rotations around the origin of the unitary circle the shape similarity between two patches can be assessed by comparing the zernike invariants of their associated 2d projections in particular we measured the similarity between patch i and j as the euclidean distance between the invariant vectors ie the starting structure of the sars-cov-2 spike trimeric complex was taken from the model structure proposed by the i-tasser server 54  all steps of the simulation were performed using gromacs 20193 58  topologies of the system were built using the charmm-27 force field 59  the protein was placed in a dodecahedric simulative box with periodic boundary conditions filled with 131793 tip3p water molecules 60  we checked that each atom of the trimer was at least at a distance of 11 nm from the box borders the addition of 3 sodium counterions rendered the systems electroneutral the final system consisting of 448572 atoms was first minimized with 2064 steps of steepest descent relaxation of water molecules and thermalization of the system in nvt and npt environments were run each for 01 ns at 2 fs time-step the temperature was kept constant at 300 k with v-rescale algorithm 61  the final pressure was fixed at 1 bar with the parrinello-rahman algorithm 62 which guarantees a water density of 1004 kgm 3  close to the experimental value lincs algorithm 63 was used to constraint h-bonds finally the systems were simulated with a 2 fs timestep for 140 ns in periodic boundary conditions using a cut-off of 12 for the evaluation of short-range non-bonded interactions and the particle mesh

a very wide range of severity from asymptomatic carriage to mild respiratory tract infection and severe to fatal pneumonia singhal 2020 besides this sars-cov-2 is characterized by very high morbidity

cov uses its spike s glycoprotein 180 kda to bind its receptor and mediate membrane fusion and virus entry indeed s proteins are typical homo trimeric class i fusion proteins and protease cleavage is required for activation of the fusion potential of s protein a two-step sequential protease cleavage starts with activation of s proteins covs which involves prime cleavage between two subunits ie s1

wrapp et al 2020 the affinity with which ace-2 bounds to sars-cov-2 s ectodomain is 10- to 20-fold higher than ace-2 binding to sars-cov s due to the high binding affinity of sars-cov-2 s for human ace-2 the sars-cov-2 exhibits greater ability to transmit from person-to-person wan et al 2020 furthermore the genomic rna acting as a messenger rna mrna has been found to play a critical role in the

prajapati  patel 2015 yang et al 2017 was carried out in pubchem database the resulting 3d structures in sdf file format were directly used in the generation of input pdbqt files for autodock vina the 2d format of all molecules were downloaded and transformed to 3d coordinates and subsequently optimized with openbabel232 gui the molecular docking simulation study was performed on the autodock vina program trott  olson 2010 which is the most widely used and trusted steadfast open-source docking simulation tool recently submitted two crystal structure of sars-cov-2 ie spike glycoprotein pdb id 6vsb wrapp et al 2020 and non-structural protein 15 pdb id 6w01 kim et al 2020 were downloaded from the research collaboratory for structural bioinformatics-protein databank rcsb-pdb both crystal structures were prepared using autodock tools adt morris et al 2009 by repairing the missing atoms the addition of polar hydrogens and the gastigier charges finally both structures were saved in the pdbqt format after assigning the ad4 autodock 4 morris et al 2009 atom type to select the binding site of both proteins the already available information was considered the region around the bound citric acid in the nsp15 was considered as the active site in the case of spike glycoprotein it is mentioned that amino acid residues in a range of 319 to 591 recombinantly expressed and measures the ace2 binding using biolayer interferometry wrapp et al 2020 hence the coordinate of ser325 amino residue was considered as the position of the grid box to confine the active site of the protein molecule the grid box information was obtained from the adt with the help of above information in case of pdb id 6w01 grid box was generated around the bound citric acid having co-ordinate of 63624 72524 and 28280 for -x -y and -z-axis respectively on the other hand for pdb id 6vsb the grid coordinate was considered as 204457 199799 and 246898 along the x- y- and z-axis respectively the grid box size for both crystal structures was determined by manual inspection and set as 50x50x50 the configuration file was created by adding the grid receptor and ligand information before the execution of molecular docking to adjudge the molecular docking study two standard drug molecules lopinavir and rivabirin cao et al 2020 were considered as control molecules throughout the study in recent past a number of findings have been reported the efficacy of lopinavir a protease inhibitor and ribavirin a nucleoside analogue in suppressing the shedding of sars-cov-2 hung et al 2020 lim et al 2020 sheahan et al 2020 all 20 phytochemicals along with above two drug molecules were also prepared by adding polar hydrogen and gasteiger charges in adt each molecule was saved as pdbqt format for autodock vina input after detection and set of torsion angles the molecular docking outcomes were analyzed based on binding energy and binding interactions profile highest binding energy among the drugs was used as a threshold to select the best phytochemicals for both the receptors the binding interactions between ligands and the receptor were assessed through the protein-ligand interaction profile plip salentin et al 2015 molecular dynamics md simulation study is one the crucial and effective tools to explore the dynamic nature of the protein-ligand complex and the relative stability the highest binding affinity scorer ligand in respect to each protein ie glycyrrhizic acid for spike glycoprotein and glyasperin a for nsp15 endoribonuclease complex with respective protein was selected for further md simulation study the md simulation was done on gromacs-20182 software tool wwwgromacsorg installed at the lengau chpc server cape town south africa this study was performed for 100 ns with a 2fs of time step at a 1 atm constant pressure and 300 k constant temperature to generate the protein topology the all-atoms charmm36 force field was considered during the study each protein-ligand complex system was created within the cubic box of 1  from the center of the system the system was solvated by the tip3p water model sufficient numbers of na and cl ions were added to neutralize the simulation system and further minimized the system by employing the steepest descent algorithm of 10000 steps to address the long-range distances the van der waals and electrostatic interaction cutoff range were set to 09 and 14 nm respectively the swissparam tool daina et al 2017 was used to generate ligand topology after each of 1ps interval the trajectory information was saved for further analysis the entire system was equilibrated through the nvt constant number of particles volume and temperature followed by npt constant number of particles pressure and temperature ensemble approaches to distribute the solvent and ions equally around the protein-ligand complex further root-mean-square deviation rmsd root-mean-square fluctuation rmsf and radius of gyration rg were calculated to determine the molecular complex stability in terms of conformation and performance the binding free energy was then determined through the molecular mechanics poisson-boltzmann surface area mm-pbsa method with the help of gmmpbsa tool islam  pillay 2019 2020 theory and details of this method have been given in our previous publication bhowmick et al 2019 parida et al 2020 the structure-based screening is one of the crucial approaches to explore small to large molecular databases to find promising molecules for a specific target in the current study an effort was taken to find out anti-spike glycoprotein and nsp15 endoribonuclease molecules from a set of 20 phytochemicals through molecular docking and md simulation studies the flow diagram of the work is given in figure 1 the binding site of the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein was considered around the ser325 which is already reported as active site residue yu et al 2020 in the case of nsp15 endoribonuclease the binding site was selected around the co-crystal ligand all 20 phytochemicals along with lopinavir and ribavirin were docked in the spike glycoprotein and nsp15 endoribonuclease details of each of phytochemicals and binding energies against the spike glycoprotein and nsp15 endoribonuclease are given in table s1 supplementary file the binding energy of lopinavir and ribavirin was found to be 74 and 56 kcalmol respectively when docked in the spike glycoprotein moreover the lopinavir and ribavirin were docked in the nsp15 endoribonuclease and binding energy was found to be 83 and 66 kcalmol respectively to select best phytochemical the threshold binding energy for spike glycoprotein and nsp15 endoribonuclease was considered as 74 and 83 kcalmol respectively from table s1 supplementary file it can be seen that cid14982 cid503737 cid5481963 and cid6442433 were satisfied above criteria for both spike glycoprotein and nsp15 endoribonuclease moreover cid480775 and cid10473311 were found to have binding energy less than 830 on docking in the nsp15 endoribonuclease hence cid14982 cid503737 cid5481963 and cid6442433 were found to be promising molecules for both enzymes in addition to the above cid480775 and cid10473311 were found promising against nsp15 endoribonuclease two-dimensional representation of all six promising molecules is given in figure 2 all the above proposed final molecules were found structurally diverse all molecules consist of several pharmacophoric features including hydrogen bond hb acceptor hba hb donor hbd hydrophobic hy etc those might be crucial for potential binding interactions with the catalytic amino acids at the active site in brief the hbd and hba features in cid14982 figure 3 were found crucial in hydrogen bond interactions with gln298 his625 gln321 and arg319 while the hy region was found to be important in the interaction with ile624 and val620 residues in the spike glycoprotein in the case of nsp15 endoribonuclease of the sars-cov-2 the hbd and hba features were revealed as important in interactions with residues tyr343 his235 his250 while the hydrophobic interactions formed with residues tyr343 likewise the hbd hba aromatic ring features in the other five compounds figure 3 were found to be crucial for the interactions with similar residues at the binding site of both the proteins to further assess the binding interactions of each of the molecule were explored with respective enzymes the stability of the molecules inside the protein was explored through all-atoms md simulation finally the binding free energy was calculated through the mm-pbsa approach all four proposed spike glycoprotein inhibitors along with lopinavir and ribavirin were docked in the spike glycoprotein and binding interactions are given in figure 4 on successful docking the complex between spike glycoprotein and lopinavir was explored and found that the lopinavir properly positioned into the catalytic site assembled by arg273

hydroxymethyl group of tetrahydrofuran with glu298 ser316 and the hydroxyl group of tetrahydrofuran with ala623 amino acid with binding energy 56 kcalmol the triazole ring of ribavirin formed - perpendicular stacking with his625 docking study on the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein revealed that the glycyrrhizic acid cid14982 exhibited the best binding mode among all the ligand and standard drugs it was properly positioned into the binding pocket of spike glycoprotein constructed by his625 glu298 arg319 gln321 gln321 val320 tyr343 thr323 ile624 and asn317 amino acids with a binding energy of 92 kcalmol the glycyrrhizic acid has two oxane tetrahydropyran ring substituted with five hydroxyl and two carboxyl groups buried properly into the binding pocket of s1 subunit and showed h-bonding with his625 glu298 arg319 gln321 val320 and three -cation interaction with his625 it also has 7 methyl groups which provide a proper grip between hydrophobic pockets the equal distribution of polar ie 5 -oh and 2 -cooh group and non-polar ie 7 methyl group provide a good balance between hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity cid14982 in figure 4 the hydroxyl group of chromenone ring of glyasperin a cid5481963 showed h-bonding with val620 val320 carboxy of chromenone ring with gln321 and other hydroxyl groups of the phenyl ring with glu298 amino acid residue with binding energy 79 kcalmol cid5481963 in figure 4 the liquiritin cid503737 has chromenone ring substituted by hydroxyl group showed h-bonding with gln321 the carboxyl group of chromenone ring with val620 and the hydroxyl group of oxane moiety with cys291 his625 amino acid residues with a binding energy of 77 kcalmol cid503737 in figure 4 the phenyl ring substituted by hydroxyl group showed h-bonding with gln321 val320 the hydroxyl group of oxane ring with glu298 his625 the hydroxyl group of a furan ring with glu298 and carboxyl group of isoliquiritinapioside cid6442433 showed h-bonding with val620 amino acid residue with a binding energy of 74 kcalmol cid6442433 in figure 4 from the above observations it can be explained that all proposed molecules for the spike glycoprotein hold similar or better binding interactions in comparison to the both lopinavir and ribavirin the binding mode in three-dimensional space of all molecules were extracted which are given in figure 5 it can be seen that all molecules perfectly fitted inside the receptor cavity of spike glycoprotein the important amino residues and their involvement in binding interactions with spike glycoprotein inhibitors are given in table 2 best six phytochemicals found through virtual screening were docked in the nsp15 endoribonuclease and binding energy is given in table 1 important amino acids found in binding interaction formation with proposed molecules are given in table 3 both standard lopinavir and ribavirin was docked and binding energy found to be 83 and 66 kcalmol respectively lopinavir was properly positioned into the catalytic site constructed by his235 thr341 glu340 tyr343 trp333 and lys345 amino acids with a binding energy of 83 kcalmol pyrimidine of lopinavir showed h-bonding with glu340 and carboxyl with his235 thr341 the phenyl ring of lopinavir formed - parallel stacking with trp333 and - perpendicular stacking with tyr343 figure 6 ribavirin was found to interact into the binding pocket with a binding energy of 66 kcalmol figure 6 the simulation study on the crystal structure of nsp15 endoribonuclease revealed that glyasperin a cid5481963 have chromenone ring substituted with three hydroxyl and 3-methylbut-2-enyl group and a phenyl ring which is substituted with a hydroxyl and a 3-methylbut-2-enyl group showed h-bonding with tyr343 lys290 leu346 asn278 and lys345 with a binding energy of 92 kcalmol figure 6 glyasperin a showed the highest stable binding mode ie lowest binding energy among all the docked test ligand and standard drug lopinavir and ribavirin glyasperin b c and d have 2 4-dihydroxy phenyl ring attached to chromen ring but in glyasperin a one hydroxy of phenyl is substituted with a 3-methylbut-2-enyl group at 3rd position which showed additional hydrophobic interaction with phe269 and val292 due to which glyasperin a exhibited better binding affinity the isoliquiritinapioside cid6442433 have furan ring substituted with hydroxyl group showed h-bonding with glu340 asp240 and ser294 showed  stacking and hydrophobic interaction with isoliquiritinapioside figure 6 90 kcalmol the hydroxyl group of chromenone ring of liquiritin cid503737 showed h-bonding with leu346 asn278 leu246 lys290 gln245 two -cation interactions with lys290 his235 amino acid residues 88 kcalmol figure 6 the hydroxyl group of chromene ring of dehydroglyasperin c cid480775 showed h-bonding with ser294 val292 and thr341 his250 with a binding energy of 84 kcalmol the phenyl ring of dehydroglyasperin c formed - parallel stacking with tyr343 and - perpendicular stacking with trp333 figure 6 structure of dehydroglyasperin c has resembled with glyasperin a but due to lack of one 3-methylbut-2-enyl group on phenyl ring decreases its hydrophobic interaction and also a binding affinity with protein the glycyrrhizic acid cid14982 have oxane ring-substituted with hydroxyl and carboxyl groups exhibited h-bonding with ser294 cys291 his250 and thr341 amino acids with binding energy 83 kcalmol and three -cation interactions with lys290 his235 his250 figure 6 licochalcone d showed h-bonding with lys290 asn278 gly248 leu346 his250 pro344 83 kcalmol and phenyl

active site located between the two -sheets carries residues lys290 tyr343 his235 the lys290 in which his235 has been proposed to constitute the catalytic triad and tyr343 is believed to govern uridyl specificity moreover a us patent us005843990a signifies the use of pyran-chromenone compounds in inhibiting the growth or replication of a viruses which is not limited to herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 hiv-1 hiv-2 cytomegalovirus varicella zoster virus papillomavirus feline leukaemia virus avian sarcoma viruses like hepatitis types a-e rous sarcoma virus influenza virus measles rubella and mumps viruses baker 1998 the position of the binding pose in three-dimensional space figure 7 was clearly explained all six molecules perfectly fitted inside the receptor cavity of nsp15 endoribonuclease the protein backbone rmsd is one of the critical parameters obtained from the protein-ligand complex which gives the overall information about the stability and insight into the structural conformation in the dynamic states during the md simulation the system equilibration in terms of stability can be explained through the rmsd analysis the lower range of rmsd along with consistent variation throughout the simulation can be inferred the stability of the protein backbone on the other hand the higher rmsd and or high fluctuation to the native structure indicates comparatively low stability of the protein-ligand complex it is always preferable to accept the protein biomolecule with the lower range of rmsd but higher deviated rmsd can also be acceptable which might indicate that the protein is probably undergoing large or some sort of conformational change during the simulation the rmsd of each frame for both complexes was calculated and it is given in figure 8 the average maximum and minimum rmsd values of both complexes are given in table 4 the average rmsd value was found to be 1149 and 0231 nm for the backbone of spike glycoprotein and nsp15 endoribonuclease respectively it is also important to note that not a single frame of glycoprotein and nsp15 endoribonuclease backbone was deviated higher than 1531 and 0350 nm in comparison to the respective native structure when bound with glycyrrhizic acid and glyasperin a respectively on close inspection it can be seen that spike glycoprotein backbone bound with glycyrrhizic acid fluctuated from beginning to about 20 ns and afterwards it was equilibrated until the end of the simulation a similar pattern was also observed in case of nsp15 endoribonuclease backbone bound with glyasperin a above observation clearly explained the stability of the protein-ligand complexes during the all-atoms md simulation the individual amino residue in the protein-ligand complex plays a critical role in complex stability the fluctuation of the amino residues can be inferred by the rmsf parameter which explains the average deviation of each amino residue over time from the reference position more precisely it can be said that it analyzes the specific part of the protein structure that are fluctuating from its mean structure the amino acid or group of amino acids with high rmsf value indicate the greater flexibility attained by the complex whereas lower rmsf indicates lesser flexibility for the complex the rmsf of individual amino residues of both glycoprotein and nsp15 endoribonuclease bound glycyrrhizic acid and glyasperin a is given in figure 9 the average maximum and minimum rmsf values are given in table 4 the average rmsf was found to be 0634 and 0148 nm for spike glycoprotein and nsp15 endoribonuclease respectively in case of spike glycoprotein bound with glycyrrhizic the amino acids were found consistent except in the range 200 to 500 the fluctuation of the above amino acids might be due to lack of inter- and intra-molecular binding interactions on the other hand the rmsf plot of amino acids belongs to the nsp 15 endoribonuclease bound with glyasperin a was found consistent due to the free end of both proteins the end amino acid was found to fluctuate highest in comparison to others the compactness and rigidity of the protein-ligand complexes can be assessed through the rg parameter obtained from md simulation trajectory it can be defined as the mass-weighted root-mean-square distance of a collection of atoms from their common center of mass baig et al 2014 therefore the overall dimensions and the alteration in the macromolecular structure during the md simulation can be explored by the rg parameter the rg values for each frame of both complexes were calculated and plotted against the time simulation and it is given in figure 10 moreover to explore in more details the average maximum and minimum rg values were calculated and showed in table 4 the rg value was varied from 4104 and 4877 nm and 2193 and 2320 nm for the spike glycoprotein and nsp15 endoribonuclease respectively the rg parameter of the spike glycoprotein system bound with glycyrrhizic acid was gradually decreasing from about 48 nm and finally equilibrated around 2 nm in the case of nsp15 endoribonuclease bound with glyasperin a the rg was consistent throughout the simulation except for few fluctuations around 40 ns hence the trend of rg plot against the time simulation and low fluctuation of the same undoubtedly explain that residual backbone and folding of both spike glycoprotein and nsp15 endoribonuclease have remained consistent after binding with glycyrrhizic acid and glyasperin a respectively the binding energy calculated through the mm-pbsa approach is considered to be more accurate than binding energy calculated by any other means including molecular docking the binding energy of any small molecule can give an idea about the affection towards the macromolecule to explore the affinity of both glycyrrhizic acid and glyasperin a towards the glycoprotein and nsp15 endoribonuclease respectively the binding free energy was calculated from the entire trajectory of md simulation through the mm-gpbsa approach higher negative binding energy explains more affinity towards the receptor the binding free energy of each molecule was plotted against the time of simulation and it is given in figure 11 the average minimum and maximum binding energy of all frames were also calculated and it is given in table 4 from table 4 it can be seen that average binding free energy was found to be 331723 kjmol and 124036 kjmol for glycyrrhizic and glyasperin a respectively in the case of glycyrrhizic few frames at the beginning of the md simulation were found with positive binding energy but after about 7 ns all frames showed high negative value new orientation and conformation gained by the complex after 7 ns might be the reason for change binding energy of the molecule the binding free energy of glyasperin a was found to be almost constant throughout the simulation not a single frame was found to have positive binding free energy hence the binding energy of both molecules suggests that glycyrrhizic and glyasperin a possess a strong affinity to inhibit the spike glycoprotein and nsp15 endoribonuclease respectively the pharmacoinformatics approaches such as molecular docking and md simulation studies were carried out to explore a set of molecules belong to the natural products all the selected molecules including two anti-viral drugs lopinavir and rivabirin were docked in the covid-19 targets such as spike glycoprotein and nsp15 endoribonuclease the binding energies from the molecular docking study and binding interaction were explored in details several crucial amino residues were found to interact with all the molecules a total of six phytochemicals were found promising compounds based on comparative analysis of binding interactions and binding energy with lopinavir and ribavirin against spike glycoprotein and nsp15 endoribonuclease further high binding energy scored one molecule from each of spike glycoprotein glycyrrhizic acid and nsp15 endonuclease glyasperin a were used for the md simulation in complex with the respective target molecule many parameters were calculated from the md simulation and found that both molecules were retained inside the protein in the dynamic states finally the binding free energy of both molecules was calculated from the md simulation trajectories high negative binding free energy value of both molecules substantiated their strong affinity towards the target molecule it can be concluded that that glyasperin a might block the nsp15 endoribonuclease activity with uridine specificity and glycyrrhizic acid connect well with the widespread binding pocket of spike glycoprotein due to its bulky nature moreover it can be said that the glycyrrhizic acid disturbed the connection of the virus with ace-2 receptor at entry-level and after entry into host cell glyasperin a inhibits the replication process of the virus hence both proposed molecules might be important molecules to control the covid-19 subjected to experimental validation  virtual screening of plant metabolites against main protease rna-dependent rna polymerase and spike protein of sars-cov-2 therapeutics option of covid-19 virtual screening of plant metabolites against main protease rna-dependent rna polymerase and spike protein of sars-cov-2 therapeutics option of covid-19 sorwer alam parvez 1amp kazi azim faizul abdus shukur imran topu raihan aklima begum tasfia saiyara shammi sabbir howlader farhana bhuiyan rumzum mahmudul hasan  covid-19 a serious respiratory complications caused by sars-cov-2 has become one of the global threat to human healthcare system the present study evaluated the possibility of plant originated approved 117 therapeutics against the main protease protein mpp rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp and spike protein s of sars-cov-2 including drug surface analysis by using molecular docking through drug repurposing approaches the molecular interaction study revealed that rifampin -163 kcalmol were topmost inhibitor of mpp where azobechalcone were found most potent plant therapeutics for blocking the rdrp -159 kcal mol and s -144 kcalmol protein of sars-cov-2 after the comparative analysis of all docking results azobechalcone rifampin isolophirachalcone tetrandrine and fangchinoline were exhibited as the most potential inhibitory plant compounds for targeting the key proteins of sars-cov-2 however amino acid positions h41 c145 and m165 of mpp played crucial roles for the drug surface interaction where f368 l371 l372 a375 w509 l514 y515 were pivotal for rdrp in addition the drug interaction surface of s proteins also showed similar patterns with all of its maximum inhibitors adme analysis also strengthened the possibility of screened plant therapeutics as the potent drug candidates against sars-c with the highest drug friendliness  covid-19 pandemic situation has tremendously turned the entire world into a place of horrible death tragedy sars-cov-2 initially named as 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov by the world health organization who is the causative agent of the recent serious respiratory complications resulting the covid-19 pandemic 1 2 3 4  though the symptoms of covid-19 infection appear after an incubation period of approximately 52 days the period from the onset of covid-19 symptoms to death ranged from 6 to 41 days with a median of 14 days 5 6  it has already completed its world tour and around 213 countries are now experiencing the deadly scene occurred by covid-19 including 41 52670 infected patients and 2 84536 global death cases till 12th may 2020 7  the scientific community is racing to explore the effective remedy against this severe health complications but till to date there are no any potential therapeutics have been approved for clinical use 8  there have been few key proteins of sars-cov-2 that could be targeted as the vaccine or drug surface 9  similar to sars and mers non-structural proteins eg 3-chymotrypsin-like protease coronavirus main protease papain-like protease helicase and rna-dependent rna polymerase structural proteins eg spike glycoprotein and accessory proteins were investigated in the genome of sars-cov-2 where non-structural proteins constitute two-thirds of the entire genome 10  among the structural proteins nucleocapsid n protein is prerequisite for rna genome assembly where membrane m and envelope e proteins are associated in viral assembly in the host environment 11  moreover spike s protein is mainly responsible for the viral entry into the host cell and that is why spike protein is now being considered as a major therapeutic target for drug and vaccines against sars-cov-2 12  again the s protein interaction with the human ace2 interface has been revealed at the atomic level and the efficiency of ace2 usage was found to be a main factor of coronavirus transmissibility in human to human 13  on the contrary coronavirus main protease m pro or 3c-like proteinase 3clp was reported for their ability to cleave the polyproteins into individual polypeptides that are required for replication and transcription 14  the 3clp is autocleaved initially from the polyproteins to become a mature enzyme leading the translation of the messenger rna 15  then the 3clp cleaves all the 11 downstream non-structural proteins as 3clp plays a vital role in the replication cycle of virus in the host it has been reported as the attractive target against the human sars virus 16  rna-dependent rna polymerase other key target protein of sars-cov-2 catalyses the synthesis of viral rna possibly with the support of other non-structural proteins as co-factors 17 18 19  the computational drug repurposing method could allow the immediate search of potential antiviral therapy in case of re-emergence of viral infections as like as covid-19 pandemic situation 20 21 22  computational drug repurposing has already been used to identify promising drug candidates for other virus associated diseases like dengue ebola zika and influenza infections 23 24  most importantly the sars-cov-2 has shown evolutionary convergent relations with sars-cov and mers-cov and the drug repurposing methods were also applied to sars-cov and mers-cov 25 26 27  hence extensive in silico studies were performed to identify potential drug candidates for example prulifloxacin bictegravir nelfinavir and tegobuvi were identified as repurposing candidates against covid-19 by looking for drugs with high binding capacity with sars-cov main protease 28  again nelfinavir an hiv-1 protease inhibitor was also predicted to be a potential inhibitor of covid-19 main protease by another computational-based study 29  however secondary metabolites from plant origin are found to show effective defence mechanism against different deadly pathogens and they have been widely used for conventional remedy to treat a wide range of human diseases since the ancient period of human civilization 30 31 32  in this pandemic situation researchers are trying find out the effective solution against covid-19 where plant metabolites could be a promising wings for screening out potential drug candidates even few plant secondary metabolites have already been reported as effective against other coronaviruses 33 34  in the present study a total of 117 plant based drug compound were screened out to check their potentiality for blocking the three important key proteins of sars-cov-2 the main protease proteins rna-dependent rna polymerase and spike protein of sars-cov-2 were employed to molecular docking study with the repurposed drug candidates from plant origin for find out the better drug option towards the covid-19 pandemic protein and acquisition of potential natural therapeutics pdb structures of sars-cov-2 main protease proteins 6lu7 6y2e rna-dependent rna polymerase 6m71 and spike protein 6vyb were retrieved from rcsb protein data bank 35  moreover a total 117 plant based drugs were collected from pubchem database supplementary table   1  alpha-ketoamide cid 6482451 were also retrieved from the pubchem database database httpspubchemncbinlmnihgov of ncbi 36  molecular docking is an effective approach for screening out potential therapeutics against specific drug-targets of deadly pathogens 37 38  the crystal structure of retrieved sars-cov-2 proteins complexed with inhibitors were refined by pymol v20 software 39  unwanted molecules ie water ions inhibitors were removed from the viral retrieved viral protein and further employed to molecular docking experiment with 117 natural therapeutics autodock vina software 40 to analyse the binding affinity and interactive amino acids alpha-ketoamide an inhibitor sars-cov-2 main protease protein were used as a positive control in this study 41 and also docked against the target proteins of sars-cov-2 the default parameters for grid box were set to 62 a x 71 a x 60 a x y and z and center -25389 a x 15333 a x 56865 a x y and z to perform the action moreover 2d ligand-protein interaction diagrams were generated by ligplot find out the involved amino acids with their interactive position were identified in the docked complexes 42  the ligand molecules interactions with the viral proteins were visualize and analyzed by discovery studio 43 and pymol v20 software 44  the drug surface hotspot of sars-cov-2 proteins were identified by analysing the docked structures of each protein with the top most natural therapeutics by ligplot pymol v20 and discovery studio software binding patterns of azobechalcone rifampin isolophirachalcone tetrandrine fangchinoline with sars-cov-2 proteins and the results were allowed for the comparative structural analysis of screened natural therapeutics furthermore interactions of alpha-ketoamide with the studied proteins were also investigated the adme absorption distribution metabolism and excretion properties of top drug candidates were analysed by swissadme server 45  the pharmacokinetics drug-likeness property and medicinal chemistry were assessed 46  default

consensus log pow pharmacokinetics parameters log kp skin permeation and water solubility of the probable drug candidates 47  the inhibition effects of these natural therapeutics with different cytochromes p450s cyp2c9 cyp2c19 cyp1a2 cyp3a4 cyp2d6 were also studied in addition admetsar and osiris property explorer were employed to evaluate the toxic or undesired effects ie mutagenicity tumerogenecity of the compounds 48 49 50  all of the retrieved natural therapeutics were employed for molecular docking against mpp rdrp and spike protein of sars-cov-2 supplementary table 2  the scoring function of autodock vina was utilized to predict the interaction between the ligands therapeutics and the proteins the top five inhibitors for each protein was identified based on their free binding energy results showed that rifampin had the highest negative binding energy -163 kcalmol among top mpp inhibitors table   1  azobechalcone -146 kcalmol isolophirachalcone -13 kcalmol amentoflavone -128 kcalmol and cepharanthine -127 kcalmol docked with the mpp of sars-cov-2 were also exhibited topmost place with a higher negative binding energy -127 kcalmol as well table 1  while interacting with rdrp of sars-cov-2 the most negative binding energy was scored by azobechalcone -159 kcal mol following by rifampin -156 kcalmol tetrandrine -139 kcalmol biflavone -137 kcalmol biflavone -137 kcalmol  table 2  moreover azobechalcone rifampin isolophirachalcone fangchinoline and tetrandrine were found to be top most natural inhibitors for the spike protein of sars-cov-2 azobechalcone required lowest energy -144 kcalmol to interact with the spike protein while rifampin isolophirachalcone fangchinoline and tetrandrine scored -137 kcalmol  -128 kcalmol -126 kcalmol and -125 kcalmol respectively table 3  however azobechalcone rifampin isolophirachalcone tetrandrine and fangchinoline were found to be most effective inhibitory natural compounds when the docking results were compared for all three sars-cov-2 proteins figure 2 and table 4  all of these plant based natural inhibitors required minimum energy not more than -123 kcalmol to interact with the studied protein molecules the docking pattern and interacting amino acid residues with their respective position were analyzed to unravel the binding sites of studied sars-cov-2 proteins rifampin were involved with the amino acid h41 n142 s144 c145 h163 m165 e166 d187 r188 q189 of mpp of sars-cov-2  figure 2  the position of h41 c145 and m165 were also crucial for the binding of amentoflavone however an additional residue t430 were involved in case of isolophirachalcone table 3  p426 d428 t430 p463 f464 and f515 were also critical for binding pattern of rifampin and sars-cov-2 spike protein the most potent mpp rdrp and spike protein inhibitors azobechalcone rifampin isolophirachalcone tetrandrine and fangchinoline were investigated in the spheres of physicochemical parameters lipophilicity pharmacokinetics and water solubility table 5  lipophilicity partition coefficient between n-octanol and water log pow were also calculated by using five widely available predictive models xlogp3 wlogp mlogp silicos-it ilogp gi absorption was lower for all the drug candidates azobechalcone rifampin isolophirachalcone tetrandrine and fangchinoline molecules had no repressive action with the p450 cyp isoforms cyp1a2 cyp2c19 cyp2c9 cyp2d6 cyp3a4 moreover no permeant bbb exists among the protein inhibitors of mpp rdrp and spike the compounds sowed water solubility from moderate to high level ie 130e-16 mgml 150e-02 mgml 118e-10 mgml 978e 09 mgml 461e-08 mgml respectively  table 5  the toxicity analysis of these inhibitors showed that there were no carcinogenic effect and organ toxicity however rifampin tetrandrine and fangchinoline were slightly positive in terms of mutagenesis though azobechalcone and isolophirachalcone inhibitors were completely negative among the top five inhibitors azobechalcone was listed in the acute oral toxicity category 2 and rest of them were listed in the category 3 global pandemic caused by sars-cov-2 has become a major concern due to its excessive infection rate and lethality 51 52 53 54  despite huge research regarding the pathogen no drugs or vaccine has proven satisfactory to combat infections caused by sars-cov-2 55 56  several investigational drugs exist however none of these could treat the patients unquestionably moreover lack of rapid detection procedures made sars-cov-2 diagnosis troublesome 57  computational approach and drug repurposing strategies hold promise to face such challenges caused by sars-cov-2 hence in the present study attempts were taken to suggest probable drug candidates by checking the efficacy of natural inhibitors to inhibit the key proteins of sars-cov-2 the race against the covid-19 pandemic has allowed the drug repurposing through virtual for finding drugs that could be used for the treatment of covid-19 recent studies prioritized mpp inhibitors of sars-cov-2 ie alpha-ketoamide hydroxy remdesivir chloroquine and favipiravir to evaluate their potency as drug 58 59 60  several in silico approach was also adopted to screen putative drug candidates against sars-cov-2 61 62  however all these experiments used either main protease proteins or rna-dependent rna polymerase of sars-cov-2 as probable drug targets in this study we screened potential natural therapeutics against sars-cov-2 mpp rdrp and spike protein by molecular docking approach here rifampin azobechalcone and azobechalcone were determined as top most drug candidates as they interacted with sars-cov-2 mpp rdrp and spike protein with lowest negative binding energy had the highest negative binding energy -163 kcalmol -159 kcal mol and -144 kcalmol respectively however comparative analysis revealed the superiority of 5 drug candidates ie azobechalcone rifampin isolophirachalcone tetrandrine fangchinoline against sars-cov-2  table 4  the common drug surface hotspots were analyzed along with modeling of pharmacophore which is very important step for drug discovery three amino acid residues ie h41 c145 and m165 played the crucial role for the interaction of mpp with its inhibitors ie rifampin amentoflavone cepharanthine table 1  azobechalcone the top scorer among rdrp inhibitors again the position of f368 l371 l372 a375 w509 l514 y515 were vital for binding of rdrp with tetrandrine biflavone and fangchinoline table 2  most importantly the binding patterns of spike protein with isolophirachalcone fangchinoline and tetrandrine were significantly similar this study revealed the possibility of these amino acids to efficiently interact with drugs though requires validation in wet lab trials adme analysis of top drug candidates reveled no undesirable consequences by these compounds various physico-chemical parameters lipophilicity pharmacokinetics properties and water solubility were determined table 5  in addition no bbb permeant were identified among the top most inhibitors of mpp rdrp and spike protein the consequence of association of the natural inhibitory drugs of three key proteins with the cytochrome p450 cyp suggests that no substantial inhibition can occur however toxicity analysis revealed that rifampin tetrandrine and fangchinoline can be slightly mutagenic though there was no possibility for organ toxicity the results suggest that azobechalcone rifampin isolophirachalcone and tetrandrine fangchinoline could be an option to treat sars-cov-2 infections however the study employed various computational approaches to screen the potent natural therapeutics and does not involve in-vivo assay currently investigational drugs of sars-cov-2 are under immense experimental evaluation therefore we suggest clinical trials for the experimental validation of our findings covid-19 pandemic situation is going to be a worst condition throughout the world rapid detection and social distancing are being encouraged at this stage but we need to search for immediate therapeutic options and effective vaccine candidates for battling this serious health crisis drug repurposing approaches could screened out the already approved drugs for reusing against any serious causative agents that are causing health complications plant metabolites based repurposed drug molecules could be a promising options against sars-cov-2 in the present study five plantr based therapeutics such as azobechalcone rifampin isolophirachalcone tetrandrine and fangchinoline were suggested for potential inhibitors for the main protease protein rna dependent rna polymerase and spike protein of sars-cov-2 by using molecular docking based virtual screening study the study initiated the window towards the thinking of plant based therapy against covid-19 though extensive research and wet lab validation needs to make it usable for patient   cryo-electron microscopy structures of the sars-cov spike glycoprotein reveal a prerequisite conformational state for receptor binding miao gui wenfei song haixia zhou jingwei xu silian chen ye xiang xinquan wang   coronaviruses are a large group of highly diverse enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses that infect many mammalian and avian species currently six coronavirus strains that are able to infect humans have been identified among them alphacoronaviruses hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 and lineage a betacoronaviruses hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 usually cause mild and self-limiting upper respiratory tract infection1 in 2002 the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov a lineage b betacoronavirus was identified and infected more than 8 000 persons including nearly 800 related deaths worldwide in the 2002-2003 sars pandemic234 ten years later another highly pathogenic lineage c betacoronavirus named the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov emerged in saudi arabia in 201256 since its discovery the mers-cov has infected 1 800 persons including 640 related deaths according to the who data in august 2016 these two deadly coronaviruses have been extensively studied in epidemiology virology clinical features and other aspects78910 however there are still no approved antiviral drugs and vaccines to treat and prevent the infections of sars-cov and mers-cov the spike s glycoprotein on the coronavirus envelope is responsible for host cell attachment receptor binding and for mediating host cell membrane and viral membrane fusion during infection it is synthesized as a precursor single polypeptide chain of 1 300 amino acids and then cleaved by host furin-like proteases into an amino n-terminal s1 subunit and a carboxyl c-terminal s2 subunit711 the s1 subunit contains domains for host cell attachment by recognizing cell surface sugar molecules and binding to specific cellular receptors1213 therefore the s1 subunit especially its receptor-binding domain rbd is critical in determining cell tropism host range and zoonotic transmission of coronaviruses1415 the s2 subunit contains a hydrophobic fusion loop and two heptad repeat regions hr1 and hr2 which suggest a coiled helix structure of the s2 subunit7 previous studies suggested that three s monomers assemble to form homo-trimer spikes anchoring on the outmost viral envelope16 binding of rbd to cellular receptors triggers conformational changes in the s1 and s2 subunits leading to the exposure of the fusion loop and its insertion into target cell membrane17 the hr1 and hr2 regions in the s glycoprotein trimer then form a six-helix bundle fusion core that bridges the viral and host cell membranes into close apposition to facilitate fusion17 for the highly pathogenic sars-cov and mers-cov the rbd in the s1 subunit and the post-fusion core in the s2 subunit have been structurally and functionally studied as separate domains181920212223 a previous study of the sars-cov virions by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy cryo-em reported the structure of the s glycoprotein trimers on the virion at a low resolution of 160 16 recently the pre-fusion structures of mouse hepatitis virus mhv and human coronaviruses hku1 and hcov-nl63 s glycoprotein trimers were determined by cryo-em at 40 40 and 34  resolutions respectively242526 however high-resolution structures of the highly pathogenic sars-cov and mers-cov s glycoprotein trimers are still missing in addition intermediate states of the coronavirus s glycoprotein trimer are also required for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying receptor binding and membrane fusion we report here the cryo-em structure determination of the sars-cov s glycoprotein trimer in four different conformations structural analyses revealed that these conformations are different in the position of one c-terminal domain 1 ctd1 which functions as the rbd of the s glycoprotein trimer structural comparisons further indicated that a down to up positional change of the ctd1 switches the s glycoprotein trimer from receptor-binding inactive to active state which is a prerequisite for the binding of sars-cov receptor ace2 and for the neutralization by monoclonal antibodies by using the bac-to-bac insect cell system we expressed and purified a mutant sars-cov s glycoprotein ectodomain in which the residue arg667 at the s1s2 cleavage site was mutated to alanine to enhance sample homogeneity and a strep tag was added to the c-terminus to facilitate purification27 figure 1a the purified sars-cov s glycoprotein was subjected to cryo-em structural analysis using an fei titan krios electron microscope equipped with a gatan k2 summit direct electron counting camera supplementary information figure s1a projected secondary structure features were clearly visible in the 2d classification analysis of the boxed particles supplementary information figure s1b after 3d classification and refinement four major different conformational states conformations 1-4 were determined supplementary information figure s2a the sars-cov spike has an overall mushroom-like shape one of the conformation states is closely three-fold symmetric whereas the other three conformation states show significant asymmetric features in the mushroom head region further calculation and processing were performed with c3 symmetry imposed for the symmetric conformation 1 and without any symmetry imposed for the asymmetric conformations 2-4 supplementary information figures s2 and s3 the resolution of the final c3 symmetric conformation 1 calculated with 34 152 particles was 43  supplementary information figure s1 the atomic model of the sars-cov s was built based on the c3 symmetric density map supplementary information table s1a in the sars-cov s glycoprotein the -strand-rich s1 subunit is composed of an n-terminal domain ntd residues 14-294 and three c-terminal domains ctd1 residues 320-516 ctd2 residues 517-578 and ctd3 residues 579-663 figure 1a and 1b the ctd1 functions as the rbd of sars-cov s glycoprotein which specifically binds to the cellular receptor ace21828 the ctd1 is immediately followed by the ctd2 and ctd3 and the ntd is connected to the ctd1 through a long linker residues 295-319 figure 1a and 1b the ntds of mhv and hku1 s glycoproteins are structurally similar and both adopt a galectin-like -sandwich fold the model to map correlation values are 086 for the mhv ntd and 087 for the hku1 ntd supplementary information figure s4a and s4b fitting of the mhv or hku1 ntd structure into the corresponding sars-cov s glycoprotein density map gave relatively low resolution to map correlation values 055 for mhv ntd and 052 for hku1 ntd supplementary information figure s4c and s4d indicating that the sars-cov ntd has different local conformations although it may still adopt the galectin-like -sandwich fold the relatively low resolution in this region also did not allow us to perform ab initio model building of the ntd therefore only two strands and a short -helix were built and residues 14-260 were not included in the atomic model figure 1a and 1b the -helix-rich s2 subunit begins after the s1s2 cleavage site at residue 667 figure 1a the atomic model of the s2 subunit includes the functionally important fusion peptide residues 798-815 and hr1 residues 880-967 figure 1a and 1b the c-terminal hr2 residues 1 154-1 183 was not built due to relatively poor density in this region figure 1a and 1b in the conformation 1 with three-fold symmetry the three s glycoprotein monomers intertwine around each other to form a closely packed mushroom-shaped homotrimer figure 1c and 1d the triangular head of the trimer spike is composed of the ntds and ctd1s of three s1 subunits three ctd1s locate in the center of the triangular head and are arranged around the 3-fold symmetry axis figure 1c and 1d three ntds locate at the outside of the triangular head and each ntd interacts with one ctd1 from the neighboring s1 subunit figure 1c and 1d the stem of the trimer spike consists of a core helix bundle formed by the long helices of three s2 subunits and the core helix bundle is further surrounded by ctd2s and ctd3s of three s1 subunits figure 1c and 1d the three ctd1s in the head all lay on and cover the top of the s2 subunits figures 1c 1d and 2a we observed three other conformations 2-4 showing asymmetric features of the ctd1 in the triangular head figure 2b-2d in the symmetric conformation 1 the ctd1s in the head are all in a down position covering the s2 subunits in the stem figure 2a the angle between the long axis of the ctd1 and its projection on the horizontal plane perpendicular to the 3-fold axis is 19 degree figure 2a in the conformations 2-4 two ctd1s still adopt the same down conformation as in the conformation 1 whereas one ctd1 rotates outward to an up position and no longer covers the s2 subunit figure 2b-2d the angles between the long axes of the up ctd1s and their projections on the horizontal plane have increased to 52 64 and 70 degrees respectively figure 2b-2d of note the ntd and ctd2 around the rotated ctd1 do not have significant conformational changes supplementary information figure s5a therefore the rotation of the ctd1 is a hinge motion around the loops connecting ntd to ctd1 and ctd1 to ctd2 that are in close proximity supplementary information figure s5b and s5c suggesting that these two loops would play key roles in the conformational switch between the down and up positions of ctd1 although the position of the ctd2 is not affected within the monomer where the ctd1 adopts an up conformation the ctd2 may become more liable to undergo conformational changes to expose the fusion loop underneath as the rbd of sars-cov s glycoprotein trimer the ctd1 specifically binds to the cellular receptor ace2 which is a prerequisite for the host cell attachment of the virion and the subsequent membrane fusion1828 we superimposed the previously determined ctd1-ace2 complex crystal structure onto one ctd1 of the s glycoprotein trimer figure 3a for conformation 1 in which all ctd1s are in the down positions numerous steric clashes were observed between ace2 and the neighboring ctd1 and the volume of the steric clashes reaches 10 696 3 figure 3b and 3c therefore the sars-cov s glycoprotein trimer with all its ctd1s in the down positions would not be able to bind the cellular receptor ace2 suggesting that the three-fold symmetric conformation 1 represents a receptor-binding inactive state of the spike in contrast similar structural superimpositions showed that ace2 binds the up ctd1 well without steric clashes with other regions of the s glycoprotein trimer figure 3d-3f supplementary information figure s6a and s6b suggesting that spikes with one ctd1 in the up position are able to bind receptor ace2 and asymmetric conformations 2-4 represent a receptor-binding activate state of the spike notably the up position of the ctd1 also exposes one of the covered s2 subunits leaving the space for the large-scale conformational change of the s2 subunit to expose and insert the fusion peptide into the target cell membrane several neutralizing antibodies targeting the ctd1 m339 80r and f26g19 have shown potent inhibition activity against the cell infection of pseudo-typed or live sars-cov and the antibody binding epitopes have been elucidated by crystal structure determination of the antibody-ctd1 complexes293031 these antibodies binds to the receptor-binding site on the ctd1 thereby directly inhibiting the engagement of ace2 receptor structural superimpositions showed that these antibodies all have steric clashes with other regions of the s glycoprotein trimer in the conformation 1 state figure 4a-4c in contrast the s glycoprotein trimer conformations 2-4 would allow the antibodies to bind the up ctd1 and inhibit its interaction with the ace2 receptor figure 4d-4f these results indicated that the receptor-binding inactive to active state transition of the s glycoprotein trimer is required not only for successful infections of the sars-cov virions by also for efficient neutralization by antibodies targeting the ctd1 as the known largest class i viral fusion protein the coronavirus s glycoprotein trimer recognizes a variety of host cell receptors through the ntd or ctd1 of the s1 subunit and subsequently mediates the viral and cell membrane fusion through the fusion peptide and two heptad repeats of the s2 subunit since the discoveries of highly pathogenic sars-cov in 2002 and mers-cov in 2012 most studies have been focused on the rbd ntd or ctd1 of the s1 subunit because it binds to the host receptors and is also the main target of neutralizing antibodies during infection our knowledge about the structures of complete sars-cov and mers-cov spike trimers in pre-fusion and post-fusion states are still very limited in the present study we determined the structure of sars-cov s glycoprotein trimer in four different conformational states recently reported cryo-em structures of the mhv and hku1 s glycoprotein trimers are similar to the conformation 1 of the sars-cov s glycoprotein trimer in the receptor-binding inactive state in which all three ctd1s in the s1 subunit are in down positions figure 2a the sars-cov s glycoprotein trimer conformations 2-4 in the receptor-binding active state figure 2b-2d in which one ctd1 is in an up position were not observed in the mhv and hku1 s glycoprotein trimers the protein receptor of the hku1 has not been identified and the ntd in the s1 subunit was shown to bind o-acetylated sialic acids on host cells32 the rbd of mhv s glycoprotein is the ntd of the s1 subunit and structural alignment revealed that the mhv protein receptor ceacam1a binds to the ntd in the s glycoprotein trimer without steric clashes supplementary information figure s6c33 therefore the mhv and hku1 s glycoprotein trimer may not need the prerequisite receptor-binding inactive to active state transition for receptor binding this intrinsic receptor-binding difference among these coronavirus s glycoprotein trimers may be one of the reasons why the previous studies were not able to reveal other conformations rather than conformation 1 in the mhv and hku1 s glycoprotein trimers nevertheless the conformational change of ctd1 may still be needed for the subsequent exposure and conformational changes of the s2 subunit for membrane fusion during the infection of mhv and hku1 the protein receptor-binding site in the ctd1 has also been confirmed for mers-cov and bat coronavirus hku4 which are lineage c betacoronaviruses and have the same host receptor dpp41920343536 structural superimposition of dpp4 complexed with the ctd1 of mers-cov or hku4 onto the sars-cov s glycoprotein trimer also showed that the up conformation of ctd1 is required for the binding of dpp4 by these two betacoronaviruses supplementary information figure s7 therefore we suggest that the receptor-binding inactive to active state transition observed in the sars-cov spike would also occur in the spikes of other betacoronaviruses that bind to their host receptors through the ctd1 in receptor-binding inactive state all three ctd1s in the down positions would not allow efficient binding to receptors figure 5 the transition of one ctd1 from down to up position would release the steric clashes and enable the binding of one receptor molecule figure 5 whether the binding of the first receptor molecule is enough or the binding of the second and third receptors is required to trigger conformational changes in the s1 and s2 subunit necessary for membrane fusion will be an interesting question for future studies a human codon-optimized gene coding the sars-cov spike s glycoprotein ectodomain ncbi accession np8288511 residues 1-1 195 with an r667a mutation to enhance sample

performed in relion 1341 four representative class averaged images were selected as references for automatic particle picking with the whole data set using relion 14 all 2d and 3d classifications and refinements were performed using relion 14 auto-picked particles were visually inspected and then were selected by several rounds of reference-free 2d classifications during the 2d classification particles from classes not showing clear secondary structure features were deleted finally yielding 210 129 selected particles these selected particles were subjected to an initial 3d refinement with c3 symmetry imposed followed by two runs of 3d classifications a total of 52 983 particles of the best class were selected and subjected to a 3d auto-refine at the final stage of the refinement 34 152 particles with a higher loglikelicontribution value were used the resolution of the final c3 symmetric density map was 43  post processing in relion the initial 210 129 selected particles were also subjected to 3d refinements and classifications without any symmetry imposed the central parts of the different classes were similar but most classes showed obvious asymmetric features with one of three ctd1 domains protruding up these asymmetric particles could be grouped into three major classes according to the tilt angle of the up ctd1 particles from these classes were separately subjected to 3d auto-refine the resolutions of the final density maps were 73 57 and 68  for the three classes the handedness of the density maps was verified by docking the crystal structure of sars-cov s glycoprotein ctd1 into the maps reported resolutions are based on the gold-standard fsc 0143 criterion local resolution variations were estimated using resmap42 the crystal structure of the sars-cov s

as a rigid body in real space by using phenix then the two models were merged manually adjusted in coot and refined in phenix again with reference model restrains secondary structure restrains and

displaced by 05  using phenix pdb tools then the displaced model was refined against one of the two half maps in reciprocal space by using phenix fsc curves were calculated between the refined model

the three asymmetric conformations were built by fitting the symmetric model of sars-cov s into the density maps using ucsf chimera the fitted models were then refined as rigid bodies in real space using phenix for the subunit with the up ctd1 the subunit was split into two rigid bodies for refinement including the up ctd1 and the rest part of the subunit structural comparisons between different

models with the sars-cov s rbd structure as reference using the match command in ucsf chimera to calculate the up angles of the ctd1s figure 2 the horizontal plane of the s perpendicular to the 3-fold axis and the long axis of the ctd1 were generated using the ucsf chimera define command and then the angle between the axis and the plane was calculated using the ucsf chimera angle command the overlap volumes between the fitted receptor and the s spike were also calculated using ucsf chimera two atoms were considered to be overlapped if their overlap score  0 the overlap score is defined as the sum of two vdw van der waals radii minus the distance between them and minus an allowance 04  for potentially hydrogen-bonded pairs all the overlap atoms were used for the generation of the steric

from the ts specimens retrieved two complete genome sequences from case 1 and case 3 the complete genomic sequence data for case 2 could not be recovered due to the lower kappa concentration of the sample and hence not included in the study for analysis the fastq files were reference mapped with the available wuhan seafood pneumonia virus wuhan hu-1 complete sars-cov-2 genome accession number nc 0455122 the total reads which were mapped and the percentage of the genome recovered for the two cases are summarized in table i analysis of the complete genome sequences of sars-cov-2 from the

emerging heterogeneity within the sars-cov-2 sequences globally the indian sars-cov-2 viruses were positioned in different clusters indian sars-cov-2 sequences showed two changes 408 argile and 930 alaval in the spike protein compared to the wuhan hu-1 sequence the mutations were further mapped on the spike protein model of the indian sequence supplementary fig 1 available from

indian sars-cov-2 from case 1 when compared to the other sars-cov-2 sequences as noted in the earlier sars-cov-2 sequences both the indian sequences possessed the polybasic cleavage site rrar in the spike protein at the junction of s1 and s2 the two subunits of the spike protein19 epitope predictions thirty one linear b-cell epitopes were predicted by bepipred in the indian sars-cov-2 of which three were found to have a length of 6 amino acids and hence not considered linear epitopes were also predicted using the abcpred prediction tool which predicted 47 epitopes based on the threshold of 08 regions common to both the prediction methods n17 were identified manually the 17 epitopes were screened for their antigenicity using the vaxijen v20 tool httpwwwddg-pharmfacnetvaxijenvaxijenvaxijenhtml and nine of these epitopes were shortlisted these epitopes were further screened for their ability to elicit an ifn- response which was predicted using the ifnepitope tool finally five epitopes four in the s1 domain and one in the s2 domain were predicted which could possibly generate an immune response and suppress the ifn- response table ii n-linked glycosylation site prediction revealed that two putative glycosylation sites with a low value for jury agreement were present within the epitope stretch 328-344 the discontinuous epitopes in the spike protein of the indian sars-cov-2 were further identified using multiple methods ellipro and discotope conformational epitopes based on these methods were mapped on the pre-fusion structure of the modelled indian sars-cov-2 spike protein the newly released structure of the sars-cov-2 spike protein was used as the template for modelling the indian spike protein ramachandran plot

software based on the threshold of 04 twelve of these were shortlisted considering a binding efficiency of 05 nm and capable of eliciting ifn- response table iii till february 29 2020 three positive cases of sars-cov-2 were reported from india from 881 suspected cases tested at icmr-niv pune all the three cases had a travel history from wuhan china during january 2020 although ngs was performed on the specimens for all the three positive cases the complete genome sequence could be retrieved only from case 1 and case 3 the three cases were recovered after hospitalization and were home quarantined as per the guidelines of the ministry of health and family welfare government of india14 the low viral copy number of the ts specimen from case 2 could be the possible reason for lesser viral reads being retrieved during the ngs run leading to a fragmented genome the recent study from china on serial samples tss sputum urine and stool from two patients followed days 3-12 and days 4-15 post onset20 n gene-specific real-time rt-pcr assay showed that the viral loads in ts and sputum samples peaked at around 5-6 days after symptom onset ranging from around 104-107 copies per ml during this time20 in another study the virus was detected in the saliva specimens of 11 of the 12 patients and serial saliva testing showed declines of viral rna levels21 the two indian sars-cov-2 sequences were found to be non-identical 004 nt divergence and the result of phylogenetic analysis indicated that there were two different introductions into the country a recent study using 52 published genbank sequences showed evidence of substantial genetic heterogeneity and estimated the time to the most recent common ancestor to be december 5 2019 95 confidence interval november 6 - december 13 201922 continuous monitoring and analysis of the sequences from the affected countries would be vital to understand the genetic evolution and rates of substitution of the sars-cov-2 the comparison of the amino acid sequences of the non-structural nsp1-nsp16 and structural polyproteins was undertaken with reference to the wuhan-hu1 strain for molecular characterization some human betacoronaviruses including hcov-hku1 lineage a have a polybasic cleavage site as well as predicted o-linked glycans near the s1s2 cleavage site of the spike protein as published recently the polybasic cleavage site that has not been previously observed in related lineage b betacoronaviruses and is a unique feature of sars-cov-2 was noted in the indian sars-cov-2 the mutation arg408ile in the spike protein of one of the indian sequences is noted to be in the rbd and ala930val is located in the s2 domain however both are away from the ace2 receptor-binding interface1923 mutations in the spike protein sequences of sars-cov-2 observed currently are localized over the s1 and s2 domains and so far have not been found in the ace2-binding interface from the alignment of the spike protein sequences of sars cov-1 and sars-cov-2 wuhan-hu1 and india it can be observed that the three nucleotide-deletion in the case 1 sars-cov-2 from india is located close to the insert 1 region of the sars cov-1 supplementary fig 3 available from httpwwwijmrorginarticles20201512imagesindianjmedres20201512200281471sm11pdf notably case 1 and case 2 were in close contact while travelling to india but due to the absence of the complete genome of case 2 the genetic relatedness and source of infection could not be pinpointed among the sars-cov structural proteins the spike protein has been found to elicit neutralizing antibodies24 in this study it was observed that of the five b-cell linear epitopes which were predicted four epitopes were present in the s1 domain and one in the s2 domain prediction of conformational b-cell epitopes revealed that one of these residue positions 341-505 in the spike protein incorporates two of the predicted linear epitopes 327-342 and 404-419 having good antigenicity along with a favourable ifn- response that enables differentiation and proliferation of the b-cells25 notably an equivalent epitope 347-499 is predicted for the model generated using the sars-cov-1 s protein as a template in both cases this epitope lies within the rbd6 although the epitope has two putative n-linked glycosylation sites within it at positions 330 and 332 the probability of these sites being actually glycosylated is very low a major immuno-dominant epitope has been reported from sars-cov between residues 441 and 70026 hence the predicted b-cell conformational epitope identified in the present study may play an important role in initiating a b-cell response among the five linear epitopes predicted in this study epitopes 327-342 and 1204-1219 are conserved between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-1 epitopes 243-258 404-419 and 413-428 are found to have variations the spike protein of sars-cov has also been reported to be immunogenic and elicit high ifn--specific t-cell response26 the prediction results in this study revealed that nine possible ctl epitopes possessing good antigenicity and inducing ifn- response were present in the s protein a recent report27 also predicted t-cell epitopes in the s protein based on a similar annsvm method and antigenicity score although the ifn- response was not considered by these authors it was noted that two of the predictions were found to be common among the t-cell epitopes predicted in the present study four epitopes 89-97 and 256-264 in the s1 domain and 825-833 and 1058-1066 in the s2 domain were found to have good ctl prediction scores with a broad hla allele coverage of a and b supertypes these hla supertypes being predominant in the indian population the predicted epitopes may be considered suitable for future experiments towards vaccine design to conclude the prompt intervention by the government of india and the health authorities of the state of kerala ensured that the said cases did not become secondary foci of transmission further the timely identification of sars-cov-2 in these suspected cases by the icmr-niv pune has helped in the isolation of the patients containment and enhanced surveillances for the virus and its restricted movement the availability of the genomic sequences of the identified cases will contribute to the public repositories and help towards the development of diagnostics vaccines and antivirals the sequence data would also help in tracking the virus from its origin and evolution with its transmission in time availability of data sequences are deposited in

binding affinity yong jia gangxu shen yujuan zhang keng-shiang huang hsing-ying ho wei-shio hor chih-hui yang chengdao li wei-lung wang  highlights  based on the currently available genome sequence data we proved that sars-cov-2 genome has a much lower 31 mutation rate and genetic diversity than sars during the 2002-2003 outbreak 32  the spike s protein encoding gene of sars-cov-2 is found relatively more conserved than other protein-encoding 33 genes which is a good indication for the ongoing antiviral drug and vaccine development 34  monitoring the mutation dynamics of sars-cov-2 is critical for the development of effective approaches to contain the 20 pathogen by analyzing 106 sars-cov-2 and 39 sars genome sequences we provided direct genetic evidence that 21 sars-cov-2 has a much lower mutation rate than sars minimum evolution phylogeny analysis revealed the putative 22 original status of sars-cov-2 and the early-stage spread history the discrepant phylogenies for the spike protein and its 23 receptor binding domain proved a previously reported structural rearrangement prior to the emergence of sars- despite that we found the spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 is particularly more conserved we identified a mutation that 25 leads to weaker receptor binding capability which concerns a sars-cov-2 sample collected on 27 th january 2020 from 26 india this represents the first report of a significant sars-cov-2 mutant and raises the alarm that the ongoing vaccine 27 development may become futile in future epidemic if more mutations were identified 28 29 evolutionary rate assessment 95 the ratio of nonsynonymous mutations dn to synonymous mutations ds was calculated using codeml in the paml 96 version 47 package 18 cds sequences for each protein encoding gene were filtered to remove redundant identical 97 sequences then codon-based cds sequence alignment was performed using muscle program and an individual nj 98 tree was generated using mega70 17 with p-distance model the obtained sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree 99 files were used as paml inputs for dn and ds calculations 100 protein structural analyses 101 3d structure of

sars-cov-2 112 as of 24 th march 2020 there are a total of 174 nucleotide sequences for sars-cov-2 in the ncbi database by restricting 113 to the complete or near-complete genomes 106 sequences from 12 countries were obtained and used for further analyses 114 this encompasses 54 records from usa 35 from china and the rest from other countries australia 1 brazil 2 finland 115 1 india 2 italy 1 nepal 1 spain 3 south korea 1 and sweden 1 116 based on the gene model of the reference sars-cov-2 genome genebank nc0455122 a total of 12 protein-encoding 117 open reading frames orfs plus 5utr and 3utr were annotated  figure 1a  overall the gene sequences from 118 different samples are highly homologous sharing  991 identity with the exception of 5utr 967 and 3utr 98  table 1  which are relatively more divergent sequence alignment showed that there is no mutation in orf6 orf7a 120 and orf7b the genetic diversity profile across the 106 genomes was displayed in figure 1a  a few nucleotide sites 121 within orf1a orf1b orf3a and orf8 exhibiting high genetic diversity were identified  figure 1a  122 the s protein is critical for virus infection and vaccine development as shown in figure  to assess how the mutation rate and genetic diversity of sars-cov-2 the ratio of nonsynonymous mutations dn and 138 synonymous mutations ds was calculated for each protein-encoding orf based on the 106 sars-cov-2 and 39 sars 139 genomes for sars-cov-2 the highest dn was observed for orf8 00111 followed by orf1a 00081 orf9 00079 140 and orf4 00063  table 1  indicating these genes may be more likely to accumulate nonsynonymous mutations in 141 contrast orf1b 00029 s gene 00040 encoding the spike protein and orf5 00023 are relatively more conserved 142 in terms of nonsynonymous mutation noteworthy orf6 orf7ab and orf10 are strictly conserved with no 143 nonsynonymous mutation compared to sars-cov-2 sars displayed higher mutation rates for all of the orfs in the 144 virus genome table 1  suggesting an overall higher levels of genetic diversity and mutation rate in particular the dn and 145 ds values for the s gene in sars-cov is around 12 and 7 times higher than that for sars-cov-2 in contrast the mutation 146 rate differences for orf1a and orf1b between sars-cov-2 and sars are relatively milder varying from 15 times to 147 48 times only in contrast to sars-cov-2 which has strictly conserved orf6 orf7a and orf7b sars displayed 148 mutation rates at different levels notably the ds for orf10 are comparable between the two genomes at 00326 and 00341 149 respectively 150 151 to trace the potential spread history of sars-cov-2 across the world an unrooted minimum evolution me tree of the 153 106 genomes was developed based on whole-genome sequence alignment the clustering pattern of the me phylogeny 154  the spike glycoprotein is critical for the virus infection recent study suggested that the s protein in sars-cov-2 may 185 has underwent a structural rearrangement13 to investigate this hypothesis two separate phylogenies were developed 186 based on the full-s and rbd sequences respectively overall the two phylogenies displayed similar clustering patterns 187 separating into three major clades figure 3  sars-cov-2 was identified in the same major clade and was clustered most 188 closely with two bat sars covs highlighted in purple and green colors figure 3  and the human sars-cov orange 189 color figure 3  in both phylogenies sars-cov-2 is most closely related to batcovratg13 suggesting sars- 2 may have originated from bat however the evolutionary positions of human sars-cov and bat-sl-covz45 were 191 swapped between the full-s and rbd-only phylogenies in the full-s phylogeny bat-sl-covz45 is relatively more similar 192 to human sars-cov-2 whilst human sars-cov is closer to sars-cov-2 than bat-sl-covz45 taken together these results suggested that the rbd of sars-cov-2 is more likely originated from human sars-cov whilst the rest part of 194 the s protein in sars-cov-2 may have originated from bat-sl-covz45 supporting the potential structural rearrangement 195 of s protein in sars-cov-2 batcovratg13 is similar to sars-cov-2 indicating the proposed structural 196 rearrangement may have occurred in bat first before its transmission to human the rbd of virus s protein binds to a receptor in host cells and is responsible for the first step of cov infection 3 thus 204 amino acid mutation to rbd may have significant impact on receptor binding and vaccine development the 3d structure 205 of the spike protein rbd of sars-cov-2 pdb 6vw1 has recently been determined in complex with human ace2 206 receptor 6 one of the12 amino acid mutations in the rbd of s protein r408i was identified among the 106 sars-207 cov-2 genomes sequence alignment showed that 408r is strictly conserved in sars-cov-2 sars-cov and bat sars-208 like cov figure 4a  based on the determined cov2rbd-ace2 complex structure 408r is located at the interface 209 between rbd and ace2 but is positioned relatively far away from ace2 thus does not have direct interaction with ace2 210  figure 4b  however the determined rbd0-ace2 structure showed that 408r forms a hydrogen bond 33  in length 211 with the glycan attached to 90n from ace2  figure 4c  6 the hydrogen bond may have contributed to the exceptionally 212 higher ace2 binding affinity in contrast despite this arginine residue is also conserved in human sars-cov 213 corresponding to 395r in pdb 2ajf it is positioned relatively distant 61  from the glycan bound to 90n from ace2 214  figure s1  interestingly the 408r-glycan hydrogen bond seem to be disrupted by the r408i mutation in one sars-cov-215  linear epitope landscape of sars-cov-2 spike protein

therapeutic antibodies and vaccines are pressingly needed the genome of sars-cov-2 encodes 27 proteins among them spike protein plays a central role for the binding and entry of the virus to the host cell spike protein is cleaved into s1 and s2 at furin and s2 sites by specific proteases 4 it is highly glycosylated with 21 n-glycosylation sites 5 spike protein and more specific the rbd domain is currently the most-focused target for the development of covid-19 neutralization antibodies and vaccines 6-11 however except rbd other parts on spike protein may also elicit neutralization antibodies 12-16 in addition antibody dependent enhancement ade is an unneglectable concern for the development of neutralization antibody and vaccine for sars- 18  to facilitate the precise development of neutralization antibodies and vaccines it is necessary to understand which part of spike protein is highly immunogenic on a systematic way by analyzing samples collected from a large cohort of covid-19 patients results to reveal the immunogenic linear epitopes of spike protein a peptide microarray with full coverage of spike protein was updated from an original version 14 fig s1  sera were collected from two groups ie 1051 covid-19 patients and 528 controls table s1  and analyzed individually on the peptide microarray table s2  by plotting the signal intensities of all the samples against each peptide a linear epitope landscape was constructed for better overview the landscape is aligned to the sequence of spike protein figure 1  to assure the specificity all the control samples table s1  were also analyzed on the peptide microarray almost all the peptides were negative for all the control samples while significant bindings were observed for many of the peptides when probed with covid-19 sera this indicate that the positive bindings are sars-cov-2 specific it was speculated that the n-glycosylation may interfere with antibody responses 19 however  our results clearly showed that the distribution of the linear epitopes is not related to nglycosylation if any subtle to call the highly immunogenic peptides the criteria were set as the averagesignal intensity is larger than 3cutoff2 and the response frequency is larger than 10 see methods for the definitions a total of 16 peptides were obtained surprisingly all of them are outside of rbd because the significance of rbd we lowered the criteria i e the response frequency is larger than 1 while keep the averagesignal intensity larger than 3cutoff2 3 consecutive peptides of moderate immunogenicity i e s1-76 s1-77 and s1-78 were selected table s3  interestingly all these peptides locate within rbm receptor binding motif the binding interface of spike protein and ace2 while a few of these immunogenic peptides are dispersed on spike protein there are two linear epitope hot regions could be immediately recognized aa525-685 and aa770-829 one of which is ctd c-terminal domain and another covers the s2 cleavage site and the fusion peptide fp for the immunogenic peptides table s3  the solubility 20 and pi range from -197 to 106 and 301 to 1116 respectively this indicates the overall immunogenicity of spike protein is not correlated to solubility and pi there are several sars-cov-2 epitope related studies involving small sample sets 21 22  our immunogenic epitopes are partially consistent with these studies table s3  a relative high consistency was observed between our data and rescan a phage display based strategy 23 24  it is known that the immune response may be related to some key clinical parameters such as gender disease severity age and the final outcome 25 26  to test whether the linear epitope landscape correlates with these parameters we divided the linear landscape  fig 1a according to these parameters ie male vs female for gender fig s2  mild vs severe for severity fig s3  60 vs 60 for age fig s4 and recovered vs death for final outcome fig s5  unexpectedly overall no obvious difference was observed these suggest that the linear epitope landscape is highly robust and consistent among covid-19 patients to further illustrate the location and distribution of the 19 immunogenic peptides table   s3  we mapped them to the 3d structure of spike protein 27 fig s6a and s6b  it is clear that most of these peptides locate on the surface of spike protein which is consistent  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright

trimeric spike protein but on the surface of the monomer a plausible explanation is that the monomer spike protein could be exposed to the immune system at a certain yet undiscovered stage it is well known that rbd is highly immunogenic 26 29  however according to our selection criteria no highly immunogenic peptide was obtained from rbd only when we lowered the selection criteria 3 peptides were selected ie s1-76 s1-77 and s1-78  fig   2a  when rbd is compared to other regions of spike protein it is obvious that rbd is very poor of linear epitopes this seems contradictory to the knowledge that rbd is highly immunogenic it is possible that most of the epitopes of rbd region are conformational to test this possibility we collected a set of 9 high affinity monoclonal antibodies of rbd or spike protein see methods these antibodies were obtained through memory b cell isolation from covid-19 recovered patients 30  we analyzed these antibodies individually on the spike protein peptide microarray 14 fig 2b  among these antibodies 414-1 has the highest affinity 296 nm to rbd as expected strong bindings were observed for both s1 protein and rbd however negative signals were obtained for all the peptides including the rbd peptides from aa331-524 also no peptide bindings were observed for the rest of the rbd specific antibodies data not shown for antibody 414-4 strong binding was obtained for s1 protein but not rbd interestingly 414-4 binds s1-97 with high affinity indicating the epitope that 414-4 recognized is around aa577-588 actually the 3 immunogenic peptides i e s1-76 s1-77 and s1-78 were also identified in other related studies 22 31  these three peptides are consecutive and locate in rbm region which are at least partially overlapped with or close to the binding epitopes of a variety of sars-cov-2 neutralization antibodies eg b38 6 cb6 32 and p2b-2f6 33  to further illustrate the locations of these peptides we mapped them to the 3d structure of spike protein of both the open state and the closed state fig 2c  in closed state aa455-465 of s1-767778 locate at the contact area among the three monomers and probably is difficult to be accessed aa452-454 and

and bat coronavirus btcov-ratg13 1 high homologies were observed for all these 3 peptides among sars-cov-2 sars-cov and btcov-ratg13 the high homology indicate that antibodies elicited by s1-767778 may at least be effective for both sars-cov-2 and sars-cov these results strongly suggest that rbd is rich of conformational epitopes while poor of linear epitopes the underlying mechanism is worth for further investigation taken together our results suggest that s1-767778 could serve as a promising candidate for the development of broadly neutralization antibodies or vaccine the first hot

although aa677-684 is invisible in spike protein structure these residues could be exposed on surface and induce antibody response to prevent s1s2 hydrolysis fig 3b  s1-113 is also on the out surface while s1-111 is on the inner surface the underlying mechanism why s1-111 triggers strong igg reaction in many patients worth further study homology analysis was performed for the 6 highly immunogenic peptides fig 3c  except s1-113 high homologies were observed for all the 5 peptides among sars-cov-2 sars-cov and btcov-ratg13 the high homology indicate that antibodies elicited by s1-93 s1-97 s1-105

s2-22 is the only one that was identified or predicted in all these studies since s2-2223 covers the s2 cleavage site and fp we speculate that antibody targeting s2-2223 may block the cleavage and disturb the function of fp thus has potent neutralization activity interestingly strong s2-22 specific igg reaction was also elicited by a mrna vaccine study 38  which further demonstrated the high

the coronaviruses and almost identical among sars-cov-2 sars-cov and btcov-ratg13 if this peptide can elicit strong neutralization activity it may could serve as a promising candidate for making broad

coverage of spike protein 14 analyzed 1051 covid-19 sera and 528 control sera a set of highly immunogenic peptidesepitopes were revealed and a comprehensive igg linear epitope landscape was constructed one limitation of this study is that only short peptides were involved though linear epitopes are nicely represented conformational epitopes may not for example for rbd region which is highly immunogenic only 3 linear epitopes of moderate immunogenicity were identified to overcome this limitation one way is to synthesize longer peptides which may retain some conformational information 31  it is necessary to point out that for the linear epitopes that we identified they are highly physiologically relevant since all of them were revealed through the analysis of sera from covid-19 patient our study presents the first igg linear epitope landscape of spike protein which could only be enabled by analyzing a large cohort of samples using a systematic approach such as the peptide microarray of full coverage of spike protein according to the landscape it is obvious that spike protein is highly immunogenic there are many epitopes on the protein and these epitopes are not evenly distributed across spike protein among the 19 immunogenic peptides table s3  some may be good candidates for developing neutralization antibodies or vaccines some may cause ade if any the rest

trigger neutralization activities when use the intact spike protein for vaccine development we can take a more precise way by deleting or mutating the peptides that correspond to ade and neutral immunodominant epitopes thus assure the efficacy while minimize the side effect alternatively the peptides which elicit neutralization activity have the potential to be applied directly for neutralization antibody generation or applied as peptide vaccine by this way we can avoid many challenges when working with intact spike protein or rbd the linear epitope landscape and the highly immunogenic peptides identified in this study could serve as a solid base to guide the precise development of prophylactic therapeutic antibodies and vaccines for combating covid-19 because of the high homology they may also effective for other human coronaviruses including sars-cov and mers-cov since most of the highly immunogenic peptides are outside of rbd we believe that the antibodies and

opportunities to further explore the inhibitory potential of the concerned phytocompounds in vitro and in vivo towards their effective deployment as inhibitors against sars-cov-2 an accurate account of the physicochemical features of a therapeutic compound in compliance with the general rules of drug-likeness is an imperative step in the initial phases of drug development paul gleeson et al 2011 decent binding affinities binding energy scores  70 kcalmol of the compounds taraxerol friedelin and stigmasterol against the sars-cov-2 spike mpro and rdrp proteins conferred an appropriate scope to further evaluate their physicochemical attributes related to drug-likeness lipinskis rule of five proposes that a drug candidate with logarithm of partial coefficient log p  5 molecular weight  500 dalton number of hydrogen bond acceptors  10 and number of hydrogen bond donors  5 exhibits decent gastrointestinal absorption and enhanced membrane permeability lipinski et al 2001 a thorough investigation revealed that all the three compounds table 4 were in accordance with lipinskis rule of five ro5 with slightly higher log p logarithm of partial coefficient values than the optimum in this pretext it is worth mentioning that most of the oral drugs frequently used in the treatment of cancer have log p values higher than the optimum range proposed by lipinskis rule of five oneill  twelves 2002 vebers rule suggests that a potential therapeutic molecule with the number of rotatable bonds  10 and topological polar surface area tpsa  1402 tends to display decent oral bioavailability veber et al 2002 the compounds taraxerol friedelin and stigmasterol were noted to be in agreement with the vebers rule and our observation correlated well with their decent bioavailability score of 055 table 4 naidoo et al 2020 the physicochemical features of the compounds were further compared with the relevant drugs like arbidol lopinavir ritonavir remdesivir and favipiravir that are presently being employed against sars-cov-2 with a motive to infer about the potential druggability of the compounds in relevance to the drugs it was striking to note that the drugs lopinavir molecular weight  500 dalton number of rotatable bonds  10 ritonavir molecular weight  500 dalton number of rotatable bonds  10 tpsa  1402 and remdesivir molecular weight  500 dalton number of rotatable bonds  10 tpsa  1402 violated the rules of drug-likeness the compounds taraxerol friedelin and stigmasterol were predicted not to possess any structural alerts associated with toxic consequences on pains toxicophore estimation table 4 naidoo et al 2020 pouliot  jeanmart 2016 however the drug arbidol was observed to possess 1 structural alert the phytocompounds were found to display relatively better physicochemical and drug-likeness features compared to the drugs that are presently being employed against sars-cov-2 an in silico toxicity estimation revealed that all the compounds were potentially non-mutagenic and non-cytotoxic table 4 and our observations were found to be consistent with previous reports demonstrating their non-toxic nature al-snafi 2016 ayaz et al 2019 boldrin et al 2013 borges et al 2013 subash-babu et al 2017 surapaneni  prakash 2018 thus the concerned phytocompounds exhibited promising drug-like features and provide further scopes to be validated in vitro and in vivo towards the development of effective therapeutics against covid-19 blomme  will 2016 decent binding energy scores  70 kcalmol of the compounds taraxerol friedelin and stigmasterol against the sars-cov-2 spike mpro and rdrp proteins offered scopes to further estimate the free energies of binding of the concerned protein-ligand complexes using the mm-gbsa method it has been suggested that mm-gbsa provides apt estimates of free energies of binding of protein-ligand complexes and a more negative value indicates stronger binding al-khafaji et al 2020 a detailed investigation of the mm-gbsa binding free energy scores gbind of the selected protein-ligand complexes revealed that the compound taraxerol displayed higher binding potential with the respective sars-cov-2 proteins in comparison to the compounds friedelin and stigmasterol p  001 as evident from the gbind mm-gbsa scores of taraxerol with the sars-cov-2 spike -4519 kcalmol mpro -5853 kcalmol and rdrp -4372 kcalmol proteins table 5 our observations signified a better binding efficacy of taraxerol with the concerned sars-cov-2 proteins relative to friedelin and stigmasterol the compound taraxerol exhibited better binding potential with the sars-cov-2 spike mpro and rdrp proteins in terms of binding energy tables 13 and gbind mm-gbsa scores table 5 in comparison to the phytochemicals friedelin and stigmasterol accordingly the complexes of taraxerol with the respective sars-cov-2 proteins were selected for md simulations along a timescale of 40 ns to validate the results of molecular docking and assess their conformational stability the taraxerol-rbd sars-cov-2 spike protein complex displayed fluctuations in rmsd values of c atoms until 31 ns and attained stability thereafter figure 4 the taraxerol-sars-cov-2 mpro complex was noted to experience initial fluctuations in rmsd values of c atoms until 25 ns after which it attained equilibrium and remained stable figure 4 the taraxerol-sars-cov-2 rdrp complex exhibited significant dynamicity in rmsd values of c atoms in the initial phases of md simulation however it attained considerable stability after 27 ns and remained in equilibrium figure 4 our observations reflected the conformational stability of the complexes and indicated towards the decent binding potential of taraxerol against the sars-cov-2 spike mpro and rdrp proteins khan et al 2020 analysis of root mean square fluctuation rmsf of the residues of a protein-ligand complex is effective in addressing local changes along a protein chain and deciphering its conformational stability muralidharan et al 2020 extensive analysis of rmsf pertaining to the complexes revealed that the average rmsf values were 19  13  and 16  for the complexes taraxerol-rbd sars-cov-2 spike protein figure 5a taraxerol-sars-cov-2 mpro figure 5b and taraxerol-sars-cov-2 rdrp figure 5c respectively the peaks in the rmsf plot depict the residues which experience major fluctuations during the md simulations muralidharan et al 2020 it was evident from our analysis that the residues in the active binding pockets of the sars-cov-2 proteins that interacted with taraxerol tables 13 were relatively stable figures 5a-c throughout the course of the md simulations and thus reflected the conformation stability of the respective complexes conformational stability of a protein-ligand complex is inferred when there are no considerable changes in the interaction patterns of a complex prior to and after md simulations khan et al 2020 extensive analysis of interaction profiles of the complexes taraxerol-rbd sars-cov-2 spike protein taraxerol-sars-cov-2 mpro and taraxerol-sars-cov-2 rdrp after md simulations for 40 ns revealed that they did not suffer any change in their binding patterns the interacting residues prior to and after the md simulations of 40 ns were found to be the same figure 6ac and tables 13 thus it was evident that the complexes were conformationally stable and supported the initial observations of the molecular docking studies covid-19 pandemic has afflicted human population worldwide with its calamitous impact and rapid spread transmission and infectivity there has been an utmost demand for the development of specific drugs and vaccines targeted against sars-cov-2 the causal agent of covid-19 the present research venture aimed at exploring the inhibitory prospects of the phytocompounds from clerodendrum spp revealed that taraxerol was indubitably the most promising inhibitory candidate against the sars-cov-2 spike mpro and rdrp proteins followed by friedelin and stigmasterol as evident from the binding energy scores the fact that taraxerol displayed decent binding potential against all the concerned sars-cov-2 proteins included in the present analysis might provide a foundation for it to be deployed as a universal target against sars-cov-2 with further in vitro and in vivo validations required to draw a final inference  the biological characteristics of sars-cov-2 spike protein pro330-leu650 qiu-dong su yao yi ye-ning zou zhi-yuan jia feng qiu feng wang wen-jiao yin wen-ting zhou shuang zhang peng-cheng yu sheng-li bi li-ping shen gui-zhen wu   the family coronaviridae has historically been known to cause common colds and diarrheal illnesses in humans however sars-cov emerged as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2002 1 seventeen years after sars the current outbreak of coronavirus disease covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 which has a high similarity with sars-cov has shocked the world 2 as of march 17 2020 sars-cov-2 has infected 179111 people involving 160 countriesregions worldwide whereas china bears a significant burden with approximately 453 of cases and 3231 deaths 3 however the evolution of sars-cov-2 has continued with the identification of two major strains type l approximately 70 and type s approximately 30 4 sars-cov-2 belongs to the beta-coronavirus genus which includes sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov bat sarsr-cov and others 5 sars-cov-2 has a positive single-strand rna genome that is over 29 kilobases in length 6 moreover sars-cov-2 encodes four major structural proteins the spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n proteins 7 the s protein is the most likely target of neutralizing antibodies as it is the main trans-membrane glycoprotein responsible for receptor-binding and virion entry 7 viral mutations occur in regions with much stronger mhc-i binding ability while no other mutations are located near the s receptor-binding domain rbd cys336-glu516 8 humoral immunity mediated by antibodies produced by b cells is critical for effective vaccines whereas cellular immunity mediated by t cells cd4 and cd8 t cells is also considered to be essential 9 the cd4 t cell response is critical to both antibody production and the killing of infected cells mediated by cd8 ctls in addition only neutralizing antibodies can fully block viral entry into host cells however the general location of the binding of other antibodies would strongly affect the bodys ability to produce neutralizing antibodies 7 to date no coronavirus vaccine has been approved 10 inactivated sars-cov has been demonstrated to offer incomplete protection whereas purified coronavirus spike protein nanoparticles have been found to induce coronavirus neutralizing antibodies in mice 10 therefore full exposure of neutralizing epitopes with other b cell epitopes are likely to represent important factors in coronavirus vaccine design the high homology of the s protein between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov resulted in the design of a subunit vaccine for sars-cov-2 which is focused on the rbd region and its vicinity for the purpose of vaccine design we analyzed the biological characteristics eg homology analysis t and b cell epitope prediction and advanced structural analysis by focusing on pro330-leu650 of the sars-cov-2 s protein sars-cov-2-spl to evaluate its potential as a vaccine antigen of pro330-leu650 the spike protein sequences of sars-cov-2 and sars were obtained from genbank qhd434161 and aap410371 both of the protein sequences were aligned by mega x the correspondence between sars spike pro317-leu636 sars-cov-spl and sars-cov-2 spike pro330-leu650 sars-cov-2-spl was determined the b cell epitopes of sars-cov-2-spl were predicted online with disctope2 11 and iedb 12 a disctope score peak chart was subsequently constructed using graphpad prism 80 the mhc-i 9 mer and mhc-ii 15 mer presentation scores were predicted by netmhcpan4 13 and maria 14 respectively thirty-two mhc alleles were included in the analysis of cd4 and cd8 t cell epitopes with a more stringent 995 threshold for both netmhcpan4 and maria an oligopeptide was selected if it was presented by more than one of three common alleles 8 the approximate tertiary structures of the monomer sars-cov-2-spl pdb 6nb61c and sars-cov-spl pdb 6crx1c as well as the homotrimer sars-cov-2-spl pdb 6vsb1a were constructed with swiss-model using homology modeling 15 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 was identified as the sars-cov-2 receptor with its receptor binding domain rbd located on the spike protein 5 the rbd region was referred to as the arg319-phe541 however cys336-phe515 was sufficient for maintaining the rbd structure 5 the sars-cov-2-spl contains an rbd region pro330-phe541 and tail region asn542-leu650 according to the discotope scores of each amino acid the potential b cell epitope motif distribution of sars-cov-2-spl and sars-cov-spl was created using graphpad prism software fig 1 there were five b cell epitope motifs in the sars-cov-2-spl ser438-gln506 gly446 3263 thr500 3290 thr553-glu583 lys558 -1298 gly404-aps427 lys417 -2402 thr345-ala352 ala352 -7612 and lys529-lys535 asn532 -7715 fig 1a among these motifs three were located in the rbd region whereas two were located in the tail region as expected there were also five motifs in the sars-cov-spl thr425-gln492 thr433 2403 thr486 0943 leu538-leu571 arg544 1618 val389-asp414 val404 -1604 thr332-trp340 ala339 -5031 and thr517-lys521 asp518 -8507 fig 1b furthermore the two discotope score peaks were almost mirror images fig 1 according to the maria percentiles for all possible 15 mer peptide sequences and netmhcpan4 percentiles for all possible 9 mer peptide sequences for sars-cov-2-spl broad coverage was defined as being presented by 13 of mhc alleles 8 we found that 15 cd4 epitopes and 17 cd8 t cell epitopes met this requirement after overlapping integration there were nine potential cd4 and 11 potential cd8 t cell antigenic determinants table 1
 the rbd region possessed seven cd4 epitopes and nine cd8 t cell epitopes whereas the tail region has two cd4 epitopes and two cd8 t cell epitopes moreover when comparing these epitopes with verified cd4 and cd8 t cell epitopes of sars-cov-spl 16 a one-to-one correspondence was observed eg ser516-asn530 sars-cov to ser530-asn544 sars-cov-2 for the cd4 t cell epitope and lys411-val420 sars-cov to lys424-val433 sars-cov-2 the amino acid identity was 7625 between sars-cov-2-spl and sars-cov-spl fig 2
 there were 76 amino acid differences between them 36 of which were located in the receptor-binding motif rmb ser438-gln506 accounting for 474 3676 empirically the biological characteristics of some amino acids eg arg-lys thr-ser glu-asp and ile-leu were similar after taking the biological similarity of amino acids into account and eliminating the rbm the amino acid identity was approximately 877 according to the overall topology of the sars-cov-2-spl monomer fig 3
a there were six disulfide bonds cys336-cys361 cys379-cys432 cys480-cys488 cys391-cys525 cys538-cys590 and cys617-cys649 correspondingly the sars-cov-spl monomer also had six disulfide bonds cys323-cys348 cys366-cys419 cys467-cys474 cys378-cys511 cys524-cys576 and cys603-cys635 fig 3b furthermore the six pairs of cysteines from the two coronaviruses were located at the same position in both the primary fig 2 and tertiary fig 3 structures when artificially divided into three parts the region contained a head receptor-binding motif rbm trunk rbd except rbm and tail remainders the structural differences of the trunk especially the head were obvious eg the head and trunk of sars-cov-2-spl appeared to be more compact than those of sars-cov-spl whereas the tail region was highly similar fig 3 homotrimer sars-cov-2-spl was arranged in a barrel with three rbms situated on the top fig 3c in our previous study regarding sars-related antigens from 2003 17 we prepared an insoluble sars-related antigen with high antigenicity using prokaryotic expression chromatography purification and an in-house dialysis procedure moreover the immunogenicity of this sars-related antigen was also preliminarily confirmed unpublished compared with inactivated virions and other subunit antigens prepared in cell culture antigens prepared using our method have clear advantages including decreased time and labor as well as enhanced convenience as mentioned above the presence of a complex structure and numerous cysteines in sars-cov-2-spl is likely to seriously hinder the correct folding of the protein which is crucial for the vaccine to generate effective immunity therefore the successful preparation of sars-related antigens may increase the speed at which a sars-cov-2 vaccine can be developed and thereby control the covd-2019 outbreak based on the knowledge gained from sars-cov vaccine development a sars-cov-2 vaccine should target the structural proteins particularly the rbd region 18 the rbd of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov possesses a similar structure despite amino acid variations at some key residues 6 therefore many sars-related studies may provide a valuable reference for sars-cov-2 vaccine development amino acid sequence variations between the rbd of the sars-cov-2 spike protein rbd and other coronaviruses have been elucidated completely 6 19 despite the high sequence homology with the sars-cov spike protein approx 76 sars-cov rbd-specific antibodies could not bind to sars-cov-2 7 and vice versa 20 21 therefore exploiting sars-cov-related antigens to develop a sars-cov-2 vaccine is not practical in this study our focus was centered on sars-cov-2-spl which was found to contain the rbd and skeleton supporting its conformation furthermore we analyzed the protein skeleton comparisons instead of performing simple sequence comparisons between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 the similar protein skeleton was suggestive of a similar protein structure and procedure of prokaryotic expression and chromatography purification burial of the neutralization epitope and an unsustainable t cell response might result in the failure of an inactivated sars vaccine moreover the inclusion of effective b and t cell epitopes is essential for inducing specific humoral and cellular immunity in an ideal vaccine 22 the recognition of effective b cell epitopes is dependent on antigenicity accessibility of the surface and assistance of t helper cd4 t cells cd4 t cells are the main components of the immune system found to impart immunological memory to the new strains pathogen-specific t cell responses are also required for protection against infection 23 in addition a specific cellular response is considered to be equally important for sustainable protection and pathogen elimination and cd4 t cells assist in promoting the production of antibodies and ctl reactions the sars-cov-2-spl was found to possess 5 b cell epitopes 15 cd4 t cell epitopes and 17 cd8 t cell epitopes respectively moreover from the overall topology fig 3a we found that most of these epitopes were exposed on the surface which is an advantage of a small molecular protein in addition the rbd region of the sars-cov-2-spl appeared to be compact which might explain why sars-cov-2 rbd exhibited a stronger affinity with ace 5 the preparation of sars-cov-2-spl was successfully performed in our laboratory a high level of antibodies to sars-cov-2-spl appeared in the balbc mice after immunization however further neutralization experiments demonstrated that antibodies other than neutralizing antibodies were predominantly generated in this circumstance antibody-dependent enhancement ade may exist which would enhance viral invasion thus a potential vaccine antigen should not contain too many epitopes especially b cell epitopes deleting unnecessary b cell epitopes or inserting neutralizing epitopes to virus-like particles may be a practical means of achieving this reduction empirically the structure of the three distinct parts head trunk and tail is critical for protein stability moreover the topology of sars-cov-2-spl and sars-cov-spl appear similar to a goldfish with rmb as the head rbd as the trunk and remainders as the tail fig 3a and 3b the rmb head critical for receptor binding of sars-cov-2-spl was completely exposed on the surface fig 3a which is also crucial for the production of neutralizing antibodies homotrimer sars-cov-2-spl was arranged in a barrel with three rbms on the top fig 3a which might represent the natural state of the sars-cov-2-spl structure in this study we analyzed the biological characteristics of sars-cov-2-spl and found it possessed a b cell-epitope-rich head and trunk and t cell-epitope-rich tail giving it an ideal antigenic structure thus these findings may provide meaningful guidance for future sars-cov-2 vaccine design
