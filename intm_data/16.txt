ultraviolet germicidal irradiation uvgi has been used to scrub the air in health care facilities and laboratories for many decades uvgi is known to be efficacious to varying degrees in controlling the circulation of airborne infectious particles approximately 60 of all uvgi air disinfection systems are installed in health care facilities according to kowalski and bahnfleth1 this equates to 41 in hospitals and 19 in clinics until recently most of the experimental data that led to the development of uvgi systems were decades old aside from anecdotal observations little information about the actual performance of these systems in hospital rooms was available although uv light is known to inactivate microorganisms limiting their ability to grow and multiply when inhaled or picked up on surfaces there is insufficient evidence on which to base a decision to rely solely on uvgi as an engineering control for preventing health care-associated tuberculosis tb transmission2
numerous laboratory studies dating back to the 1930s have been conducted to analyze the efficacy of uvgi for various microorganisms in a range of temperature and humidity conditions few studies have evaluated the practical application of uvgi in health care buildings however3 most of the existing evidence comes from laboratory investigations conducted under simulated conditions our search revealed only one study that has been conducted in a physically realistic setting under controlled conditions4 that study served as the basis for the 2009 national institute for occupational safety and health niosh technical guidance document on the use of uvgi systems to protect health care providers from occupational tb infection5 this review examines the gaps in existing evidence and highlights design and operational factors that can significantly impact the efficacy of uvgi systemsairborne transmission of infectious agents involves droplets that are expelled by sneezing or coughing or are otherwise distributed into the air although the liquidvapor around the infectious agent evaporates the residue or droplet nuclei may remain in the air for long periods depending on such factors as particle size velocity force of expulsion particle density infectivity ie viability of the microorganism when exposed to the environment and its ability to cause infection when a susceptible host is subsequently exposed humidity and rate of air flowroy and milton14 suggested that transmission of infectious agents does not correlate solely with the size of the microbes in droplet nuclei or larger droplets the size can range from obligate inhalational airborne pathogens such as m tuberculosis to preferential inhalational transmission such as measles virus or varicella-zoster vzv based on the ability to cause infection in distal airways to opportunistic pathogens like sars-cov that take advantage of unique environmental and clinical circumstances that permit dissemination over several meters for m tuberculosis the prototype obligate inhalational pathogen airborne droplet nuclei containing this agent can travel via air currents aided by the ventilation system and be spread over a wide area the disease-causing organisms then are inhaled and cause infectionopportunistic dissemination can be accomplished from respiratory droplets generated during such procedures as suctioning endotracheal intubation and induction of cough by chest physiotherapy there is theoretical chance that pathogen-laden droplets expelled during these procedures might travel further distances and reach deeper into the respiratory tract of susceptible persons concerns over the protection of health care personnel performing these types of procedures on patients with h1n1 2009 infection led to recommendations for higher facepiece filtering devices such as n95 respirators the latter have traditionally been required only to protect health care personnel against occupational exposure to m tuberculosis
droplet transmission involves relatively short-range movement of the infectious agent over a distance of 1-2 m some of these agents eg influenza virus also can be transmitted by direct and indirect contact with droplet transmission respiratory droplets containing infectious pathogens travel directly from the respiratory tract of the infectious individual to another susceptible person through deposition on mucosal surfaces of the recipient the distance that droplets travel depends on the velocity and mechanism by which respiratory droplets are propelled from the source the density of respiratory secretions environmental factors such as temperature and humidity and the ability of the pathogen to maintain infectivity over that distance droplets in dry air evaporate quickly shrink in size and fall to the ground more slowly the changing size of a droplet affects how it responds to airflow patterns and how quickly it settlessmall pressure differences induced by natural forces such as thermal buoyancy due to air temperature differences the wind or mechanical fans can generate air flows that move air from one room to another air filtration aims to reduce airborne concentrations to well below infectious doses in a hospital setting patients lie in bed much of the time the direction of an exhalation jet from a standing or seated person and that from a lying person can be different eg the latter may face up the upward thermal plume generated by a standing or seated person is much stronger than that generated by a lying person thus some differences between the behaviors of breathing flows in hospital and other indoor environments are expected the exhalation jet from a lying patient can behave differently in different ventilation systems and also can be affected by other factors such as the mode of contaminant release and the thermal plume generated by the human body or other heat sources understanding breathing flows from a patient lying supine with different ventilation systems is useful for developing an effective ventilation method for minimizing the risk of cross-infection via airborne transmission droplet nuclei 5 m in diameter exhibit a settling velocity of 1 mh 88 feet per minute in still air and can follow the exhalation flows as well as the ambient air flows in a hospital ward clinically applicable distinctions are made between short-range airborne infection routes between individuals generally 1 m apart and long-range routes within a room between rooms or between distant locations generally distances 1 m fennelly et al15 and bjorn and nielsen16 set the following size definitionslarge droplet diameter 60 msmall droplet diameter 60 mdroplet nuclei diameter 10 m
small droplets also may participate in short-range transmission but they are more likely than larger droplets to evaporate to become droplet nuclei and then be considered to have the potential for long-range airborne transmissiontrue long-range aerosol transmission becomes possible when the droplets of infectious material are sufficiently small to remain airborne almost indefinitely and to be transmitted over long distances pathogens that are not transmitted routinely by the droplet route can be dispersed into the air over short distances for example as reported by bassetti et al17 although staphylococcus aureus is most commonly transmitted by the contact route viral upper respiratory tract infection has been associated with increased dispersal of s aureus from the nose into the air over a distance of 4 feet under both outbreak and experimental conditions known as the cloud baby and cloud adult phenomenaonce infectious droplets are released the main factors that determine how they move are their size and the airflow patterns that carry them around droplet size changes with time depending on the environmental conditions droplets in dry air evaporate quickly shrink in size and fall to the ground more slowly the changing size of a droplet affects how it responds to airflow patterns and how quickly it settles movement of people in a room plays a significant part in disturbing airflow and also in transporting infected air from one place to another thus room airflow is governed primarily but not solely by mechanical ventilation other influences include temperature humidity movement of personnel and patients and equipment the varying combinations of these factors make the route and suspension time of an infectious particle very difficult to predict in a dynamic real-world environment of a health care facilitymeasles and chickenpox vzv are both lipid-enveloped and sensitive to changes in temperature relative humidity rh and uv radiation according to cox18 stephenson et al19 and ijaz et al20 viruses without a lipid envelope eg poliovirus generally survive longer at high rh 50 but lipid-enveloped viruses eg influenza lassa fever virus human coronavirus hcv 229e survive longer in low rh 5018 19 20 data on hcv 229e indicate that when airborne this virus has a survival half-life of about 3 hours at an rh of 80 67 hours at an rh of 50 and 27 hours at an rh of 30 at 20 c suggesting that high rh 80 is most detrimental to the survival of this coronavirus bean et al21 reported that influenza can survive for 24-48 hours on hard nonporous surfaces such as stainless steel and plastic but for less than 8-12 hours on cloth paper and tissues in addition influenza virus can survive for up to 5 minutes on hands and can be transferred to hands from these nonporous surfaces for 24 hours and from tissues for 15 minutes21
more recently lai et al22 demonstrated that sars cov can survive in alkaline diarrhea stools for up to 4 days and can remain infectious in respiratory specimens for more than 7 days at room temperature similarities with other viruses of nosocomial importance eg other rna lipid-enveloped respiratory viruses such as influenza suggest that such organisms can survive long enough in aerosols to cause disease especially when associated with biological fluids such as mucus feces and blood this sensitivity to environmental conditions also might help explain the seasonality of some viral infectionsregarding influenza transmission brankston et al23 concluded that natural influenza transmission in humans occurs via droplets and contact over short distances as opposed to long distances although none of the studies that they reviewed could specifically rule out airborne transmission the authors believed that the airborne route is neither the predominant mode of transmission nor a frequent enough occurrence to be of significant concern when considering control measures for most clinical settings23 a recent epidemiologic investigation confirmed their conclusions24
all viruses and almost all bacteria excluding spores are vulnerable to moderate levels of uvgi exposure but the magnitude of the effect is extremely species-dependent27 spores which are larger and more resistant to uvgi than most bacteria can be effectively removed through high-efficiency air filtration without uvgi some ugvi systems are installed in conjunction with high-efficiency filtration this combination design can be very effective against biological agents in certain situations smaller microbes that are difficult to filter out tend to be more susceptible to uvgi whereas larger microbes such as spores which are more resistant to uvgi tend to be easier to filter out fig 1

a recent taiwanese study found that the effectiveness of uvgi depends strongly on the type of virus nucleic acid and that viruses with dsrna or dsdna are significantly less susceptible to uv inactivation30 for 90 airborne virus inactivation the uvgi dose was approximately 2-fold higher for dsrna and dsdna viruses than for ssrna and ssdna viruses the microorganism susceptibility factor was the highest for the viruses similar to that for fragile bacteria but 13-20 times higher than that for endospore bacteria or fungal spores the susceptibility factor for the viruses was higher at 55 rh than that at 85 rh possibly because under high rh water adsorption onto the virus surface might provide protection against uv-induced dna or rna damage30
uvgi has been used as a supplement to mechanical ventilation to inactivate airborne infectious agents to protect the health of building occupants upper-room uvgi installations are frequently used to provide ach equivalent or effective e-ach to that recommended by the cdc for aiirs however e-ach is not acceptable for meeting cdc recommendations as a primary environmental control against m tuberculosis
uvgi generally refers to a uv wavelength of 2537 nm uv-c exposure to uv light at this wavelength is a practical and cost-effective method of inactivating airborne viruses mycoplasma bacteria and fungi on clean surfaces31
the most widely used application of uvgi is in the form of passive upper-room fixtures containing uvgi lamps that provide a horizontal layer of uv energy field above the occupied zone these fixtures are designed to inactivate bacteria that enter the upper irradiated zone and their efficacy is highly reliant on among other factors the airflow field conditions in the room the survival probability of bacteria exposed to uv irradiance depends on the susceptibility of the target microorganism and the dose and duration of uv-c to which it is exposed32 lamps used to produce uv-c are located relatively high up in the room 8 ft to prevent exposure to occupants by a specially designed fixture there are two basic designs a pan fixture with uvgi unshielded above the unit to direct the irradiation upward and a fixture with a series of parallel plates that direct the irradiation outward while preventing the light from reaching the eyes or unprotected skin of the rooms occupants germicidal activity is dependent on air mixing via convection between the rooms irradiated upper zone and the lower patient care zones32 this was confirmed in an investigation by miller et al4 that involved installation of upper-room uvgi units and evaluation of these units impact on culturable airborne bacteria more than 90 of the bacteria detected were inactivated however the rate was lower for more-resistant bacteria and fungal spores that investigation also clearly demonstrated that room air must be mixed for uvgi to effectively inactivate microorganisms when warm air entered the room via a duct close to the ceiling which can occur in the winter when the heating system is turned on the warm air simply rested on the much cooler air below and the efficacy of the uvgi system was dramatically diminished because the microbes did not move up for exposure to the uv-c irradiation no mixing fans were turned on during the experiment but moderate ventilation was presentthe cleanliness of uv light bulbs and age of uv lamps should be checked periodically approximately every 6 months to ensure sufficient uv light intensity for germicidal activity uv-c the intensity of germicidal wavelength light decreases with age and bulb ratings hours of use may vary by manufacturer13 upper-room uvgi is often seen as a cost-effective measure to supplement the general ventilation system in a room however the combination of the general ventilation system and uv lamps might not necessarily be implemented correctly within a room for example if the ventilation rate is too high the particles may not be sufficiently exposed to the uv-c irradiation to ensure complete inactivation or if the ventilation system does not provide good mixing within the room airborne particles containing microbes might not even be exposed to the uv-c irradiation13
a well-designed upper-room uvgi system may effectively kill or inactivate most airborne droplet nuclei containing mycobacterium spp if designed to provide an average uv fluence rate ie irradiance from all angles that is incident on a small region of space a more accurate term than uv dose in the upper room in the range of 30-50 wcm2 provided that the other criteria stipulated in the cdcs tb guidelines are met2 the fixtures should be installed to provide as uniform a uvgi distribution as possible in the upper room5 schafer et al33 developed a method to measure fluence rate and used it to verify that this rate varied as much as 3-fold in a typical room depending on proximity to the lamp and found that lamp failure was common this reinforces the need to monitor the efficacy of the lamps used in uvgi fixtures under experimental laboratory conditions with mechanical ventilation rates of up to 6 ach the rate at which microorganisms are killed or inactivated by uvgi systems appears to be additive with mechanical ventilation systems in well-mixed rooms2
for other infectious agents such as sars-cov and influenza the mode of transmission is by droplets which do not remain suspended in air for long periods of time but fall out within a 2-m radius from a coughingsneezing person even the most robust hvac system is unlikely to achieve sufficient air mixing to provide efficient kill of microbes transmitted by droplets these particles never reach the upper-room uv zone thus an alternate method of disinfection is needed34
escombe et al35 recently investigated impact of upward-facing uv light fixtures installed in ceilings of a negative-pressure tb isolation ward and ceiling-mounted air ionization fixtures in an animal enclosure chamber using a guinea pig air sampling model that involved exposure of the animals to exhaust air from the isolation ward with this animal model 35 of controls exposed to untreated exhaust air from the tb ward developed tb infection whereas frequency was reduced to 14 and 95 with use of an ionizer and uvgi respectively they concluded that provided there is adequate mixing of room air an upper-room uvgi fixture is an effective low-cost intervention for use in tb infection control in high-risk clinical settings35
critical factors that affect the efficacy of uvgi include temperature rh and lamp output a number of studies have indicated that the effectiveness of upper-room uvgi systems decreases as humidity increases for optimal efficiency rh should be controlled to 60 or less when upper-room uvgi systems are installed temperature should be kept between 68f and 75 f 20 c-24 c both of these suggestions are consistent with 2010 facility guidelines institute fgi and the american society of heating refrigerating and air-conditioning engineers ashrae recommendations in ashrae standard 170 now part of the fgi guidelines standards36 the ashrae handbook also provides comprehensive recommendations for installation and operation of uvgi systems37
experimental upper-room uvgi systems used in rooms with aerosolized bacteria including surrogates of m tuberculosis have shown that the higher the uv fluence rate produced in the upper air of a room the greater the effectiveness of the system4 38 39 based on the results of experiments with upper-room uvgi systems and aerosolized bacteria in bench-scale reactors it is apparent that the greater the uv fluence rate in the irradiated zone the more effective the system40 41 however there appears to be an upper threshold after which an increase in uvgi does not directly correspond to an increase in the systems ability to kill or inactivate microorganisms4 13 42 43 miller et al4 reported decreased effectiveness of the uvgi system when the uv fixtures were placed on only one side of the room this is consistent with the findings of riley and permutt44 who reported that a wider distribution of low-irradiance uv lamps was more efficient compared with the use of one centrally located high-irradiance uv lamp this suggests that upper-room uvgi systems should be installed to provide the most uniform uvgi distribution in the upper air possiblein most of the studies that form the basis of the irradiance guidelines the bacteria studied were primarily single cells aerosolized in deionized water this lack of a mucus coating could possibly make these bacteria more sensitive to uvgi compared with bacteria in droplet nuclei from an infected host45 the killing or deactivation of 63 of droplet nuclei in a room by uvgi is equivalent to 1 ach in terms of reduced total droplet nuclei concentration in the room3 this reduction of droplet nuclei by a method other than mechanical ventilation is termed eachuvgi lamps can be installed in a various locations in a hvac system one possible location is inside the ahu typically in front of the cooling coils and drip pan there are anecdotal reports that this configuration results in energy conservation and maintenance cost savings but more rigorous study is needed to reproduce and validate these claims some manufacturers of these systems have also made claims of reduced incidence of health care-associated infections hais with the use of uvgi in ahus to date however there is little if any supportive evidence in the peer-reviewed scientific literature many of the published investigations rely on environmental surface or air sampling cultures or laboratory-based animal studies for inferential support our assessment of the available literature indicates claims of reduced hais from ahu-installed uvgi in health care facilities remain unfounded there is some evidence of fewer complaints related to indoor air quality in buildings with systems containing uvgi inside the ahu46 levetin et al47 provided some evidence for this by demonstrating a significantly lower concentration of fungal spores on a floor of a building with an in-duct uvgi system compared with a floor in the same building without such a system the spores recovered in the building were the same as from insulation material in the ventilation ducts however the authors concluded that few spores from the outdoors passed through filters in the ahus but that the spores developed when the hvac system was turned on and off notably they noted that as a result we cannot say that the uv-c radiation had a direct effect on spores in the air stream the effectiveness of uv-c lamps seemed to be localized because visual inspection indicated there was conspicuous fungal growth in the downstream duct insulation lining47 uv lamps also can be placed inside supply or return air ducts to disinfect the air before it is supplied to an occupied space or when recirculateduv irradiation by itself does not clean air the microorganisms are still there and in the case of some microorganisms might still contain the ability to cause noninfectious eg allergenic disease although uv potentially can destroy allergenic sites on the surface of a bioaerosol this ability has yet not been documented or quantified47 bacterial inactivation studies using bacillus calmette-gurin bcg a strain of mycobacterium bovis and serratia marcescens have estimated the effect of uvgi as equivalent to 10-39 ach34 however another study suggested that uvgi may result in fewer equivalent ach in the patient-care zone especially if the mixing of air between zones is insufficient48 the use of fans or hvac systems to generate air movement and good mixing might increase the effectiveness of uvgi by ensuring exposure of airborne microorganisms to the light energy for a sufficient length of time35
uvgi has been used for disinfection of water but that application is not addressed in this review it has also been used to disinfect surfaces one study found that the effectiveness of this application is limited by the low penetrating power of uvgi and thus it is currently limited to decontaminating surfaces when conventional methods such as the use of liquid chemical disinfectants are not feasible31
some studies also have explored disinfection of medical devices and other high-frequency touch surfaces sweeney and dancer49 found that uvgi disinfection of computer keyboards without mechanical friction from cleaning had no impact on bioburden for 72 of the 68 keyboards in their study and concluded that physical cleaning is of greatest importance before the use of uvgi kac et al50 found that uvgi effectively disinfected endocavitary ultrasound probes but only if used in combination with a surface disinfectant applied with a cloth and with mechanical friction interestingly both of these investigations highlight the adjunctive impact of uvgi following traditional cleaning and disinfection for medical devices and other surfaces whivch is consistent with use of uvgi for disinfection of air more recently rutala et al51 presented unpublished results of their study of no-touch full room disinfection with an automated portable uv-c device that uses mirrors to bounce uvgi around a room to reach all surfaces including those not directly exposed to fluence they reported substantial log reductions in vegetative bacteria 3-4 within 15 minutes of exposure and in spore-forming bacteria such as c difficile 2-3 after 50 minutes of exposurean analytical model for evaluating the uv dose in steady-state conditions using the eulerian system was proposed by memarzadeh et al48 computational fluid dynamics cfd was used to study the efficacy of inactivation of airborne bacteria by upper-room uvgi in a test room several uv lamp configurations were used in the model compared with available experimental data the proposed model closely predicts the percentage of particles inactivated by uvgi the proposed model was used to study the effects of ventilation flow rate and uv fixture configuration on inactivation of airborne bacteria in a test chamber the lagrangian system model was also applied in the same test chamber for a similar scenario this cfd model demonstrates that the percentage of uvgi inactivation is higher when the ventilation flow rate is lower increasing the ventilation flow rate from 2 to 6 ach reduces the residence time of a pass through the uv zone from 247 to 83 seconds in the latter case the dosage is then only 35 of the total dose received in the former case for upper-room uvgi to be effective the aerosolized infectious particles must be moved from the lower part of the room where they are produced by a person coughing or sneezing to the germicidal zone in the upper room practical considerations prohibit the ideal situation of uvgi cleansing of all infectious particles in a single pass when they move through the upper-room uvgi zone another consideration is how rapidly microorganisms proceed through the uvgi zone a higher frequency of ach limits the exposure time of the infectious particles to the uvgi and thus is likely to have less effective antimicrobial activity in practice the effectiveness of a uvgi installation is determined by the following factorsfixture used to house the uv-c lamp this determines how much of the radiation discharged from the uv lamp is actually emitted from the fixture and how it is distributedenvironmental sustainability issues most uv-c lamps use low-pressure mercury have a limited life span and require environmental precautions for disposaldistance from the uv-c lamp the distance of airborne infectious agents from the fixture will determine the irradiance level and thus the germicidal efficacyairflow pattern this affects how long the bacteria and viruses are exposed to the uv radiationhumidity the humidity of the atmosphere is key because water makes the infectious agent less susceptible to damage from uv radiation the higher the rh the less likely an aqueous aerosol will dry out for maximum effectiveness of uvgi rh should be 7534

on may 18 2007 niosh received a request from the director of environmental affairs at brigham and womens hospital bwh in boston massachusetts some bwh orthopedic surgical staff members were concerned about unspecified skin and eye symptoms which they attributed to germicidal uv-c radiation produced by ceiling-mounted uvgi lamps in orthopedic operating rooms ors the use of uvgi in orthopedic ors was investigated by the occupational safety and health administration osha on january 19 2007 in response to a formal complaint submitted after staff discovered that the uvgi lamp controls in an or had been tampered with and set at an inappropriately high setting after an inspection osha recommended that bwh provide annual uv-c and personal protective equipment ppe training and medical screening for all affected employees as well as ensure that all affected employees use the required ppe in july 2008 bwh moved the orthopedic operating suite to an area equipped with laminar airflow and discontinued the use of uvgi for intraoperative infection control niosh investigators recommended the use of alternative infection control technologies such as laminar airflow53
the use of direct uvgi as an air-cleaning method for intraoperative infection control is a relatively uncommon application that has been used by some surgeons since the 1930s54 55 56 some evidence suggests that the use of uvgi in this manner might reduce the incidence of surgical site infections by minimizing intraoperative levels of airborne bacterial contaminants this design differs from upper-room devices in that the uv-c irradiation is directed down to expose the entire or eye protection and other attire are required for those in the or the relative efficacy of direct uvgi on intraoperative air quality and prevention of infection has not been well defined however because studies that have examined its use did so at a variety of uv intensities in association with other infection prevention methods and surgical techniques in addition most studies have been observational beforeafter investigations which are limited by biases and other confounding variables investigators have reported that uvgi is usually used not alone but rather in conjunction with laminar airflow or body exhaust techniques with discrepancies in wound rates under the same conditions56 the cdc recommends against using uvgi to prevent surgical site infections26 overall for general ventilation effectiveness there is little advantage to increasing the effectiveness of the uvgi beyond 4-6 ach uvgi is effective when at low ach and its efficacy diminishes as ach increases because the kill rate is dependent on the duration of exposure to the uv dose with high ach exposure time is significantly decreasedfor personnel safety niosh strongly encourages employers to protect employees using a hierarchy of controls approach the objective of this approach is to minimize the risk of failure of preventive measures resulting in a hazardous exposure according to the hierarchy initial efforts should be made to eliminate the hazardous agent or source of exposure with regard to intraoperative uvgi use this could be achieved by substituting other infection prevention methods or technologies such as vertical laminar air flow before implementing direct uvgi inside the or53 it should be noted that a more recent design for the or uses nonaspirating diffusers with unidirectional airflow over the surgical site but at lower velocities than traditional high-velocity laminar sir flow thereby minimizing the risk of hypothermia this design is now required in the 2010 fgi guidelines36 and is described in detail elsewhere57
given the foregoing discussion we recommend that uvgi system designers take the following considerations into accountapply safety factors to their designs particularly as they depart from operating modes for which they have performance data and field experienceknow the actual lamp output under the most challenging operating conditionsavoid relying solely on design equations to determine the performance of their systems actual testing with the contaminants of interest is highly recommendedview claims regarding uvgi systems high level of inactivation of pathogenic bioaerosols with caution whereas the microbiological science underlying these conclusions applies to pathogenic bioaerosols as well as environmental organisms much greater caution is required in the former case it would be irresponsible to claim a high inactivation rate for a pathogenic bioaerosol without substantial testing even with substantial testing design failures may occur
although many laboratory studies have been conducted to analyze the efficacy of uvgi for numerous microorganisms in a range of temperature and humidity conditions little has been done to evaluate the practical application of uvgi in health care buildings3 in fact beggs et al58 concluded that the knowledge base that exists on uvgi and its application is relatively small and health care authorities have few guidelines on which to make decisionsas discussed earlier potentially infectious droplet nuclei emitted from an infected host might be coated with mucus and consist of more than one bacterium study bacteria aerosolized in deionized water and lacking a mucus coating may be more sensitive to uvgi compared with bacteria in droplet nuclei from an infected host44
uvgi is associated with human health risks and unpredictable results uv rays can cause harm to building occupants if not properly installed and maintained installation techniques widely vary among manufacturers and currently are not regulated by a governing body to ensure proper efficacy of uvgi after installationuvgi lamp manufacturers eg philips pld acknowledge that some important information is not available for example regarding to the sizing of uv lamps for installation in ductwork systems a philips technical document on uv disinfection states that in the calculationit should be emphasized that it results only in a rough estimation we did not incorporate the possible effects of humidity and temperature on the killing rate philips is not a specialist in that field we always advise to contact qualified authorities to evaluate the bacteriological aspects59 the use of cfd models and improved distribution studies on uvgi lamps and fixtures is moving the industry in the right direction the cfd models characterize the room and air distribution in coordination with any uvgi systems applied within the space to evaluate the effectiveness quantitatively3 for uvgi applications in ahu and ductwork maintenance personnel may be at increased risk even if their exposure time to the uvgi irradiation is short because they will be in close proximity to the uvgi sourceservice personnel and occupants are at risk without special care measures service staff need to ensure that the system is turned off when working the need to wear protective clothing and eyewear should be stressed to prevent any possibility of harm to workers room occupants may be exposed to higher doses of uvgi irradiation if the fixtures are not located or installed properly within the space health care providers are at a greater risk because they occupy the space for longer periods than most patients uvgi overexposure has the potential to cause unpleasant eye and skin irritations however these effects appear to be temporary and have involved no known long-term consequences to date60
there is some indication that low rh 25 might adversely affect the ability of uvgi systems to kill or inactivate airborne bacteria additional research is needed in this area research in full-scale rooms to better ascertain the effects of high humidity eg 80 rh on airborne microorganisms is needed as well experimental research has indicated that mechanical ventilation of up to 6 ach does not have a significant effect on the effectiveness of upper-room uvgi systems studies are needed to examine whether mechanical ventilation 6 ach decreases the effectiveness of upper-room uvgi systemstests to determine the relative sensitivity of microorganisms to uvgi are not standardized among laboratories laboratory testing guidelines are needed to ensure that these tests are reproducible and reflect real-world situations laboratory tests of the efficacy of uvgi upper-room systems should be standardized as well protocols for testing and validating upper-room uvgi systems are needed to ensure that the systems perform as designed1
guidelines are needed to determine the most practical method for planning effective uvgi systems in a variety of rooms or areas theoretically cfd modeling can be used to evaluate many of the variables associated with installing an upper-room uvgi system and provide an estimate of the uvgi dose received by droplet nuclei experiments involving photoreactivation of microorganisms in full-scale test rooms should be conducted as should tests of the effectiveness of uvgi on airborne bacteria over a wide range of temperatures in real-world situations potentially infectious droplet nuclei will vary in size and may be coated with sputum both of these factors can decrease the effectiveness of uvgi although some laboratory research has been done to evaluate these parameters34 44 61 more work is needed to further characterize microbial susceptibility to uvgi based on the size of respirable up to 5 m droplet nuclei and droplet nuclei coated with actual or simulated sputumas this and previous literature reviews have shown although numerous studies address the efficacy of uvgi there remains a lack of definitive epidemiologic data demonstrating that these systems prevent hais endemic to health care facilities also lacking is objective reproducible evidence of improved energy efficiency of coils and fans with uvgi systems installed in ahus the efficacy of an upper-room uvgi application depends strongly on sufficient exposure of microorganisms to uv-c which can occur if there is good mixing of upper and lower air in the room or area where installed furthermore there are many marketing claims suggesting that such systems as well as mobile systems will protect occupants against emerging diseases such as sars cov influenza m tuberculosis and bioterrorism agents these claims have not been substantiated by the existing data however and must be weighed against the many variables discussed in this literature review for tb there is ample laboratory and reasonable evidence from animal studies but the key question remains the relative role of uvgi in the context of the hierarchy of controls to prevent health care-associated tbsome of the agents that might be used for bioterrorism such as anthrax spores are not very susceptible to uv-c because the clinical effectiveness of uv systems may vary uvgi is not recommended for air management before air recirculation from airborne isolation rooms it also is not recommended as a substitute for hepa filtration local exhaust of air to the outside or negative pressurethe use of uv lamps and hepa filtration in a single unit offers only minimal infection control benefits over those provided by the use of a hepa filter alone duct systems with uvgi are not recommended as a substitute for hepa filters when the air from isolation rooms must be recirculated to other areas of the facility regular maintenance of uvgi systems involving keeping the bulbs free of dust and replacing old bulbs as necessary is crucial safety issues associated with the use of uvgi systems are described in guidelineswhen uvgi units are required for air cleaning as demonstrated by a risk assessment of the aii area the units should be installed in the exhaust air ducts of the hvac system to supplement hepa filtration when uvgi is used as a supplemental engineering control fixtures should be installed on the wall near the ceiling or suspended from the ceiling as an upper-air unit in the air-return duct of an aii room or in designated enclosed areas or booths for sputum inductionin summing up the role of uvgi in todays health care facilities uvgi should continue to be viewed not a routine replacement for ventilation but rather as a supplement when needed under the conditions and parameters described in this review it does not appear to have a role in the or where air changes are well above 4-6 ach or in properly designed aii rooms many questions remain regarding how to achieve a balance between utility and safety hopefully the necessary research will continuethree different mutually non-exclusive modes of influenza transmission have been identified and discussed so far droplet airborne and contact transmission1 2 3 4 droplet transmission requires the infectious case to directly spray large droplets by coughing or sneezing onto conjunctiva or mucous membranes of a susceptible host airborne transmission through droplet nuclei does not require face-to-face contact with the infectious case droplet nuclei settle from the air slowly are respirable and can thus transmit the virus directly into the alveolar region contact transmission occurs either indirectly through contact with secretions on fomites or directly such as through physical touch between an infected individual and a susceptible host1 5 we need to emphasize that there is no unique and generally agreed-upon classification of airborne droplets for example concerning the aerodynamic diameter d
a which defines the cut-off size between droplet nuclei and large droplets definitions and classifications differ between medicine and aerosol science and depend on explanatory interest when evaluating airborne transmission a cut-off point of 5 m is commonly chosen1 we however propose a post-evaporation value of 10 m because droplets of this size can remain airborne for several minutes the settling time for a 10-m particle from a height of 15 m is 491 s the settling time then drops rapidly with increasing particle size6 in the following we only use the terms droplet nuclei and large droplets table 1
and fig 1
summarize the concepts terms and interrelationships important for the description of transmission modeswhich of the three transmission modes is responsible for most influenza infections remains highly controversial3 4 7 8 9 10 11 12 especially the importance of the airborne pathway via droplet nuclei has proved to be contentious  despite often repeated statements such as influenza virus is readily transmitted by aerosols 13 p 1278 and the obvious importance of knowing the significance of this transmission mode for implementing efficient non-pharmaceutical control measures14 15 16 should for example the use of face masks be recommended during a pandemic when a vaccine is not yet available on the basis of what we know or do not know about airborne or droplet transmission is airborne transmission perhaps only important indoors but not outdoors where virus removal by dilution air circulation and also virus inactivation might be higher how can airborne infections efficiently be controlled in health care settings17 18 19 20 21
one factor contributing to the relative importance of each of the three transmission modes is the inactivation of influenza a viruses in different environmental media sometimes viruses in transmission are described as being outside of their natural habitat17 p 457 transmission however is an integral part of the life cycle of viruses and thus shaped by natural selection22 a full understanding of transmission modes requires a comprehensive understanding of mechanisms on several different levels of organization from virion structure to aspects of human behavior and social organization we consider these latter aspects if necessary but focus on the characteristics of transport medium and their consequences for virus inactivation the empirical study of these issues is never easy but especially challenging for aerosols the size distribution of respiratory aerosols their size changes after expulsion2 and subsequent inhalation23 the pathogen concentration and the mechanisms of virus inactivation are factors that are very difficult to study empirically environmental persistence is key parameter because it can place strict limits on the impact of a transmission pathway despite its probable relevance and possibly because of the empirical challenges the issue of environmental persistence and mode of transmission of influenza a has remained a comparatively neglected topic charles v chapin claimed in 1910 that communicable respiratory infections are transmitted by means of large droplets over short distances or through contact with contaminated surfaces24 this claim has remained dominant ever since the paradigm of droplet and contact transmission experienced a temporary challenge through the pioneering work of william f wells who produced experimental evidence for the existence of droplet nuclei as a means of airborne transmission of respiratory diseases the airborne route of infection and influenza virus inactivation in aerosols was quite intensely researched from the late 1930s to the early 1980s25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 received some still contested epidemiological support45 but then failed to attract noteworthy attention for many years outside the community of influenza researchers the topic of airborne transmission and virus inactivation remained of some interest46 a review concluded that airborne transmission is possible for numerous types of viruses47 in influenza research the airborne route only recently has regained significant and controversial interest3 4 48 49 there appears to be agreement that airborne transmission is at least possible but there is strong disagreement about importance there are a number of reasons for this renewed attention to the airborne transmission route for example the need to consider and develop non-pharmaceutical interventions in case of a pandemic14 15 or emerging diseases such as sars where the transmission mode remained controversial and uncertain for some time and it subsequently turned out that airborne transmission was feasible50 these developments and the threat of bioterrorism51 have reopened and revitalized the debate about the transmission modes of influenzaenvironmental inactivation of influenza a virus also plays an essential role in other controversial issues how does influenza a persist between seasonal epidemics52 53 54 55 is there continuous serial person-to-person transmission or do they survive extended periods in the environment the threat of highly pathogenic avian h5n1 to jump permanently to human hosts has led to the consideration of a transmission pathway that never was judged to be important for human influenza in aquatic birds influenza viruses are transmitted mainly through the fecaloral route56 could ground water lakes and pond sediments or arctic ice serve as long-term reservoirs for the virus and thus start to play a role in the epidemiology of the diseaseour aim here is to draw attention to environmental virus inactivation by emphasizing what role this process may play in the epidemiology of influenza we critically review the available data and attempt to derive at least some robust qualitative conclusions given the differences in methodology in studies conducted in the course of several decades it is hard to derive reliable quantitative patterns we still offer numerical values of inactivation rates derived from the reviewed studies but our conclusions are more an outline of the gaps that need to be closed than the presentation of an unequivocal message we also review recent modeling studies because showing that a certain transmission mode is feasible is not the same as showing that it also is an important pathwaythe question of environmental persistence is connected but not identical to the issue of efficient disinfection57 physical and chemical methods of inactivating influenza viruses and other infective agents can provide insight into mechanisms that determine and limit persistence in other settings we will use evidence from studies on disinfection when appropriate but we will not provide a thorough review of results from this fieldwe attempted to identify all studies that report quantitatively and qualitatively the inactivation of human influenza a viruses in different environmental media without restrictions on publication year in medline and the science citation index we used the search terms influenza virus inactivation environment survival and decay as these terms often failed to identify older literature we also relied on the references provided by the papers found in the database search furthermore we used chapters in relevant booksif measures of initial and final titers and time were given inactivation rates were calculated as lnntlnn0t where t has the unit of days in case the time course of titers was reported a negative exponential function was fitted to estimate  curve fitting was performed using jmp600 if half times t
05 were given  was calculated as ln2t
05 in some cases approximate inactivation rates could be directly read from graphs a number of papers only provide survival times which is the maximum time virus could be detected we report these values but a biological interpretation of these times is difficult and we do not base any conclusions concerning transmission modes on survival timesinfluenza a virions are pleomorphic with shapes ranging from spherical to long filamentous viral morphology is determined by genetic factors viral proteins58 59 and host cell type60 virions contain a lipid envelope which is densely covered by projections there are about 500 individual spikes that cover the surface evenly and comprise the major glycoproteins hemagglutinin ha and neuraminidase na these surface projections are 1014 nm long and 46 nm in diameter the envelope also contains the m2 protein m2 is an integral membrane tetramer which functions as an ion channel virions are composed of 1837 lipids by weight the composition of viral envelope lipids and host cell membranes are similar as the lipids are modified plasma membrane-derived host cellular lipids under the viral envelope there is a m1 protein layer inside the virion the eight segments of linear negative-sense single-stranded rna are bound to the nucleoprotein and to the rna polymerase which is composed of three subunits pb2 pb1 and pa the ns2 protein or nep probably functions as a nuclear export protein for viral rna in infected cells ns1 is the only non-structural protein of influenza virus and seems to regulate viral and cellular protein expressionviral tropism is of fundamental importance to transmission dynamics the ha protein is thought to play a key role in determining host and cellular specificity tropism of human influenza a virus is determined by the binding to glycolipids or glycans that contain terminal sialyl-galactosyl residues with a 2-6 linkage sia2-6 avian viruses bind to sia2-3 another important determinant of tropism is the specificity of the protease cleavage site on the ha protein which in human and avian low-pathogenicity viruses can be cleaved only by trypsin-like proteases present in the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract in highly pathogenic avian viruses this site has mutated and can be cleaved by proteases found in many tissues a number of recent studies attempting to define distribution and targets of human and avian influenza viruses have resulted in a range of sometimes conflicting results61 62 63 these discrepancies make it particularly difficult to identify unambiguously the range of potential target cells of influenza virus contained in aerosol particles of different sizes a precautionary approach suggests that both upper and lower respiratory tract down to the alveoli should be regarded as targetsthe fact that influenza a virions are enveloped by a lipid bilayer is one major determinant of their survival capabilities one broad generalization is that enveloped virions are less stable in the environment than non-enveloped virions there is however considerable variation the enveloped sars coronavirus is quite stable and versatile64 65 66 enveloped viruses belonging to the bunyaviridae family show large differences in their stability outside their hosts67 moreover the above generalization does not tell us very much about the variability in survival ability of influenza viruses with regard to environmental physiological and genetic factors of host and pathogen the ecology of the host organism host cell type used for replication and virus strain can conceivably all influence the ability of a virus to spread using a certain transmission pathwaythe study of the inactivation of influenza virus as a function of relative humidity and temperature has produced contradictory results several investigators found that aerosolized influenza virus survives well at low rh and is inactivated quickly at medium and high rh28 29 31 32 33 34 other researchers identified a distinct survival minimum at middle rh and an increase in survival at high rh30 or at both low and high rh43 low temperatures increase survival at each level of rh33

summarizes the range of daily inactivation rates first-order rate constants for influenza viruses if the value could be estimated from the data or graphs provided some studies only provide maximum survival times and insufficient information on initial titer and it is thus impossible to estimate inactivation rates maximum survival times vary between 1 h 80 rh and 24 h 20 rh29 comparing the survival of human avian swine and equine influenza a viruses in aerosols it was found that equine and avian influenza viruses survive much longer in the airborne state 2436 h than human influenza viruses 918 h39 41 these experiments suffer from a number of serious problems that severely limit their value they were performed at 75 rh virus preparations were not quantified with any degree of precision and human influenza viruses were grown in embryonated eggs at the suboptimal temperature of 37 cmany studies addressing the topic of rh and influenza a virus inactivation were motivated by the strong seasonality of inter-pandemic influenza in higher latitudes the experimental results cited above imply that low rh in heated indoor environments in winter support influenza virus survival a predominantly indoor living mode during this time of year facilitates transmission and the outbreak of epidemics it has been suggested that enveloped viruses in general show this pattern of rh- and temperature-dependence75 several recent epidemiological studies on influenza in the tropical regions put into doubt this generalization in the city of pune in western india the highest numbers of influenza a isolates are identified in the rainy months from july to september76 and in dakar senegal influenza incidence peaks during the hot and rainy season77 in north-east brazil peak periods of influenza a and b also occurred during the rainy season78 in equatorial brazil peak influenza activity coincides with periods of high humidity whereas colder temperatures are associated with increased viral activity in subtropical regions of brazil79 however epidemics also occurred in these countries outside of the rainy season80 81 and there is no correlation between rainfall and influenza virus activity82 the findings on influenza in tropical regions thus do not offer a clear-cut picture of seasonality but they strongly suggest that the seasonal timing of outbreaks is not driven exclusively by the rh-dependence of virus inactivation in aerosols31 a recent hypothesis states that in the tropics contact transmission might predominate whereas in temperate climate airborne transmission prevails48 in conditions of high humidity exhaled respiratory droplets will grow and thus settle quickly on surfaces and become available for contact transmission this explanation fails to convince it is realistic to assume that the size distribution of expelled respiratory droplets is created at 100 rh at the moment of expulsion even at a high rh of 80 respiratory droplets quickly decrease in diameter7 water droplets with a diameter of 1 m evaporate within a few milliseconds even at high rh droplets with a diameter of 100 m survive up to 1 min at high rh the time dependent equation for the droplet diameter dt after an expiratory event shows that the droplet diameter at time t converges to its initial value d
0 as the relative humidity increases2 the presence of nonvolatile solutes in the expulsed material does not significantly change these patterns after a cough or sneeze there will be more large droplets at high rh than at low rh available to settle on surfaces but there will also remain plenty of airborne fine droplets in both situations it seems therefore unlikely that a change to a high rh can tip the balance so that contact transmission becomes dominant over airborne transmission a recent paper49 modifies the earlier hypothesis and argues that transmission by contact is insensitive to rh and temperature with the result that influenza can occur throughout the year in the tropics however no data are provided on the inactivation of virus on surfaces as a function of temperature or rh we are aware of only one study that investigates the outcome of drying on glass slides on the infectivity of influenza a virus83 at 20 rh and 20 c they found an inactivation rate of 38 day1 at 84 rh and 20 c an inactivation rate of 77 day1 these data suggest that inactivation on non-porous surfaces is sensitive to rh however the suggestion that differences in inactivation-dependencies in aerosols and on surfaces may lead to changes in transmission regimes is interesting and merits comprehensive experimental scrutinyultraviolet radiation in the sunlight is a major natural virucidal agent in the outdoor environment13 84 85 86 87 and very efficiently inactivates the enveloped mhv coronavirus88 expected uv inactivation of influenza a virus by solar uv radiation in various cities of the world can reach values from negligible to 21 day1 in higher latitude cities winter uv-inactivation rates are generally below 23 day1 and could thus allow aerosolized virions to survive for several days13 the claim that solar uv radiation can have an effect several orders of magnitude stronger than changes of relative humidity or of temperature13 is based on the erroneous assumption that the inactivation rates calculated in an earlier paper31 are daily rates however rates are reported with the unit of min1 and the daily inactivation rates caused by changes in relative humidity are in fact in the same order of magnitude as the expected uv-inactivation rates89
the term open air factor oaf aptly describes the ill-defined character of this agent outside air often proved to be much more toxic to microorganisms than inside air under the same conditions of photoactivity rh and temperature90 subsequent work demonstrated that no single factor was responsible for this toxic property of outside air but that oaf represents a collection of highly reactive chemical species most likely the products of reactions of ozone with olefins91 ozone can be a potent inactivator of viruses and appears to be especially effective if the fluids to be treated are nebulized92 so far with respect to oaf only the inactivation of non-enveloped viruses has been investigated in the phage x174 oaf damages both the protein coat and the dna the impact of outdoor air on microbial survival was nearly completely ignored for at least two decades but some limited interest is re-emerging connected to using synthetic oaf as a novel decontaminant93
little is known about the actual biophysical and biochemical processes of influenza virus inactivation the airborne environment is hostile to microorganisms owing to desiccation radiation ozone and pollutants an influenza virus can be inactivated by damaging the rna the protein coat or the lipid bilayer and the associated glycoproteins only inactivation of viral rna through uv radiation represents a straightforward mechanism of inactivation decreasing temperature increases the lipid ordering of the envelope and thus perhaps the stability of influenza a94 the effect of rh on influenza virus suggests a crucial role of water in inactivation processes water is essential in the formation and maintenance of the bilayer structure of the viral envelope perhaps this integrity is guaranteed at low to medium rh the inactivation of suspended virus by shaking is correlated with the generation of a continuously renewing airwater interface95 because of their hydrophobic nature lipid-containing viruses tend to accumulate at the surface of droplets and there they might be subjected to surface forces that destroy the lipid bilayerthese data and considerations suggest that at least in indoor environments airborne transmission through fine droplets may be a plausible pathway at low rh and low to moderately high temperature up to 25 c and if not exposed to uv radiation and pollutants influenza a viruses may remain alive and infectious for a considerable time in the airborne state taking into account that the airborne infectious dose id50 the dose that infects 50 of the exposed persons is in the range of only 0630 tissuecultureid5037 transmission through fine droplets becomes even more plausible droplet transmission is usually considered to be the most important transmission mode but transmission through this pathway is most likely a rare event96 inactivation is unlikely to be a limiting factor for droplet transmission but calculations based on the aerodynamics of large droplets show that even a close cough is unlikely to cause infection whereas a close unprotected horizontally directed sneeze may be potent enough to cause droplet transmission96 it remains unknown how common such an event is but such sneezes are probably quite rare in adults droplet transmission through is also constrained by the infectious dose the nasal infectious dose is in the range of 1001000 tcid50
97 98 we could find no estimates for the ocular infectious dose of influenza a the human conjunctival epithelium does not express the sia2-6 but rather the sia2-399 so human influenza viruses cannot infect the epithelium it remains to be seen whether viruses inoculated in the eye could find their way to the nasal mucosa through the lacrymal ducts in sufficient amount to initiate an infection it has to be emphasized that all these are considerations based on plausible mechanisms and estimatesassuming that fomite transmission in most cases involves hands droplet deposition on surfaces  transfer from surface to hand  transfer to mucosa or conjunctiva then inactivation on the environmental surface and on human skin will be the two major limiting factors enveloped viruses such as parainfluenza virus or 6 have a very low survival on hands100 101 102 103 and this appears to be the case for influenza a virus as well104 105 for inanimate surfaces porosity is a major factor influencing inactivation rates at 3540 rh typical for indoor environments influenza a virus survives for more than 2448 h on stainless steel and plastic surfaces but drops to undetectable levels after 812 h on porous surfaces such as paper tissue pajamas or paper105 transfer of viable influenza a virus from paper tissue to hands was only possible for 15 min but transfer from stainless steel to hands for 24 h the first-order inactivation rates of viruses on porous surfaces are approximately 24 day1 and 29 day1 on stainless steel the latter value is an order of magnitude lower than the value reported for glass surfaces83 after the transfer to hands from both surface types viable virus fell to low titers within 5 min first-order inactivation rates on hands range from 1300 to 2100 day1 high spontaneous decay of influenza a virus on skin was also found in another study106 on swiss banknotes influenza a viruses of the subtypes h1n1 and h3n2 have very low inactivation rates107 h1n1 shows a low inactivation rate of approximately 005 day1 the surprising finding is that influenza amoscow1099 h3n2 showed no significant inactivation whatsoever after 10 days nasal mucus has a strong survival enhancing effect probably mediated in part through stabilization by proteins and salts43 this might explain why influenza a virus can be detected on a wide range of fomites in homes and day care centers108
the type of metal can strongly affect inactivation rates influenza a remains viable for more than 24 h on stainless steel surfaces but no more than 6 h on copper the respective inactivation rates are 14 day1 and 332 day1109 this study was performed at 22 c and 5060 rh the value for stainless steel is close to the value reported above influenza a virus on surfaces is rh sensitive as well virus deposited and dried on glass slides shows the same pattern of rh sensitivity as in the airborne state83
the claim that avian influenza virus of the type h13n7 survives better on non-porous than on porous surfaces110 is based on maximum detection times which will depend on initial titer not on inactivation or survival rates some of the calculated inactivation rates do not support the claim made by the authors the first-order inactivation rate constants are for example 169 day1 on steel 132 day1 on tiles 058 day1 on cotton fabric and 10 day1 on feathers the rh in which the experiments were conducted is not reportedthe highest inactivation rates of human influenza a virus thus occur on hands the transfer of virus to hands appears to be a critical bottleneck for contact transmission via fomites if however there is a constantly renewed standing stock of influenza viruses on surfaces and frequent hand contact with these surfaces then even short survival times of influenza virus on human skin might make contact transmission probable if people are not directly observed nose-picking and eye-rubbing occur at a rate of approximately 04 h1 if people are facing each other the rate is 10 times smaller111 these data suggest that the importance of contact transmission will depend on the environmental context the significance of environmental context ie type of surfaces and presence of observers will interact with physiological mechanisms as already mentioned above the nasal infectious dose id50 is in the range of 1001000 tcid50 whereas the airborne id50 is in the range of 0630 tcid50 still given these differences in id50 it is difficult to judge intuitively which mode of transmission will prevail in a setting like a crowded train cinema or theatre even if surfaces are heavily loaded and constantly re-seeded with viruses they might not survive long enough on hands as people might be reluctant to pick noses or display any other behavior that may result in self-inoculation infection through large droplets or droplet nuclei might be more likely in such a settingthe risk of infection through contact with fomites might be considerable if non-porous surfaces such as door handles light switches or telephone buttons in anonymous but highly frequented settings such as hotel rooms112 public toilets or lobbies are involved there because of lower inactivation rates on such non-porous surfaces high virus loads could accumulate and self-inoculating behavior may be more frequent because people feel unobserved the finding that influenza a can survive many days on objects such as banknotes107 that are frequently exchanged between persons is especially interesting and worryingthe waterborne route of transmission is traditionally not considered to be relevant for respiratory viruses the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus h5n1 as a perceived pandemic threat has changed this situation like most viruses that cause disease in humans113 influenza virus is a multi-host pathogen influenza a viruses have been isolated from many animal species including birds pigs horses canines and sea mammals114 wild aquatic birds predominantly dabbling ducks appear to be the reservoir of influenza a viruses115 all 16 subtypes of influenza a occur in birds and they usually do not cause overt disease symptoms but they may cause decreased performance during physiologically demanding phases in the annual cycle116 117
avian influenza viruses can be isolated from natural open fresh water118 in wild birds influenza is mainly transmitted through the fecaloral route56 infected droppings nasal secretions or saliva from infected birds will enter the water environments where the birds aggregate and be ingested when the birds feed in the water scenarios describing the possible pathways avian influenza viruses  and especially highly pathogenic h5n1  may adapt to transmission in humans and cause a new pandemic have been rehearsed frequently119 transmission pathways and target tissues play a central role in these scenarios for instance the pathogenesis of h5n1 in mammals raises some new concerns about the waterborne route in cats h5n1 replicates in multiple extra-respiratory tissues including cells in the small intestine120 alternatively birds like the quail may act as the route modulator that changes the pathway from fecaloral to airborne transmission121
in this context of speculative scenarios the influenza-related risk posed by water resources water supplies and sanitation has received some limited attention122 there is apparently no quantitative information on the inactivation of human influenza a viruses in open liquid water h1 sequences have been isolated from siberian lake water but no further information on inactivation rates is provided123 the most recent work on low- and high-pathogenic avian influenza virus inactivation in water investigates 8 subtypes of low-pathogenic avian influenza lpai viruses and two strains of high-pathogenic h5n1 anyang01 and mongolia05124 virus inactivation depends on pathogenicity salinity and temperature see table 3
 survival decreases with salinity and temperature and lpai survive longer than hpai these results imply that avian influenza viruses can under circumstances of low salinity and low temperatures persist many weeks in water the fact that high-pathogenic avian influenza virus h5n1 has a lower persistence than low-pathogenic subtypes contradicts the claim that high virulence should be positively correlated with durability outside the host22
it is unclear how significant a role persistence of influenza a in water may play in the transmission dynamics during an epidemic or pandemic however inactivation in water could affect the long-term epidemiology and evolution of avian influenza viruses the fact that avian influenza viruses can potentially persist several months in water affects the way the concept of a reservoir for influenza is defined a reservoir can be defined as one or more epidemiologically connected populations or environments in which the pathogen can be permanently maintained and from which infection is transmitted to the defined target population125 like soil is an important environmental reservoir of insect-pathogenic viruses126 ponds or sediments of ponds127 and lakes could act as environmental reservoirs for avian influenza virusesinfluenza a virus genes have been isolated from siberian lake ice and the claim has been put forward that environmental ice and snow can act as a long-term abiotic reservoir for these viruses123 it has been maintained that freezing especially without cycles of thawing and refreezing can maintain the integrity and viability of the majority of viruses128 these observations are problematic in several respects influenza a virus quickly loses infectivity if stored at 20 c and below it retains however infectivity at temperatures below 70 c129 furthermore viruses were detected using rt-pcr and the actual infectivity of recovered influenza viruses was never tested moreover it is possible that the detection of influenza a virus genes was caused by laboratory contamination130 there is thus still no credible evidence that environmental ice acts as a biologically relevant reservoir for influenza virusesthe ability to recover active viruses from some environmental medium for example aerosols does not prove that transmission via this medium is in fact responsible for many or most naturally occurring infections mathematical modeling has so far been a rarely used resource in attempts to understand the interaction of factors that affect transmission the immediate usefulness of mathematical models depends of course very much on the availability and reliability of parameter estimates unfortunately for many crucial parameters that enter into mathematical models no reliable estimates are available until such parameter values are available mathematical models still remain a useful and powerful tool to investigate a range of plausible scenarios and to identify potentially critical parametersestimates of pathogen emission rates of airborne pathogen concentration as a function of equilibrium droplet diameter of the expected number and size of inspired and respired droplets and of the infectious dose can be used to calculate the airborne infection risk in a well-mixed room wmr construct2 the wmr construct implies that the estimate is reasonable for persons not close to the emission source for myobacterium tuberculosis a risk of 079 is calculated for 1 h of exposure assuming an inactivation rate of 277 day1 this estimate relies on the assumption that one bacterium may be enough to cause an infection estimates of the minimum infective dose for tuberculosis range from 1 to 5 bacili131 for influenza the airborne infectious dose id50 see above is approximately 067 tcid50 for virus reaching the respiratory epithelium96 it is not clear how many virions correspond to one unit of tcid50 reported ratios of tcid50 to number of virions are 1100 1400 and 1650132 133 134 a rough calculation based on volumes of droplets and virions suggests that between 103 and 107 virions fit into droplets with diameters between 1 and 10 m these numbers do not take into account virus inactivation or packing and thus give an upper limit for the number of infective virions per droplet these estimates however show that a dose of 067 tcid50 could easily fit into one droplet therefore the risk calculated for m tuberculosis might furnish us at least with a reasonable estimate of the order of magnitude of the risk for airborne infection of influenza a second more detailed approach presents an integrated model of the different modes of transmission which provides a quantification of the rates of pathogen transfer at different steps of the transmission pathways19 in addition also the pathogen dose and infection risk to a health care worker hcw in a scenario in which the hcw attends a patient with a transmissible respiratory disease is estimated the model considers inhalation of aerosol respiratory droplet spray and contact transmission via surfaces for close contact events the authors calculate the infection risk per cough given that the hcw is at close range at the moment of the patients cough for estimating the risk through contact transmission it is assumed that the hcw spends 15 min in the vicinity of the patient in their scenario the infection risk due to droplet spray is 50-fold greater than infection risk due to respirable pathogens 0021 vs 45  104 the infection risk due to hand contact with mucous membranes is 0029 the calculated risks will depend very much on the specific pathogen one assumption is for example that inactivation rates are the same for aerosols on porous and non-porous inanimate surfaces and on hands for influenza such an assumption would certainly overestimate the risk of infection through contact transmission because virus survival on hands is very lowa similar approach provides a detailed mathematical model of rhinovirus and influenza infection risk due to airborne and contact transmission in a four-person household96 and the analysis is not limited by the wmr assumptions the conclusion of the analysis is that airborne transmission is more dominant than contact transmission for interpandemic influenza they also analyze separately the situation of a close expiratory event cough and sneeze with the result that the likelihood of droplet transmission from a close unprotected event is rather small events of this type are likely to be rare and data are insufficient to assess the relative importance of airborne and droplet transmission thus droplet transmission might also be possible but the results strongly indicate a dominance of airborne transmission for influenzastilianakis  drossinos unpubl work develop a sir susceptible-infected-recovered model to study the contribution of airborne droplets 10 m post-evaporation and contact transmission during an influenza epidemic in a closed population they conclude that respirable droplets are a possible transmission vector for influenza virus and that the relative importance of airborne and contact transmission depends on model parameters such as inactivation rates for which better estimates are neededfor influenza none of the three possible transmission modes has unambiguously been demonstrated to be responsible for most infections a number of reasons seem to be responsible for this state of affairs first this reflects lack of profound interest  influenza was rarely perceived to be a critical threat to public health and the dogma of large droplet transmission was only rarely challenged the risk perception concerning influenza has though undoubtedly changed in the past few years second there are serious methodological difficulties studying transmission of influenza quick and accurate diagnosis of early stages of influenza was always hard and this renders detailed epidemiological studies of outbreak and transmission dynamics challenging many epidemiological studies in closed communities health care settings schools etc still analyze respiratory illness based on symptoms and do not differentiate between the causes third there is a lack of knowledge concerning fundamental biological and physical parameters affecting transmission pathways and disciplinary boundaries impeding the transfer reception and acceptance of information inactivation of influenza a virus in different environmental media and the dynamic processes determining the fate of aerosols expelled by coughs or sneezes are two critical factors potentially affecting the epidemiology of the disease there is an undisputable need for more information concerning the inactivation of influenza viruses quite a number of studies investigated the survival of the influenza virus in different media but most of the studies are several decades old in contrast the physical dynamics of aerosols are in fact well-known2 but the complexities are often not appreciated in the biomedical literature on influenza and fourth influenza can probably be transmitted via all three pathways thus it is perhaps not surprising that no single mode can be blamed for most infections however given the need to formulate robust and efficient non-pharmaceutical control measures in case of a new pandemic more quantitative estimates for the importance of the different transmission modes are called forour survey demonstrates that some general findings can be identified from the studies investigating virus inactivation these findings in combination with theoretical and empirical findings from aerosol science show that to phrase it carefully airborne transmission of influenza cannot be dismissed to phrase it more boldly under some circumstances airborne transmission may even be dominant let us quickly summarize the findings on virus inactivation and aerosol dynamics aerosolized influenza viruses are stable at low rh and low to moderately high temperatures conflicting experimental evidence and the epidemiology of influenza in tropical regions cast some doubt on the finding that high rh significantly decreases virus survival the inactivation rate constants found in these studies can differ by several orders of magnitude on inanimate surfaces and in aerosols these rates are in the order of 1102 on hands in the order of 103 the lowest inactivation rates  in the order of 101102  are reported for avian influenza viruses in cool water with low salinity half-life of influenza a viruses in aerosols can thus range from 1 to 16 h assuming a well-mixed room setting and given the low airborne infectious dose it seems likely that virus inactivation will not critically constrain airborne transmission via fine droplets high inactivation rates on hands however may limit contact transmissionit still remains very difficult to assess the relative importance of transmission through large droplets vs droplet nuclei because very different mechanisms are at play in the two cases droplet transmission requires the direct deposition of large droplets on the mucosa of a susceptible person and only mechanisms that occur immediately after expulsion 1 s in a restricted space around the event matter therefore virus inactivation and gravitational settling of particles do not play a major role in order for droplet transmission to occur infected and susceptible persons have to be in close contact several tens of cm apart of comparable height and the sneeze or cough has to be directed in the right direction the stopping distances of expelled particles provide another telling illustration of the complexities involved in droplet transmission particles smaller than 488 m cough or 232 m sneeze will not travel further than 60 cm96 in contrast contact transmission via fomites and airborne transmission via fine droplets will depend on mechanisms that occur at different spatial scales and over longer time-periods the size distribution of expelled particles equilibrates nearly instantaneously through very rapid evaporation2 large particles settle quickly on surfaces and fine particles can remain airborne for considerable time the risk of infection will thus depend on the interaction of virus inactivation infectious dose and on behavioral parameters there is insufficient information to quantify reliably the risk of influenza a infection via fomites or through the airborne route but reported values for virus inactivation and infectious dose make it plausible that transmission through both pathways can occur however transmission through fomites probably depends far more on flexible context-dependent behaviors than airborne transmission it is also important to note that influenza virus can show unexpectedly high stability on some non-biological surfaces107
the theoretical analyses2 19 96 all agree that the airborne route can significantly contribute to the infection risk all these approaches show that mathematical models can provide interesting insights mathematical models can comprehensively describe fundamental physical processes eg the fast evaporation rate or the settling velocity of droplets of different sizes which set the boundary conditions for a biological process such as the airborne transmission of a pathogen such theoretical analyses can help in testing and evaluating scenarios and thus can contribute significantly to the understanding of transmission mechanismsanalyses that attempt to clarify the effects of control measures on the spread of respiratory infectious diseases merely offer clues on the importance of contact transmission and only very few studies directly address influenza an unspecific measure such as handwashing can be effective against the main respiratory viruses including influenza136 a quantitative review finds that hand cleansing can cut the risk of respiratory infection by 16137 this suggests that in hospital and care settings contact transmission is important hand hygiene can reduce respiratory infection risk also in home and community settings138 face masks obstruct all transmission pathways because they block both the source and the main entry pathways of respiratory viruses wearing simple face masks significantly reduced the risk of infection from sars-cov139 140 n95 masks are even more effective141 if these findings are relevant for influenza is unknown the private and public control measures implemented during the 2003 sars outbreak in hong kong also reduced the incidence of other respiratory illnesses such as rsv parainfluenza and influenza142
this review also directs the view towards additional topics that are interesting and require more attention beyond the identification of some very broad generalizations the characteristics of viruses that determine their environmental persistence remain largely unknown influenza viruses are enveloped they are assembled at the plasma membrane of the host cell and bud from lipid micro-domains called lipid rafts143 the relationship between virus envelope and host cell membrane composition is complex it is beyond the scope of this review to go into details of the biochemistry and biophysics of lipid membranes but a few points deserve mentioning it has long been known that the lipid composition of the viral and cellular membrane can differ significantly144 on the other hand various strains of the influenza a virus have different fatty acid compositions even if they are derived from the same cell type145 it remains to be convincingly shown in which way the lipids and other components of the host cell play a role in determining the phenotype and thus the phenotypeenvironment interaction of enveloped viruseswe believe that the biology of virus inactivation and the physics of aerosols make it likely that the airborne route is a potentially important transmission pathway for influenza in indoor environments especially in unventilated conditions it also seems likely that the importance of droplet transmission has been overrated even if this conclusion is accepted there are no easy and immediate recommendations for the design of control measures because many other considerations have to be taken into account for example face masks can make breathing difficult and are frequently improperly donned146 compliance with quarantine measures was low during the 2003 sars crisis in canada and this measure caused psychological distress147 given the costs and the uncertainty of the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical control measures such as face masks and quarantine there is an urgent need for further empirical and theoretical research on the transmission pathways of influenza virusesto track some of the trends in the infection prevention and control literature since the last his conference in late 2012 i plugged some search terms into google trends a facility that compares the variation in volume of searches for selected terms over time one infection control trend trumped all others ebola figure 1 figure 2
 whereas trends in google searches may not necessarily correlate with trends in the infection prevention and control literature in this case it is true that the outbreak of ebola in west africa has prompted a lot of publications in the literature  as well as consuming an awful lot of professional time for all who are connected with hospital infection prevention and control aside from ebola other trends in the infection prevention and control literature covered in this article include middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov universal versus targeted interventions faecal microbiota transplantation whole genome sequencing carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae cre and some aspects of environmental science finally i attempt to predict some of the trends in the infection prevention and control literature between now and the next his conference in 2016a few weeks before his 2012 a novel coronavirus was reported in saudi arabia that was subsequently named middle eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov1 2 much like severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus before it mers-cov is associated with unnervingly high mortality 30 and its potential for airborne dissemination gastrointestinal shedding and asymptomatic carriage present infection prevention and control challenges3 most of the 600 cases reported to date have occurred in the middle east mainly saudi arabia but a few cases have occurred elsewhere including the uk and usa4 the management of mers in saudi arabia has been shrouded in controversy with missing cases reported months after they occurred5 how to safely manage mers-cov in developed healthcare systems has also been controversial with questions over whether airborne or droplet precautions are necessary to contain the virus recent data indicate that small droplet nuclei may be emitted most of the time by influenza-infected patients which argues for airborne precautions for mers-cov6 a hospital outbreak in jeddah in saudi arabia put the world on red alert in preparation for a pandemic but that outbreak was contained and few cases are being reported currentlyby contrast the outbreak of ebola infection continues unabated in west africa there have been more than 10000 cases in the current outbreak around five times more cases of ebola than had ever been reported prior to this outbreak furthermore the three secondary transmissions that have occurred from the 13 cases cared for outside of west africa to date two in the usa and one in spain have pushed the ebola crisis to the top of the agenda of many hospitals around the world this has led to a degree of politicization where regional and national decisions are made for political reasons rather than based on evidence resulting in measures such as mandatory quarantine airport screening and immigration bans7 8
politicization aside research performed during the current outbreak has provided some new insight into the epidemiology of ebola it is most usually transmitted through direct contact with blood or body fluids including droplet sprays through broken skin or mucous membranes9 10 however transmission can also occur though indirect contact with contaminated environments9 10 11 12 indeed one outbreak report from sierra leone identified incorrect personal protective equipment ppe for cleaning staff as a likely contributor to transmission12 furthermore despite being enveloped viruses ebola and indeed mers-cov has the capacity to survive on dry surfaces for days not hours13 14 15 one study even suggests an ebola survival time measured in weeks but this study was done at 4c so does not represent field conditions15 these in-vitro survival times combined with the potential for blood and body fluid contamination argue for careful attention to cleaning and disinfection when caring for patients with ebola virus diseaseseveral studies have evaluated the basic reproductive number r
0 for ebola infection in field settings which seems to be 2 one study found that r
0 is significantly higher in non-survivors 236 than in survivors 066 reinforcing the suggestion that contact with patients in the latter stages of disease is the most important risk factor for acquiring ebola virus16
another area of controversy has been the appropriate type of ppe when dealing with ebola earlier us recommendations were upgraded following the transmissions in dallas and now recommend a no skin in the game approach where all skin is covered17 however having the right ppe policy is only part of the solution  you also need to ensure ppe supply and that staff know how to don and doff it safely18 19
several high-profile studies have suggested that we should move away from targeted interventions particularly screening and decolonization towards universal interventions such as chlorhexidine daily bathing for all intensive care unit icu patients20 21 the most persuasive evidence for a universal approach involves the use of chlorhexidine for daily bathing for all icu patients it is worth noting in passing that this is not a truly universal approach since it is applied to a targeted population the studies are impressive especially in terms of design and to a lesser degree in terms of impact table i
22 23 24 25 similarly the use of antibiotics for selective digestive decontamination sdd or selective oral decontamination sod has been advocated for all icu patients again the study design and impact are impressive with reduced transmission and reduced mortality table ii
26 27 28 29 however indiscriminate use of biocides such as chlorhexidine and especially antibiotics is not without collateral damage30 several studies have reported increased antibiotic resistance associated with sod and sdd and other studies have reported reduced bacterial susceptibility associated with universal use of chlorhexidine28 31 32 33 34 so we need to consider carefully the downside before wholeheartedly adopting universal decolonizationanother universal strategy that has been evaluated recently is the universal use of gloves and gowns for the care of icu patients35 this impressive cluster-randomized controlled trial failed to meet the primary endpoint a reduction in a composite measure of mrsa and vancomycin-resistant enterococci vre although mrsa was reduced furthermore compliance with glove and gowning was high in the study 85 whereas another study monitoring glove and gown use in the real world recorded much lower compliance 2936 compliance with correct use of gloves and gowns fell as the proportion of patients on contact precautions increased36 also the over-use of gloves can result in unexpected risks for example wearing the same pair of gloves for too long37 so there is unlikely to be a rush of hospitals implementing universal glove and gown policiesthe question of whether all patients should be given a single room was the subject of a recent bmj debate38 single rooms are associated with lower rates of healthcare-associated infection some patients report high levels of satisfaction and the reduction in interruptions during patient contact leads to fewer mix-up errors39 40 41 42 43 44 45 on the other hand caring for patients in multi-occupancy bays is associated with a reduced risk of adverse events patients in single rooms often report less social contact and feelings of isolation and bays require a lower staffing ratio45 46 47 48 49 so should hospitals provide all patients with single rooms the jury is outa stunning study published in the new england journal of medicine evaluated the impact of faecal microbiota transplantation fmt for the treatment of recurrent c difficile infection cdi figure 3
50 patients were randomized to receive either fmt or standard vancomycin treatment the cure rate with fmt was 90 compared with 30 for vancomycin the difference was so stark that the trial was stopped early it therefore seems that fmt will soon become the standard of care for recurrent cdi however fmt as it stands is currently crude in every sense involving an infusion of donor stool another option is an oral dose of donor stool in carefully developed capsules known colloquially as crapsules which is as effective as a duodenal infusion51 finally we are moving ever closer to a synthetic fmt using a carefully configured live bacterial cocktail52
however recurrent cdi is just the first of many potential applications for fmt as well as aiming to develop microbiome-sparing therapy we should be advancing techniques to maintain and restore indigenous microbiota30 this could be applied not only for the treatment of disease but also for decolonization of people carrying pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract without the use of antibiotics53 in the wider field of medicine the importance of a healthy gut microbiome is becoming apparent and may be key in new understanding of inflammatory bowel disease obesity diabetes neurologic disorders and so on30
a landmark study published in the new england journal of medicine has challenged the status quo of our understanding of the epidemiology of cdi54 the researchers used whole genome sequencing wgs to type c difficile from each of their 1250 cdi cases over five years only around a third of the cases were closely related genetically suggesting that transmission from other symptomatic cases occurs much less frequently than previously thought however another recent study used multi-locus variable number of tandem repeat analysis mlva to type c difficile from each of their hospital-acquired cdi cases and from other sources and found that around a third of cdi cases were genetically related to symptomatic cases as with the oxford study54 but an additional third of cases were genetically related to asymptomatic carriers of c difficile figure 4
55 so is it time to start screening and isolating asymptomatic carriers of toxigenic c difficileanother application of wgs that has emerged in recent years is to dissect outbreak epidemiology with unprecedented detail for example during an outbreak of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae a us team was able to turn a plate of spaghetti map of epidemiologically related contacts into a clear transmission map by laying wgs data over epidemiological contacts56
carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae cre have prompted an enormous amount of interest in the last few years cre more than any other organism have led to dire warning from world leaders on the impending post-antibiotic era both the uk and us governments have published cre toolkits so that hospitals can prepare and manage problems due to cre effectively57 58 the prevalence of cre in the uk seems to be low at present judging by the prevalence of carbapenem resistance in invasive k pneumoniae isolates reported to the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance network ears-net 159 however the number of referrals to public health england is increasing and there are parts of the uk with more established problems58 the picture from elsewhere is more disturbing for example there has been a sharp increase in cre in italy since 2009 and one recent study reported a high level of colistin resistance 43 of 191 cre isolates from 21 laboratories across italy60 there has been a progressive increase in cre in the usa with the rate of carbapenem resistance in klebsiella species increasing from 2 in 2001 to 10 in 2011 figure 5
61 furthermore there have been some shocking reports from some us regions for example 30 of patients in chicago long-term acute care hospitals carried cre in a point prevalence survey and the rate in individual facilities ranged from 10 to almost 6062
what should we do to prevent and control the spread of cre and other multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms the european society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases escmid has published comprehensive guidelines outlining the core principles of prevention and control including active surveillance contact precautions antibiotic stewardship hand hygiene and cleaning and disinfection63 however we still do not really know what is effective in controlling multidrug-resistant gram-negatives in general and cre in particular some interesting analysis of gram-negative outbreak reports found that bundled interventions were less likely to fail than single interventions64 put another way when in doubt throw in the kitchen sinka key question for some time has been whether automated room disinfection systems are able to reduce the rate of transmission compared with conventional cleaning and disinfection65 a us study found that patients admitted to rooms decontaminated using hydrogen peroxide vapour hpv were 64 less likely to acquire multidrug-resistant organisms than patients admitted to rooms disinfected using standard methods66 although this study is not without its problems as outlined in accompanying editorial it does reinforce the need to do a better job of cleaning and disinfection particularly at the time of patient discharge67
there has been an explosion of interest in the potential use of ultraviolet uv-based systems for automated room disinfection65 our understanding of these systems is evolving rapidly and the following now seem clear uv-c is fundamentally different to pulsed-xenon uv px-uv65 uv systems are more effective than conventional cleaning and disinfection68 69 uv systems are faster and easier but less effective than hpv70 uv systems are less effective out of direct line of sight using multiple locations in the room helps to mitigate this70 71 some evidence is emerging that uv room disinfection reduces transmission72 the results of a us centers for disease control and prevention-funded study in progress into the clinical impact of uv for terminal room disinfection are eagerly awaitedthere has been much interest in the potential for antimicrobial surfaces to provide a continuous reduction in the level of microbes on hospital surfaces73 a us study evaluated the impact of introducing copper hand-touch surfaces into icu rooms74 the randomized study of 614 patients in three icus found that patients admitted to copperized rooms had significantly less healthcare-associated infection or colonization the study has come under fire for some aspects of its design and reporting but it does provide compelling data that antimicrobial surfaces should be evaluated further75 76
an age-old question is whether contaminated hands or surfaces are more important in the transmission of healthcare-associated infection a model provides new insight into this question77 the model simulates patient-to-patient transmission in a 20-bed icu 100 simulations were run for each pathogen of interest evaluating the impact of stepwise changes in hand hygiene or terminal cleaning compliance the key finding is that improvements in hand hygiene compliance are more or less twice as effective in preventing the transmission of mdr acinetobacter baumannii mrsa or vre ie a 20 improvement in terminal cleaning is required to match a 10 improvement in hand hygiene compliance however although this may be overstretching the model it appears that improving terminal cleaning may make more impact than improving hand hygiene at higher levels of compliance figure 6

a recent australian study discovered biofilms some containing viable mrsa on dry hospital surfaces78 there are important implications if the presence of biofilms on dry hospital surfaces turns out to be a widespread occurrence biofilms could explain why vegetative bacteria can survive on dry hospital surfaces for so long be part of the reason why they are so difficult to remove or inactivate using disinfectants and explain to some degree the difficulty in recovering environmental pathogens by surface sampling79 80 further work is required to explore the prevalence and composition of biofilms on dry hospital surfaceslooking into my crystal ball for his in 2016 it seems unlikely that the ebola outbreak will be ongoing in west africa and i hope that we will have seen the last of mers-cov however pandemic influenza will be around for at least as long as mankind it does seem likely that there will be a move towards universal interventions the impressive data on fmt is likely to continue it will quickly become the standard of care for recurrent cdi and other applications will come through wgs is unlikely to be so topical only because it will increasingly become a standard tool used for day-to-day hospital epidemiology i am sure that environmental science will continue to grow and the global cre epidemic curve will only go one way upwards finally as financial constraints continue to squeeze us studies of cost-effectiveness and healthcare economics will become increasingly important to direct our precious resourcesa team from imperial college london evaluated twitter trends relating to antibiotics finding that peak twitter activity correlated neatly with various antibiotic-related national and international announcements81 regardless of how you feel about social media it is good to see that the issue of antibiotic resistance is receiving considerable public attentionthe author is employed part-time by bioquellnonethe sars outbreak has been identified in more than 30 countries in five continents affecting more than 8000 people predominantly in asia especially china with mini-outbreaks in north america and a few cases in europe the disease has led to more than 700 deaths worldwide clusters of cases are particularly common among close associates of patients and the health care workers who treated them and their household contacts because of the alarming global spread of the disease who issued a global alert in march 2003 and instituted worldwide surveillance6
most patients identified up to now were previously healthy adults aged 25 through 70 years10 a few cases of sars have been reported among children  15 years of age in whom the clinical course now is thought to be less aggressive11 we provide a summary of the major clinical characteristics of patients with sars although the information should be considered preliminary because of the broad and non-specific case definitionthe incubation period for sars is widely considered to be two to seven days but occasionally may last up to 10 days symptomatically the illness appears to have two phases an early prodromal febrile phase and a secondary lower-respiratory phase in pathological terms however it is a triphasic disease with a primary viral replicative phase a secondary immune hyperactive phase and a pulmonary destructive phase12 the disease generally begins with a prodrome of typically high fever  38 c that may be accompanied by chills and rigors headache malaise and myalgia also are common at the onset of the illness some patients have mild respiratory symptoms in a few cases the febrile prodrome may be accompanied by diarrhea although rash and neurologic or gastrointestinal findings are absentafter three to seven days the secondary lower-respiratory phase begins with a dry nonproductive cough or dyspnea that may be accompanied by or progress to hypoxemia in up to one-fifth of the cases the respiratory illness is severe enough to require intubation and mechanical ventilationthe fatality rate among patients with illness that meets the current who definition for probable and suspected cases of sars ranges from 3 to 10 percent depending on the age group and possibly other yet unconfirmed factors10 furthermore the mortality rate is higher among those with underlying illnesses and among the very elderlytypically chest radiographs appear normal during the febrile prodrome and in some patients throughout the course of the illness however in the majority of patients the respiratory phase is characterized by early focal infiltrates that progress to more generalized patchy interstitial infiltrates sometimes leading to consolidation in the very late stages13
in general in the early phase of the disease patients may have either a normal or decreased white blood cell count with a reduction in the absolute lymphocyte count at the peak of the lower respiratory phase up to one-half of patients exhibit leukopenia and thrombocytopenia or platelet counts at the low end of the normal range 50000 to 150000 per microliter renal function appears to remain normal in the vast majority of patientsthe box
shows the second interim case definition for sars provided by the centers for disease control and prevention or cdc14 it is based on clinical epidemiologic and laboratory criteria14 however in areas such as hong kong where there has been significant disease activity the cdc criteria have been amended to include patients who do not respond to appropriate antibiotic therapy for atypical pneumonia caused by conventional agents such as mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia pneumoniae andor are in direct contact with another patient with sarsboxupdated interim us case definition for severe acute respiratory syndrome or sarsadapted from the centers for disease control and prevention14clinical criteriaearly illness

an alternative diagnosis can fully explain the illnessthe case has a convalescent-phase serum sample that is obtained  28 days after symptom onset which is negative for antibodies to sars-covthe case was reported on the basis of contact with an index case that was subsequently excluded as a case of sars provided other possible epidemiologic exposure criteria are not present
a number of treatment regimens have been explored for sars these include a variety of antibiotics to presumptively treat known bacterial agents of atypical pneumonia as well as antiviral agents such as oseltamivir and ribavirin steroids also have been administered in combination with these antimicrobial agents however the most beneficial regimen remains to be determined15
until reliable diagnostic tests an effective vaccine and antiviral drugs are available control of the epidemic depends on early identification of suspected and probable cases quarantine of patients and their close contacts and effective infection control measures particularly after patients are admitted to a health care facilityresearchers have confirmed that a new strain of virus belonging to the family coronaviridae is the prime agent of this disease16 17 18 19 although other viruses belonging to paramyxoviruses such as metapneumovirus have been implicated these appear to play only a secondary role if any in the disease process
coronaviridae are a family of rna viruses that have been associated etiologically with respiratory illness in humans and with other diseases in domestic animals interestingly they also are associated to some extent with human diarrheal diseases21 structurally they are 80 to 160 nanometers in diameter positive-stranded and about 30 kilobases in length21 their genome is the largest of all rna viruses and high-frequency recombination between related coronaviruses leads to the generation of much genetic diversitythe virus has three major proteins the nucleocapsid protein is enclosed within the viral envelope with the rna in a helical nucleocapsid the other two proteins are the membrane glycoproteins and the spike glycoprotein21 the spike glycoprotein is responsible for the characteristic fringe of crownlike projections antibodies that elicit spike glycoprotein are thought to confer protection against infection because the human strains are relatively difficult to culture compared with animal strains the extent of strain variation in human coronaviruses is unclear25
there are three serologically and genetically distinct groups of coronaviruses associated with animal and human disease in general they are species-specific although there are a number of examples of viruses crossing species barriers and establishing themselves in new hosts21 25 once the host is infected the virus may produce localized disease that often is restricted to the respiratory epithelium or the gastrointestinal tract or they may produce disseminated infection causing systemic disease21
coronavirus was confirmed as the etiologic agent in sars via serologic techniques demonstrating a rise in antibody titer its growth in tissue culture a determination of reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction or rt-pcr specific for this virus using molecular genetic techniques and animal studies23
animal studies have helped to satisfy kochs postulates which are necessary to prove disease causation19 these postulates stipulate that to be the causal agent a pathogen must meet four conditions it must be found in all cases of the disease it must be isolated from the host and grown in pure culture it must reproduce the original disease when introduced into a susceptible host and it must be found in the experimental host so infected however further studies that include control groups are required to determine the role of other agents if any in causality or as cofactors for severe diseasethe rapid spread of sars worldwide within a few months points to the contagious nature of the disease the infectivity during the incubation period is still unclear and it appears that the risk of transmission during the prodrome is low in contrast in coronaviruses that cause the common cold the viral shedding period usually precedes the onset of clinical symptoms by one to two days although the peak viral excretion occurs during the symptomatic phase21 23 26 the infectivity of sars during convalescence appears to be low and remains to be determinedsome data on the survival and infectivity of the sars coronavirus27 indicate that unlike other coronaviruses it is a rather robust organism that is stable in feces and urine at room temperature for at least one to two days it is more stable up to four days in stool from patients with diarrhea which has a higher ph than does normal stool however the virus loses infectivity five minutes after being exposed to commonly used disinfectants and fixatives including 10 percent formaldehyde 10 percent hypochlorite 75 percent ethanol and 2 percent phenol heat at 56 c kills the sars coronavirus at around 10000 units per 15 minutes considered to be a quick reduction27
the available epidemiologic data suggest strongly that the main routes of virus spread are droplets direct contact and fomite indirect contact transmission although airborne transmission has not been ruled out completely28 researchers believe that the cause of the large outbreaks among health care workers was the transmission of droplets through aerosol-generating medical procedures such as the use of nebulizers28 29
no firm data exist regarding the infectivity of contaminated saliva as opposed to sputum from the respiratory tract through the droplet route in some patients the infection manifests itself as a mild form of diarrhea and coronavirus particles have been recovered from fecal matter hence it is possible that fecal contamination could lead to the spread of the disease although more data are needed to confirm this route of transmission it is interesting that some animal coronaviruses are spread through the fecal-oral route21
from about 20 days after the onset of clinical signs elisa tests can be used to detect immunoglobulin or ig m and iga antibodies in the serum samples of patients with sars early antibodies are detected in some patients within two weekssars virusinfected vero cells can be used to detect igm antibodies in serum samples of patients after about day 10 of the onset of the disease this test is reliable yet demanding because the live virus must be grown in cell culture in addition subsequent immunofluorescence needs to be demonstratedlaboratory workers can detect virus in specimens for example respiratory secretions blood from patients with sars by infecting cultured vero-e6 or fetal rhesus kidney 4 or frhk-4 cellslaboratory workers can use pcr assays that detect genetic material of corona-virus in patient specimens such as respiratory secretions blood or stool samples primers that are required for this test now are available widely through various web sites for example the cdc the university of hong kong and the governmental viral unit of hong kongclinicians must exercise caution when interpreting laboratory test results because the key to diagnosis is clinical evaluation and possible exposure to an infected person a positive laboratory test result indicates that the patient is or has been infected with the sars-cov while a negative test result does not necessarily rule out sars16 23
seroconversion of paired serum samples with convalescent serum samples obtained more than 21 days after onset of symptoms is a reliable sensitive and specific diagnostic method however the current diagnostic option of choice for early and rapid diagnosis is rt-pcr detection of virus in respiratory or fecal specimens this test has low sensitivity and a negative test result does not exclude the diagnosismany laboratories are addressing the problem of sensitivity and specificity of the sars diagnostic tests and it will take some time before a highly sensitive specific quick and simple diagnostic test is available it is possible that as is the case with hiv infection saliva could be used as a diagnostic fluid in this contextas health care providers dentists should be able to identify a suspected case of sars the cdcs current interim diagnostic criteria for sars are shown in the box14 they are subject to change as more is learned about the disease and should be reviewed periodically by visiting the ada or cdc web sitesas stated above we doubt that patients with sars who are in the acute febrile phase of the disease will visit a dentist in the unlikely event that this does occur the dentist should not treat the patient in the dental office but should refer him or her to a health care facility as soon as possible for diagnosis and care dentists also have a duty to report the case to state or local health departments32
as always dentists should take a thorough medical history from each patient and update it at each recall appointment5 the questionnaire used for this purpose may have to be modified to incorporate targeted screening questions regarding sars although these questions may appear superfluous during the current abeyance of the outbreak they are important as a guide if there is another outbreak of sars or an outbreak of a similar new disease these questions may include the following
do you have feverhave you experienced a recent onset of a respiratory problem such as a cough or difficulty breathinghave you within the last 10 days that is the incubation period for sars traveled internationally or visited an area where documented or suspected community transmission of sars is occurringhave you come into contact with a patient with sars in the past 10 days
in the event that the patient recently has returned from a geographic region with documented or suspected community transmission of sars the clinician can defer elective treatment until the incubation period is over dentists can provide emergency treatment provided they use routine barrier precautions and avoid spatter or aerosol-generating procedures this emergency treatment should be limited to the control of pain and infection dentists should not treat patients in the dental office who are suspected of having sarsif a patient replies yes to the first two screening questions the dentist should wear a surgical mask discuss his or her potential concerns with the patient call an area medical facility such as a hospital and inform the staff that he or she is referring a patient suspected of having sars so that arrangements can be made for transportation and care of the patient patients with sars need ground emergency medical services32
these screening questions should be asked routinely of all patients because questioning only a select group of patients for whatever reason may undermine the early detection of infection and might be construed as a discriminatory practice clinicians should delay treating convalescing patients for at least one month after they are released from the hospital convalescing patients are instructed to remain at home for seven days after discharge from the hospital and during this period they are requested to stay indoors and keep contact with others to a minimum33
a preprocedural antimicrobial mouthrinse with 012 to 02 percent chlorhexidine gluconate is believed to reduce the number of microbes that are released into the operatory environment this has been shown in a number of studies in which a long-lasting mouthrinse for example chlorhexidine gluconate with povidone iodine and essential oils has reduced the disseminated microbial load during procedures such as ultrasonic scaling34 35 however no concrete data show that a preprocedural mouthrinse reduces infection among dental health care workers or patients a preprocedural rinse would be most useful in situations in which a rubber dam cannot be used such as when a prophylaxis cup or an ultrasonic scaler is used and in the absence of assisted high-volume suctionmicroflora on the skin can be divided into two categories the transient flora colonizing the superficial layers of the skin and mainly acquired through environmental routes and the residential flora thriving on the deeper layers of the skin and hair follicles36 the exogenous superficial flora are harmful and pathogenic but are removed easily with clinical hand-washing procedures by contrast the endogenous residential flora are almost impossible to remove completely but are less likely to be associated with infections36
the single most important method of preventing transmission of any infectious agent including the sars coronavirus is hand washing and appropriate hand care studies have found that even in critical care units hand-washing compliance is relatively low sometimes approaching 40 percent37 by contrast a dramatic reduction in the prevalence of health careassociated infections has been shown when regimented hand hygiene measures were introduced38 thus appropriate hand hygiene is the mainstay of a good dental infection control programfurthermore recent data indicate that the sars virus compared with other coronaviruses is a relatively robust organism and may survive on nonporous surfaces for up to 48 hours39 this reinforces the need for good hand hygiene as well as the importance of thorough surface disinfectionfor routine dentistry which entails examinations and nonsurgical procedures plain soap and water are adequate recently the cdc recommended that if the health care workers hands are not visibly soiled an alcohol-based hand rub could be used for routine decontamination because this is as effective as hand washing and also saves time40 also clinicians should decontaminate their hands both before and after removing gloves because humidity and moisture cause bacteria to multiply rapidly under the glove surfacehand rubs that are based on alcohol alone should not be used owing to their rapid evaporation and lack of residual effect consequently hand rubs must be laced with agents such as chlorhexidine octenidine or triclosan to achieve the needed effect41 after using an alcohol-based hand rub the clinician must dry his or her hands thoroughly before putting on gloves because any residual alcohol may increase the risk of glove perforation42
face masks were first worn by surgeons to minimize postsurgical infection in patients due to microbes that were exhaled or shed by the surgical team43 however the realization that face masks protect the health care worker as well as the patient has led to the routine use of this protective measure in many clinical settings including dentistrytransmission of airborne infection depends on factors such as the virulence of the organism as well as the number of organisms transmitted44 in the case of coronavirus-induced pneumonia leading to sars airborne droplet transmission of infection is considered to be the main route of spread45
various types of masks and face shields are available surgical masks usually provide adequate protection in dental care settings where highly transmissible infectious diseases are not typically encounteredhowever surgical masks are not designed to provide adequate protection against exposure to airborne infectious agents such as tubercle bacilli or droplet nuclei smaller than 5 micrometers for such purposes particulate respirators for example n-95 masks must be used during the sars outbreak in hong kong the vast majority of dental practitioners in that country used n95 masks for routine dentistry however these masks are uncomfortable to wear for extended periods because of the difficulty in breathing through a thick impervious fabric and are not recommended for routine dental office settingsrubber dams help minimize the production of saliva- and blood- contaminated aerosol or spatter samaranayake and colleagues46 reported an up-to-70-percent reduction in airborne particles around a 3-foot diameter of the operational field when a rubber dam was used a split-dam technique may be used in situations in which gingival areas are involved such as class v restorations and crown-and-bridge preparationsaerosol-generating procedures should be avoided as much as possible if rubber dam isolation is not feasible some of these procedures include ultrasonic scaling root-surface debridement and high- or low-speed drilling with water spraythere is no doubt that coronavirus research has gained an unprecedented and urgent momentum owing to the lethality of sars and its nearly worldwide spread within a few months consequently laboratories throughout the world are working in unison to provide answers to many unresolved questions as well as to develop a new preventive vaccine in dentistry in particular a number of questions remain to be resolved including the following
does the virus survive in human saliva and if so for how longis the virus shed in saliva during the early incubation period or during the convalescent phase of the diseasedo human salivary constituents such as lysozyme lactoferrin and the salivary leukocyte protease inhibitor have anticoronavirus activitycould the virus spread in a dental clinic environment because of aerosols and if so are additional barrier protection measures required to prevent such spreadwhat are the more efficacious disinfectants that kill or inhibit the viral activityhow long does the virus survive on surfaces and what factors such as humidity affect its survival
although the global threat of sars has peaked for the most part it is helpful to review the response of the community to this novel disease it is fortunate that sars was not sufficiently infective to cause a repeat of the 1918 influenza pandemic that killed millions even so we might be able to attribute the relatively low death rate in large part to the worldwide surveillance networks and patient isolation efforts that were introduced rapidly in most countries in retrospect an overreaction seems to have been a better option than allowing the disease to run out of control as was the case with the aids pandemicthe who lifted all its travel advisories47 as of june 15 2003 and since then only three new cases of sars have been reported two of theseone in singapore and the other in taiwanwere accidental laboratory-acquired infections in research technicians working with the organism while the third patientfrom guangdong province in southern chinais thought to have acquired the infection through contact with contaminated rodentsbecause the initial symptoms of sars mimic those of many variants of atypical pneumonia a high degree of suspicion by the medical establishment intense surveillance and immediate quarantine of all close contacts of patients should ward off another large-scale winter outbreak if sars does return its epidemiology may be different from that of the current strain for instance the genome of the new sars-cov may differ and the virus may be more or less infective than the original strain that emerged in 2003 furthermore we do not know how long the acquired immunity to sars persists also will those exposed to the virus be carriers of the disease in the face of a new infection how many will be silent healthy carriers of the virus will an emergent strain or strains behave similarly to the older counterpart we do not have the answers to these questionsthe reason for the pandemic spread of hiv is its ability to mutate rapidly from one generation to another so it can escape the immune surveillance mechanisms of the host as well as the prescribed antiviral medications the sars virus on the other hand seems to be remarkably invariant the genome sequence of isolates from patients in singapore toronto china and hong kong has not revealed any changes of major consequence23 this does not mean that the sars virus is incapable of mutation rather because the virus has encountered little resistance from new human hosts there is less selective pressure for new mutants to emerge and persistmany researchers are working on potential drugs and vaccines to treat patients with sars however their approach has been scattered for the most part as they screen the multitude of available drugs and compounds for their ability to destroy the sars-cov thus far a few have had success one group reported that the compound glycrrhizin which is derived from licorice roots can rid cultured monkey kidney cells of the sars virus48 other researchers using in silico research have proposed that the newly described proteinase of the sars virus which converts viral proteins into the active form required for viral replication49 could be inhibited by drugsanimal models are essential for experimentation and drug discovery thus far the only validated model has been cynomolgus macaque macaca fascicularis20 a smaller and less expensive animal model for sars research has yet to be definedalthough vaccines exist for animal coronavirus infections it may take a few years before a vaccine for sars is developed it is comforting to note that the existing technology and know-how for animal coronavirus vaccines could be translated directly toward the manufacture of a sars vaccine furthermore implicit evidence shows that the vaccine approach to preventing sars is feasible because patients conditions appear to improve when they are given hyperimmune serum from recovered patients with sarssars vaccines could be based on a killed sars virus or on an attenuated virus that is sufficiently potent to replicate itself in humans and initiate a successful antibody response but not potent enough to cause disease another option would be to re-engineer a harmless candidate virus to contain genetic sequences of the sars virus this approach has been used to produce a prototypic vaccine against a coronavirus that causes bronchitis in chickens50 should there be a renewed threat of sars a vaccine would be a most-welcomed weapon by health care workerssars is the first readily transmissible infectious disease that the global community has confronted in the new millennium this surely will not be the last contagion that we will encounter the fact that no dental health care worker or dental patient has thus far contracted sars in a dental setting is a testament to good infection control measures that have been implemented in the vast majority of dental offices however the dental community cannot let down its guard and must be constantly aware of impending infectious threats in various guises as well as recrudescence of disease that may challenge the current infection control regimenover the past several thousand years the urbanization of human society has permitted viral infections to wreak havoc on human health led by smallpox viruses have killed or incapacitated hundreds of millions of people throughout past centuries but the advent of widespread antiviral vaccination has had dramatic effects not only has it permitted the eradication of the smallpox virus and the approaching extirpation of poliovirus but it also has come close to consigning diseases such measles mumps and rubella to the pages of history despite this progress viruses continue to exact a heavy toll in human suffering human immunodeficiency virus hiv is thought to infect almost one in four africans gregson et al 2002 previously unidentified viruses have emerged to cause substantial harmmost recently exemplified by the novel coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome sars fouchier 2003 kuiken 2003 and old adversaries such as influenza virus give sporadic reminders of the threats that they pose shortridge et al 1998the main bulwark protecting the population from microbial onslaught is the immune system the efficacy of the antiviral immune response is well established i the majority of infections even by viruses considered highly pathogenic are resolved by an immunocompetent host ii this requires an intact immune system because even normally innocuous virus infections can be fatal in immunosuppressed individuals and iii the enormous benefits of antiviral vaccination rely on the adaptive immune response the importance of vaccination is well demonstrated by the current reemergence of measles as an important human pathogen irrational parental fears of measles vaccine side effects have led to reduced vaccine uptake in some countries with potentially catastrophic consequences there have been sporadic outbreaks of measles in areas of the united states with low vaccine uptake robbins 1993 and in the united kingdom parental acceptance of the mmr vaccine has dropped to a level that may eventually permit the measles virus to become endemic once again jansen et al 2003 perhaps most striking is that low vaccine coverage has resulted in an explosion of measles in japanan estimated 30000 to 200000 cases annually nakayama et al 2003and deaths have numbered in the hundreds thus to address current and future viral challenges and to further improve the safety and efficacy of available antiviral vaccines it is imperative that the immune responses to viral infection be fully understoodthe immune response can be classified in several ways but we consider classification most logical by antigen specificity thus immune responses may be termed nonantigen-specific or antigen-specific as the name indicates nonantigen-specific responses do not rely on recognition of specific antigenic motifs these responses are broad-based and include phagocytes natural killer cells type i interferons and barrier defenses such as skin lysozyme and gastric acid their actions are exerted very early in the course of combating an infection and they do not require any form of antigenic instruction consequently they are termed innate immune responses in contrast the antigen-specific immune system can learn from experience and thus is termed adaptive immunity upon first encounter with any given antigen the antigen-specific responses will be somewhat slow to develop usually becoming detectable only after the innate responses have approached their peak howeverand in contrast to the innate responsesupon second exposure to the same agent the antigen-specific responses are greatly improved both in quantity and quality these enhanced antigen-specific secondary immune responsestermed anamnestic from the greek word for recalloriginate from memory cells that are specific for the antigens previously encountered and that are the cornerstone of all antiviral vaccines both the innate and adaptive immune responses play key roles in controlling a viral infection and it is becoming increasingly clear that these responses are not as previously supposed separate and are instead inextricably linked however our goal in this chapter is to cover the adaptive response and we shall provide no further description of the innate immune system hereinadaptive immunity relies on lymphocytes of which there are two classes t-lymphocytes derived from the thymus and b lymphocytes named for the avian organ the bursa of fabricius b lymphocytes give rise to antibody-producing plasma cells antibodies act mainly to diminish the infectivity of free virus whereas t cells recognize and often kill infected cells thus antibodies and t lymphocytes act in a complementary manner antibodies neutralize viruses in the fluid phase eg blood lymph interstitial spaces thereby reducing the number of infected cells and easing the t lymphocytes workload t lymphocytes kill infected cells before virus maturation has occurred minimizing the release of an infectious virus and thus easing the load on antibodies in the following pages we shall review the biology of b and t lymphocyte responses to virus infection and vaccinationantibody is produced in five different classes igg igm iga igd and ige these antibody molecules differ in their molecular composition as well as in their biologic functions padlan 1994igg is the most abundant class of immunoglobulin in the serum mean adult serum level is 12 mgml and in humans can be organized into four subclasses igg1 igg2 igg3 and igg4 which respectively constitute approximately 70 15 10 and 5 of total serum igg the main effector function shared by all four igg subclasses is neutralization although human igg3 also very effectively activates the complement system igg1 is especially effective in opsonization a process in which the pathogen becomes coated with antibody and the multiple exposed igg constant domains facilitate internalization by phagocytes expressing fc receptors opsonization is generally more important in countering bacterial rather than viral infectionigm is structurally similar to an igg molecule but its h chains carry a fourth constant region it is the first immunoglobulin expressed at the surface of a developing b cell and as the cell matures the antibody is secreted into the plasma in the form of a star-shaped multimeric array of five antibodies plasma igm molecules therefore contain 10 antigen recognition sites the multiplicity of antigen-binding sites would seem to make igm well-suited for neutralization and it is perhaps surprising that its main biological role appears to be complement activationiga is similar in appearance to igg but forms a dimer that has the capacity to be actively transferred across epithelial surfaces allowing its entry into luminal spaces as a result dimeric iga is a key factor in providing barrier mucosal immunityige structure is similar to that of a single igm molecule with four constant regions in the h chain but it does not form multimers its serum level is orders of magnitude lower than that of other classes and it is instead found on the surface of mast cells where it plays a role in allergies and perhaps in immunity to parasitesigd is superficially similar to igg but its function remains unknown although it can substitute for igm if genetic defects prevent the synthesis of that antibody class lutz et al 1998 the biological features of the three classes most important for controlling virus infectionigm igg and igaare summarized in table i

there are several possible outcomes of virus infection some virus families cause acute ie short-lived infections whereas others can persist in the host for months or years it is therefore important to understand the role played by antibodies in preventing infection or disease progression under these widely disparate circumstances one school of thought is that antibodies play a key role in controlling acute infections but not persistent infections kagi and hengartner 1996 the authors noted that during acute infections infected cells are rapidly destroyed by the virus and therefore cellular immunity which exerts its effect by acting on infected cells may be of minimal importance under these circumstances the host must rely on antiviral antibodies in contrast cellular immunity may be more important than antibodies during persistent infection when the hosts goal is to eradicate virus that is hiding inside cells does this proposal fit the data the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of antibodies against a number of human viruses is summarized in table ii
 in support of the hypothesis there are many instances of lytic viral infections most notably poxviruses and flaviviruses that are highly susceptible to antibody-dependent immunity however there are several exceptions in which a preexisting antibody response to a typically nonlytic persistent virus appears to afford partial and in some cases complete protection against infection for example some arenaviruses can persist for the lifetime of the host but it is well established that administration of convalescent serum or plasma results in a significant level of protection against lethal junin virus infection enria and barrera oro 2002 although the results for protection against lassa fever virus another member of the arenavirus family have been mixed clayton 1977 mccormick 1986 the prototypic arenavirus lcmv can establish lifelong persistence in mice and immunity against this agent is mediated largely by cd8 t cells consistent with the hypothesis monoclonal lcmv-specific antibodies however can ameliorate disease wright and buchmeier 1991 and a vaccine that appeared to induce antibodies in the absence of protective levels of cd8 t cells also could confer protection di simone and buchmeier 1995 again indicating that the hypothesis may be an oversimplificationthe results outlined in table ii illustrate an important point antibodies are generally more effective prophylactically than therapeutically preexisting antibody from acquired immunity or by passive transfer often can prevent or at least ameliorate disease caused by a subsequent virus infection but the same antibody is less effective when administered after severe disease symptoms have appeared this may be due to overwhelming levels of virus that cannot be adequately controlled by a finite amount of transferred antibody conversely there may be very little virus remaining at a time when symptoms are most severe because many symptoms of viral diseases reflect the immunopathology that occurs during virus clearance slifka and whitton 2000b see section vi nevertheless antibody-mediated therapies are beginning to gain wider acceptance especially now that humanized monoclonal antibodies are more easily obtained and can be used in place of convalescent sera for example palivizumab is the first humanized monoclonal antibody licensed for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus rsv infections and since its introduction in 1998 it has had a significant impact on the number and duration of rsv-associated hospitalizations in susceptible infant populations romero 2003 other monoclonal antibody formulations are also showing promise in animal models a combination of monoclonal antibodies has been shown to be effective in postexposure prophylaxis against rabies virus prosniak et al 2003 and a vaginally applied monoclonal antibody directed against the hiv-1 gp120 molecule protects against mucosal virus transmission veazey et al 2003 monoclonal antibody therapy has at least two major advantages over convalescent serum including i low lot-to-lot variation in neutralizing titer giving a guaranteed standard of therapeutic efficacy and ii a significantly decreased risk of contamination with human viruses or other clinically relevant pathogens a common risk factor encountered when administering convalescent serum or plasmain addition to producing antibodies to directly combat microbial infections some b cellsmost prominently memory b cellsalso help to regulate the immune response by acting as antigen-presenting cells memory b cells are detectable in lymphoid organs and the bloodstream within 1 to 2 weeks after acute viral infection and are maintained at steady-state levels thereafter these cells do not secrete antibody and instead maintain cell-surface expression of their immunoglobulin receptors so that they can recognize their specific antigen once bound the antigen is internalized and processed and the viral epitopes are presented at the cell surface by major histocompatibility complex mhc class ii molecules these complexes on the surface of memory b cells are extremely effective triggers of antigen-specific cd4 t cells responses lanzavecchia 1985 the importance of which is described below highly activated memory b cells can also proliferate and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells the main cell type involved with maintaining antibody levels after vaccination or infection there appears to be a clear division of labor between these related cell types in that memory b cells are mainly involved with antigen processing presentation and mounting anamnestic immune responses whereas plasma cells are unlikely to be involved with antigen uptake or presentation because they are largely deficient in surface immunoglobulin and show little or no mhc class ii expression abney 1978 halper 1978 slifka 1998 plasma cells instead devote most of their energy to the production and secretion of antibodymany viruses and many vaccines both live and inert induce antibody responses that remain detectable for years after antigen exposure and since the half-life of an antibody molecule is measured in weeks the longevity of the response must be explained by ongoing antibody synthesis there is general agreement that long-term antibody levels are maintained by the combined efforts of two largely distinct cell types memory b cells and plasma cells but there is substantial controversy regarding the roles played by each plasma cells secrete up to 10000 molecules of antibody per second helmreich 2003 hibi 1986 and typically are measured by the elispot technique which detects spontaneous antibody production by individual cells plasma cells accumulate in the spleen or in draining lymph nodes during the early stages of an acute viral infection but then as the infection is resolved and the local immune response subsides the majority of virus-specific plasma cells are typically found in the bone marrow compartment bachmann 1994 hyland 1994 slifka 1995 youngman 2002 for many years it was believed that plasma cells were very short-lived a half-life of less than 3 days thus requiring continuous replenishment by proliferating memory b cells if long-lived antibody responses were to be maintained slifka and ahmed 1996 as noted above memory b cells undoubtedly can differentiate into plasma cells and it was thought that they must do so at a very high frequency to replace the short-lived plasma cells however this notion has recently been challenged by studies demonstrating that individual plasma cells can survive for months to years in the absence of proliferation manz et al 1997 and without their being reconstituted by resident memory b cells slifka et al 1998 in mice virus-specific plasma cells could be observed more than 500 days after memory b cell depletion indicating that at least a subpopulation of plasma cells could survive for the life of this host the life span of plasma cells in humans in currently unknown and it will be interesting to learn whether plasma cells in larger more long-lived mammals have a maximal life span of only 1 to 2 years as found in mice or whether the life span is extended commensurate with host longevityb cell responses mature in at least three ways over the course of a viral infectionfirst b cells produce secreted ig molecules antibodies naive b cells express igm restricted to their cell surfaces following an appropriate encounter with cognate antigen the cells are activated begin to divide and produce the secreted multimeric form of igm which facilitates activation of the complement cascadesecond b cells undergo class switching alluded to previously in this process the variable regions and hence the antigen specificity of the antibody remain unchanged but the h chain constant domains are rearranged for example the igm constant domains may be replaced with igg constant domains the igm-secreting b cell will now instead secrete igg with identical antigen specificity but with different structure divalent instead of decavalent and new effector functions eg enters interstitial spaces better neutralizing activity see table ithird during the process of expansion that results from antigen contact multiple mutations are introduced into the variable regions of the antigen-specific b cells in a process termed somatic hypermutation somatic hypermutation has at least two consequences one consequence is that many of the changes may reduce or abolish recognition of the triggering antigen but the resulting b cells and antibodies may now recognize a different antigenic moiety thus the process further increases the diversity of the antibody response to as high as 10141016 specificities another consequence is that some of the mutations will increase the antibodys affinity for the original antigen and those b cells that express the improved ig molecules are preferentially expanded by continued antigen contact as a result as long as antigen is present to drive the response the overall affinity of the antigen-specific antibody population will increase and antibodies can reach extremely high affinities the range of kd for antibodies begins at about 107 m and extends as high as about 1012 m high-affinity antibodies are more specific for their cognate antigen diminishing the risk of side effects and the stronger binding enhances their effector functions eg neutralization complement fixation etc the strong binding between an individual antibody and its antigen may be effectively irreversible therefore antibodies should be considered disposable effector molecules as will be described next these features distinguish the maturation of antibody responses from the changes in t cell responses that take place during infection
in contrast to antibodies which generally recognize antigenic moieties on intact molecules most t lymphocytes recognize short 924 amino acid fragments epitopes of foreign proteins that are presented on the cell surface by host glycoproteins encoded in the mhc antigen recognition by a t cell relies on the t cell receptor tcr a cell surface molecule present in multiple identical copies each of which is structurally reminiscent of one arm of the y in an antibody molecule the tcr is a heterodimer with each chain comprising one constant region common to all t cells and one variable region which varies among different t cells there are two categories of tcr  and  the function of cells bearing the  heterodimer remains largely unknown and will not be discussed in this review the great majority of cd8 t cells responding to viral infection express  tcr heterodimers and it is this population that has been intensively studied over the past decade the paired variable regions in an  tcr determine its antigen specificity and therefore the specificity of the t cell itself  t cells are subdivided into two major classes distinguished by their expression of cell surface proteins termed cd8 and cd4 there are two major types of mhc molecule class i and class ii in general cd8 t cells recognize peptide epitopes presented at the cell surface by mhc class i and cd4 t cells recognize peptides presented by mhc class ii during the recognition process broadly speaking the tcr recognizes the specific combination of peptide epitope and mhc molecule thus conferring antigen specificity upon the cell and the cd4 or cd8 molecules interact directly with conserved areas of their respective mhc molecules konig 1992 salter 1990 increasing the avidity of the interaction and helping to assemble the signal transduction apparatusthere are at least two key differences between the mhc class i and class ii molecules and these define the biologic roles of cd4 and cd8 t cells they are summarized in table iii
 first the molecules differ in their distribution class i molecules are almost ubiquitous whereas class ii molecules are expressed by a relatively limited number of cells most of which are specialized antigen presenting cells apcs important in the induction of an immune response second the molecules differ in the source of viral peptides that they present mhc class i molecules present epitopes from proteins made within the cell thus ensuring that in general cd8 t cells will recognize only cells actively infected with a virus in contrast mhc class ii molecules present peptides that come from proteins taken up from the extracellular milieu thus specialized apcs can be recognized by cd4 t cells even if they are not actively infected these differences in mhc distribution and function have profound implications for the biological activities of t lymphocytes cd8 t cells can in principle recognize and exert their effects on almost any somatic cell that is unfortunate enough to become infected thus cd8 t cells can be effective front line combatants against virus infection in contrast cd4 t cells are unable to recognize the majority of infected cells and therefore are less plausible candidates for the direct control of infection although they may have some direct effects section vc3 however their interactions with specialized apcs ensure that cd4 t cells play important roles in marshalling the immune response as might be expected from their different roles in countering virus infection the two t cell types differ somewhat in the ways in which they respond to infection therefore we shall consider them separately beginning with the better-understood cd8 t cell responses and in both cases we shall consider how over the course of infection the t cells vary in quantity and in qualitythe expansion phase begins when a naive antigen-specific cd8 t cell encounters its cognate antigen which results in triggering of a program that leads to the cells division and differentiation a study in mice indicated that there may be approximately 100 to 200 naive cells specific for a given antigen and since a mouse has 2  107 cd8 t cells in total the frequency of naive cd8 t cells of a given antigen specificity would be about 1 in 105 blattman et al 2002 if indeed a mouse contains cd8 t cells of only approximately 105 different specificities this is far below the number of antibody specificities that are available to the animal and may have implications for either the number of epitopes that can be recognized or for the fidelity of tcr-antigen recognitiontriggering of a naive cd8 t cell requires that it receives at least two signals i contact with cognate epitope delivered via the tcr and ii costimulatory signals which come from a variety of receptor-ligand interactions the widespread expression of mhc class i molecules ensures that most somatic cells can present viral antigen to cd8 t cells but only a few cell typesin particular activated dendritic cells and memory b cellsexpress the appropriate costimulatory molecules consequently only those cellslocated in lymphoid tissues such as the lymph nodescan trigger naive cd8 t cells to enter the activation pathway the interaction between a naive cd8 t cell and an activated apc expressing its cognate antigen may be rather brief recent studies from several laboratories indicate that only a few hours of antigen exposure are required to cause a cd8 t cell and its progeny to proceed through the expansion contraction and memory phases and to express appropriate effector functions kaech 2001 mercado 2000 van stipdonk 2001 following antigen triggering cd8 t cells divide and continue to do so rather rapidly the t cell responses shown in fig 1 are intended to demonstrate the quantitative changes that may take place in a single population of about 100 naive cells all of which are specific for the same epitope in the first 7 days of a viral infection a naive cell may undergo approximately 14 to 16 rounds of division permitting a single cell to generate between 16000 to 65000 progeny blattman et al 2002 the graph in fig 1 assumes that all of the naive cells receive the appropriate antigenic signal but this may not occur in vivo for example under some circumstances increasing the antigen epitope expression increases the overall epitope-specific cd8 t cell response wherry et al 1999 consistent with the possibility that the lower expression may have recruited only a proportion of the epitope-specific naive cells into the responding population it is also possible that all naive cells were activated at both levels of epitope expression but that the higher level led to increased proliferation eg more rapid or more prolonged cell division regardless of the mechanism it is likely that the quantity of antigen available during the early phases of an infection can play a key role in determining the intensity of the cd8 t cell response does the duration of antigen availability have a marked effect the effect of persistent antigen is unclear it has been suggested that persistent antigen may cause the related t cells to undergo more rounds of cell division kaech et al 2002 but others have noted that the duration of antigen exposure has a minimal effect on the cd8 t cell response badovinac et al 2002in summary naive cd8 t cells are preprogrammed and after brief antigen contact they expand express their effector functions contract and enter the memory phase this reliance on an easily triggered program may have advantages and disadvantages viruses have developed many strategies to evade the immune system including the rapid down-regulation of apc function if cd8 t cells were to require prolonged or repeated contact with antigen-charged apcs there would be a significant risk that viruses could undermine the developing cd8 t cell response by limiting apc function because only brief antigen contact is needed to initiate the program the host has a better chance of being able to mount a meaningful response an additional advantage of programming is that it may permit the activated cell to quickly exit the lymphoid tissues where the initial triggering occurs and presumably to continue its rapid division in peripheral sites even in the absence of ongoing antigen contact in this way the antiviral functions of the expanding cell population are more rapidly deployed than they would be if the cells had to remain in the lymphoid tissues to receive repeated antigenic signals a possible disadvantage of programming is that the cells may continue to expand long after the virus and the antigen has been eradicated this is potentially harmful because autoaggressive cd8 t cells may play a role in virus-induced autoimmune disease von herrath et al 2003upon activation cd8 t cells up-regulate the expression of several activation markers such as cd11a cd25 il-2 receptor- cd44 and cd69 they also down-regulate other molecules including cd62l l-selectin and cc-chemokine receptor 7 ccr7 the understanding of these proteins functions is incomplete but several of the proteins appear to play an important part in regulating the anatomical distribution of the t cells it has been known for many years that t lymphocyte recirculation is not random with some cells being retained in lymph nodes and others preferring peripheral tissues cahill et al 1977 naive cd8 t cells appear to remain in lymphoid tissues because they express on their cell surface high levels of proteins such as cd62l gallatin et al 1983 and ccr7 which can mediate adhesion to lymph node venules baekkevold et al 2001 t cell activation results in the rapid down-regulation of these proteins and this along with other factors allows the cell to exit the node once released from the nodes t cells patrol the peripheral tissues and settle preferentially in tissues that express particular ligands andor chemokines which interact with proteins on the t cell membrane for example with cd11a and cd44 there is increasing evidence that t cells home to specific organs although it remains uncertain whether this behavior is imprinted on the individual t cell by the apc during priming or whether the behavior results from positive selection of activated t cells carrying the appropriate cell-surface molecules in any event it appears that during viral infections and other inflammatory processes t cell trafficking is tightly controlled reviewed in weninger et al 2002activated t cells express the fasl molecule permitting them to induce apoptosis of virus-infected cells that express the death receptor fas the fasfasl interaction can initiate a caspase cascade beginning with the cleavage of procaspase-8 and culminating in apoptotic t cell death reviewed in budd 2001 a role for the fas pathway in t cell homeostasis in vivo is strongly supported by observations in mice lacking fas lpr mice or fasl gld mice both of which develop uncontrolled lymphoproliferation nagata and suda 1995 however inhibition of the caspase pathway using either drugs hildeman 1999 holler 2000a or genetic manipulation smith et al 1996 usually does not result in lymphoproliferation suggesting the existence of an alternative caspase-independent pathway that may mediate t cell death what is the evidence that the fas pathway andor the caspase cascade may play a role in aicd during the immune response to virus infection the fas pathway is thought to be central to aicd antigen-driven overstimulation of the t cell receptor induces fas expression rendering the t cell susceptible to fasl-driven apoptosis brunner et al 1995 since aicd is antigen-driven it is thought to play its part relatively early in infection when the antigen load is high furthermore t cells are rendered more sensitive to fas-triggered apoptosis when they are actively dividing and when il-2 levels are high refaeli et al 1998 these are precisely the conditions present during the later part of the expansion phase thus aicd may drive much of the t cell death that occurs toward the end of the expansion phase furthermore aicd is thought to be crucial for the down-regulation of antiviral t cell responses in persistent virus infection ie when antigen remains in the organism for an extended period of time zhou et al 2002 however the fact that the in vitro induction of aicd often requires repetitive stimulation through the tcr has led to some doubt about its contribution to the contraction phase of an antiviral immune response in vivo hildeman et al 2002a and this together with the observations of caspase-independent death pathways has led to the search for alternative mechanisms of t cell deathacad is thought to be responsible for the bulk of virus-specific cd8 t cell death that occurs after the virus has been eradicated ie later in the contraction phase unlike aicd acad does not depend on the ligation of death receptors ie it is fas-independent and it is instead controlled by molecular regulators within the t cell with the bcl-2 protein family playing a key role strasser 1995 van parijs 1998 the bcl-2 family comprises at least three subgroups of proteins arrayed in opposing factions the first subgroup contains antiapoptotic proteins such as bcl-2 and bcl-xl and the second is populated by proapoptotic proteins such as bax and bak members of the third subgroup termed bh3-only proteins favor apoptosis by inhibiting their antiapoptotic relatives or enhancing the activity of the proapoptotic molecules one bh3-only protein bim has been proposed as the key molecular regulator of acad hildeman 2002a hildeman 2002b acad can be inhibited by the expression of high levels of bcl-2 and il-2 selectively induces the antiapoptotic members of the bcl-2 family thereby preventing acad akbar et al 1996 furthermore elevated levels of bcl-2 protein have been reported in memory t cells grayson et al 2001 the bcl-2 protein family controls mitochondrial outer membrane permeability and the proapoptotic family members act by disregulating the membrane potential of these vital organelles this lethal effect appears to be a final common pathway employed by various inducers of caspase-independent cell death one consequence of the disregulation is the intracellular release of cytochrome c which in turn activates procaspase-9 and triggers the caspase cascade thus caspase activation occurs in both aicd and acad but its significance differs greatly between the two pathways in aicd caspase activation is required for cell death in contrast caspase activation is a secondary feature of acad being required for the dna fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis but cell death occurs even in the absence of caspases ferraro-peyret et al 2002in summary there are at least two independent but partially overlapping pathways that may induce t cell death the likelihood that one or both pathways will be activated in any one cell depends on a variety of factors which may include the history of antigen contact the number of cell divisions and the extracellular microenvironment at the peak of the infection the rapid cell division and high il-2 levels will tend to favor aicd but as the inflammatory milieu dissipates the decline in il-2 will cause the balance of power within the warring factions of the bcl-2 family to shift leading to changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase-independent cell death acad a recent study in which il-2 was delivered in vivo at various times over the course of an antiviral immune response has confirmed that the timing of il-2 administration is critical il-2 reduced t cell numbers when administered relatively soon after infection during the expansion phase consistent with il-2 inducing aicd but increased t cell survival when administered during the contraction phase consistent with il-2 preventing acad blattman et al 2003cd8 memory t cells play a critical role in protecting against many viral infections and there is ample evidence that vaccines which induce only cd8 memory t cells can confer good protection against subsequent viral challenge del val 1991 klavinskis 1989 whitton 1993 the induction of virus-specific cd8 memory t cells is therefore a central goal of antiviral vaccine design the number of cd8 t cells that enter the memory phase is related to the extent of the primary response hou 1994 marshall 2001 but the ontogeny of cd8 memory t cells remains controversial some studies suggest that they arise directly from effector cells that escape the contraction phase jacob 1999 opferman 1999 and that passage into the memory phase may be a stochastic process sourdive et al 1998 other data indicate that memory cells may represent a separate lineage that can be generated without expressing their effector functions lauvau 2001 manjunath 2001 regardless of precisely how these cells are generated it is clear that in immunocompetent animals the resting level of memory cells remains relatively stable for a prolonged period months or years after infection or vaccination the establishment of this stable cd8 t cell memory population requires cd4 t cells in mice lacking cd4 t cells where the primary cd8 t cell response ie the expansion phase can be relatively normal the number of memory cells and the extent of antiviral protection decrease with each passing month von herrath et al 1996 the activity of cd4 t cells that stabilizes cd8 t cell memory may be exerted very early perhaps when the naive cd8 t cells are being programmed janssen 2003 shedlock 2003 sun 2003in normal mice the maintenance of a stable level of cd8 memory t cells requires that the cells continue to divide in a homeostatic manner this homeostatic division is regulated by cytokines in particular by il-7 and il-15 becker 2002 schluns 2000 schluns 2002 tan 2002 and occurs in the absence of cognate antigen lau 1994 murali-krishna 1999 it has been suggested sallusto et al 1999 that there may be two types of memory t cell termed effector memory cells that are cytolytic and produce cytokines immediately upon antigen encounter and central memory effectorless cells that do not express ifn- or perforin immediately upon antigen contact evaluation of ccr7 expression suggested that ccr7 cells were central memory and ccr7 cells were effector memory as proposed this centralmemory hypothesis had three distinguishing tenets i effector memory cells are both constitutively lytic and cytokine competent ii central memory cells express neither cytokines nor perforin upon antigen contact and iii the effector and central memory populations can be distinguished on the basis of ccr7 expression emerging data are challenging all tenets of the hypothesis first several labs have shown that long after virus clearance virus-specific memory cells can quickly produce ifn- in response to antigen contact but most of them are nonlytic and thus would be excluded from the sallustolanzavecchia definition of effector memory cells second in our own laboratory we have found that almost all virus-specific cd8 memory t cells identified using a tetramer are also cytokine competent cells data not shown suggesting that virus-specific effectorless ie central memory cells if they exist are a very minor component of the response similar findings have been reported in other models of infection masopust et al 2001 third with regard to ccr7 expression pircher and colleagues unsoeld et al 2002 used a new reagent to detect mouse ccr7 in lcmv tcr transgenic mice and found that a few days after lcmv infection virus-specific tcr transgenic cd8 t cells that were lytic and cytokine competent showed no clear pattern in their level of ccr7 expression unsoeld et al 2002 to determine the relationship if any between ccr7 expression and effector function in normal not tcr transgenic t cells we infected mice with lcmv and several months later the effector functions of their virus-specific cd8 memory t cells were evaluated directly ex vivo by intracellular cytokine staining iccs using the dominant np118126 peptide as stimulator cells were stained to detect cd8 and ccr7 and we included cd62l for comparative purposes in addition to determine the effects of antigen re-exposure some long-term lcmv-immune mice were reinfected with lcmv and sacrificed 4 days later their splenocytes were analyzed as already described representative results are shown in fig 2
 all cells shown are cd8 t cells and the axes represent ifn-cd62l fig 2a or ifn-ccr7 fig 2b prior to secondary infection left columns in figs 2a and 2b peptide-responsive ie ifn- cd8 memory t cells in the spleen were almost all cd62l and ccr7 this identification of ccr7 cells that respond immediately to antigen contact is not consistent with the centraleffector memory hypothesis four days after virus infection post-2 right column in fig 2a and 2b the cytokine competent cells had expanded and were still cd62l but their ccr7 status had markedly changed with the majority of the responding cells being ccr7 thus our data show that in normal cd8 memory t cells ccr7 expression does not correlate with the absence of immediate effector function rather we suggest that it may correlate with the infection status because ccr7 expression decreases markedly in the 4 days following secondary virus infection ccr7 is thought to mediate attachment to endothelial cells campbell 1998 gunn 1998 and alters the distribution of cells within the spleen potsch et al 1999 presumably like cd62l ccr7 is down-regulated during infection to permit efficient extravasation of effector t cells similar findings have recently been reported by others ravkov et al 2003 furthermore in vivo analyses have shown that both of these proposed classes of cd8 memory cell can confer protective immunity and they might be better considered as parts of a continuum in which effector memory cells serve as the origin for central memory cells which are distinguished more by their anatomical locations than by their effector functions wherry et al 2003 in summary although there is no doubt that cd8 memory t cells may be somewhat heterogenous in their function and distribution there is little to support the original classification into two discrete populations based on marker expression and effector activitythe great majority of published work on memory cells has focused on tissues in which t cells are abundant usually in the spleen and lymph nodes the information derived is interesting and relevant but it represents an incomplete snapshot of antiviral cd8 t cell responses in vivo because many of their biologic effects must be exerted in nonlymphoid tissues although it has been known for many years that memory t cells can be found in nonlymphoid tissues mackay 1992 sprent 1976 their detailed analysis is a new area of research and the emerging data are rather inconclusive one study showed that cd8 memory t cells in lung and liver were immediately cytolytic masopust et al 2001 but others have investigated the effector functions of cd8 memory t cells in the lung parenchyma and airways and have found that virus-specific cells are not immediately cytolytic hogan 2001a ostler 2001 furthermore even in an exhaustively studied organ the spleen controversy remains selin and welsh 1997 showed that a small proportion of lcmv-specific memory cells in the spleen were cytolytic oehen and brduscha-riem 1998 extended this observation in an lcmv transgenic tcr model demonstrating that some of the transgenic lcmv-specific cd8 memory t cells in the spleens were cytolytic in a short-term 6 h assay however the lefrancois laboratory showed that in contrast to oehens findings cd8 memory cells in the spleen were not cytolytic masopust et al 2001 our own observations suggest that soon after the virus is cleared lytic activity is rapidly lost by the great majority of lcmv-specific cells in the spleen rodriguez et al 2001 the regulation and expression of t cell effector functions in peripheral tissues will be the focus of much study in the coming years as will the quantity of t cells that are resident at these sites it is known that the number of virus-specific cd8 memory t cells in peripheral tissues such as lung tissue remains relatively stable for many months but it remains uncertain whether this outcome is achieved by homeostatic division of lung-resident cells or whether the population is continually replenished by the immigration of new memory cells from lymphoid tissues the available data favor the second mechanism ely 2003 hogan 2002virus-specific cd8 t lymphocytes control microbial infections in two general ways by secreting cytokines such as ifn- and tnf and by lysing infected cells it has long been assumed that for controlling viral infections the cytolytic function of cd8 t cells far outweighs the contribution made by their release of cytokines there are at least two mechanisms by which cd8 t cells can cause lysis of infected target cells first by the insertion of a pore-forming protein perforin into the target cell membrane thus facilitating the entry of toxic molecules such as granzymes and second by triggering death pathways as exemplified by the fasfasl pathway in this pathway an interaction between the fas molecule on the target cell and its ligand fasl on the t cell results in apoptotic death of the infected cell many probably most cd8 t cells develop cytolytic capability within hours of antigen contact but epitope-specific cd8 t cells can differ in their cytolytic capacities and virus-specific cd8 t cells very rapidly lose their lytic activity after virus clearance although they remain cytokine competentthat is capable of producing cytokines immediately upon antigen contact rodriguez et al 2001 the role of the fasfasl pathway in direct antiviral defense is unclear fasfasl interactions have been implicated in regulating virus infection of hepatocytes kafrouni et al 2001 and neurons medana et al 2000 but in the absence of perforin this pathway appears incapable of controlling lcmv infection walsh et al 1994 there is no doubt that perforin is important in the clearance of several virus infections such as lcmv kagi 1994 walsh 1994 but cytolytic activity long considered the crown jewel in the cd8 t cell armamentarium is in some cases dispensable perforin plays little role in controlling infections caused by vaccinia semliki forest virus vesicular stomatitis virus kagi et al 1995 rotaviruses franco et al 1997b and coxsackie viruses gebhard et al 1998 furthermore exposure to cytokines can directly reduce viral replication and cytokines alone are able to cure some infected cells by inactivating viral replication in the absence of cell death estcourt 1998 guidotti 1996 levy 1996 walker 1991 thus both cytokines and cytotoxicity contribute to the antiviral activity of cd8 t cellsone way in which t cells could enhance their biological efficacy would be by optimizing their sensitivity to antigen contact this could in principle be achieved by increasing the affinity of the tcr for the relevant epitopemhc complex others have reported that between 8 days postinfection and the memory phase t cell populations carrying tcr of higher affinity are selectively expanded busch 1999 savage 1999 however this leads to only a very small about twofold to fourfold increase in the antigen-responsiveness of the t cell population and for several reasons it appears that tcr affinity can contribute nothing more to the maturing cd8 t cell response most importantly and in contrast to antibodies whose affinities for cognate antigen range from 107 to 1012 m the affinities of tcrs for peptidemhc are very low in vivo ranging from 104 to 107 m eisen 1996 valitutti 1997 this low affinity is unlikely to result from structural constraints because in vitro mutagenesis of a tcr can generate a receptor with very high affinity for cognate antigen holler et al 2000b thus the low affinity of tcr in vivo appears to result from selective pressures that favor cells bearing low-affinity receptors andor oppose cells expressing high-affinity molecules consistent with the idea that high-affinity tcrs are not evolutionarily desirable these receptors appear incapable of somatic hypermutation the sequence of a tcr in a naive cell remains unaltered following activation and expansion several proposals have been advanced to explain this in vivo affinity ceiling for tcrmhc interactions i high-affinity tcr may be deleted during thymic selection ii t cells bearing high-affinity tcr that escape thymic deletion may become dysfunctional or be actively eliminated by prolonged tcr contact with cognate antigen in the host periphery valitutti and lanzavecchia 1997 and iii cells carrying tcr with affinities of approximately 107 m can be triggered by very low levels of cognate antigen so the host has no need to produce cells with higher affinity receptors salzmann 1998 sykulev 1995does this mean that cd8 t cells improve their antigen responsiveness only about twofold to fourfold during viral infection prior studies compared cells at the peak of the immune response with cells in the memory phase these time points were selected because cells were sufficiently numerous to be readily detectable by then-current methods however technological advances allowed us to investigate the antigen-responsiveness of virus-specific t cells from much earlier times postinfection when cells are few in number we found that between approximately 4 and 8 days postinfection the quantity of peptide antigen needed to trigger cytokine production by virus-specific cd8 t cells diminished by about 70-fold and remained stable thereafter essentially for the lifetime of the animal slifka and whitton 2001 by optimizing their ability to be triggered by very low levels of antigen cd8 t cells ensure that they can recognize cells very early minuteshours after they have become infected thus maximizing the chance that the t cells effector functions eg cytokine production cytolytic activity will be exerted before the virus has had the opportunity to complete its cycle of replication maturation and egress this occurs without a demonstrable selection of cells bearing high-affinity tcr we proposed that this optimization is mediated by hard-wiring of the signal transduction apparatus a suggestion confirmed by another study kersh et al 2003 in this light we proposed an additional explanation for the in vivo affinity ceiling of tcrs t cells are serial killers and their biological function relies on their being able to rapidly disengage from one target cell and move to another this antiviral activity might be fatally compromised if t cells were irrevocably linked to a target cell by high-affinity tcr this explanation is consistent with an elegant study that showed there is an optimal dwell time in the interaction between an epitopeclass i complex and the tcr of a cd8 t cell if this interaction is too weak or too strong the t cell does not proliferate only those cd8 t cells bearing tcr that are just right are rapidly expanded and thus are included in the antiviral immune response kalergis et al 2001we have explained that t cells increase their antigen-responsiveness in vivo by becoming able to respond to lower levels of antigen recent studies suggest that as few as 10 peptidemhc complexes are sufficient to stimulate coordinated signaling via the tcr irvine et al 2002 in which case the antigen-sensitivity of activated t cells approaches the lowest possible limit of antigen concentration on the cell surface how else might the cells improve their effector response we reasoned that they might do so by increasing the speed with which they begin cytokine production after being triggered by antigen contact to determine how quickly an epitope-specific population of cd8 t cells could initiate ifn- synthesis in response to antigen contact their on-rate the proportion of cells synthesizing ifn- was evaluated after 1 2 3 4 and 6 hr of peptide exposure the response at 6 hr was defined as 100 the prior responses were plotted as a fraction of that maximum response and the time taken for 50 of cells to respond to antigen the half-maximal on-rate or12 was identified for each population representative results are shown in fig 3
 the or12 of cells harvested at 8 days postinfection was approximately 375 h but the or12 decreased markedly between day 8 and day 15 and by 21 days postinfection the cell populations had become maximally responsive to antigen contact or12  1 h this rapid response was retained in long-term immune animals day 30 reinfection of long-term immune mice did not appreciably accelerate the response day 4 post-2 indicating that an or12 of approximately 1 h may represent the fastest possible response by a cd8 t cell population data not shown it is important to ask whether this acceleration in responsefrom about 4 to 1 his likely to be biologically significant although this improvement may at first blush appear modest one must remember that for most viruses a single round of propagation from infection through replication to release of infectious progeny takes place over a short time period usually about 624 h consequently even a small increase in the rapidity with which a triggered cd8 t cell can express an antiviral function might substantially decrease the ability of a virus to complete its replication cycle in an infected cellwe have shown that cytokine production by cd8 t cells is very tightly regulated ifn- and tumor necrosis factor tnf are produced only when the t cell is in contact with cognate antigen slifka et al 1999 however as shown in fig 4
 the pattern of cytokines produced by virus-specific cells changes as the immune response to infection proceeds slifka and whitton 2000a when cells are harvested from lcmv-infected balbc mice during the expansion phase of the primary response up to 7 to 8 days postinfection for many viruses and are exposed to antigen in vitro two broad populations can be distinguished one produces only ifn- while the other produces both ifn- and tnf as the response contracts day 15 the ratio of these two populations changes and double-positive cells outnumber single-positive cells by approximately 51 this process continues into the memory phase day 60 at which time almost all cells respond to antigen contact by immediately producing ifn- and tnf this maturational shift in cytokine profiles also was observed following lcmv infection of c57bl6 mice and during recombinant vaccinia virus infection not shown a similar change in phenotype occurs during the response to secondary infection not shown the cells are initially double-positive ie they are memory phenotype but soon after infection single-positive cells appear after infection is cleared the population reverts to the double-positive memory phenotype these observations have been confirmed in both the influenza model belz et al 2001 and the murine gamma herpesvirus model liu et al 2002 the physiologic significance of this change has not been determinedlike the cd8 response transient exposure to antigen induces a program of cd4 proliferation lee et al 2002 and the great majority of cd4 t cells activated during infection are antigen-specific ie few cells are driven by nonspecific bystander activation homann 2001 whitmire 1998 however cd4 t cell responses are typically much lower in magnitude than the concurrent cd8 t cell responses maini 1998 maini 2000 whitmire 1998 whitmire 2000 this difference correlates with a lower proliferation rate as revealed by brdu incorporation or cfse labeling it has been estimated that in the week following lcmv infection a virus-specific cd4 t cell undergoes only about nine cell divisions homann et al 2001 the survival of the proliferating cells is improved with prolonged antigen stimulation lee et al 2002 the cd4 expansion phase also is regulated by several costimulatory interactions including cd40lcd40 whitmire et al 1999 cd28b7 suresh et al 2001 ox40ox40l kopf et al 1999 and icos kopf et al 2000 although these interactions are not required for t-help-independent cd8 t cell responses cd4 t cells may be regulated more tightly than cd8 t cells via expression of ctla4 or dr6 or other molecules that inhibit proliferation bird 1998 doyle 2001 there is also evidence that there are intrinsic differences in the proliferative potential of cd4 t cells and cd8 t cells foulds et al 2002 perhaps cd4 t cells differentiation requires prolongedrepeated antigen contact whereas cd8 t cells commit to full differentiation after only brief stimulation kaech 2001 van stipdonk 2001contraction of the cd4 t cell response is quantitatively similar to that of cd8 t cells in that about 90 of the cells die however in contrast to the abrupt contraction of cd8 t cells which is usually complete within 1 week of the peak response cd4 t cell contraction lingers over the course of several weeks homann 2001 kamperschroer 1999 il-2 treatment can increase both proliferation and survival of cd4 t cells blattman et al 2003 suggesting that cytokine withdrawal may play an important part in cd4 t cell contractiona number of reports have shown that cd4 t cell responses to lcmv sendai virus and influenza virus in mice can be readily detected long after the infection has been cleared topham 1998 topham 1996a varga 1998 whitmire 1998 and this cd4 t cell memory is maintained in the absence of antigen and mhc class ii swain et al 1999 some studies suggest that cd4 memory is even more stable than cd8 memory chang 2001 varga 2001 but this is somewhat controversial one study reported a decline in cd4 memory cell number over a prolonged period in contrast to cd8 memory t cells which remained stable in the same mice homann et al 2001 the changes correlated with levels of the antiapoptotic molecule bcl2 which were lower in cd4 memory t cells than in cd8 memory t cells despite the conflicting conclusions from these studies it is clear that cd4 t cell memory is regulated differently from cd8 t cell memory for example it appears that the survival of cd4 memory cells is not dependent on il-15 or il-7 tan et al 2002 and cells lacking a common cytokine receptor chain survive indicating that il-2 -4 -7 -9 and -15 may not be required lantz et al 2000 howeveras evidence that the understanding of this process is far from completea recent paper reported that the homeostasis of cd4 memory t cells was regulated by il-7 signaling seddon et al 2003 cd4 memory t cells show improved responsiveness to antigen and can respond very quickly to antigen reencounter by producing cytokines homann 2001 rogers 2000for the most part cd8 t cells are at the front line their biological effects are exerted directly upon infected cells the functions of cd4 t cells are more disparate and usually serve to assist or otherwise regulate the responses of b cells and cd8 t cells because their main function is to provide help to other lymphocytes cd4 t cells often are termed t helper th cells and at least two different subsets of th can be defined according to their pattern of cytokine production th1 cells produce il-2 ifn- lymphotoxin and tnf whereas th2 cells produce il-4 il-5 and il-10 th1 cells are associated with the induction of the igg2a subclass of igg antibody and th2 cells direct the production of igg1 both th1 and th2 cells can be induced following many viral infections including cmv kallas 1998 tsai 1997 hiv imami et al 2002 ebv steigerwald-mullen 2000 wilson 2001 rsv bendelja 2000 tripp 2002 hbv diepolder et al 2001 hcv godkin 2002 rosen 2002 tsai 1997 and measles virus ovsyannikova 2003 ward 1993 in humans the cells can also be induced following lcmv su 1998 whitmire 1998 influenza graham et al 1994 sendai mo et al 1995 coxsackievirus b3 huber and pfaeffle 1994 rsv srikiatkhachorn 1999 tripp 2001 and others in mice the ratio of th1 to th2 cells induced by infection can vary markedly depending on the infectious agent and host genetic background both cell types can be specific for the same epitopes varga 2000 whitmire 1998 and there is evidence arguing that antigen dose alone does not dictate the type of th cell induced there are some correlations between the th1th2 ratio induced by virus infection and the clinical outcome imami 2002 tsai 1997 wang 2003 although this is a controversial issue bergamini et al 2001 for example clearance of acute hcv infection is associated with a strong th1 cell response whereas individuals who developed chronic hcv infection had predominantly th2 responses tsai et al 1997some viruses such as measles virus hcmv and mcmv are found to induce a generalized th1 to th2 shift and cause immune suppression studies of chronic lcmv infection have indicated that primary th1 t cell responses are reduced in magnitude ciurea et al 2001 compared to acute lcmv infection with il-2 cells being most affected fuller and zajac 2003 and the virus-specific cd4 t cells that are initially induced disappear over time fuller 2003 oxenius 1998 in contrast in mice infected with gamma-herpesvirus which persists at low levels virus-specific il-2 cd4 t cell responses can be detected long after initial infection flano et al 2001 in terms of activation requirements fewer th1 and th2 cd4 t cells are induced by virus infection in the absence of intact cd40cd40l or b7cd28 costimulation pathways whitmire et al 1999 however other model systems have provided evidence that th2 cells have a lower reliance on costimulation while the definition of the th1 and th2 subsets is clearand there is evidence in cell lines for chromosomal restructuring suggesting irrevocable differentiationis it possible that during an in vivo infection some cells at times make cytokines of both classes there is a precedent for this in humans infected with cmv kallas et al 1998 but because il-4 is best detected by elisa or elispot assays proof of this in mice must await improved intracellular staining techniques that allow costaining for both ifn- and il-4a long recognized function of cd4 t cells is their ability to induce b cell differentiation they are involved in class switching and in the transition of virus-specific memory b cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells because preexisting antibody is a first line of defense against reinfection these cd4 t cell functions are crucial for protection cd4 t cells drive b cell differentiation and proliferation by acting through the cd40lcd40 pathway and they modify antibody class-switching by stimulating b cells with ifn- or il-4 these differentiation events occur primarily in germinal centers where activated cd4 t cells associate with antigen-reactive b cells garside 1998 pape 2003 cd4 t cells deliver their help to b cells in an antigen-specific manner memory b cells can internalize viral antigen via their surface-bound antibodies these antigens are processed within the b cell and epitope peptides are presented at the cell surface in association with mhc class ii molecules section iib only those cd4 t cells that are specific for the epitopes will therefore be triggered ensuring that during a virus infection only virus-specific cd4 t cells will be triggered to respond and their signals will be delivered only to the virus-specific memory b cells recent studies have identified a protein named sap that plays a key role in the differentiation of cd4 t cells wu et al 2001 sap-deficient mice mount antigen-specific cd4 t cell responses to infection but these cells cannot support the development of long-lived plasma cells crotty et al 2003 the reason that sap cd4 t cells are unable to provide this particular type of help remains unknown the cells make normal amounts of ifn- il-2 and il-4 and they express cd40lmany viruses eg lcmv sendai vaccinia influenza ectromelia gamma-herpesvirus-68 and theilers virus induce strong primary cd8 t cell responses even in the absence of cd4 t cells ahmed 1988 belz 2002 belz 2003 buller 1987 hou 1995 johnson 1999 mo 1997 these infections often are systemic and may directly activate innate defenses and apc costimulatory molecule expression by infecting apcs olson 2001 wu 1994 these infections may instead express peptides of high avidity for mhc class i and tcr franco 2000 heath 1993 thus triggering the program of cd8 t cell differentiation without the need for accessory molecule expression in contrast viruses that replicate to a lower extent or are localized to peripheral sites often induce a detectable primary cd8 t cell response only when cd4 t cells are present examples of such t-help-dependent antiviral cd8 t cell responses in mice are those induced by rauscher leukemia virus japanese encephalitis virus herpes simplex virus and mouse hepatitis virus edelmann 2001 hom 1991 jennings 1991 murali-krishna 1996 stohlman 1998cd4 t cells can provide help to cd8 t cells in at least two ways the first described previously involves apc licensing via the cd40-pathway this enhances the costimulatory signals that are delivered to naive cd8 t cells and triggers their program of proliferation and differentiation a second means by which cd4 t cells can enhance primary cd8 responses is by secreting il-2 the effects of il-2 on cd8 t cells are manifold this cytokine induces fasl expression on cd8 t cells thus increasing those cells cytotoxic potential esser et al 1997 and il-2 also may increase ifn- production by those cells cousens et al 1995 il-2 thus augments the proliferation of cd8 t cells cousens et al 1995 and prolongs their survival akbar 1996 blattman 2003 kelly 2002 krummel 1999 so that effector cells can pursue virus-infected cells for longer periods of time for example during coronavirus infection of the cns high numbers of cd4 t cells and cd8 t cells can be found in the brain parenchyma haring et al 2001 if cd4 t cells are absent coronavirus-specific cd8 t cells still migrate to sites of infection in the cns but they are much more likely to undergo apoptosis stohlman et al 1998 this is consistent with their having an in vivo requirement for cd4-produced il-2 finally there is strong evidence suggesting that cd8 memory t cell numbers are influenced by il-2 blattman et al 2003 however il-2 can also have deleterious effects on cd8 t cells including increasing apoptosis of activated cells depending on when and how much it is produced and to what extent the cd8 t cells are stimulated van parijs et al 1999 given the possible opposing effects of il-2 it will be interesting to learn how cd4 t cell production of this cytokine is regulated it is conceivable that different amounts of the cytokine are produced at different times depending on what effect is neededin addition to possible effects on the primary cd8 t cell response cd4 t cells also may regulate the quality and quantity of cd8 t cell memory primary cd8 responses to lcmv and influenza virus are relatively normal in cd4 mice but memory responses measured by limiting dilution assay or after secondary infection are much reduced belz 2002 von herrath 1996 recent publications suggest that cd4 t cells may deliver a signal during the early programming of naive cd8 t cells which facilitates their survival and ensures that they can respond appropriately to secondary antigen challenge section iva3 cd4 t cells also may play a key role in sustaining cd8 t cells during persistent virus infections during persistent infection in the absence of cd4 t cells cd8 t cells are quickly deleted or are rendered nonresponsive battegay 1994 hunziker 2002 matloubian 1994 zajac 1998cd4 t cells may mediate direct purging of mhc class ii-expressing cells such as b cells which can be infected by for example ebv or murine gamma herpesvirus macrophages and dendritic cells which can be infected by several viruses or microglia targets of several cns infections including theilers virus or mouse hepatitis virus however the restricted anatomical distribution of mhc class ii molecules means that cd4 t cells may be unable to recognize or act directly upon the great majority of cells that become infected following virus challenge and this presents an obvious obstacle to the concept that cd4 t cells commonly exert direct antiviral effects section iii nevertheless it is clear that several cell types eg epithelial cells can up-regulate mhc class ii expression during viral infection rendering them potentially recognizable to cd4 t cells furthermore the existence of cytolytic cd4 t cells is not in doubt and one might infer that such cellwhose cytolytic effects rely on direct contact with an antigen-expressing target cellare unlikely to exist without good reason cytolytic cd4 t cells were first identified in vivo as distinct from cd4 t cell lines or clones in lcmv-infected 2-microglobulin-deficient mice muller et al 1992 and subsequent careful analyses suggested that these virus-specific cd4 t cells could exert profound effects in the absence of cd8 t cells quinn et al 1993 indeed some 2-microglobulin-deficient mice cleared lcmv infection despite the lack of cd8 t cells muller et al 1992 suggesting but not proving that the cd4 t cells might have a direct antiviral effect this interpretation is strengthened by the observations zajac et al 1996 that i the cytotoxic effect of the cd4 t cells is fas-mediated and ii the in vivo effects are fas-dependent fas-dependence strongly suggests that the effects require a direct cellcell interaction between a fasl cd4 t cell and a fas-expressing target cell however the model of 2-microglobulin-deficient mice is fraught with difficulties reviewed in frelinger and serody 1998 and direct cytolytic effects of cd4 t cells on infected cells in vivo remain to be demonstrated cytolytic cd4 t cells also have been identified following epstein-barr virus infection khanolkar et al 2001 and perforin cd4 t cells have been reported in hiv infected individuals appay et al 2002 the mere existence of such cells however cannot be considered proof of their having a direct or indeed any antiviral effectperhaps the best evidence for direct cd4 t cell-mediated control of infection is in the murine gamma-herpesvirus model in which it appears likely although not certain that the cd4 t cells exert their effects via ifn- production directly on virus-infected mhc class ii-positive target cells christensen et al 1999 there is other circumstantial evidence consistent with the idea that cd4 t cells may exert some direct effector functions cd4 t cells are generally thought of as functioning in the spleen or lymph nodes but there is increasing evidence that cd4 memory t cells can reside in peripheral nonlymphoid sites hogan 2001b marzo 2002 mcsorley 2002 reinhardt 2001 these cells show a highly activated phenotype with elevated levels of cd25 and cd44 and decreased levels of cd45rb and cd11a making them distinct from splenic memory cd4 t cells cauley 2002 hogan 2001b cd4 t cells in the periphery tend to make ifn- arguabley consistent with a direct effector function while those that reside preferentially in lymphoid organs make more il-2 consistent with an immunoregulatory activity however these arguments are very much conjectural and exceptions exist as noted cd4 t cells in the coronavirus-infected brain produce survival factorspossibly il-2to rescue cd8 t cellsmany situations exist in which transfer of virus-specific cd4 t cells has a profound effect on the outcome of virus infection andor disease for example transfer of poliovirus-specific cd4 t cells into human-poliovirus-receptor transgenic mice protects the recipients from lethal poliovirus infection mahon et al 1995 infection of neurons is required for a lethal outcome and these cells do not usually express mhc class ii molecules therefore this effect is unlikely to be direct similarly transfer of hbv-specific effector cd4 t cells reduces viral load in mice transgenic for hbv franco et al 1997a and cd4 t cells can mediate protection against sendai infection independently of antibody or cd8 t cells zhong et al 2001 to evaluate possible bystander effects mediated by cd4 t cells chimeric mice have been produced that express mhc class ii molecules on some cells but not on others using this approach it has been shown that influenza virus-specific cd4 t cells can clear infection from mhc class ii-negative cells consistent with bystander effects however indirect antibody-mediated effects were not excluded topham et al 1996bthe cytokine profiles of cd4 t cells change over time at the peak of the response to lcmv most of the cd4 t cell response is th1 in phenotype and there is a mixture of virus-specific cd4 t cells that make ifn- ifn- and il-2 ifn- and tnf or all three cytokines the majority of these cd4 t cells make only ifn- in response to antigen contact although approximately 30 also make il-2 harrington 2002 varga 2000 and a few synthesize tnf harrington 2002 homann 2001 varga 2000 in contrast during the memory phase very few single-positive cells can be identified and essentially all of the cells are double-positive ifn- tnf or ifn- il-2 harrington 2002 homann 2001 these patterns are reminiscent of the changes reported for cd8 t cells slifka and whitton 2000a fig 4 the significance of these changes is unclear could the cytokine double-positive cells have differentiated further than the single-positive cells are the single-positive cells a distinct lineage that terminally-differentiate into short-lived effector cells like cd8 t cells cd4 t cells have been categorized into central memory cells defined as cd62lhi ccr7 and effector memory cells cd62llo ccr7 the expression of cd62l and ccr7 affects the localization of t cells with the central memory cells preferentially localized in the secondary lymphoid organs and the effector memory cells traveling through peripheral sites however as for cd8 t cells there is no clear relationship between cd4 t cell effector function and the expression of these marker proteinsimmune responses are not invariably successful in controlling infection and infections remain a major and increasing cause of human morbidity and mortality it is easy to forgive the occasional failure on the part of the immune system especially when one considers the innumerable strategies developed by microbes to evade its unwelcome attentions however it is important to realize that successful immune responses themselves are delivered at a cost because in eradicating infection the immune system also can damage the host this phenomenon is termed immunopathology and it is an extremely common feature of virus infection many of the symptoms of common viral infectionsfor example the chills muscle aches and fever of influenza as well as the characteristic rash of measlesare not caused directly by the virus but instead result from the immune response to the virus a detailed review of this topic would far exceed the scope of this chapter suffice it to say that the very nature of the cd8 t cell responsewhich often involves lysis of infected cells or the release of highly toxic cytokinesmeans that immunopathology is an almost inevitable consequence of viral infection we have argued that the need to minimize immunopathology has provided a strong selective pressure that ensures that the effector functions of cd8 t cells are held in an extraordinarily tight rein slifka 2000b slifka 1999 moreover antibodies should not be considered innocent parties antibodyantigen complexes may be deposited at various anatomical interfaces eg in the basement membrane of the kidney and can lead to complement activation and severe inflammatory damage one key question which has been approached only infrequently is to ask if we can uncouple the harmful and the beneficial effects of the immune response coxsackie virus infection of humans or mice often results in severe myocarditis and survivors have extensive myocardial scarring often causing dilated cardiomyopathy which is treatable only by transplantation there is no approved treatment for coxsackie virus myocarditis using the mouse model we have found that myocarditis and subsequent scarring are much reduced in perforin-deficient mice but these animals clear the virus infection with kinetics indistinguishable from those observed in normal mice gebhard et al 1998 thus we suggest that the development of a reagent capable of specifically blocking perforin activity might permit the treatment of coxsackie virus myocarditis without compromising the hosts ability to recover from the infectionevolutionary pressures imposed by an unremitting onslaught of infectious agents have shaped the mammalian immune system and our very existence stands as proof of the potency of the antimicrobial immune response the cooperative nature of the antibody and t cell arms of the adaptive immune system has long been recognized but our understanding of the immune response to infection remains far from complete recent studies have begun to reveal previously unappreciated subtleties in the t cell response which are tailored to most effectively detect a viral challenge and to provide a rapid and effective reply if safer and more effective vaccines are to be designed and if the harmful effects of the immune response are to be diminished while retaining beneficial components we must not rest on our laurels many important questions remain to be answeredthe experience in 2003 with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars highlighted the issue of aerosol transmission both short range between healthcare workers and their patients1 2 3 and long range amongst the residents of the amoy gardens estate4 5 aerosol or airborne transmission is already well recognized for many human pathogens much work has been performed using air-sampling techniques together with culture and molecular detection methods for viruses6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 particularly varicella zoster virus vzv17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 bacteria25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 particularly tuberculosis mycobacterium tuberculosis tb and other mycobacteria34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 and fungi particularly aspergillus spp43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 beggs reviewed the importance of airborne transmission of infection in hospitals focusing mainly on bacteria that are well known to cause nosocomial infections ie staphylococcus aureus and meticillin-resistant s aureus mrsa m tuberculosis acinetobacter spp aspergillus spp pseudomonas spp and legionella spp57 he concluded that for these infections although contact spread was still the main route of infection infections via the airborne route both direct and indirect via the settling of airborne pathogens on fomites were probably underestimatedthe generation of such infectious aerosols of infectious human pathogens can occur in many ways and in many settings although some have been studied more extensively than others due to their greater clinical significance the literature on the risks of aerosol transmission of infection in hospital operating theatres is extensive58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 over 40 studies on the relationship between ventilation systems and the transmission of infection in hospitals offices aeroplanes and ships were reviewed recently by li et al
66 studies have also been conducted on how infectious aerosols generated by various procedures in hospital environments can lead to infection in burns care facilities67 68 69 and medical intensive care units70 71 in particular the use of oxygen masks72 73 and power tools in dental practice74 75 76 77 and orthopaedics77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 may pose a risk of aerosol infection aerosol dispersal of infectious agents has also been demonstrated in wastewater spray sites85 surface waves on the sea86 the flushing of the household toilet87 and even just opening a standard hinged door88
true long-range aerosol transmission becomes possible when the droplets of infectious material are sufficiently small to remain almost indefinitely airborne and to be transmitted over long distances one set of infection control guidelines for healthcare settings suggested that only tb measles rubeola virus and chickenpox vzv should be considered as true airborne infectious diseases89 however it is likely that other infectious agents may also behave as airborne given a favourable environment eg whooping cough bordetella pertussis influenza virus adenovirus rhinovirus mycoplasma pneumoniae sars coronavirus sars-cov group a streptococcus and neisseria meningitidis many more organisms fall into this category as it probably includes virtually all pathogens where replication andor colonization occur in the respiratory tract
table i lists organisms associated with varying degrees of aerosol transmission90 each organism can also be transmitted through direct contact with infected body fluidsa recent systematic review demonstrated that adequate or inadequate ventilation has an effect on the risk of infection via infectious aerosols66 this interdisciplinary review authored by a large group of engineers microbiologists and epidemiologists defined the following termsairborne transmission refers to the passage of micro-organisms from a source to a person through aerosols resulting in infection of the person with or without consequent diseaseaerosols are a suspension of solid or liquid particles in a gas with particle size from 0001 to over 100 m91 infectious aerosols contain pathogensa droplet nucleus is the airborne residue of a potentially infectious micro-organism-bearing aerosol from which most of the liquid has evaporated92

on the basis of these definitions the following clinically applicable distinctions are made between short-range airborne infection routes between individuals generally less than 1-m apart and long-range routes within a room between rooms or between distant locations generally greater than 1-m distancesthe short-range airborne infection route depends on the close proximity of the infected source and susceptible host a study was performed recently xie et al unpublished observations to define more clearly the size of the droplets originally referred to by wells92 these terms are also in common current use this study proposes the following size definitions large-droplet diameter 60 m small droplet diameter 60 m and droplet nuclei diameter 10 m note that small droplets may also participate in short-range transmission but they are more likely than larger droplets to evaporate to become droplet nuclei and then be considered as having the potential for long-range airborne transmission see below93 exhaled air from both nose and mouth is able to enter and mix with air in the breathing zone of another person standing nearby eg patients and doctors on a ward round at the bedside thus short-range transmission implies that air flows between individuals may interact to infect one another94 in addition it has been shown that the use of a simple oxygen mask may also generate a short-range 1 m infectious aerosol with a potential risk to nearby healthcare workers and other patients72 73 together with nebulizers oxygen masks fall into this classification of potential short-range aerosol transmission sources but some droplets generated by such masks can evaporate to become droplet nuclei that can also transmit infection over larger distances57
long-range aerosol transmission refers to the potential for agents to be carried long distances by air flows to cause infection and includes the traditional terms small-droplet or droplet nuclei and airborne virtually all infectious agents that can cause infection at long range can also cause infection at short range as well as by direct contact therefore use of the term long range refers to the greatest distance from their source at which these agents have the potential to cause infection
if the pathogen has some part of its life cycle in the respiratory tract it is more likely to be present in aerosols generated and projected into the surrounding air by breathing talking coughing sneezing and singing for truly airborne pathogens tb measles and vzv the routes of acquisition and dissemination of the infectious particles are well recognized to be via the respiratory tract in the other pathogens listed in table i acquisition of the infection is also via the respiratory tract which is the primary site of infection and replication therefore these other pathogens such as parvovirus b19 enteroviruses and the organisms of atypical pneumonias m pneumoniae chlamydophila psittaci previously chlamydia psittaci chlamydophila pneumoniae previously chlamydia pneumoniae coxiella burnetti and legionella pneumophila have the potential to be transmitted via aerosols as their life cycle involves replication at some point in the respiratory tract regarding l pneumophila replication also occurs in water systems and human infection can occur via infected water aerosols such as showerheads and fountains with sars-cov viral rna as well as viable culturable virus has been found in air samples95 96 therefore sars-cov can potentially be transmitted by short- and long-range aerosols to cause disease as has been strongly implicated by several studies1 2 3 4 5
with influenza there is ongoing debate about the nature of transmission between people a recent review suggested that aerosol-generating proceduresshould be performed with proper infection control precautions but the authors do not elaborate on exactly what these precautions should be97 recent guidelines from the uk review the evidence for aerosol transmission of influenza more comprehensively98 the report concluded that whilst close contact with infected individuals seems to be responsible for the vast majority of transmission most reports of influenza transmission do not provide enough temporal-spatial data to determine whether transmission is mainly due to droplet contact or airborne spread this is probably the most realistic assessment and this uncertainty is reflected in the large range of values for the basic reproductive number r0 the number of secondary cases arising from a single index case in an otherwise totally susceptible population ranging from 1299 to 27100 to 21101 however there are reports to suggest that in pandemic or large explosive outbreak situations influenza can become truly airborne12 13 for comparison the r0 values of other commonly encountered infections are shown in
table iiin contrast other pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis b and c viruses replicate mainly outside the respiratory tract and are not naturally transmitted via aerosols with other organisms that can replicate on many surfaces either inside or outside the body eg s aureus the picture is not so clear-cut although mainly spread by direct contact there is a suggestion that patients that carry s aureus in the respiratory tract can spread the bacteria by short-range aerosols57 106
s aureus on skin epithelial cells on fomites such as bed sheets can also be spread during bed making57 106 this becomes more important when considering resistant strains such as mrsa57
a commonly encountered source is the patient with flu-like symptoms who is coughing sneezing and dispersing the organism 
figure 1107 108 in the diagnostic laboratory it may be an inoculated culture medium that is dropped or spilt as has been reported for laboratory-acquired sars infection109 a more worrying possibility is the deliberate release of a biological agent such as during the us terrorist anthrax attacks of 2001200232 33 or an accidental release such as the anthrax incident in the russian city of sverdlovsk of 1979110
a sneeze can generate up to 40 000 droplets figure 1107 108 which can evaporate to produce droplets of 0512 m in diameter107 a cough can generate about 3000 droplet nuclei the same number as talking for 5 minutes111 during normal breathing exhalation can project droplets up to 1 m in room air which may be inhaled by another person nearby 
figure 294 whereas sneezing can project droplets several metres figure 1107 108 in addition a recent study has shown that some individuals may exhale more particles during quiet breathing than others suggesting that some people may be more infectious than others when infected with the same organism112 the way that an infectious aerosol is generated should be considered when assessing the probable distance of spread as noted earlier large droplets can evaporate to become small droplets that can evaporate further to become droplet nuclei and hence become truly airborne if this evaporation process can occur before the droplet lands on the ground the 2003 sars epidemics also revealed iatrogenic and environmental factors that might contribute to producing virus-laden aerosols such as those produced by nebulizers tracheostomies bronchoscopies113 114 115 116 and in the amoy gardens outbreak a defective sewage system4 5
once infectious droplets are released the main factors that determine how they move are their size and the airflow patterns that carry them around 
figure 3 the droplet size changes with time depending on the environmental conditions humidity in the air alters the rate of droplet evaporation and therefore its size droplets in dry air evaporate quickly reduce in size and fall to the ground more slowly57 the changing size of a droplet affects how it will respond to airflow patterns and how quickly it will settle movement in air is determined by stokes settling law which governs how quickly a sphere falls under the opposing forces of gravity downwards and air friction upwards figure 392 knight estimated the times taken for particles of various diameters to fall 3 m corresponding to the height of a room10 particles of diameters 13 m remained suspended almost indefinitely 10 m took 17 min 20 m took 4 min and 100 m took 10 s to fall to the floor naked viruses bacteria and fungal spores ie without associated water mucus or pus droplets range in approximate size from 002 to 03 m from 5 to 100 m and from 1 to 10 m respectively infectious agents from patients can be expelled as individual or clusters of naked organisms or disseminated on skin cells mucus or saliva107 the amount of solid matter in a droplet ultimately determines its minimal size limittemperature differences can set up large exchange flows between rooms in a similar way to leaving a front door open on a cold day 
figure 4 opening a hinged door leads to a sweeping action which can also move a considerable volume of infectious air across the open doorway figure 4 a typical hinged door about 1 m wide opening relatively slowly from closed to 45 sweeps out one-eighth of a circle of circumference c 2  63 m c  2r therefore the door edge travels about 638  about 08 m in about 2 s generating an air flow with speed of approximately 082  04 ms in practice doors may be opened faster and wider than this as the door opens air inside the room is dragged or entrained into the region swept by the door leading to a large exchange of air across the doorway117 118 at least one case report has described a secondary case of chickenpox arising from infectious air being transported out of an isolation room containing a patient with severe chickenpox via the opening of a hinged door88 closing a door does not seem to lead to any significant air exchange between rooms such problems with hinged doors may be reduced by the use of sliding doorsthe effect of movement of people on air flow produces a similar effect to door opening but is more complex and difficult to calculate the velocity of the layer of air closest to the body is comparable to a persons walking speed as a person moves at speed u there is a volume flux f of air volume of approximately f  cau2 where c is the drag coefficient for a body approximately equal to 1 in this example a is the cross-sectional area of the body for a person about 17 m tall 03 m wide and 015 m deep a  17  03  051 m2 and u is velocity in addition there is a wake bubble of volume v where v is the volume of the body in this example v  17  03015  00765 m3 ie a person of 765 kg since 1 m3
  100  100  100 cm3
  1000 l water assuming human body density has an average density equal to that of water and   13119 for a person walking at speed u  1 ms this corresponds to f  1  051  12  0255 m3
  255 ls with an attached wake of v  0076502295 m3
  76230 ls thus movement of people in a room plays a significant part in disturbing the flow and also in transporting infected air from one place to another 
figure 5thus room air flow is governed by a combination of air movements caused by differences in temperaturehumidity and moving bodiesequipment these complex air movements make the route and suspension time of an infectious particle very difficult to determine once it has left the infectious host the infectivity of the droplet nuclei will also change with time as the infectious organism will also be affected by the air temperature and humidityto transmit from the respiratory tract of one person to another the organisms in such droplets must remain airborne for a sufficient amount of time and must remain viable in a sufficient quantity to be inhaled by a susceptible host many environmental factors affect the viability of an infectious agent eg temperature humidity and air flows that might lead to dehydration120 ultraviolet uv radiation121 122 123 chemical hazards such as exhaust fumes from road transport or air pollution120 and possibly cigarette smoke and air fresheners inside houses some organisms resist environmental degradation better than others m tuberculosis is a hardy organism with a thick cell wall and can survive for long periods in the environment111
measles and vzv are both lipid enveloped and are sensitive to changes in temperature relative humidity rh and uv radiation124 viruses without a lipid envelope generally survive longer at high rh 50 eg poliovirus6 120 but lipid-enveloped viruses survive longer in low rh 50 eg influenza6 110 lassa fever virus125 and human coronavirus hcv 229e126 data on hcv 229e from ijaz et al showed that when airborne this virus had a survival half-life of about 3 h at an rh of 80 67 h at an rh of 50 and 27 h at an rh of 30 at 20 c suggesting that high rh above 80 is most detrimental to survival of this coronavirus126 influenza has been shown to survive for 2448 h on hard non-porous surfaces such as stainless steel and plastic but for less than 812 h on cloth paper and tissues127 in addition influenza virus survived for up to 5 min on hands and could be transferred to hands from these non-porous surfaces for 24 h and from tissues for 15 min127 more recently it has been shown that sars-cov can survive in alkaline diarrhoea stools for up to four days and remain infectious in respiratory specimens for more than seven days at room temperature128 similarities with other viruses of nosocomial importance ie other rna lipid-enveloped respiratory viruses such as influenza suggest that such organisms can survive for long enough in aerosols to cause disease especially when associated with biological fluids such as mucus faeces and blood this sensitivity to environmental conditions may also partially explain the seasonality of some viral infectionsthe situation is more complex in airborne bacteria gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae tend to behave like enveloped viruses ie are less stable at high rh120 in contrast a study on another airborne gram-negative bacterium salmonella seftenberg found the opposite ie that survival or tenacity was highest at high rh129 cox suggested that a temperature of 10 c offers optimal survival to most infectious pathogens120 hence it is difficult to predict the survivability of infectious organisms from their structural characteristics alonethe infectious dose of a pathogen is the number of organisms required to cause infection theoretically a single organism in a favourable environment may replicate sufficiently to cause disease guidelines for commissioning operating theatres recommend that the bioload in an empty theatre should not exceed 35 bacteria-carrying particles eg skin scalesm3 air130 131 during an operation the bioload in the same theatre should not exceed 180 colony-forming units per cubic metre cfum3 where 1 cfu represents the progeny from one viable bacterium132 such guidelines are developed in an attempt to minimize the risks of surgical nosocomial transmissiondata from research performed on biological warfare agents suggest that both bacteria and viruses can produce disease with as few as 1100 organisms eg brucellosis 10100 q fever 110 tularaemia 1050 smallpox 10100 viral haemorrhagic fevers 110 organisms132
m tuberculosis may need only a single organism to cause disease and as many as 3000 organisms can be produced by a cough or talking for 5 min with sneezing producing many more111 for many common agents the infectious dose almost certainly varies between individual pathogens and their hosts eg immunocompromised hosts may not only be more susceptible to infection with a lower infectious dose but may also be a more infectious source as the pathogen is poorly controlled by the defective immune system this may allow higher pathogen loads to be disseminated into the surrounding environment in some cases possibly leading to super-spreading events such as described in some sars outbreaks1 2 3 4 5 knowledge of the infectious dose of airborne pathogens may allow an estimate of the number of air changes required in an indoor environment to reduce the concentration of such pathogens below the level that can cause diseasethe idea is to create a uniform low concentration of infected air in the room air that is subsequently extracted the air is supplied along the ceiling or directed upwards along the window or wall surface as shown in figure 6athis refers to fresh air sweeping in one direction across a room carrying the pollutants with it and exhausting the polluted air the flow is driven by large temperature differences in the room145 148 the vertical downward displacement ventilation system would be the ideal ventilation system for operating theatres but there is a need for further study in the effectiveness of removing large particles with the upward vertical displacement system shown in figure 6b however a recent study demonstrated that the exhaled air plumes from a patient lying on hisher side on a bed could be spread over long distances assisted by differences in air temperature and density on a ward using displacement ventilation149 this suggests that displacement ventilation should be used with caution in hospital wards where such a risk of aerosol transmission is presentin practice ventilation usually consists of a combination of mixing and displacement ventilation the fresh air stream mixes with convection currents such as the heat plumes that arise above people and equipment to remove infectious particles existing guidelines recommend that the air flow should follow a path from the ceiling supply vents to the healthcare workers then to the patients then finally to the exhaust vents that are generally located at a lower level near the floor147
ventilation and air flows also affect the thermal comfort of both healthcare workers and patients the air speed in the occupied zone of a room is designed to be below 02 ms for reasons of comfort150 due to differences in metabolic rate and clothing the cooling or heating requirements of healthcare workers and patients can be different thermal discomfort such as sweating may also discourage the proper use of ppe by hcws and thus limit its effectiveness141
to reduce the spread of airborne contamination between rooms it is common to fit ventilation systems with the capability to produce negative pressures so that the direction of flow around closed leaky windows and doors can be controlled for instance in a negative pressure room the supply flow rate to the room is less than the exhaust flow rate such negative pressure isolation rooms are generally separately air-conditioned and temperature controlled but there is likely to be a temperature difference between adjacent rooms current guidelines recommend a minimum negative pressure of 25 pa 001 inch water gauge in relation to corridors although other guidelines recommend a negative pressure of 510 pa147 151 152 153 154 in practice however the negative pressure will fluctuate with time depending on the control method and environmental factors these systems need to be regularly maintained because it is commonly found that some air-supply vents do not supply the air at their specified rate vents may be blocked and fail to deliver any air andor negative pressure rooms are being operated in a positive pressure modemost recently a study using computational fluid dynamical modelling confirmed that the air exchange rate and airflow patterns are important factors in the control of airborne virus diffusion155 also despite the recommendations for ceiling to floor level ventilation air flows this study suggested that this arrangement results in an up-draft effect and poor infection control efficiency147 155 there is an obvious need for further work to determine the optimal methods of ventilation control to reduce the risk of aerosol transmission in healthcare premises
droplets generated by talking laughing coughing and sneezing potentially lead to the generation of an infectious aerosolthe survival of such aerosolized pathogens depends upon environmental conditions such as temperature and rh both of which can vary with the season and the indoor building environmentsuch aerosols can be transmitted over short and long distances short-range transmission occurs over a distance of 1 m between individuals and is mediated mainly by the interaction of breathing zones of individuals long-range transmission occurs between distant locations and is primarily governed by air flows driven by pressure differences generated by ventilation systems open windows and doors movement of people or temperature differencesagents able to transmit infection over long distances can almost always transmit infection over short ranges and through direct contact in addition large droplets may become small droplets then droplet nuclei via the process of evaporation this may explain why some infectious agents normally only associated with short-range transmission may occasionally cause outbreaks over greater distanceswhether an individual acquires an infection depends on the final inhaled pathogen dose and the hosts immune responsethe airborne transmission of diseases may be restricted in three wayscontrol the source of infection by quarantine and the use of isolation facilitiescontrol airborne transmission routes by the use of negative pressure ventilation systems sliding doors instead of hinged doors and improving seals around doors and windows andprotect exposed susceptible individuals from both aerosol and contact transmission of infection by the use of ppe

data for this review were identified by searches of medline references from relevant articles and books and the authors own extensive archives search terms included aerosol transmission airborne transmission environmental survival aerosol suspension airborne suspension aerosol dispersal airborne dispersal aerosol dispersion airborne dispersion infectious dose nosocomial airborne infection nosocomial airborne transmission nosocomial aerosol infection and nosocomial aerosol transmissionthe ability to control viral load is one of the best prognostics of whether a patient will have mild or severe covid-19 symptoms 15 for the immune system to effectively suppress then eliminate sars-cov-2 it must perform four main tasks 1 recognize 2 alert 3 destroy and 4 clear each of these mechanisms are known to be dysfunctional and increasingly heterogeneous in older people 16 17 but which tasks are most relevant to covid-19 progression in older people is not yet clear 18during aging the immune system changes in two major ways one is a gradual decline in immune function called immunosenescence which hampers pathogen recognition alert signaling and clearance this is not to be confused with cellular senescence an aging-related phenomenon whereby old or dysfunctional cells arrest their cell cycle and can become epigenetically locked into a pro-inflammatory state in which they secrete cytokines and chemokines the other classic immune system change during aging is a chronic increase in systemic inflammation called inflammaging which arises from an overactive yet ineffective alert system 19an abundance of recent data describing the pathology and molecular changes in covid-19 patients points to both immunosenescence and inflammaging as major drivers of the high mortality rates in older patients within immunosenescence there are defects in both the innate and adaptive immune systems innate immunosenescence is characterized by ineffective pathogen recognition and macrophage activation and a reduction in natural killer nk cell cytotoxicity whereas adaptive immunosenescence is characterized by thymic atrophy and accumulation of anergic memory lymphocytes in both cases these age-related changes are thought to be due to pathogenic genetic and lifestyle factors that affect the cells epigenetic status and the diversity of immune cellsthe innate immune system is the bodys first line of defense against coronaviruses sentinel cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells recognize structurally conserved viral proteins via single-pass membrane-spanning receptors called toll-like receptors tlrs expressed on their cell surfaces defects in tlr function in innate immune cells are known to increase the severity of pneumonia in mice especially in the context of aging and chronic inflammaging 20 alveolar macrophages ams are mononuclear phagocytes that surveil the lungs for dust allergens and the remnants of pathogens when their tlrs detect an invader ams respond by producing type i interferons which attract immune cells to the site of infection and present antigens to lymphocytes 21 22 although ams increase in number during aging their plasticity to convert between pro- and anti-inflammatory states is greatly reduced 23 exemplified by a weak cytokine response after tlr activation 24 figure 1the inability of ams in older individuals to recognize viral particles and convert to a pro-inflammatory state likely accelerates covid-19 in its early stages whereas in its advanced stages ams are likely to be responsible for the excessive lung damage a recent study comparing immune cell composition of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from moderate and severe covid-19 patients showed in severe cases macrophages were phenotypically more proinflammatory expressing higher levels of ccr1 and cxcr2 that recruit other innate immune cells compared to macrophages from moderate covid-19 cases that expressed more t-cell attracting chemokines 25 prolonged monocyte activation is a well-known cause of severe lung injury in rhesus monkeys 26 and in cases of sars caused by sars-cov-1 higher numbers of pulmonary neutrophils and macrophages correlated with the development of ards and greater lung damage 27 a decline in neutrophil activity might also be partly responsible because during aging these cells progressively lose their ability to migrate to sites of infection and kill infected cells 28 29 nk cells a major component in innate immunity with potent cytotoxic activity are an unlikely cause of covid-19 severity their numbers are relatively stable during aging 30 and in a mouse model of sars they were not necessary for normal viral clearance 31 to discern which of these cell types play the most destructive roles more detailed analyses of covid-19 patient autopsy tissue will be neededadditionally the production and diversity of mucins protective glycoproteins found in mucosal barriers throughout the body also change in aging 32 33 although their role in immunity against coronaviruses in humans is understudiedimmunosenescence of the adaptive immune system is also a likely factor that determines whether a patient progresses to severe covid-19 figure 2 situated just above the heart the thymus  a primary lymphoid organ and the site of t cell development and maturation of early thymic progenitors from the bone marrow  is one of the first tissues to experience aging by age 65 the thymus is on average 40 its original size 34 coincident with activation of the inflammasome component nlrp3 and caspase-1 a pro-apoptotic protease 35 36 a build-up of intrathymic adipocytes further reduces thymic cellularity and deteriorates the thymic microenvironment thymic atrophy also contributes to a reduction of nave t cells and an accumulation of memory lymphocytes resulting in defective immunosurveillance and an exhaustion of b cells cytotoxic t cells and helper t cells 37 other common effects of aging on the adaptive immune system include a decline in the production of fresh nave t cells a less expansive t cell receptor tcr repertoire t cell metabolic dysfunction and weaker activation of t cells 38 39 clonal populations of cd8 t cells expand during aging limiting their diversity whereas cd4 t cells retain fairly diverse tcrs 40 and instead suffer activation deficits 39interestingly one study found that supercentenarians  defined as adults over 110 years old  tend to have an unusual population of cytotoxic cd4 t cells whose activation doesnt decline with age and can take on the effector functions usually performed by cd8 t cells 41 this t cell behavior may explain why some older people even some people over 100 are able to survive covid-19 measuring the repertoire and frequency of tcrs in patients from a spectrum of ages and disease severity should be performed to determine if a loss of t cell diversity is a reason why sars-cov-2 viral loads tend to spike in older people but not the youngnot only does the repertoire of t cells decline in aging so do their numbers those over 60 years old increasingly have low t cell numbers a condition known as lymphopenia 42 because t cells express very low levels of ace2 the lymphopenia in covid-19 patients is unlikely to be caused by direct sars-cov-2 infection 43 as in the case for hiv one proposed cause of the t cell paucity is an exhaustion of the immune system driven by repeated exposures to viruses over ones lifetime 42 44 45 this hypothesis is based on several studies that tracked the morbidity and mortality of people over 60 who had been chronically infected with human cytomegalovirus cmv 46 47 cycles of cmv reemergence were associated with vast immune system remodeling including a pronounced exhaustion of cd8 t cells that was more predictive of all-cause mortality than chronological age other studies indicate that t cell depletion is due to the cumulative exposure to many different pathogens and lifestyle factors not cmv alone 46 48 at the chromosomal level a major cause of immune exhaustion is telomere shortening in viral-specific memory cd8 t cells which induces cellular senescence a state of cell cycle arrest and hyper-inflammation that prevents expansion upon re-infection 49 the fact that in the most severe covid-19 cases bronchoalveolar cd8 t cells appear to have reduced expansion capability 25 and peripheral blood t cells express high levels of the immune-exhaustion marker pd-1 42 make this theory plausibleb cells  adaptive immune cells which produce antibodies in response to coronavirus antigens 21  are also less diverse and less responsive in aging 50 51 while total b cells numbers do not decrease in aging memory b cells accumulate and nave b cells are depleted which may lead to loss of diversity of the b cell repertoire although this has not yet been definitively demonstrated in humans 51 changes in igg glycosylation patterns however have been shown to strongly associate with age and inflammation and predict age-associated disease development 52 in particular igg n-glycans appear to be the most predictive of biological aging however b-cell intrinsic and extrinsic regulation of glycosylation in aging require further studydue to a lack of sun exposure and decreased production of vitamin d about half of all older people have a deficiency in this vitamin 53 which reduces the efficacy of both adaptive and innate immune responses and increases the risk of infection 54 vitamin d levels in older people are correlated with preserved features of immunity such as the cd4cd8 ratio and lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines after stimulus 54 55 although not all studies see a benefit of vitamin d supplementation on the risk or duration of lower respiratory infections 56 the majority have especially in those with an antibody deficiency or increased susceptibility to respiratory tract infections 57 58 a recent meta-analysis of 25 randomized placebo-controlled trials concluded that vitamin d supplementation prevented about 20 of acute respiratory infections 59 as such some health professionals have recommended vitamin d supplementation for older people in general and especially for aged-care residents and critically ill patients as a strategy for improving chances of covid-19 survivalduring the course of covid-19 older patients can reduce their viral titers only to rapidly descend into a state of shock involving hyperactivation of the immune system and hypercoagulation in small blood vessels 42 60 this rapid and uncontrolled inflammatory signaling cascade typically occurs in the later stages of infection known as a cytokine storm it exacerbates the dyspnea and hypoxemia and triggers inflammation in major tissues such as the lungs kidneys heart liver and brain cytokine storm syndrome is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a maladaptive host response to an infectious trigger 61 the resulting vascular inflammation is emerging as the cause of complement-associated microvascular injury and thrombosis in severe covid-19 cases 62 the initial trigger for cytokine storm is not yet known but it likely involves the immune systems detection of a large quantity of viral antigens released by dying cells why older people are particularly prone to cytokine storms is also unclearthe cytokine profiles of late-stage covid-19 patients are similar to patients with secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis a type of cytokine storm that can be triggered by systemic viral infection including increased levels of interleukin il-2 il-6 il-7 c-reactive protein crp granulocyte-colony stimulating factor gcsf interferon- inducible protein 10 ip-10 monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mcp-1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1- mip1- and tumor necrosis factor- tnf- 45 63 64even more predictive of death than serum cytokine profiles is an increase in the fibrin degradation product d-dimer released from blood clots in the microvasculature and a prognostic for dic 9 as such d-dimer is now widely regarded as a key indicator of the severity of late-stage covid-19 d-dimer levels naturally increase with age most likely reflecting a higher basal level of vascular inflammation 65 which could predispose patients to severe covid-19 it would therefore be informative to know if pre-cytokine storm levels of d-dimer levels could predict who is likely to develop a cytokine stormin cytokine storms high levels of il-6 cause vascular endothelial cells to secrete fibrin which causes dic in the lung this may underlie the hypoxemia seen in patients with seemingly functional lungs if left untreated clots leach additional clotting factors from the bloodstream increasing the risk of bleeding coagulopathy and multi-organ failure drugs such as tocilizumab actemra which block il-6 receptor activity are currently being used in patients in advanced stages 66one in two fatal cases of covid-19 experience a cytokine storm 82 of whom are over the age of 60 67 though there may be many simultaneous triggers of the storm abundant evidence indicates that inflammaging is a major driver exacerbated by obesity poor diets and oral health microbial dysbiosis and sedentary lifestyles 68 69 for example in rodents inflammaging increases the risk of cytokine storm syndrome 70 and in humans age correlates with higher basal circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-6 tnf- il-1 and crp 71 72a central player that could help explain the predisposition to cytokine storms is nlrp3 the major protein component of the inflammasome during aging there is a steady increase in the abundance and activity of nlrp3 in immune cells including ams of the lung which upon chronic stimulation contribute to pulmonary fibrosis 73 nlrp3 inflammasome activation requires two steps the first of which is the priming step induced by tlrs or tumor necrosis factor receptor activation this leads to the activation of nf-b and promotes the expression of nlrp3 pro-il-1 and pro-il-18 the second step also called the activation step is triggered by a range of stimuli that emerge during infections such as tissue damage nucleic acids and invading pathogen proteins 74in older individuals nlrp3 may be poised for hyperactivation by sars-cov-2 antigens nlrp3 activity is under the direct control of sirtuin 2 sirt2 a member of the nad-dependent sirtuin family of deacetylases sirt1-7 75 during aging nad levels decline reducing the activity of the sirtuins 76 old mice especially those deficient in sirt2 have decreased glucose tolerance and increased insulin resistance 77 this decline exacerbated by covid-19 might promote hyperactivation of nlrp3 and the trigger cytokine storms in covid-19 patients 14 maintaining nad levels may therefore alleviate covid-19 symptoms a possibility supported by recent data showing that sars-cov-2 proteins hyperactivate poly-adp-ribose polymerases parp9 -10 -12 and -14 and deplete cellular nad 78 additionally nad precursors lower inflammation in human subjects 79 80mechanisms of infection in other coronaviruses support the hypothesis that nlrp3 activation is a trigger of cytokine storms in the aged the sars-cov-1 orf3a protein for example is a potent activator of pro-il-1 gene transcription and protein maturation the two main signals required for activation of nlrp3 81 in macrophages sars-cov-1 orf8b robustly activates the nlrp3 inflammasome by interacting directly with the leucine rich repeat domain of nlrp3 in cytosolic dot-like structures 82 suggesting another two-step model in which inflammaging and the nlrp3 basal overactivation is the first step and sars-cov-2 antigen-mediated hyperactivation is the second step that triggers a cytokine stormin chronic diseases hyperactivity of the inflammasome plays a dominant role in the development of type 2 diabetes and other age-related diseases 83 indeed in older adults the upregulation of two inflammasome-related gene sets correlate with increased risk of hypertension metabolic dysfunction oxidative stress and mortality 84 individuals over the age of 85 that expressed lower levels of these inflammasome modules were less likely to die within seven years 84 taking together the known effects of coronavirus proteins on nad nlrp3 and the two stages of inflammasome activation these data provide a plausible explanation as to why co-morbidities positively correlate with cytokine storms and fatality in covid-19 patientsafter age and hematological cancers obesity is the next major risk factor for covid-19 fatality similar to type 2 diabetes 85 obesity is well known to increase the activity of nlrp3 and stimulate low grade inflammation in mice including higher levels of serum chemokines and lower neutralizing antibodies and effector memory t cells during a viral infection 86 accordingly this may help explain why obesity is associated with lower survival in covid-19 sars-cov-1 and mers-cov infections and why obesity-related human diseases such as cardiovascular disease chronic kidney disease and diabetes predispose patients to cytokine storms table 1 8789 in addition by causing the endothelium of the microvasculature to become leaky obesity and type 2 diabetes may increase the ability of sars-cov-2 to infect surrounding pericytes that appear to express ace2 at levels far greater than surrounding cells 12the dysregulation of the epigenome and resulting changes in gene expression during aging are strongly implicated as biomarkers and potentially underlying causes of chronic disease states and of aging itself the relocalization of chromatin modifiers theory of aging postulates that symptoms of aging and the loss of resilience are a result of a lifetime accumulation of epigenetic changes 90 91 these changes may be caused in part by the redistribution of chromatin factors such as the nuclear proteins sirt167 hdac1 and parp1 away from regular loci to sites of dsdna break repair then back again causing epigenetic noise to accumulate which may iteratively erase cellular identity 9094 this process is thought to manifest as dna methylation changes that set the pace of the biological clock in tissues and in hematopoietic cells 95 96there is an abundance of evidence indicating that age-related changes to the hosts epigenome compromise immune cell composition and function 97 and negatively impact viral defenses 98 99 including adaptive immune memory 100 101 coronaviruses are known to mediate epigenetic alterations potentially accelerating the rate that the immune system ages mers-cov for example antagonizes host antigen presentation by altering dna methylation a mark that silences genes encoding major histocompatibility complexes 102 similarly sars-cov-1 changes histone methylation and long non-coding rnas which is accompanied by the activation of interferon-response genes 103 measuring the dna methylation age of immune cells and other blood cell types before during and after infection could help elucidate both how the aged epigenome impacts disease severity and how the virus alters the aged epigenomethe vulnerability of the aged to sars-cov-2 may also have to do with the effects of the epigenome on viral entry which is initiated by physical interaction between the viral spike glycoprotein receptor and the ace2 cell surface protein 104 while genetic differences in ace2 are being pursued as a cause of covid-19 severity 105 there is little attention being paid to epigenetic differences in humans ace2 is ubiquitously expressed in epithelial tissues of the body most highly in alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine 106 ace2 is regulated in the body transcriptionally post-transcriptionally and post-translationally 107 although its role and regulation in covid-19 is still poorly understoodin both mice and rats ace2 expression decreases with age and is associated with an increase in aortic fibrosis and inflammation 108 109 in healthy human lungs ace2 expression does not appear to change with age 110 even though ace2 is more highly expressed in the lungs of cigarette smokers 111 a meta-analysis of covid-19 deaths however did not identify smoking as a significant risk factor 4 ace2 promoter hypomethylation in lymphocytes correlates with transcriptional activation in patients with lupus 112 implying that transcription of ace2 is controlled by methylation although this mechanism has not been systematically investigated it is known however that methylation at one of seven cpgs in the ace2 promoter decreases with age and these cpgs are bordered by long-range promoter-enhancer contacts that may change over time 113 bisulfite sequencing of the ace2 gene paired with transcriptomic and four-dimensional chromatin analyses will be necessary to understand if there is a causal relationship between promoter methylation ace2 expression and disease outcomethe elucidation of sars pathogenesis is complicated by the fact that ace2 is also part of the renin-angiotensin system ras that regulates immunity fibrosis blood pressure and metabolism ace2 counteracts vasoconstriction caused by angiotensin converting enzyme ace by cleaving its product angiotensin ii most likely due to its role in vasodilation and reducing inflammation ace2 partially protects against sepsis-induced- and sars-induced severe acute lung injury in mice 114 115 and asthma-induced airway inflammation in rats 116 changes in dna methylation during aging are known to affect the ras 14 117 118 analysis of ace2 gene expression in the lungs of covid-19 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease found a correlation between ace2 expression and covid-19 severity 111 thus age-related dysregulation of ace2 could explain why age is such a risk factor for covid-19 complications and why cardiovascular disease and hypertension predispose patients to develop a more aggressive form of covid-19the effects of ace inhibitors used commonly beyond middle age to control blood pressure are generally believed to be neutral in covid-19 119 120 due to their opposing roles in the ras ace2 expression appears to increase when ace is inhibited likely providing a yet unknown protective function 121 inhibiting ace2 expression or blocking ace2 accessibility could prevent viral entry but may lead to vasoconstriction and hypertension instead the most promising ace2-targeted therapeutic strategy is to infuse human recombinant soluble ace2 into the airway or bloodstream to bind the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein receptor preventing it from binding ace2 on host cell surfaces 122 and slowing cell infection ratesthe sirtuins are a family of nad-dependent lysine deacylases that control numerous aspects of stress resistance and pathogen defenses sirt1 is a nuclear histone deacetylase that suppresses viral replication and chronic inflammation 123 by binding to the promoter region of ace2 sirt1 upregulates transcription under conditions of cell stress 124 during aging and perhaps particularly during the course of covid-19 levels of nad decline this is likely due to increased nad consumption by the cd38 glycohydrolase 125 and increased transcription of the poly-adp-ribosyl transferases parp9 parp10 parp 12 and parp14 in mice and humans infected with sars-cov-2 78 coronaviruses also possess an adp-ribosylhydrolase that further depletes nad apparently to disrupt cell signaling dna repair gene regulation and apoptosis 14 126 127by negatively regulating activity of nlrp3 sirt1 and the related protein sirt2 seem to play key roles in suppressing acute lung inflammation during sepsis 75 mice lacking sirt1 for example display aggravated inflammasome activation with increased production of lung proinflammatory mediators including intercellular adhesion molecule 1 icam-1 and high-mobility group box 1 hmgb1 and a dramatic reduction of lung claudin-1 and vascular endothelial-cadherin expression 128 further as a result of nad depletion in mouse models of uncontrolled diabetes dna repair is blunted leading to pulmonary inflammation senescence and fibrosis 129 which could explain why diabetics are more susceptible to covid-19 sirt1 also attenuates the acute inflammatory response through deacetylation of h4k16 in the tnf- promoter 130 another nuclear sirtuin sirt6 attenuates nf-kb signaling by deacetylating h3k9 131 thus a decline in nad and the known mis-localization of sirt1 and sirt6 across the genome during aging 90 132 could be major contributors to the age-dependency of covid-19 symptoms as such nad precursors such as nmn and nr 133 have been suggested as possible treatments for covid-19 especially in older people 78 clinical studies are needed to determine if nad supplementation would benefit in the early stages of sars-cov-2 to reduce replication or if nad treatment during acute covid-19 can hasten recoveryover the past decade a variety of biological clocks have been developed to predict human health and longevity more accurately than chronological age including those based on dna methylation patterns 134136 inflammaging 137 gene expression patterns 138 frailty 139 140 serum proteins 141 and igg glycosylation 142144 given that these clocks provide a quantitative measure of the rate of aging of an individual and their overall resilience biological clocks may be useful for identifying at-risk populations and for predicting within those populations who will most likely progress to severe covid-19estimates based on twin studies place the contribution of non-genetic factors on predicted covid-19 phenotype at 50 145 and on total disease burden in old age at approximately 80 146 indeed lifestyle factors that affect the epigenome such as calorie intake may increase the susceptibility to covid-19 epigenetic age is greater than chronological age in various disease contexts and lower in long-lived humans providing strong evidence that epigenetic age reflects biological age 134 147 age-associated changes to the epigenome have profound effects on the immune system including t cell function cytokine production and macrophage pattern recognition dna methylation is believed to set the pace of the aging clock in several mammalian tissues including hematopoietic cells of the immune system 95 96 epigenetic clocks that measure dna methylation at specific cpg sites are the most widely used measure of biological age and disease susceptibility 134 147 restoration of the thymus using a drug cocktail of metformin growth hormone and dehydroepiandrosterone led to the reversal of features of immunosenescence specifically increasing nave t cells and a decreasing senescent pd-1 t cells along with the reversal of the epigenetic clock by about 15 years 96 epigenetic age may be a better biomarker than chronological age in predicting how variation in lifestyle factors and age-associated comorbidities increase susceptibility to covid-19 and may also help determine if covid-19 infection accelerates epigenetic age we hope to test both by measuring the dna methylation ages of peripheral blood samples from thousands of covid-19 patients and correlating methylation age measurements with clinical outcomeschanges in glycosylation during aging may also predispose older individuals to severe covid-19 148 glycosylation is the enzymatic process by which carbohydrates called glycans such as sialic acid mannose and fucose are covalently attached to proteins or lipids typically on the cell surface or in the bloodstream an individuals repertoire of glycans  a notable example being the type of n-glycans attached to immunoglobulins 149  changes with age and environmental factors such as smoking and poor diet 148 the type of glycans attached to iggs affects their pro- and anti-inflammatory properties 150 decreased galactosylation of iggs is associated with central adiposity 151 and inflammaging in the context of diabetes 152 biological clocks based on igg glycosylation are able to predict chronological age within 10 years and can be improved by inclusion of clinical parameters 144 thus changes to the glycome with age could serve both as an indicator of biological age and could potentially predict covid-19 severityaging also changes the glycome via non-enzymatic glycation by which reducing sugars circulating in extracellular compartments covalently bind to proteins and lipids to form advanced glycation end products ages ages are present in large quantities in the western diet and greater consumption of dietary ages increases serum tnf- 153 ages tend to accumulate under hyperglycemic conditions and contribute to the pathology of many age-related disease such as type 2 diabetes and obesity 154 ages may increase covid-19 severity in the aged by inhibiting the nlrp3 inflammasome during the early stages of viral infection 155 when the inflammatory program is activated by the sars-cov-1 3a protein 156 ages also play a role in activating pro-coagulation pathways 154 potentially contributing to the dic observed in covid-19 patientsglycosylation patterns specific to older people may also impact viral entry the sars-cov-2 spike protein is heavily glycosylated 157 modifications that are highly conserved between coronaviruses sars-cov-2 shares 20 out of 22 of glycosylated n-linkages with sars-cov-1 157 in the case of the human influenza virus variation in sialic acid structures on the surface of cells lining the upper and lower respiratory tracts dictates tropism and age-dependent binding efficiency of the virus 158 but how changes in the coronavirus spike protein during aging might affect viral transmission and pathogenesis is not yet known if we are to use glycation as a prognostic marker for covid-19 it will be necessary to map the glycome in hundreds of patient samples with varying degrees of covid-19 severity including asymptomatic individualsbetween individuals heterogeneity of the immune system increases during aging 18 and may explain differences in susceptibility to infectious diseases a biological clock based on the immune system called imm-age was recently developed that predicts all-cause mortality in older adults more accurately than even dna methylation clocks 137 imm-age overcomes the limitation of inter-human immune heterogeneity by tracking immune cell frequencies and gene expression changes longitudinally within individuals and then computationally predicting how an individuals homeostatic immune state changes over time though individuals exhibit variation in immune cell-type composition these changes fall into three stages that converge on a common attractor point that correlates with age and is indicative of overall physiological resilience 137 in this way imm-age measures the entropic relationship between age and immune system remodeling the rate of which can predict survival because imm-age is even able to capture and predict the effect of inflammaging on the cardiovascular system and because covid-19 fatality is so closely tied to cardiovascular disease and inflammaging this clock may prove to be the most accurate at identifying covid-19-susceptible individuals more studies are still needed to determine if and how viral infections alter these and other biological clocks and whether variation in biological age predicts covid-19 severityadvanced age is by far the greatest risk factor for covid-19 fatality independent of underlying co-morbidities 4 this striking fact has led many researchers to speculate whether molecules that target aging itself called geroprotectors could be used to combat infections in older people 5 159 primarily via its regulation of cellular metabolism the mammalian target of rapamycin mtor signaling pathway controls several immune functions such as antigen presentation immune activation differentiation and cytokine production 160 161 low dose mtor inhibitors exhibit a hormetic effect in older people seemingly improving immunity and reducing rates of infection 162 163 people over 65 years old who took mtor inhibitors for six weeks responded more robustly when challenged with an influenza vaccine and showed reduced levels of the t-cell exhaustion marker pd-1 162 in a similar clinical trial protection from infection and an increase in anti-viral gene expression was observed even a year after the 6-week course of mtor complex 1 mtorc1 inhibitors 163 though the result was not reproduced in a phase 3 trialmetformin a blood glucose lowering geroprotector that activates 5amp-activated protein kinase ampk and inhibits the mtor pathway has also been suggested as a possible drug to combat severe sars-cov-2 infection in older people in addition to its potential insulin-sensitizing antiviral effect 164 metformin confers a myriad of anti-aging benefits including improving mitochondrial metabolism decreasing inflammatory cytokines protecting against genomic instability and decreasing cellular senescence 165 which may bolster the aging bodys resistance to covid-19 results from the ongoing targeting aging with metformin tame clinical trials and others should reveal whether these anti-aging drugs are protective against sars-cov-2 infection 165 166why sars-cov-2 infections are more severe and fatal in the aged is not known but viable hypotheses are emerging that include changes to the immune cell repertoire the epigenome nad levels inflammasome activity biological clocks and covalent modifications of human and viral proteins figure 3 much remains to be elucidated still besides understanding the basis of the cytokine storms and coagulopathy it is not known why sars-cov-2 so easily damages such a broad array of tissues in older people but rarely in the young nor is it clear whether older people develop stronger or weaker functional immunity during seroconversion or how long their protection will last compared to younger people in the aged immune responses to vaccination are also often weak or defective 18 167 168 whereas autoimmunity increases 169 therefore in designing vaccines against sars-cov-2 it will be important to consider that older people may not respond as well to vaccines as young people studies that follow the long-term consequences of sars-cov-2 infection in older people will also be critical to understand the long-term health consequences of covid-19 pathology such as fibrosis and scaring of the lungs micro-ischemic events cardiopulmonary dysfunction and neuropsychological disability 170 these could significantly reduce viral resistance and lifespan in older and middle-aged people who recover from severe cases of covid-19 the most exciting and potentially impactful technologies to combat covid-19 and other viral pandemics are those that activate the bodys defenses against aging 5 166 eventually with advances in the field it may even be possible to reverse the age of cells and tissues 171174 so that high-risk older individuals can respond to viral infections as though they were youngcoronaviruses covs belong to the family coronaviridae which includes four genera    and  as well as several subgenera and species 1 sars cov-2 is a -coronavirus with a single-stranded rna genome of 30 kb 2 recent topicalresearch has revealed several new covs three -coronaviruses three new -coronaviruses and one previously described -coronavirus from bats captured from myanmar and future emergence of new diseases caused by these covs due to change of land use has been speculated 3 furthermore newer mutations of the virus that originally spread from wuhan were confirmed as deadlier in some countries compared to others which has led to added confusion and concern 4sars cov-2 was first identified from the outbreak of respiratory illness cases in wuhan city in the hubei province of china initial reports of the virus were made to the world health organisation who on december 31 2019 this was followed by the who declaring covid-19 as a global health emergency on january 30 2020 due to rapid spreading and a later pandemic declaration on march 11 2020 the disease has quickly engulfed most of the world and has caused severe infection to populations across numerous countries as shown in figure 1
covid-19 is shorthand for coronavirus disease 2019 which is caused by the sars cov-2 virus also called coronavirus in typical usage viruses cause disease by binding to receptors on cells in the human body and then replicating at a rapid rate which triggers a variety of pathogenic processes in the case of covid-19 the structures on the surface of the virus bind to receptors in the airway or the lungs of human beings the lungs may become inflamed making breathing more difficult for some people the infection becomes severe and leads to critical care requirementsthe anatomy of sars cov-2 including its internal biological structure of spike protein legs envelope protein and membrane protein surrounding the genomic rna is shown in figure 2
a the virus shown in figure 2a highlights a large diameter of about 01 m with variations in sizes reported by different researchers the spike-shaped protein legs that make up a portion of the outer capsule of the virus create the crown-like or corona-like appearance thus the name coronavirusloeffelholz et al 1 described the biological structure of the virus by statingcoronaviruses are enveloped viruses containing a single strand of positive-sense rna virions are mostly spherical with pronounced spiked glycoprotein s embedded in the envelope additional structural proteins include envelope e matrix m and nucleocapsid n intra- and inter-species transmission of covs and genetic recombination events contribute to the emergence of new cov strainsthe mechanism of infection due to the surface interactions between the spike protein and the lung cells is depicted in figure 2b this understanding was gathered from the genetic analysis which revealed that the mutations located in the spike surface glycoprotein might induce conformal changes and play an essential role in binding to receptors on the host cell lungs and determine host tropisms by leading to possible changing antigenicity 7viruses are fundamentally different to bacteria so the classically developed work on nano-structuring and biomimicking surfaces such as the cicada wing primarily targeting bacterial killing should not be confused as a readily available knowledge to kill sars cov-2 physically a bacterium is larger than a virus the biggest size of a virus is smaller than the smallest known bacteria bacteria are living cells which arecapable of prolific reproduction independently whereas viruses are non-living particles requiring a host cell for replication also bacteria possess a cell-wall engulfing a chromosome whereas viruses consist of genetic material either dna or rna covered by a protein coating bacterial infections can therefore be treated with high success using antibiotic drugs although some antiviral medicines are now available the susceptibility of viruses to react to the treatment rate of medicines is significantly reduced as they are non-living hence the only long-term option to eradicate viruses is the development of vaccines that stimulate the natural production of antibodiesstudies suggest that the source of sars cov-2 could either be ratg13 from horseshoe bats rhinolophus affinis pangolins manis javanica or a mix of both their transmission has occurred by zoonotic mechanisms 6 7 however the coronavirus isolated from pangolins is 99 similar in a specific region of the spike protein which corresponds to the 74 amino acids involved in the angiotensin- converting enzyme 2 ace 2 receptor binding domain which allows the virus to enter human cells to infect them as shown in figure 2b the virus ratg13 isolated from rhinolophus affinis bats is highly divergent in this specific region only 77  similarity this observation indicates that the coronavirus isolated from pangolins can enter human cells whereas coronavirus isolated from rhinolophus affinis bats is unable to enter human cellsthe sars cov-2 has a high transmissible efficiency and covid-19 has high morbidity and mortality a popular but possibly flawed measure for assessing fatality of disease is the use of deathscase counts this measure would yield a fatality rate of 66 for covid-19 as of 17th may 2020 8 the problem with this measure is that case counts reflect the number of tests that were done rather than infections and the deaths lag the cases because fatality if observed may happen several days after the case is identified a lag in reporting case numbers and incorrect tests may also occur an alternative measure is the case fatality rate cfr which is the ratio of deathsdeaths  recovered cases this measure would yield a fatality rate of 146 9the consensus is that the covid-19 disease has high fatality and can exceed the fatality ratio of the century-old spanish flu which had a 10 cfr 11 however the data analysis of callaway et al 10 shown in figure 3
suggests that covid-19s cfr is lower than that of mers and ebola and that its infection rate r0 - the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection suggests that the infection can spread more easily than other diseases including seasonal influenzaa further comparison of three different episodes of epidemics and pandemics caused by the family of coronavirus namely sars cov-1 mers and sars cov-2 is depicted in table 1
as an agile response to the pandemic a few drugs are gaining popularity recently the indian government task force for the repurposing of drugs tford has proposed that favipiravir and tocilizumab are the most promising drugs to treat covid-19 a rigorous survey of about 70 drugs showed that the originally thought game changing hcq scored only 54 at the readiness level in comparison to favipiravir 73 and tocilizumab 73 drugs a ready list of this comparison is shown in table 2
12the exact mechanism of these drugs towards the virus is yet to be completely understood however the mechanism where a drug affects the replication of viruses in-vivo is a broadly accepted concept in general viruses replicate via protein processing using endosomes within golgi bodies a drug such as hcq increases the ph of the golgi bodies making them more basic thus disrupting the integrity of the internal nucleocapsid protein see figure 2a this denatures the protein of the coronavirus rendering it dysfunctional therefore the rationale for using hcq is built on the premise that the change in ph brought about by the drug inhibits the endosomal transport necessary to spread the infection hence the patient recoversanother short-term treatment being implemented by some hospitals across the world is to infuse patients with the antibody-rich blood plasma of people who have recovered from covid-19 13 this approach has been used during disease outbreaks for over a century however the approach carries significant risk in terms of the already immunocompromised patients immune response after administration and results may vary between patientsas an early effort of investigation of the problem from scratch researchers at toho university in japan used high-sensitivity cameras and laser beam guidance experiments to deduce that saliva spray during a sneeze potentially containing thousands of viruses can be classified into large vs small droplets or droplets vs aerosols the droplets due to their heavier weight fall off whereas aerosols remain airborne for a few hours due to their relatively small size prima facie evidence suggests that the coronavirus has escalated to a pandemic due to the high contagion occurring via this airborne spread model recently the possibility of asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic infection has also been highlighted 14the aerosols may circulate near an infected patient in an airborne condition depending on the local conditions airflow rate humidity dryness for up to a few hours even after the infected person has left the location hence the chances of contracting coronavirus are relatively high by merely occupying the same vicinity where an infected person has been or passed through researchers have experimentally evaluated the stability of sars cov-2 recently and these comparisons are shown in figure 4
15 16it is noteworthy that sars cov-2 was stable in the aerosol airborne form for up to 3 hours as opposed to this the virus appears to be stable on surgical masks or stainless-steel surfaces for up to 7 days and for up to 4 days on smooth surfaces such as glass or currency notes the same research also shows that the application of hand soap does not immediately deactivate the virus but rather takes up to 5 minutes therefore a 5-minute waiting period after a handwash is required before bringing hands in contact with face mouth or nosecovid-19 is not only present in the airway secretions of infected patients when they sneeze but also when they simply breathe out or speak studies have shown that covid-19 is also present in other body fluids of infected people such as faeces blood 17 oral fluids anal secretions 18 tears 19 and urine 20 the virus primarily attacks the respiratory system however new evidence shows the virus is not filtered by the kidneys as traces of virus can be seen in sewage systems 8therefore as a mitigation strategy testing of these fluids which can be available and abundant in the wider population can be done for identifying the most effective areasoverall when people are in close contact with one another then transmission is more likely most sources for infection worldwide have happened in an enclosed space including homes offices public transport and restaurants a second spreading pathway for the virus is through touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching ones own mouth nose or eyes if one is in a well-ventilated space with fewer people even for a longer period the risk of infection is low sustained contact with an infected person even for a short period even without a cough or sneeze can spread the infectionby the virtue of disturbing the cell programming covid-19 possesses the capability to cause a surprise attack on almost any part of the body ranging from lungs heart blood vessels brain eyes nose liver kidneys and intestine a schematic representation of this adverse impact is shown in figure 5
a 21 recent literature suggests that apart from the airway the human brain may also be targeted by the virus - see figure 5b and figure 6
22 patients have reported having mild anosmia and ageusia to severe encephalopathy neurological manifestations and if true it makes sars cov-2 more lethalour nasal lining tissue contains a rich number of cell receptors called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 which are favourable sites for the sars cov-2 to attach its spiked protein to thus paving way for the entrance of the virus inside the body once attached to the cell sars cov-2 can change cell programming replicate itself and attack new cells at a very rapid pace within a week of entrance into the body the virus exhibits effects during this time the person may show early symptoms such as fever dry cough sore throat loss of smell and taste or head and body aches at this point the failure of the immunity in defeating the virus means giving the virus a way forward to enter into the respiratory system where the lungs are attacked the lungs also have a cell lining rich in ace2 22as the immune system continues to fight the sars cov-2 the supply of healthy oxygen is disrupted as the disease progresses inside the body the white blood cells release inflammatory molecules or chemokines which attack and kill the virus-infected immune cells leaving the dead cells and pus behind this affects healthy oxygen transfer in the lungs and is the stage where the patient starts to complain of pneumonia coughing fever and rapid shallow respiration acute respiratory distress syndrome may develop at this stage the lungs start to be filled with opaque black spots signifying closure of the air pores and such patients require ventilator support the survivors of this severity of infection can end up having long-term complications a few hospitals have successfully applied artificial intelligence to monitor the recovery rate by monitoring the coronascore  a general term used to quantify the extent of the blocked pores in cm3 25long-term research measures advanced manufacturing and metrology have pivotal roles to play in containing a pandemic specifically the development of engineering innovations is timely for the control of the covid-19 pandemic for diagnostic testing to be useful for informing doctors and governments about the true incidence at any one time of coronavirus in the population it needs to be inexpensive high in sensitivity and specificity sensitivity refers to the ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease or true positive rate whereas specificity refers to the ability of a test to correctly identify those without the disease or true negative rate and easy to use for non-experts as doctors are treating infected patients in this emergent time in an unprepared state emergent manufacturing measures can help design better testing equipment and thus help in both short and long term to tackle this problemthe most significant challenge now lies in probing early-stage symptoms of covid-19 for a relatively late stage detection in severe cases chest computer tomography ct using x-ray probes providing 90 sensitivity has proved to be a more reliable test assay in comparison to the reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction rt-pcr test and other sensor-based detection methods currently being pursued 27 since the nervous system and respiratory dysregulation are both likely to co-exist covid-19 testing should be done by combining brain mri and rt- pcr tests as shown in figure 7
a 28 however caution is required in the analysis of results such that covid-19 should not be confused with drug-resistant tuberculosis tb as both would show symptoms of damages in the lungs in an attempt to boost the testing in a populous country such as india the indian council of medical research icmr has approved the use of diagnostic machines used for testing drug-resistant tuberculosis under the guidance that the throatnasal swabs are collected in the viral transport medium 29 interestingly the pcr test cannot identify asymptomatic infections or those people who were exposed to or infected with covid-19 in the past and did not suffer from the disease or have recovered from covid-19 and may still be spreading the virus carriers therefore different tests may be required to collate vital information required by government bodies to carry out a risk-benefit analysis to relax lockdown measures to protect their economiesimmunodiagnostic kits such as a lab-on-a-chip are being developed for asymptomatic detection of covid-19 30 a lab-on-chip figure 7b works on the principle of detecting the presence of patient-generated antibodies against the virus that causes a specific disease in this case covid-19 the test uses a lateral flow immunoassay to assess the presence of an analyte from a patient sample or specimen and detects two types of antibody isotypes igm and igg igm antibodies are the first antibodies to appear in response to a novel antigen and imply a more recently initiated infection while igg antibodies are generated later in the course of infection and possess a higher affinity for the target antigen meaning they are more specifically able to bind the substance which caused the immune response a test is declared positive if either one or both antibodies are detected during the test similar to widely used pregnancy teststhe test consists of an anti-human igg coating in the g test line region and an igm coating the m test line region see figure 7b during testing the sample blood urine etc reacts with sars-cov-2 antigen-coated gold nanoparticles aunp in the conjugation pad of the test cassette any antibody in the patient sample that recognises the sars-cov-2 antigen binds to the antigen-aunp complex the mixture then migrates laterally across the membrane by capillary actionlateral flow as these human antibodyantigenaunp complexes move across the test lines they are captured at the anti-human igm m line the anti-human igg g line or both depending on the antibody contents of the specimen the sample first reaches the anti-human igm antibodies which coat the m line if the specimen contains igm antibodies to sars-cov-2 a coloured line will appear in the m test line region next the sample reaches the anti-human igg antibodies which coat the g line if a specimen contains igg antibodies to sars-cov-2 the conjugate-specimen complex reacts with anti-human igg a coloured line appears in the g test line region as a result the rabbit igg-aunp complexes are captured by the control line which contains anti-rabbit-igg this visible line indicates that there has been successful lateral flow across the detection strip the last check ensures that the sample had enough volume to move across the entirety of the test cassette only human antibodysars-cov-2 antigenaunp complexes will produce a visible red or pink line at the m or g line other antibodies produce no colourthe accuracy of these lab-on-chip tests is still being debated as it depends on two key parameters sensitivity and specificity to date igg related sensitivity and specificity has been found to be higher than that of igma schematic diagram in figure 7c and figure 7d shows that unlike currently available diagnostic methods field-effect transistor fet-based biosensing devices may have several advantages including the ability to make highly sensitive and instantaneous measurements using small amounts of analytes 31 the fet sensor shown in figure 7d makes use of a graphene sheet since graphene-based fet biosensors can detect surrounding changes on their surface and provide an optimal sensing environment for ultrasensitive and low-noise detection from this standpoint graphene-based fet technology is attractive for applications related to the sensitive immunological diagnosisa group of researchers at mit and harvard are developing coronavirus-identifying sensor embedded face masks this ongoing work is an extension to their previous work where they developed a low-cost method to detect a zika virus 33 in this technique the sensor is made by using genetic material such as the rna or the dna which binds to the viruses the researchers used a lyophilizer to freeze-dry the genetic material onto the fabric of the mask the material deposited onto the fabric remains stable for many months at room temperature and the detection process starts merely by the presence of moisture such as saliva the detection signal is small in terms of voltage and can be detected by an additional fluorimeter device that can quantify this signal and emit in form of a fluorescentlight thus one can expect to see light glowing masks to detect coronavirus in the futurefumigation chambers allow quick disinfection of a person while visiting areas such as hospitals universities or airports the aim is to use tubes releasing hydrogen peroxide in a chamber designed to be five-feet wide and seven-feet tall the fumigation chamber usually seals automatically after the persons entry to avoid any leakage outside of the chamber and has designated sensors facilitating the chamber entry the disinfection lasts for five seconds it is to be noted here that hydrogen peroxide has also been recommended by the food and drug administration fda to be used as a sterilisation material to decontaminate n95 or n95-equivalent respirators for reuse by health care workers in hospital settings 34a populist view is that sunlight and high temperature during peak summers kills the coronavirus which would help containment of its spread it is reported that sars cov-2 does not survive beyond 5 min after being exposed to 70c 16 however it has yet to be ascertained as to how long does sunlight take to deactivate sars cov-2 and at what intensity a more specific question is whether ultra-violet uv light can kill coronavirus sunlight usually contains three types of uv uva 320 400 nm uvb 280320 nm and uvc 200280 nm uva and uvb can both cause sunburn however uvc is shorter and a more energetic wavelength oflight while uvc is effective at destroying genetic material whether in humans or viral particles it is filtered by the ozone layer and does not reach the earths surface preliminary findings from the national biodefense analysis and countermeasures centre of the usa which houses a bsl-4 level lab indicate that sunlight seems to be very detrimental to the virus within minutes the majority of the virus is inactivated on surfaces and in the air in direct sunlight 35research on the use of uv as a treatment is still evolving and the behaviour of sars cov-2 under uv light is unknown results were relatively favourable for sars cov-1 treatment with uvc 36 37 sars cov-1 was efficiently inactivated after 40 minutes of uvc exposure at about a wavelength of 254 nm whereas addition of psoralen a light-sensitive drug to uva enhances inactivation of thesars cov-1 popular press reports suggest that uv light booths are capable of deactivating coronavirus without any human contact and are proposed to be deployed figure 8
 one must be cautious since uvc can be dangerous to the skin causing burns within seconds and harmful to the eyes if observed directly therefore risk assessment and associated precautions would need to be deployed that may render this strategy difficult in the short-termchouirfa et al 39 summarised nanomaterials based coatings for antibacterial applications and xing et al 40 have summarised the potential of natural polymer chitosan as an antimicrobial agent figure 9
 their research on antimicrobial properties of a nanocomposite coatingformed by polysaccharide 1-deoxylactit-1-yl chitosan chitlac and silver nanoparticlesnag on methacrylate thermosetsshowed satisfactory resultsantimicrobial surfaces are based on three main mechanisms see figure 10
 the anti-biofouling mechanism which repels microbes and prevents them from adhering to the surface the release-killing mechanism where microbes are killed in the near-surface environment with a release of antimicrobial agents and the contact-killing mechanism where microbes adhere and are killed on the surface 41 42researchers have also experimented with developing long-lasting antimicrobial surfaces to stop spreading pathogenic microbes through commonly touched surfaces or at-risk surfaces and have focused on the use of antimicrobialantiviral materials such as copper experimental trials for copper oxide impregnated respiratory protective facemasks have yielded 100 efficiency in eradicating the infectivity of human and avian influenza a virus in simulated breathing conditions 43 warnes et al 44 have shown that the surfaces of dry copper alloys are lethal to viruses such as mnv-1 at room temperature with higher copper content being more time-efficient generally the antimicrobial activity of copper is attributed to oxidative behaviour of copper and the solubility properties of copper oxides 45more recently surface texturing of copper via cold spray methods has shown enhanced promise as an antiviral agent 46 combining the aforementioned antimicrobial contact-killing properties of copper the anti-adhesion properties of polymeric micelles and the release-kill abilities of chlorine dioxide clo2 li et al47 developed a multifunctional coating viricidal for influenza virus h1n1 this multifunctional coating is composed of clo2 encapsulated in polymeric micelles with slow on-demand release on which copper nanoparticles were covalently tetheredother studies have investigated hydrophobic polycationic coatings as antimicrobial coatings 48 49 50 hsu et al 51 investigated the mechanism by which the nn- dodecylmethyl-polyethelenimine pei coated surfaces killed the influenza a virus it was concluded that upon contact with the coated surface the virus adheres irreversibly and through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions the virus disintegration is then initiated resulting in rna leakage into the solutionthe incorporation of pei into protective mask textiles has also been investigated with nearly a 1000-fold improvement in the capture of the t4d bacteriophage virus of escherichia coli b 52 finally the direct mechanical action of sharp nanostructuressuch as darts blades and spikes as a kind mechano-cide has been shown to have some success for bacteria but remains largely unexplored for viruses 53 from a contact mechanics perspective the combined effect of sharp 10s of nm surface features combined with ubiquitous surface forces suggests the generation of potentially large disruptive stresses on relatively soft viral materials a few manufacturing research laboratories including the indian institute of technology delhi iit in india and cranfield university uk have taken the lessons from the past and developed manufacturing innovations to fight this pandemic 54 55somewhat surprisingly while researchers have investigated bactericidal properties of nanoparticles of silver yet the current understanding of the interaction of these nanoparticles with viruses is limited however some positive results are reported and based on these reports this direction of manufacturing research holds a good promise to tackle sars cov-2 previous studies showed that the size of nanoparticle is critical to manifest a viricidal effect for example a nanoparticle size of less than 25 nm was found to be effective against tacaribe virus 56 while a particle size of between 7 to 20 nm worked well against herpes simplex virus hsv type 12 and human parainfluenza virus type-3 57 nakamura et al 58 reported that materials with immobilised silver nanoparticles possess enhanced microbicidal activities against the virus these researchers developed a material using silver nanoparticle absorbed on a chitin sheet having a nanoscale fibre-like surface structure shown in figure 11
and obtained favourable results against h1n1influenza a virusmoreover the unique characteristics of metallic nanoparticles such as high surface to volume ratio surface-enhanced raman scattering and localized surface plasmon resonance can be utilised for virus detection and therapy via destruction through laser-induced localised hypothermia as well some of the candidate nanoparticles are metallic and high entropy alloy nanoparticles agauptpdcu high entropy nanoparticles feo nps ag nps tio2 nps au nps ag-au core-shell nps

for this purpose uv-visible spectroscopy can be deployed to study the surface plasmon resonance refractive index and fluorescence change when nanoparticles interact with virus particlesnanoparticle-based investigation can help detect and inactivate viruses figure 12
 specific to coronavirus graphene oxide sheets with silver nanoparticles go-ag nps were reported to inhibit the growth of feline coronavirus fcov by up to 25 in comparison to pure go that inhibited it only up to 16 60 additionally chiral biosensor with self-assembled chiral gold nanohybrids cau nps on account of multiple plasmonic scattering showed better detection performance on coronavirus 61as with all fundamental and translation nanomaterial research progress is not immediate caution is required with nanomaterial technologies as the long-term impact on human health and the environment of free nanoparticles has not been ascertained and this may ultimately pose greater risk particularly in the liver and respiratory tract of human beings and in ecosystems lack of governmental regulation strategies for nanomaterials can also hinder the speed of approval and ultimately the availability in the marketplace nevertheless a call has gone out to nanomedicine researchers to utilise their existing knowledge base and translate their technologies towards covid-19 should the outbreak last more than 12 months 62filtration efficiency is a strong measure of penetration prevention of aerosols through mask filters and is usually required to be above 98 for surgical face masks 63ultrasonic welding is usually deployed to produce filters with sufficient filtration efficiency both polymer and textile-based masks are popular and can benefit from the adoption of sequential micromachining techniques 64 a surgical mask procedure mask is worn by health professionals during surgery to avoid exposure to aerosols such masks are not designed to protect the wearer from inhaling airborne bacteria or virus particles and are less effective than respirators such as n95 or niosh masks which provide better protection due to their material shape and tight sealthe who laboratory biosafety manual necessitates biosafety level 2 bsl-2 requirements for non-propagative diagnostic laboratories and bsl-3 for laboratories handling high concentrations of live sars-cov-2 according to the manual and the who biosafety guidance for sars-cov-2 the exhaust air from such laboratories should be discharged through high-efficiency particulate air hepa filters it is worth mentioning that particle collection efficiency of such mechanical filtering methods decreases to about 50 at particle sizes of 05 m due to diffusion and diffusion-interception regimes of particles with sizes in the range from 005 up to 1 m 21therefore hepa filters are not ideal in screening the viruses like sars cov-2 which has a typical diameter from 60 nm to 160 nm 22mass production of appropriate filters to screen the virus entry is a micromanufacturing challenge this could potentially involve technologies such as direct laser micromachining or punch-based microstamping methods for this purpose a plasma spraying or laser micromachining method may be used to obtain a well-suited punch which can be used to stamp pierce polymer sheets eg pet to achieve appropriate filter sizes another candidate process of subtractive manufacturing is metal anisotropic reactive ion etching with oxidation mario 65an illustration of how the proposed micromachining strategies can be deployed for scalable fabrication of filters to screen virus scale particles is shown in figure 13
 while self-assembly techniques such as block copolymers have shown promise filtering small viral particles such as human rhinovirus 66 direct printing methods allow greater engineering control over pore size and spacing critical to tuning membrane efficiency fluid resistance and mechanical strengthprotection of surrounding or nearby people is important and an infected patient can help to control the spread by wearing a mask leading to the concept of social distancing suggested by various governments the safe distance guideline is an important concept especially in populous countries where an assembly of people on the streets can cause the spread to grow exponentially keeping this in mind the who urged people to maintain a safe social physical distance of about 3 ft 1 m while the centre of disease control and prevention recommends this to be 6 ft 2 m these limits are now challenged by recent research that suggests this safe distance should be 23 to 27 ft 7 to 8 m 69 the same study also suggested that the currently available commercial masks need to be redesigned it was suggested that the masks available at present are not suitable for containment of sprayed aerosols during a sneeze travelling at the velocity of 108 kmph 70 as this increases the possibility of escape of viruses through contaminated droplets from edges of the mask making nearby people more vulnerable to contracting the coronavirus also chin et al 16 tested the strength of the virus and suggested that the virus is highly stable at 4c as well as in the ph range of 3 to 10 the virus was found to be detectable on a mask surface even after 7 days these findings suggest a product design strategy to develop more appropriate masks for handling exhalations travelling at high speeds by considering human ergonomics material aspects antimicrobial nature and structural aspect while the design and strategies for developing these new types of masks are underway a possible technique for deploying the extant fabrication methods would be to merge the two approaches namely additive and subtractive manufacturing methods described above this development would mean that even in the current landscape a new mask-making strategy would provide more protection than the currently available masksastm f2100-07 is the relevant international standard that details specifications of materials to be used in medical face masks however the current standards do not capture the techniques required to make the mask reusable especially as the current materials are yet to be tested against sars cov-2 as of now curad antiviral isolation masks making use of a cocktail coating citric acid zinc and copper are available as an option to disinfecting the outer surface of the mask these are useful for medical professionals as they can come in contact with the virus infected aerosols more frequentlyanother concept is that of a germ trap surface 71 which is akin to fooling a virus the team at the university of manchester uk identified specific glycoproteins that have carbohydrates attached to their surface similar to those seen on the surface of the cell of the nasal passages this study suggests that a glycoprotein biocoating on a snood surface 72 denatures a virus by causing the same interfacial chemical reaction between the spike proteins and carbohydrate cell surface as the one when the coronavirus attaches to the ace2 receptors but due to unavailability of any physical cells to invade on the snood surface the virus decomposes and becomes deactivated immediately after landing on the textile surface see figure 14
 the efficiency of germ trap coating in achieving its goal is indicated to be 96based upon the existing literature an immediate measure to functionalise the personal protective equipments ppes could be to introduce the use of antimicrobial coatings comprising of proven materials eg zinc and sodium 73 74 based compounds on the surface of ppes especially the shields and visors such coatings can be deposited by additive methods such as spraying in 3d or via roll to roll r2r manufacturingin terms of processing techniques one limitation of thermal spraying is that it requires heat resistant feedstock materials limiting the use of most of the chemical species traditionally used to functionalise surfaces such as polyethylene glycol peg 75 in view of this limitation a possible research avenue is to develop functional coatings with viricidal properties such that the coating ingredients do not degrade at high temperatures thus providing a controlled release over time with this goal in mind a suitable processing and material matrix availability is crucial to obtain a coating to possess desirable advantages in the medical fieldon the other hand the use of thermal sprayed hydroxyapatite ha coatings on orthopaedic implants has been widely adopted in the medical field since the late 1980s 76 as reported in the early 2000s 77 the use of thermal sprayed ha coatings on metal implants presents several advantages and a positive potential for its use in the medical field 78 taking into consideration the status of ha as the standard in thermal sprayed coatings and the decades of research on its behaviour and response to living tissue 79 the choice of ha as a base material for the development of anti-microbial functional coatings has been most popular to dateat a personal level deploying smart ppe incorporating viral detection capability into masks gloves or wearing viral dosimeter badges might help monitor the strength ofdirect transmission vectors as well as environmental exposure rates and accumulation conversely masks could collect exhaled viral particles for early detection of infection 70 detection could be implemented as microfluidic channels functionalized with bioelectronic miniaturized detection schemes 80 81 with specific virus sensitivity 82 83 local area smart sensing filter textiles incorporated into mobile or in-place ventilation systems designed to both filter and detect could also help provide early alert alarms and protection in buildings and other areas of restricted air replacementthe importance of wearing a mask by the infected person and by a healthy person coming in the vicinity of the infected person is ranked on the priority order shown by the cartoon model in figure 15
safe disposal of materials used in the treatment of infected patients such as gloves masks test samples clothes or the human waste especially in icu patients who may be closer to death is a challenging task in addition to the possibility of an infection this waste could lead to other secondary issues including emergence of a new category of virusbacteria hence safe disposal of biomedical waste is very important additionally gaining support from members of the public to adequately dispose of their used personal masks etc is essential recently an absorbent gel with embedded disinfecting material has been developed at sree chitra tirunal institute for medical sciences and technology india for liquid respiratory and other body fluid solidification and disinfection for the safe management of infected respiratory secretions this material helps to solidify the liquid respiratory secretions from icu patients or those with copious secretions treated in the wards the material so collected becomes fit for disposal through the usual incineration system for biomedical wastes newer guidelines are required to refine the existing risk assessments procedures 84big data analytics and extant research utilizes accelerated development of techniques for data mining machine learning and use of artificial intelligence ai that shows promise in the treatment of sars cov-2 as a direct benefit to this approach a digitalised shadow of the data to study plausible scenarios of certainty of an event becomes easier as for sars cov-2 genome data now exist offering scope for soft-computing application researchers as well as those involved in ai based research to offer new insights into the area as an example the global initiative on sharing all influenza data gisaid database httpswwwgisaidorg made available in march 2020 contains a compilation of over 24000 sars-cov-2 complete and partial genomes from all over the globe since december 2019 85recently researchers from cambridge used phylogenetic network on 160 complete genomes of sars cov-2 85 to predict probable mutation and migration paths of the coronavirusatomistic modelling and molecular docking 86 can hold the key to a scientific breakthrough to address questions surrounding sars cov-2 the development of vaccines antibodies and diagnostics is dependent in a large measure on our understanding of the interfacial science between the spike s glycoprotein of sars cov-2 and ace2 receptor in human lung cell as shown earlier in figure 2 wrapp et al 87 obtained a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the sars cov-2 s trimer in the metastable prefusion conformation showing it undergoes a transient hide and active states structural rearrangement their results relying on surface plasmonic resonance elucidated a stronger affinity of sars cov-2 with ace2 compared to sars cov-1 and shed light on two states namely a down state or receptor-inaccessible and an up state or receptor-accessible state shown in figure 16
ain yet another interesting study 89 computer-aided drug screening was used to run a test assay over 10000 compounds as inhibitors to a key cov enzyme mproebselen was found to exhibit antiviral activity and illustrate a way forward use of this potentially promising modelling strategy to discover targeted drug and vaccinedevelopment a molecular docking example shown in figure 16b is yet another effective example of accelerating the drug discovery 88recently liu et al 90 carried out an aerodynamic analysis by measurement of the rna of sars cov-2 they used pre-sterilized gelatin filters pore size of 3 m to collect the aerosols from different areas of two wuhan hospitals this study classified the sampling location in three areas1patient areas these are the areas where covid-19 patients are physically present such as intensive care units coronary care units ward rooms a toilet and staff workstations2medical staff areas these are the areas that are exclusively accessed by the medical staffs who are in direct contact with the covid-19 patients3public areas these are the venues open to the general public such as reception and waiting lounge areas
surprisingly the researchers detected maximum stains of sars cov-2 in patients toilet areas while the levels were low in the isolation wards and ventilated patient rooms also the medical staff areas showed peaks of high concentrations with aerosol size ranging from 001 micrometres to 25 micrometres and they were neutralised after rigorous sanitisation proceduresthe study suggests that there is a likelihood of resuspension of virus-laden aerosols from the surface of medical staffs protective equipment including surgical masks during their removal while having lunch visiting toilets or breaks etc the source ofthese virus suspensions was speculated to be from the direct deposition of patients respiratory droplets or airborne sars-cov-2 onto the protective apparel the researchers also found that the sars-cov-2 in aerosol forms had relatively longer residence time implying the infection remains for a relatively longer time causing further transmissions this study serves as a practice guide on the requirements and specification after the lockdown procedures are eased to avoid recurrent infectionthe exit-strategy after the lockdown must consider carefully the ventilation of officesclassrooms maximum use of open space preferable sunlight regular sanitisation of clothes hairs and hands and proper use and disinfection of toilet areasthe data obtained by toho university figure 17
 suggests that laser technology can be employed efficiently to monitor the streamlines and microdroplets movements from a sneeze this monitoring could be a highly effective lab-scale activity to not just guide the futuristic cfd models but also to efficiently design new masks effective for preventing diseases caused by high velocity spray caused by a sneezewhile engineering and manufacturing will undoubtedly play their part over the coming years the interventions proposed herein can help avoid the recurrent spread and emergence of new infectionsthe patients who have survived while battling against covid-19 showed that they have developed antibodies to the virus antibodies are virus-specific proteins which have a memory of the exposure to the virus and will recognize the virus on a second exposure antibodies help prevent future infections by detecting the virus and binding to their surfaces signalling the bodys immune system to destroy such viruses or virus-infected cells while reasons are not clear common wisdom is that the human body does not have an adequate immune response to hiv for covid- 19 an adequate immune response does exist therefore a vaccine is more likely to be created successfully for sars cov-2 additionally the observation that a large majority of people recover either without any symptoms or with minimal symptoms such as fever and body ache also bodes well for the development of a vaccinethree major scenarios are currently being pursued or envisaged in tackling the diseaseiresearch and trials on vaccines clinical trials are being conducted across the globe into novel vaccines and fast-tracking approval processes are being deployed however scientists fear that the virus itself like the flu can mutate and form different strains therefore immunity after immunisation or contracting and surviving covid-19 may only last as short as two yearsiitherapeutic trials using available drugs attention is being focused to drug repurposing and advanced formulations including antimalarial hiv and other antiviral and immune-modulating drugs and biomoleculesiiinanotechnology study of molecules that show promise but exhibit poor physio-chemical properties or toxicity is currently being formulated across the globe into advanced nanomedicine platforms translating the knowledge gained in drug targeting and efficacy enhancement from conditions such as cancer and cardiovascular disease such technologies aim to provide better treatment prognosis for those patients who fall ill with coronavirus related diseases attention to immune-modulating molecules is growing as patients who contracted severe forms of covid-19 were reported to experience notorious cytokine storms which ultimately
lead to their death ability to suppress such immunological responses could be one key to controlling the progression of the virus from mild to severe infectionlessons learned during this pandemic will also impact the outlook for other viruses these include governmental pandemic funding allocation stockpiling of medical protective equipment and emergency aid strategies within and between countries across the globe as the coronavirus problem increased across the globe in 2020 many questions have been raised regarding what more governments could have done why they did not act more quickly and what were the fundamental failures within their policy over time addressing these issues will pave the way for a more streamlined and effective future response in addition to this contact tracing technology is being heavily invested in across the globe with the intention that citizens would be able to download mobile applications which could inform them and the authorities if they had been exposed to another person who tested positive to covid-19 whilst early trials seem positive the longer-term question remains over privacy and ownership of personal data collected by such applications access to death records inside countries and across continents will allow identification of high-risk population categories which will aid risk prevention the positive news is that this pandemic has cemented the importance of scientific integrity the inclusion of scientific advisors into government and the role of science in society while this may offer little solace at such an upsetting time yet with the power of science this disease will be managed unlike many other viral threats over the years currently vaccine trials are ongoing at various phases of progress in different countries see table 3
 and good news may be expected soonin the wake of this pandemic many countries have developed new methods of digital communications that were not realised to be of much importance earlier for example in the uk enhanced digital communication developed through structured formats including the discourse digital health network which is a discussion and collaboration for the uk and international digital health communities 95the world has seen a surge in the use of digital tools being growingly used for teaching research consultation banking and day to day activities digital health innovation has been a prime example these approaches culminated in the development of telemedicine consultation the current situation has also driven many changes in work-life routines such as less travel and digital technology-based remote workthe coronavirus pandemic has brought significant disruption and caused severe emotional sentimental and financial losses there is even a chance that life on the planet will never be the same again and many stringent safety measures will continue to be followed in the time to come while using public transport air travel or while visiting touristic places the continued extension of lockdowns eg lockdown 10 to lockdown 40 in india has resulted in making people restless when staying indoors countries who were not very resilient in adapting to the situation even saw disrupted supply chains disturbed migrant workers lack of food and other supplies and unavailability of essential items - a situation comparable to a natural disasterhowever every disaster brings forth a new cycle of life and the episode of covid-19 did bring some good things countries facing severe pollution in air water and land saw a life not seen in the last many decades social websites and digital tools were used heavily to share the beauty of nature rivers got cleaner the air became more breathable and the sky got clearer 96 as a result of this transition even climate change and transition in weather were observed in many places and it will be befitting to say that we witnessed how nature self-heals and mends itselfa prime example of climate change as a result of lockdown can be seen in china europe and in india see figure 18
 india has faced two major challenges for many years in the wake of rapid urbanisation alarming levels of air pollution and a rapid decrease in the availability of clean water especially from rivers like the ganga the government of india had earlier set up a mega project called namami gange 97 for freeing the rivers from industrial wastes the project is of such importance that when addressing the indian community at madison square garden in new york in 2014 the prime minister of india mr narendra modi had said if we can clean the ganga it will be a huge help for 40 population of the country covid-19 has rejuvenated the ganga and many other rivers around the world making them cleaner to a point that their water was reported to be potable 98the learning from the episode of covid-19 has been that resources offered by mother nature are meant to be used and not to be exploited if this simple rule is forgotten then the world may continue to witness a regular self-healing cycle on this occasion it was covid-19 but the next time it could be readjustments in the ecosystem caused by a surge in the carbon emissionsresearchers are reporting a decrease in solar activity leading to an increased flux of energetic particles in our galaxy 101 before it is too late to realize and the entire human race wipes-off the face of the earth due to the climate change we must take this pandemic as a wake-up call towards being considerate to the environmentwhat has apparently come clearer though is that problems like biohazards primarily emerge due to our lifestyle eg consumption patterns including eating habits or mishandling of biowastes see figure 19
 there is an absolute necessity to pay utmost attention to biosafety and implementation of effective iso standards worldwide health of people is also closely connected to the health of animals and our shared environment this is because people animals plants and our environment are interdependent 102 and this direction of research considers the concept of one healthin the wake of the covid-19 pandemic the world witnessed an all-time-high demand of ventilators ppes masks bed liners other essential health supplies and medicines the pandemic struck everywhere including the largest manufacturing economies  and pretty much all at once as a result most nations experienced manufacturing shocks the two shocks that have impacted manufacturing worldwide aresupply shock the containment measures such as lockdowns and social distancing kept the workers away and resulted in reduced productivity and outputdemand shock customer consumption patterns started changing eg movement away from non-essentials and this affected the demand for a large variety of manufactured goods and associated services
as the pandemic spread a few countries were resilient enough to cope with the pace of transformed supply chain requirements while many others who had earlier in pre- covid-19 era aligned themselves to outsourced or cloud-based manufacturing primarily driven by low-cost became hugely dependent for their essential supplies on other countries primarily china stringent lockdowns enforced by different countries at different times had severe consequences on the supply chains where outsourcing-based dependencies existed indeed china manufactures much of its pharmaceuticals for export in the hubei province which is where covid-19 originated and this outbreak introduced a bottleneck in the global supply of several antibiotics even functioning factories that tried to increase their manufacturing productivity by increasing their inventory or logistics capability or increasing the number of operators could not do so their efforts were negated by the strong social distancing measuresoverall unprecedented requirements arising out of covid-19 could not be met by outsourced manufacturing systems under such scenarios indigenous manufacturing programs have come into focus many examples of a sustained push to indigenous manufacturing were seen the us ramped up indigenous production of masks ventilators and test-kits and india increased indigenous ppe suits production capacity from practically nothing to more than 100000 suits per day earlier there were only a handful of firms such as becton dickinson philips hamilton medical fisher  paykel healthcare draeger medtronic and ge systems who manufactured specialised ventilators in the wake of the pandemic new capabilities on this front have emerged and many innovations were deployed at manufacturing firms for example in the us automobile firms such as gm and ford as well as other firms emerged with new designs and ventilator manufacturing capabilitiesthe manufacturing related lesson learned from the covid-19 episode is that pandemics can affect manufacturing in several geographical locations simultaneously and therefore can affect an individual nations surge capacity to deliver essential supplies such as diagnostics drugs and vaccines to its population going forward this lesson will critically affect thoughts on manufacturing strategy and low-cost basedoutsourcing and we may see a sustained push towards development of resilient indigenous manufacturing capabilities and a decreasing reliance on low-cost based outsourced manufacturinga second trend that we perceive is an increasing focus on digitised automation and use of automated production systems including the use of robotics in day to day life as well as deployment of embedded robotics in manufacturing operations an example of a futuristic automation capability was displayed at the indian institute of technology guwahati who developed remote controlled food delivery robot for covid-19 isolation wards see figure 20
 the robot was designed for 6 hours run when fully chargedantimicrobial resistance amr refers to the resistance of microbes to antimicrobial drugs or microbial immunity the who as well as several national health organizations have identified antibiotic resistance as one of the greatest threats to global public health economic growth agriculture economic security and national security around the globe people are being admitted to hospitals with infections that do not respond to antibiotic treatment the problem of amr is rooted in the fact that when microbes are repeatedly exposed to antibiotics they mutate to produce strainsthat are resistant to the antibiotic and are therefore able to resist the effects of medication that could successfully treat the microbein 2014 lord jim oneill and his team published a review commissioned by the united kingdom government entitled antimicrobial resistance tackling a crisis for the health and wealth of nations the amr review which is in line to the question that de kraker et al 104 asked will 10 million people die a year due to amr by 2050the problem of amr is connected to that of covid-19 with respect to the emergence of zoonotic diseases the trend of overuse andor misuse of antimicrobials excess use of certain antibiotics in animals and pharmaceutical industry pollution can lead to continuous emergence of zoonotic diseasesexcessive use of antimicrobials stresses the naturally occurring microbiome and allows for resistant bacteria to become dominant indeed research has suggested that amr might spread to humans through food products of animal origin the environment and by direct contact in the case of agricultural workers addressing the issue of amr as well as others shown in figure 21
is thus a global priority as its impact on claiming lives is no less than that of covid-19 105the rapid emergence of the covid-19 pandemic provided minimal time for well-directed resource mobilization and almost every country was tested for its resilience in its medical and manufacturing abilities during the first half of 2020 the number of tragic health cases pushed organizations such as the fda to allow emergency use authorisation of various drugs without a systematic testing protocol and among the 70 drugs tried favipiravir and tocilizumab were rated most effective amidst the chaotic situation the growing use of digital tools for professional communications and artificial intelligence to monitor the recovery of covid-19 patients showed some positive outcomes a major question remains open to date how can the symptoms of covid-19 be detected in their early stages while more research is needed on the instrumentation and manufacturing sides there are clear opportunities identified from the available scientific knowledgebase in relatively advanced stages of the symptoms rapid measurements by combining chest computer tomography ct and reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction rt-pcr tests seem to provide a high confidence level in the screening more work is needed on the sensing side for detection of the virus in the primitive stages definitive promise has been exhibited using laser technology to monitor the aerosol spread and to detect the rna of the virus and gain a deeper understanding of the aerodynamic properties of emergent virusesfurther development of fumigation chambers and ultra-violet chambers seem to hold promise as precautionary measures that can be implemented in public places like malls airports theatres and train stations etcin this paper we have also highlighted the possibilities of developing novel tools such as lab-on-the-chip in addition to developing advanced personal protective equipment ppe using combinatorial additive and subtractive manufacturing techniques such as roll-to-roll manufacturing and thermal spray these technologies allow the capability to filter the coronavirus which has a diameter in the range of 100  60 nm it is envisioned that in future wearing masks and social distancing would be mandated to avoid the recurrent spread of the virus in the long term micro-manufacturers medical professionals metrology engineers material scientists and virologists will need to work in a more interdisciplinary way to develop modelling informed fabrication strategies accelerated use of molecular modelling approaches - like molecular dynamics and molecular docking  also seems to hold promise in drug and vaccine discovery to end this pandemic from its rootas society progresses to meet challenges such as covid-19 many overarching issues will become important strong measures will need to be implemented to ensure careful handling of biowastes indigenous capability-based manufacturing focus will become stronger and issues such as antimicrobial resistance will demand increased attention our hope is that the post-pandemic society will better heed the warning signs from nature and work on making manufacturing systems resilient to address emerging threatsall data in the manuscript will be available through cranfield university open repository

we hereby declare that the authors and co-authors of this work have no competing interests
the following sequence of events was formulatedrelevant literature was identified from the pubmed online database of the us national library of medicine and from infection control textbooks predominantly englishlanguage sources were reviewed bibliographies of all relevant papers were searched to identify additional papers search terms included transmission inanimatenonporous surface and environment fomites survival and persistence hand hygiene transmission crossinfection and crosscontamination contact transmission autoinoculation handtomouth transfer infectious and infective dose and exposure in addition current editions of guidelines and consensus recommendations on healthcare hygiene from organizations were reviewed eg us centers for disease control and prevention us food and drug administration international scientific forum on home hygiene
247microorganisms causing persontoperson spread microorganisms with high secondary attack rates and those requiring contact isolation and to a lesser extent droplet isolation were withheld they were evaluated for their capability of surviving on hands and fomites and for their capability and efficiency of being transferred from hand to fomites and vice versa further data on their infectious dose were reviewed as well as data on the numbers shed by patients and carriers end point was the identification of those microorganisms that may be transferred through fingerprinting in doses sufficient to cause infectionstudies on standards of personal hygiene in the community were reviewed to document the carriage of microorganisms on hands in the community and to assess the frequency and efficiency of autoinoculationthe visa application office at the belgian embassy in kinshasa rdc and the border control point at brussels airport were visited the capturing and reading procedures were reviewed and the operating staff was interviewedtransmission risk combines the numbers of microorganisms transferred and the expected exposure the exposure depends on geographic social and epidemiological factors we estimated the risk of human rotavirus transmission for adults in the us setting using monte carlo sampling to represent the uncertainty of the estimates with 95 credible intervals 95 ci we used addrisk that is an addin to excel 2000 v 405 palisade corporation newfield ny usa the estimation was based on 1 million fingerprintcapturing procedures at a turnaround time of 10 minutesapplicant data on transmission and survival of human rotavirus were retrieved from the literature and for the efficiency of fingermouth transfer data on surrogate virus were used

a 50 range 3060 handwashing rate in the community was assumed
1213
likewise we assessed the quantitative risk reduction of hand washing water and soap and hygienic hand disinfection with 70 isopropyl liquid hand rub and 85 ethanol hand gel after fingerprint capturing using log reduction rates reported from laboratory experiments
1415the fingerprint capturer ls2 check smith heimann biometrics gmbh jena germany contains an optical reader covered by an optical surface area this area consists of a glass plate of approximately 10  10 cm surrounded at three sides by a plastic board that creates a ushaped space for application of the fingers figure 1a and b between the glass plate surface and the edges of the board there is a split of approximately 1 mm height and 5 mm depth figure 1b the index reader sagem ms100 sagem paris france is a device the size of a computer mouse with a sunken area to accommodate a single finger pad on the index reader used at brussels airport leftovers of multiple fingerprints were clearly visible figure 1cfingerprint capturing involves subsequent application of the four digits of the right hand those of the left hand and both thumbs the applicant places his flat fingers finger pads as well as phalanges on the glass plate figure 1a and d resulting in a skinsurface contact area of approximately 20 cm2hand the overlapping contact area between the fingers of the successive applicants is very large for capturing a considerable pressure has to be exerted higher than when shaking hands and the total time of finger to surface contact for scanning 10 fingers in three capturing sets is approximately 20 seconds index reading takes 1 to 2 seconds requires only a slight pressure and involves a small contact surface 12 cm2at brussels airport and at the embassy in kinshasa there was no procedure on how to deal with obvious skin defects cuts or abrasions fingers with uncovered skin defects were scanned in an identical way to fingers with intact skin no cleaning and disinfection procedures were available and no facilities for hand washing were present in the fingerprintcapturing room the operators manual instructions mentioned wiping off the fingerprint capturers glass plate once daily before use to remove latent images that are caused by leftover prints from users the day before

according to the operating staff the foreseen numbers of applicants at visa application imply at times and places a short turnaround time with delays of less than 10 minutes elapsed between two successive applicantsnumerous studies have counted bacteria on healthcare workers hands but only a few assessed bacterial loads on hands in the community mean log colonyforming units cfu counts of 572 and 570 on a single hand were found in two recent studies of hand flora in the community staphylococcus aureus was present on 185 of hands and gramnegative bacteria in 751
1718
among primary school children fecal contamination of fingers reached 7 and on hands of housewives fecal bacteria were found in densities of 300 cfucm2
1920
most bacteria survive at least more than 30 minutes on the hands
21ample epidemiological evidence of survival of viruses on hands is present for human rotavirus hepatitis a virus astrovirus adenovirus rhinovirus respiratory syncytial virus rsv and influenzavirus
92123hand washing in the community does not meet the recommended standards of frequency and technique handwashing compliance rates after restroom use varied between 37 and 61 with as few as 8 of observed individuals using soap and 2 washing hands for more than 10 seconds
1213
after changing a dirty diaper observed childcare providers washed hands on only 42 of occasions
24most microorganisms survive long enough on fomites to be transferred through fingerprinting
25
in general they tend to survive better on nonporous surfaces plastic china glass and stainless steel than on paper and fabrics cotton terry and blends
82627
survival is influenced by temperature relative humidity and the presence of organic material but not to an extent that is of critical importance in the short delays of the fingerprint setting
25
among the viruses notably though survivors are the nonenveloped viruses human rotavirus hepatitis a virus astrovirus enteric adenovirus and poliovirus hepatitis a virus and human rotavirus combine long survival spans 60 d with decay rates of only 10 and 100fold respectively
82829
many bacterial pathogens survive for days to weeks
25microorganisms can be readily transferred from fomites to hands and vice versa compared to porous surfaces nonporous surfaces have higher transfer efficiencies holding a telephone receiver resulted in a 38 to 60 objecttohand transfer efficiency compared to a 001 transfer rate from cotton to hand
11
residual moisture such as after hand washing without drying enhances handfomite transfer
11occasionally the microorganisms that are picked up may penetrate the skin via small cuts or abrasions in most cases however the contaminated person may bring them unwittingly to the mouth gastrointestinal infection or the conjunctivae and nasal mucosa respiratory tract infection most organisms remain long enough at least 30 min on the hands to allow autoinoculation autoinoculation may occur by eating without prior hand washing or by practices such as nose picking eye rubbing page licking and nail biting these practices appear to be common one in three students rubbed their eyes during a 1hour lecture
30
1 in 10 healthcare professionals licked the index finger when paging through a clinical chart
31
approximately 45 of questioned adolescents reported to be nail biters and nearly all adolescents surveyed admitted to picking their nose
3233
for bacteria as well as for viruses autoinoculation showed transfer efficiencies of 30 to 40
11for the adenovirus types 40 and 41 astrovirus norovirus and human rotavirus all causing gastroenteritis as well as for hepatitis a virus strong epidemiological and laboratory evidence of transfer through fomites is available
23791122293438
based on a theoretical rationale numbers of organisms shed survival on hands and on fomites and infectious dose and epidemiological evidence persontoperson spread transfer of shigella dysenteriae enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli enteroinvasive e coli and salmonella typhi in numbers exceeding the infectious dose is also possible
725273943
intestinal protozoa such as cryptosporidium spp oocysts giardia lamblia cysts and helminths such as enterobius vermicularis egg meet the requirements for transfer through fingerprinting and the role of fomites in their transmission has been described
744strong epidemiological evidence in favor of transfer through fomites is present for adenovirus herpes simplex virus type 1 hsv1 and rsv in addition both experimental and laboratory data have been provided for parainfluenza virus rhinovirus and influenzavirus including the h5n1 strain
34344550
severe acute respiratory syndromeassociated coronavirus is possibly transmitted through fomites high secondary attack rate events super spreading events suggest possible fecaloral transmission with contamination of the environment
5152
a number of bacterial pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae haemophilus influenzae neisseria meningitidis bordetella pertussis and corynebacterium diphtheriae can survive on fomites and transmission through articles soiled with respiratory discharges has been described however their capacity for survival on fomites is poor and evidence for indirect contact transmission had not been thoroughly documented
2534finger lesions caused by hsv1 herpetic whitlow are mainly transmitted by direct contact but indirect transmission is not excluded as the virus survives drying on fomites
25a number of bacteria and yeasts may cause respiratory tract wound and urinary tract infections especially in hospitalized patients they include among others s aureus enterobacter spp e coli klebsiella spp serratia spp pseudomonas aeruginosa enterococcus spp and candida albicans from a technical standpoint their capability of being transferred through fingerprinting is excellent they survive for extended periods on fomites especially in the presence of organic material and persist for at least 30 minutes on hands
25
laboratory experiments have demonstrated handfomite transfer and vice versa for c albicans and enterococcus faecium
5354
further these microorganisms have been implicated in common source outbreaks related to medical household or administrative equipment the exact role of fomites in these outbreaks is difficult to ascertain but in a number of cases molecular techniques proved strain identity between the infecting strain and that present on the fomite
436
although infection transmissions through fomites remain rare events in the healthcare setting several points are of concern 1 many of the bacterial species may develop resistance to antibiotics and 2 these multidrugresistant strains are spreading from hospitals to nonhospital care facilities nursing homes and longterm care facilities and next to the community
5556the transmission risk of an infection caused by a particular microorganism combines the capability of transfer of this microorganism through fingerprinting in doses exceeding the infectious dose and the probability of exposure ie the probability that a person shedding the organisms will present for fingerprinting in the absence of a particular outbreak highest probabilities of exposure can be expected for 1 enteric viruses such as rotavirus and 2 respiratory viruses such as rsv influenzavirus and parainfluenzavirus other microorganisms occur in epidemics that are notoriously difficult to contain eg norovirus gastroenteritis in hotels and cruise ships adenovirus conjunctivitis in the healthcare setting and s dysenteriae dysentery in largescale epidemics
3842the health impact of a disease also differs according to local epidemiology worldwide infections with human rotavirus causes have a case fatality rate of 04 but in industrialized countries it is as low as 003
10
another example is hepatitis a infection where environmental sanitation is poor infection caused by hepatitis a is common and occurs at an early age at this age the disease is benign in countries with high hygienic standards most adults have never been infected and remain susceptible to infection and persons aged 50 years or older have an increased risk of complications
38using monte carlo risk analysis on us data the mean number of transmissions of human rotavirus per million fingerprintcapturing procedures among adult applicants was estimated as 191 95 ci 0289 when after fingerprint capturing hands are washed with soap and water this does not result in a marked decrease of transmission 189 transmissions 95 ci 0277 application of 70 isopropyl hand rub and 85 ethanol gel reduces the risk to 77 95 ci 0118 and 03 95 ci 003 transmissions per million procedures respectively due to the short contact time small surface and low pressure index reading has a transmission risk that is approximately 100 to 1000fold lower than that of fingerprint capturingin this study we demonstrated that based on the current knowledge of indirect contact transmission the fingerprinting procedure offers opportunities for the transfer of organisms microorganisms that can be transferred in quantities exceeding the infectious dose include enteric and respiratory pathogens the transmission risk of human rotavirus in the us setting is estimated at 191 95 ci 0289 per million fingerprintcapturing proceduresbiometric identification systems are based on distinctive personal traits such as voice fingerprint face iris and signature fingerprintbased systems are known for their high discriminative capability and have a longstanding forensic tradition they are increasingly accepted by the general public about 9 in 10 people who were fingerprinted for identification purposes felt it was an appropriate requirement
57
in recent years the systems have been technically perfected and devices and computing power have become more economically viable as a consequence applications are expanding in both the public and the private sector most applications imply person identity verification in security infrastructures financial transactions and retail sales fingerprint verification is already part of the process of entry of asylum seekers and refugees at the european union and the council decision 2004512 ec provides the legal framework for integrating fingerprint biometric data in all future european union visa applications
158it was beyond the scope of this study to consider an exhaustive list of all microorganisms some microorganisms may become important in case of an outbreak for instance poliovirus is transmitted very efficiently by indirect contact but was presently not considered because of the low worldwide incidence for some microorganisms the numbers shed and their survival on fomites is not known and for others conflicting data on infectious doses are reported
50
in parallel there are limitations on the quantitative risk estimations we presented eg assumptions were made with regard to the efficiency of fingertomouth transmission of human rotavirus and the efficacy of hand rubbing by the general public in addition most episodes of human rotavirus infection in adults are asymptomatic or mild on the other hand asymptomatic rotavirus patients contribute to transmission and host factors such as age underlying diseases nutrition status and medication will worsen the clinical picture considerably
2259
in western societies approximately 20 of the population can be classified within such an atrisk group
60further it should be noted that in case of an ongoing epidemic organisms such as norovirus s dysenteriae and adenovirus will cause higher transmission rates than those presently estimated for human rotavirus in addition there is ongoing debate on lowering the age for compulsory fingerprinting from the currently regulated 12 years to 6 years or even lower
61
regardless of ethical and political issues it is clear that fingerprinting of infants and children will both augment the number of transmissions due to higher numbers of applicants shedding pathogens and increase the severity of clinical infections due to higher host susceptibility finally it is clear that the overall transmission risk of fingerprint capturing is a compilation of the risk of all particular organisms implicatedone might question whether the above cited studies on transfer of microorganisms are applicable to the fingerprinting devices the laboratory transfer studies on hepatitis a virus and rhinovirus were conducted by a finger pad experiment in which metal disks were contaminated with 10 l viral suspensions in concentrations equal to those in affected patients after drying these disks were applied to finger pads with contact surface and contact times of 1 to 3 cm2 and 5 to 10 seconds respectively transmission efficiency ranged from 07 to 16 and the quantities transferred were invariably higher than the infectious dose
2335
in terms of transmission efficiency the conditions of fingerprint capturing 2  20 cm2 and 20 s respectively are even more favorable the high contact pressure during fingerprinting is an additional factor experiments showed that a high pressure 10 kgcm2 as with hand shaking and opening of doors resulted in a three times higher amount of hepatitis a virus transfer compared to low 02 kgcm2 pressure
35
in addition to these laboratory experiments a reallife study illustrated the potential of transfer through handfomite contact in a flat shared by four students a surrogate virus was applied on the door handle of the living room it was spread by the occupiers to nearly all the important contact points in the surrounding area including the telephone the computer trackball the light switches in the kitchen and the bathroom and the handles of the refrigerator and the teapot within 6 hours all occupants as well as visitors were infected
62
another study examined the houses of infants who were recently vaccinated for polio during which time shedding occurs in feces the presence of virus was demonstrated in up to 13 of bathroom living room and kitchen sites most frequently contaminated were hand contact sites such as bathroom taps door handles toilet flushes liquid soap dispensers diaperchanging equipment and potties
24in view of the ubiquitous prevalence of some of the pathogens one might argue that the risk of transmission through fingerprinting is only similar to the risk of touching other fomites in daily life door knobs taps bus rails etc and that by consequence control measures are obsolete in addition the quantitative risk of infection through fingerprint capturing can be neglected in view of the risk of for instance travelers diarrhea although it is difficult to compare the risks we think that in daily life the particular conditions of fingerprinting large contact surface large overlap high contact pressure and long contact time are not frequently met moreover anecdotal evidence linking acquisition of hospital pathogens to fomites in the community raises the issue of implementation of control measures in certain community settings for instance carriage of multiresistant s aureus in a nurse was linked to contamination of a computer desk and joystick at home and not eliminated until the computerrelated hardware was decontaminated
63
finally fingerprinting in the present setting is a mandatory act without fingerprinting visa application is refused for which risks as perceived by the public are higher compared to voluntary acts
64quantitative microbial risk assessment in food microbiology often relies on monte carlo analyses
6566
monte carlo analysis provides numerical expressions of risk with an indication of the uncertainties and allows assessment of the quantitative impact of control and prevention measures one of the possible limitations is that it needs precise probability distributions for all input parameters and it is difficult to use when rare events may have a major effect
67monte carlo analysis revealed the effect on risk reduction of alcoholbased hand rub in this setting hand disinfection was considered afterand not beforethe procedure because we assumed compliance by the public to be higher after the procedure and because the process of fingerprint capturing does not perform well with freshly cleaned hands hand washing with water and plain soap has virtually no activity against nonenveloped viruses and antimicrobial soaps based on chlorhexidine or triclosan have only a limited activity
21
alcoholbased hand rubs have superior activity and are better tolerated than antimicrobial soaps their use is simple approximately 3 ml of alcohol rub is applied in the palm of the hand next the hands are rubbed together covering all the surfaces of the hands and hands are further rubbed until they are dry there is no need for running water sink or drying facilities compared to the other alcohols such as isopropyl alcohol ethanol in high concentrations had a superior activity on nonenveloped viruses and retains enough activity against bacterial pathogens
21of course hand disinfection is only part of a coherent prevention strategy in that regard we are presently studying the feasibility of other control measures including training and education of the staff procedures in case of skin defects and disinfection of the devices in addition the performance and acceptability of hand rubbing by the general public will be assessed as well as the compliance with the control measures by the operating staff on mediumlength term improvements in design and construction of the devices are expected the split under the ushaped plastic board of the present fingerprint capturer hinders cleaning and allows the buildup of dirt and moisture which inactivates disinfectants and allows microorganisms to survive newly designed devices should also withstand the corroding or decolorizing effects of disinfectants other possibilities should be technically explored such as disposable transparent covers over the contact surface or a removable surface contact plate that can be detached and soaked into a disinfecting solution alternatively socalled touchless systems which capture fingerprints without making physical contact with the optical surface might be consideredin conclusion based on a literature review on indirect contact transmission both the fingerprinting devices and the procedure allow for transfer of microorganisms in doses exceeding the infectious dose substantial risk reduction can be achieved by implementation of simple infection control measuresseveral models of humoral immunity have been developed to explain or predict the duration of humoral immunity following infection or vaccination 
fig 1
 memory bcelldependent models are based on the requirement of memory b cells to become activated proliferate and differentiate into antibodysecreting daughter cells that intermittently or continuously repopulate the antibodysecreting plasma cell pool these models are based on either antigenspecific stimulation via chronic infection repeated infection booster vaccination persisting antigen in the form of immune complexes or nonantigenspecific polyclonal bcell stimulation via tolllike receptor tlr engagement or bystander tcell activation there are also two models of memory bcellindependent maintenance of longterm antibody production and these are based on the concept that memory b cells and plasma cells represent two independently regulated bcell populations and that the duration of antibody production by plasma cells is determined either by competition for space in immunological niches such as the bone marrow or is based on the principle that antigenspecific plasma cells have a predetermined lifespanto decipher which model or models best depict the outcome of humoral immune responses over time we compared these models to biological observations made during the longitudinal analysis of serum antibody responses against eight different virus and vaccine antigens in human subjects 
fig 2
 monitored for up to 26 years 1 in these studies we examined serological memory in 45 subjects who provided a total of 630 serum samples that had been banked at the oregon national primate research center onprc and the immunological profiles of two representative subjects are presented here by comparing the various models of humoral immunity 
fig 1
 to the observations made during these longitudinal experiments 
fig 2
 we hope to gain a better understanding of the different factors that are involved with maintaining longterm antibody responsesone mechanism for maintaining prolonged antibody responses is through continued antigen presentation or internal boosting of the immune response by viruses that cause chronic infection 
fig 1
 this model represents only a subset of potential immunological experiences because many pathogens are unable to sustain a chronic or persistent infection in these cases memory b cells exposed to chronic viral or microbial antigens would be triggered to proliferate and differentiate into antibodysecreting plasma cells and either maintain or even inflate serological memory through a memory bcelldependent mechanism alternatively idiotypic networks or crossreactivity to environmental or selfantigens may result in chronic stimulation of an antibody response the potential for these latter models is debatable since it would be difficult to envision how antigenspecific affinity maturation would occur if the antibodies are reacting to other antibody molecules ie idiotypic networks 2 or to other self or environmental antigens given that affinity maturation ceases shortly after vaccination and is resumed only after booster vaccination with the same antigen 3 moreover if continuous crossreactive bcell activation is the mechanism for maintaining longterm antibody responses then it is difficult to explain why some antibody responses decline whereas others are maintained for decades or in some cases for life these types of discrepancies may indicate why the crossreactive models of humoral immunity have largely fallen out of favor in recent yearswe studied the duration of humoral immunity against two common chroniclatent viral infections epsteinbarr virus ebv and varicella zoster virus vzv ebvspecific antibody responses were maintained at steadystate levels t
12  11 552 years 95 ci 63 years to infinity 
table 1
 with no significant decrease in titer over time p  099 1 human cytomegalovirus cmv causes a persistent infection that not only induces strong antiviral antibody responses but also causes immunological memory inflation with virusspecific antibody titers that continue to increase incrementally for years after infection ij amanna and mk slifka unpublished data in contrast antibody responses against vzv declined slowly but significantly over time p  0005 1 with an estimated 50year halflife 95 ci 30153 years 
table 1
 this time was substantially shorter than the calculated antibody halflife of antibody responses mounted against other viruses that cause acute infection 
table 1
 and indicates that a latent infection does not necessarily elicit the most durable antibody response from a virological perspective these results also indicate that when vzv is latent it appears to be truly sequestered from the host immune system this observation may also explain why pediatric vaccination against vzv which is based on a live attenuated herpesvirus varivax merck whitehouse station nj usa that can form latency 4 5 6 still requires booster vaccination in order to sustain protective immunity against natural vzv infection 1 7one of the oldest and most commonly described models used to explain longterm antibody responses is the persisting antigen model

 in this scenario foreign protein antigens persist on the surface of follicular dendritic cells fdcs in the form of immune complexes and these antigenantibody complexes continuously stimulate resident memory b cells to proliferate and differentiate into antibodysecreting plasma cells extensive studies on persisting antigen and the role of fdcs were performed in the 1970s and 1980s 24 25 with some of the most influential research performed by tew and mandel 26 using radiolabeled antigens they demonstrated that injected protein does indeed persist in vivo and that the antigens appear to follow a biphasic rate of decay initially greater than 99 of antigen is lost or degraded within the first 24 days with an antigen halflife of 40 h 27 the next phase of decay is much slower with an estimated halflife of approximately 8 weeks 95 ci 5120 weeks if antibody levels are maintained by continued or intermittent activation of memory b cells via persisting antigen in the form of immune complexes and if one assumes that the ability of memory b cells to capture antigen proliferate and differentiate into antibodysecreting cells ascs does not decline over time then the decay rate of serum antibody will be proportional to the decay rate of persisting antigen 
fig 1
 if we use the high end of the 95 confidence interval for antigen persistence in vivo ie 20 weeks or approximately 05 year then antigendriven bcell activation should decline steadily over time and antibody responses should decay with approximately a 05year halflife this is in stark contrast to the durable antibody responses observed in human subjects following acute viral infection or immunization with tetanus or diphtheria toxoid vaccines 
fig 2
 
table 1
there is no doubt that antigen can persist in the form of immune complexes and this property is important for the germinal center reaction as well as affinity maturation of the memory bcell response 24 25 28 29 30 31 32 indeed antigen can be detected in lymphoid organs for weeks or months after injection 25 31 33 which is associated with prolonged germinal center reactions 30 33 although antigen can clearly persist it is unlikely to persist forever for instance there is a finite limit to how much antigen can be bound to a particular fdc according to published studies 27 it is estimated that approximately 300 000 antigen molecules can bind to the surface of an fdc as noted previously 9 if antigen decays with an average of an 8week halflife then only one molecule of antigen would remain on the surface of an fdc after 3 years dendritic cell lifespan may also be a factor to consider since these cells have an estimated lifespan of only days or weeks 34 35 36 although memory b cells do not necessarily require cd4 tcell help to persist 37 38 if antigen is stimulating memory b cells then the b cells are likely to consume the antigen 39 40 and present it to cd4 t cells the maintenance of cd4 tcell memory should result as an added benefit however studies have shown in mice 41 and in humans 13 22 42 that virusspecific cd4 tcell memory declines over time even though antiviral antibody responses remain stable comparative analysis of cd4 tcell memory and virusspecific antibody responses following smallpox vaccination further showed that there is no correlation between the levels of tcell memory and antibody titers 13 taken together it is thus suggested that immune complexes and persisting antigen can play an important role in eliciting and maintaining the early stages of a humoral immune response but it is unlikely to be the sole mechanism for maintaining antibody responses that can last 50 years 1 13 43unlike other memory bcelldependent models of humoral immunity the polyclonal stimulation model is based on nonantigenspecific polyclonal stimulation of memory b cells through bystander tcell activation or tlr engagement in this model serum antibody production is maintained at levels that are proportional to the frequency of antigenspecific memory b cells 44 45 ongoing or intermittent infection is thought to elicit cytokines andor tlr activation of the memory bcell pool which in turn triggers the b cells to proliferate and differentiate into antibodysecreting plasma cells with an estimated 40day halflife 44 45 this model is based in part on compelling in vitro data demonstrating that memory b cells can be activated to divide and differentiate into ascs following exposure to combinations of cytokines and tlr agonists such as cpg oligonucleotides 44 indeed tlrinduced memory bcell activation in conjunction with immunoglobulin crosslinking is an effective means for measuring memory bcell frequencies in bulk culture 22 46 or in limiting dilution assays 1 47 in vivo however there is conflicting evidence for polyclonal stimulation of b cells playing a role in maintaining preexisting antibody responses in the original study tetanus vaccination was examined due to its ability to induce memory tcell activation and bystander tcell help within 57 days after booster tetanus vaccination the frequency of ascs in the peripheral blood that was specific for unrelated antigens such as measles or t gondii appeared to increase by 5 to 10fold although serum titers to these antigens were not examined one would predict that there would be a concomitant increase in serum antibody titers if these ascs were involved with maintaining or increasing serum antibody levels 
fig 1
 when tetanusspecific antibody titers were examined there was an expected antigenspecific response with antibody titers increasing by about 80fold at the peak of the response and then declining over the ensuing weeks with an approximate 40day halflife 44 similar to other memory bcelldependent models the polyclonal bcell activation theory represents a complex scenario in which continued infection or immune activation will be required in order to sustain antigenspecific antibody levels for decades 
fig 2
 moreover it requires a careful balance in proliferation with an equal distribution of daughter cells that enter the plasma cell pool while also repopulating the memory bcell pool to their original numbers  which remain remarkably stable over time 1 22 it is unlikely that chronic infection is responsible for this form of nonantigenspecific memory bcell stimulation since this would be expected to trigger memory b cells of all antigen specificities to proliferatedifferentiate into antibodysecreting daughter cells with a similar antibody halflife this model however does not fully explain the differences in antigenspecific antibody maintenance observed in vivo 
table 1
 if repeated acute heterologous infection is required to maintain antibody responses then this may result in substantial variability in antibody responses over time especially if plasma cells and their coinciding antibody levels have a 40day halflife 44 such a rapid decay rate followed by spikes in reactivationrepopulation of peripheral plasma cells would likely differ from year to year as well as between seasons within a given year if based on the frequency of contagious infections such as rhinoviruses coronaviruses influenza etc however longitudinal studies of multiple subjects over the course of one to two decades have indicated that antibody responses are not erratic 
fig 1
 but instead undergo stable trends unless altered by antigenspecific vaccination or infectionbased events 
fig 2
 for instance when analysis of antigenspecific antibody responses to eight different antigens was performed for the first several weeks following smallpox vaccination subject 1 
fig 2
 we found little or no effect on the levels of antibody responses to unrelated antigens 1 this finding is consistent with other independent studies conducted in mice 38 48 49 and in human subjects 8 in which an in vivo effect of heterologous vaccination or infection on preexisting serum antibody responses to unrelated antigens has not been observed although it appears unlikely that polyclonal memory bcell stimulation through heterologous infectionrelated tlr engagement or bystander tcell activation is required for maintenance of longterm antibody responses it is still an interesting phenomenon learning why memory b cells do or do not respond to these types of inflammatory signals will be important for developing better vaccines especially since tlr agonists represent an exciting area of future adjuvant development 50there are several lines of evidence indicating that plasma cells represent an independent bcell population that can be longlived in the absence of repopulation by memory b cells first studies involving tritium incorporation 51 or bromodeoxyuridine brdu incorporation 52 have shown that plasma cells can survive for long periods of time in the absence of cell division second although memory b cells themselves are also quite longlived 1 22 for each of the memory bcelldependent models of longterm antibody production to be feasible there needs to be a direct correlation between memory bcell numbers and antibody levels in this regard there are some studies that have identified this correlation 22 44 whereas there are others who do not find a consistent correlation between memory bcell frequencies and antibody levels 1 11 53 third when memory b cells are depleted in animal models 54 55 56 plasma cell populations and antibody levels continue to persist for long periods of time this is further supported by anecdotal evidence of sustained antibody responses to vaccine antigens in human subjects undergoing bcell ablative therapy with anticd20 depletion 57 although memory b cells may not be required for the longterm maintenance of plasma cell populations they still play a vital role in protective immunity by mounting secondary responses following exposure or reexposure to their specific antigen for instance adoptive transfer studies clearly show that memory b cells will rapidly expand and repopulate plasma cell numbers after booster vaccination with their specific antigen but will remain dormant and not respond to vaccination with an irrelevant antigen 38if plasma cells can be longlived as these data suggest then how is the duration of antibody production determined and regulated the plasma cell competition model is based on the theory that plasma cells survive for long periods of time when residing in the appropriate niche or microenvironment but that they are eventually displaced through competition with newly generated migratory plasmablasts that compete with the older resident plasma cells for finite space in the survival niche 58 once displaced the terminally differentiated plasma cells are believed to be unable to regain localization within the niche and subsequently die unlike the polyclonal stimulation model that predicts an increase in antibody responses to unrelated antigens during or shortly after infectionvaccination this model would predict that each new infection or vaccination would result in the loss of preexisting humoral immunity to unrelated antigens through the process of the new plasmablasts displacing preexisting plasma cells of other specificities it is believed that 8090 of longlived plasma cells reside in the bone marrow compartment 58 59 60 61 62 and one could argue that the rates of cell death by displacement would increase as the competition for limited space increases plasma cells accumulate in the bone marrow as a function of age and thus one would predict that plasma cell competition would also increase with age continuing this line of thought one would further predict that antibody responses should decay at a more rapid rate as a function of age since plasma cells would be destroyed at a more rapid rate proportional to the loss of available space and proportionally higher competition in the bone marrow niche 
fig 1
 in contrast when longitudinal analysis of antigenspecific antibody responses were performed in subjects in their 20s to 30s or in their 50s to 60s there was no observable change in antibody maintenance patterns 1 
fig 2
 in other words antibody responses against tetanus and diphtheria maintained more rapid decay rates regardless of an individuals age whereas durable antibody responses against viruses such as measles mumps or rubella remained longlived regardless of age 
table 1
 based on these in vivo observations it is difficult to conclude that plasma cell competition for space will adequately explain the differences in antibody response patterns 
table 1
 and does not predict the durability of humoral immunity during advanced age 1 
fig 2
all antibody responses are not created equal tcellindependent antibody responses are known to be shortlived whereas tcelldependent antigens elicit immunity that lasts for decades or in some cases may be maintained for a lifetime 
table 1
 in an attempt to explain the differential lifespan of antibody responses observed against different virus and vaccine antigens we have developed a model of plasma cell longevity that is based on individual plasma cells being imprinted with a specific lifespan at the time of induction 
fig 3
 epigenetic imprinting of function is not a unique concept we have previously demonstrated that individual virusspecific memory b cells will differ with regard to the number of antibodysecreting daughter cells that are produced following antigenic stimulation and the antibodysecreting daughter cells appear to have different antibody secretion rates that are unique to their cellular lineage 63 more recent studies have shown that b cells that receive tcell help will produce antibodysecreting progeny cells that produce significantly more antibody on a per cell basis than b cells that were activated by antigen in the absence of tcell help 64 this finding suggests that the microenvironment and availability of tcell help can have a profound impact on the function that is imprinted on the plasma cells produced from a particular memory bcellthere are two underlying tenets with the imprinted lifespan model first unlike memory b cells or intermediate asc types such as plasmablasts that maintain the ability to proliferate as well as secrete antibody 65 plasma cells are terminally differentiated cells that by definition can no longer divide therefore in the absence of reconstitution by memory b cells the duration of antigenspecific serum antibody responses during the intervals between vaccinations or infections will be directly proportional to the lifespan of the antigenspecific plasma cell populations second unlike memory b cells plasma cells lose the ability to sense and respond to antigenic changes in their environment memory b cells are highly adept at antigen capture due to maintaining high affinity antigenspecific antibody molecules on their surface 66 likewise memory b cells are able to elicit and respond to tcell help through the expression of major histocompatibility complex mhc class ii as well as a number of adhesion molecules such as cd80 and cd86 53 in contrast plasma cells lose the expression of many mature bcell markers including mhc class ii molecules 54 thus reducing their ability to elicit and respond to cognate tcell help although plasma cells will be directed to sites of inflammation 58 longterm antibody production after resolution of infection or vaccination is often maintained by plasma cells in the bone marrow 60 the bone marrow compartment is also sequestered from the main sites of initial infection skin respiratory and mucosal surfaces thus further reducing but not eliminating antigenic exposure bearing these factors in mind we believe that plasma cells will be unable to differentially respond to antigenic changes in their microenvironment and modify their specified lifespanwhat will determine the lifespan of antigenspecific plasma cells it may be based on the strength of the combined bcell signals that together provide an adjustable form of risk assessment of the antigenic exposure incurred during initiation of the humoral immune response if a naive bcell is exposed to soluble self protein or an unconjugated chemical molecule such as a free hapten then little or no antibody response is induced because there is no bcell receptor bcr crosslinking and no tcell help 
fig 3
 during the germinal center reaction soluble protein induces apoptosis further eliminating antibody responses to soluble antigens 67 even memory b cells are poorly responsive to soluble foreign proteins in the absence of tcell help 38 and this property may be important because it reduces the amount of antibody directed towards selfantigens or induction of antibody responses to environmental or irrelevant antigens for instance b cells will respond effectively to a repetitive or particulate antigen such as the cmv gb protein on the surface of intact virus particles but are unable to respond effectively to gb protein in its soluble form 38 this may be one reason why protein aggregates complexed with adjuvants such as alum are much more immunogenic than soluble proteins administered in the absence of adjuvantin contrast to free haptens or soluble proteins if the bcr is crosslinked by a highly repetitive nonprotein antigen such as a hapten conjugated to lps or ficoll then a tcellindependent antibody response is induced tcellindependent antibody responses are typically shortlived and maintained for only a few weeks or months by comparison tcelldependent antibody responses are typically longer lived than tcellindependent responses one example of a nonrepetitive tcelldependent antigen is tetanus toxoid this antigen represents a foreign antigen in which cd4 tcell responses will be induced and provide help to antigenspecific b cells tetanus is not a repetitive antigen and so there is low bcr crosslinking combined with the bcell signals obtained through cognate cd4 tcell help an antibody response will be induced that lasts for years or potentially for decades 
table 1
 to achieve an even longer lifespan the antigenspecific bcell would require the combination of a foreign protein antigen thus eliciting antigenspecific cd4 tcell help with a highly repetitive antigenic structure to trigger capping of the bcr and presumably stronger signal transduction in the responding b cell a virus particle provides an example of this form of repetitive antigen that would induce b cells to proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells with an increased lifespan the underlying theory is that highly repetitive foreign antigens are associated with the presence of a microbial infection and that induction of a longterm antibody response to microbial antigens provides a selective advantage to the host because it will prevent reinfection in some cases for life 9 foreign proteins that are not repetitive may still be from an infectious agent eg tetanus toxin but as a general rule the programmed lifespan against these proteins would be more limited an alternative explanation for the differences observed in the duration of humoral immunity against viruses versus vaccine antigens such as tetanus and diphtheria 
table 1
 is that live infections may trigger an inflammatory microenvironment that provides better stimulation or programming than what might occur following vaccination with these particular nonreplicating antigens formulated in alum in this regard we have begun to examine the duration of immunity against another bacterial toxin pertussis toxin following natural infection with bordetella pertussis a gramnegative bacterium preliminary results indicate that the duration of immunity to the nonrepetitive pertussis toxin is similar to that observed for vaccineinduced immunity against tetanus and diphtheria antigens ij amanna and mk slifka unpublished data and suggests that microbial infection and tlr activation may not be sufficient for inducing a lifelong antibody response although these studies are only preliminary and more work needs to be done these data lead us to believe that the repetitive nature of the antigen in combination with tcell help is more critical than an inflammatory microenvironment in eliciting the most longlived antibody responsesthere are at least three reasons to limit the duration of an antibody response first the initial antibody response is often not classswitched and is typically of low affinity it would be unwise to make a longterm lowaffinity antibody response if the host is capable of mounting a better more specific antibody response after somatic mutation and affinity maturation interestingly when the antiapoptotic gene bclxl was overexpressed in transgenic mice the size or number of germinal centers was unchanged but antigenspecific antibody responses were mounted by a substantially higher proportion of lowaffinity ascs 68 this observation indicates an important role for selection and apoptosis in culling suboptimal b cells and antibodysecreting daughter cells from the longlived plasma cell pool second if the antigen is nonrepetitive then it might not be a microbial antigen or it might not be a protective surface antigen for instance mounting an antibody response to a highly repetitive glycoprotein on the surface of a virion is more likely to have neutralizing activity or other antiviral functions 69 and be more protective than mounting a longterm antibody response to a nonrepetitive viral protein such as a viral dna polymerase or rna polymerase it is clear that antibody responses to different human immunodeficiency virus hiv proteins will demonstrate dramatically different halflives 12 and it remains to be determined whether this is unique to hiv or whether there is a range of antibody halflives mounted against different components of a particular virus or other microbe in other model systems as well third since there is a finite amount of space in the bone marrow for sustaining plasma cell numbers it is important to modify the duration of the immune response and only direct lifelong immunity to the antigens that have the greatest likelihood of representing infectious agents this way the bone marrow compartment is not overly populated with plasma cells of limited protective value by allowing a range of plasma cell life spans to be developed the loss of some relatively shortlived plasma cells against lowpriority targets would allow more flexible space for the development and maintenance of new longlived plasma cells to new infectious agents one potential outcome of this model is that as we age and the bone marrow compartment accumulates longlived plasma cells it may be more difficult to induce a longlived antibody response to new antigens although only speculation it may be one of the explanations for the difficulty in effectively vaccinating elderly individuals and opens an interesting area of future investigationa common but largely unrecognized complication with measurements of humoral immunity is that the calculated duration of serum antibody responses can be dramatically altered by which time points are used to measure antigenspecific antibody kinetics 
fig 4
 for instance if serum antibody responses are measured during the first days or weeks after the peak of the response then antibody decay rates will often be in the order of 2040 days  suggesting induction of only a shortlived antibody response since many of the early ascs induced during vaccination or infection have a halflife of only a few days 70 71 72 73 the associated antibody response measured at early time points will be dictated largely by the lifespan of the immunoglobulin ig molecules themselves studies have shown that although human igg molecules have a halflife of approximately 17526 days 74 75 76 this differs among individuals and antibody halflife estimates of as high as 42 days 75 to as long as 80 days 77 have been observed under some circumstances this recognition indicates that when antibody responses are measured immediately after vaccination and are determined to be less than 34 weeks duration then the estimated lifespan of the surviving plasma cell populations will likely be skewed by the protein halflife of igg molecules and may not be indicative of the plasma cell halflife per se within a few months after vaccination or acute infection the rates of antibody decay will slow dramatically as the effects of free ig are removed from the circulation through igg catabolism 78 and antibody kinetics become more representative of the lifespan of the underlying plasma cell populations producing the antibody of interest 
fig 4
 interestingly even if one waits 12 years after vaccination or infection before measuring the duration of immunity it may still indicate an artificially short plasma cell lifespan previous studies have shown that antibody responses in humans do not reach steady state levels until approximately 23 years after infection or vaccination 79 80 which is also apparent in the representative subjects shown in 
fig 2
 for subject 1 the antibody responses to vzv tetanus diphtheria and vaccinia declined rapidly during the first 3 years after the serospike and then were maintained with a longer halflife with similar decay rates as that observed prior to the spike in antibody titers similar results were observed following tetanus and diphtheria vaccination of subject 2 antibody responses declined most rapidly during the 23 years following vaccination before stabilizing into more longlived maintenance of serum antibody titers thereafter there are a number of mechanisms that may explain these observations first it is possible that during the first 23 years following vaccination or infection the antibody response is maintained by a combination of memory bcelldependent mechanisms eg persisting antigen in the form of immune complexes on the surface of fdcs and memory bcellindependent mechanisms ie longlived plasma cells as antigen levels slowly decline the memory bcelldependent pathway would subside leaving only longlived plasma cells to remain and continue the production of antigenspecific serum antibodies plasma cell repopulation by persisting antigen and memory bcell stimulation may explain why plasma cells at 6 weeks postimmunization were only temporarily depleted by coblockade of leukocyte functionassociated antigen1 lfa1 and very late antigen4 vla4 whereas they remained depleted for up to 10 weeks when blockade of lfa1 and vla4 was accompanied by depletion of cd20 memory b cells 55 in addition it is likely that there is a combination of shortlived and longlived plasma cells that are generated during the course of a humoral immune response 70 71 72 73 81 over time the shortlived plasma cells will decline and this decline will eventually select for the plasma cells with the longest inherent lifespan unfortunately it is not always feasible to monitor antigenspecific antibody responses for multiple years after vaccination or infection and it will be very useful if mathematical models can be developed that accurately predict the duration of an antibody response based on the kinetics of the immune response measured at earlier time pointswe have found significant differences in the duration of immunity to different virus and vaccine antigens 
table 1
 and propose that the duration of immunity is dictated largely by the repetitive nature of the antigen and the availability of tcell help 
fig 3
 however these characteristics may not be the sole factors in determining how long an immune response will be maintained by a specific individual during our analysis of the onprc cohort we found one subject subject 4 in particular who mounted antibody responses of similar duration regardless of the antigen tested 1 with the exception of antiviral responses to ebv that showed no evidence of decline the antibody responses to the seven other virus and vaccine antigens declined with similar kinetics estimated halflife of 1431 years this finding was not due to general immune suppression or an inability to mount high antibody responses since this subject demonstrated normal levels of humoral immunity to each of the antigens in addition to demonstrating a strong anamnestic antibody response following booster smallpox vaccination however this person was largely incapable of mounting the lifelong antibody response that was observed among other subjects following acute viral infections such as measles mumps rubella or vaccinia 
table 1
 targeted genetic analysis of this individual and perhaps others if identified in future studies may provide clues into the complex cellular and molecular mechanisms that distinguish longterm humoral immunity from lifelong humoral immunitylonglived plasma cells are able to maintain antibody responses for extensive periods of time but the underlying molecular mechanisms that allow for such extended survival still remain unresolved the longevity of these bone marrowresident cells is all the more impressive considering the stress of continually producing 10 000 to 20 000 molecules of ig per second 82 83 84 85 current models of plasma cell longevity suggest that survival niches exist in the bone marrow that specifically support prolonged survival 86 for instance plasma cells migrate to specific locations such as the bone marrow through chemokine signaling eg cxcr4cxcl12 and are then supported through local molecular interactions eg lfa1vla4 adhesion or il5 il6 signaling etcdespite substantial evidence that antigenspecific plasma cells reside primarily in the bone marrow 60 61 many of the assumptions concerning molecular factors important for migration and survival are based on in vitro studies of isolated plasma cells few studies have focused on the in vivo effects of specific genetic deletions especially on established antibody responses for example il6 was determined to be an important survival factor for bone marrowderived plasma cells in vitro yet il6deficient mice show no longterm humoral defects after immunization with ovalbumin a prototypical tcelldependent antigen 87 this conclusion was supported by examining both ovalbuminspecific antibody levels as well as bone marrowderived ascs at 2021 weeks postimmunization similarly although newly formed plasma cells appear to be responsive to cxcl12 the ligand for cxcr4 for a short period of time following emigration from the spleen 88 the importance of cxcr4 in orchestrating and maintaining longterm antibody responses is less apparent initial results in a cxcr4 chimeric mouse model suggested a defect in plasma cell accumulation in the bone marrow at days 7 to 14 postimmunization 89 nevertheless a conditional blineagespecific cxcr4deficient model also showed early defects in bone marrow accumulation of plasma cells following a tcelldependent response to npklh day 9 postimmunization but the mice demonstrated no longterm defects in antibody levels antibody affinity maturation or plasma cell accumulation at 90 days postimmunization 90 this study indicates that these specific chemokines and cytokines are not absolutely required for plasma cell survival and illustrates the difficulty in dissecting individual mechanisms in a system wherein biological redundancy may be involveddespite the lack of clarity in terms of chemokine and cytokine requirements several important factors supporting plasma cell maintenance have been established blimp1 has long been known as a critical factor in terminal bcell differentiation with the ability to act as a master gene regulator by directing sequencespecific chromatin remodeling 91 through its downregulation of pax5 and upregulation of xbp1 among many other roles it is thought to simultaneously induce antibody secretion in plasma cells and initiate the unfoldedprotein response to deal with the stress of increased protein production 58 more recently blimp1 has been shown to have a direct effect upon established humoral immune responses by employing a conditional blimp1 knockout investigators demonstrated that a previously established tcelldependent antibody response to npklh decreased significantly over time when compared to controls following loss of blimp1 expression 92 the loss of plasma cell function was verified independently by adoptive transfer studies nevertheless while substantial progress has been made in determining the signals that induce blimp1 expression lps cpg oligonucleotides il2 il5 il6 il10 il21 etc 93 the in vivo signals that act directly on plasma cells remain undefinedanother set of important plasma cell maintenance factors have emerged recently among the tumor necrosis factor tnf family members baff bcellactivating factor of the tnf family and april a proliferationinducing ligand both of these proteins have the ability to bind the tnf receptors taci transmembrane activator and calcium modulator ligand interactor and bcma bcell maturation antigen with the additional interaction of baff binding exclusively to the baff receptor baffr 94 the baff system is a well known survival and maturation network involved in peripheral bcell development but its role in plasma cell development has been less characterized due primarily to its upstream effects on normal bcell development however genetic deletion of bcma in mice demonstrated that defects in this receptor led to decreased maintenance of longlived plasma cells in response to a tcelldependent antigen 95 despite antibody responses that appeared normal during the first 2 weeks of the immune response this finding indicates that bcma was not required for induction of a normal antibody response but was essential for its maintenance additional data implicating baff andor april in plasma cell maintenance has recently been described utilizing in vivo blockade with soluble versions of the baff receptor and taci which blocks both baff and april 96 in these experiments mice were immunized with a tcelldependent antigen rested for 3 months and then subjected to in vivo blockade of baff or april signaling the blockade of either individual protein had no effect but the simultaneous blockade of both baff and april together led to a significant decrease in antigenspecific plasma cells strongly indicating a redundant and supportive role for both molecules in the longterm survival of antigenspecific plasma cells similar results were observed following in vivo blockade of the adhesion molecules lfa1 and vla4 55although the studies of blimp1 baffapril and lfa1vla4 have yielded substantial insight into the molecular mechanisms that directly effect plasma cell maintenance questions still remain as to why some populations of plasma cells are more longlived than others two independent studies have shown that longlived antibody responses against protein antigens eg tetanus or diphtheria range with halflives of about 1020 years whereas responses against acute viral infections show little to no decline 1 12 one possibility is that the longterm fate of each plasma cell is imprinted at the time of activation perhaps related to bcr crosslinking 
fig 3
 this is an important biological mechanism because it could be detrimental to the host if all antibody responses especially low affinity responses or antibody responses crossreactive to self antigens were longlived perhaps the additional bcr crosslinking afforded by repetitive tcelldependent epitopes such as viral particles enhances the downstream molecular mechanisms required for longterm survival additional signals delivered to the bcell at the time of activation could also play key roles in downstream longevity for instance mice deficient in the adapter protein sap slamassociated protein can initially mount normal levels of antibody but longterm antibody maintenance is greatly impaired 97 adoptive transfer experiments demonstrated that the defect was tcell intrinsic because sapdeficient b cells mounted normal antibody responses in a normal host whereas wildtype b cells could not mount longterm antibody responses if tcell help came from sapdeficient t cells more recent studies 98 have shown that sapdeficient t cells are suboptimal at forming longlived bcelltcell conjugates in vivo and it is presumed that such brief celltocell interactions result in poor tcell help this may explain why antibody responses in sapdeficient animals appear to mimic the kinetics and duration of tcellindependent responses t cells however are unlikely to be needed for longterm plasma cell maintenance since established longterm antibody responses can be maintained even in the absence of t cells 38 or after tcell memory has declined 13 while progress has been made in dissecting the factors associated with development and maintenance of plasma cells a stepwise roadmap of the signals that are necessary for this process remains to be determinedthe cloaca maxima the biggest sewer in rome had enough capacity to serve a city of 1 million people this sewer and others like it simply collected wastes and discharged them into the nearest lake river or ocean this made cities more habitable but its success depended on transferring the pollution problem from one place to another although this worked reasonably well for the romans it does not work well today current population densities are too high to permit a simple dependence on transference thus modern-day sewage is treated before it is discharged into the environment in the latter part of the nineteenth century the design of sewage systems allowed collection with treatment to lessen the impact on natural waters today more than 15000 wastewater treatment plants treat approximately 150 billion liters of wastewater per day in the united states alone in addition septic tanks which were also introduced at the end of the nineteenth century serve approximately 25 of the us population largely in rural areasdomestic wastewater is primarily a combination of human feces urine and gray water gray water results from washing bathing and meal preparation water from various industries and businesses may also enter the system people excrete 100500 grams wet weight of feces and 113 liters of urine per person per day bitton 2005 major organic and inorganic constituents of untreated domestic sewage are shown in table 241

chemical oxygen demand cod is the amount of oxygen necessary to oxidize all of the organic carbon completely to co2 and h2o cod is measured by oxidation with potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 in the presence of sulfuric acid and silver and is expressed in milligrams per liter in general 1 g of carbohydrate or 1 g of protein is approximately equivalent to 1 g of cod normally the ratio bodcod is approximately 05 when this ratio falls below 03 it means that the sample contains large amounts of organic compounds that are not easily biodegradedanother method of measuring organic matter in water is the toc or total organic carbon test toc is determined by oxidation of the organic matter with heat and oxygen followed by measurement of the co2 liberated with an infrared analyzer both toc and cod represent the concentration of both biodegradable and nonbiodegradable organics in waterpathogenic microorganisms are almost always present in domestic wastewater table 242
 this is because large numbers of pathogenic microorganisms may be excreted by infected individuals both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals may excrete pathogens for example the concentration of rotavirus may be as high as 1010 virions per gram of stool or 1012 in 100 g of stool table 243
 infected individuals may excrete enteric pathogens for several weeks to months the concentration of enteric pathogens in raw wastewater varies depending on the followingthe incidence of the infection in the communitythe socioeconomic status of the populationthe time of yearthe per-capita water consumption

the peak incidence of many enteric infections is seasonal in temperate climates thus the highest incidence of enterovirus infection is during the late summer and early fall rotavirus infections tend to peak in the early winter and cryptosporidium infections peak in the early spring and fall the reason for the seasonality of enteric infections is not completely understood but several factors may play a role it may be associated with the survival of different agents in the environment during the different seasons giardia for example can survive winter temperatures very well alternatively excretion differences among animal reservoirs may be involved as is the case with cryptosporidium finally it may well be that greater exposure to contaminated water as in swimming is the explanation for increased incidence in the summer monthsconcentrations of enteric pathogens are much greater in sewage in the developing world than the industrialized world for example the average concentration of enteric viruses in sewage in the united states has been estimated to be 103 per liter table 244
 whereas concentrations as high as 105 per liter have been observed in africa and asia
primary treatment is the first step in municipal sewage treatment and it involves physically separating large solids from the waste stream as raw sewage enters the treatment plant it passes through a metal grating that removes large debris such as branches and tires fig 244
 a moving screen then filters out smaller items such as diapers and bottles fig 245
 after which a brief residence in a grit tank allows sand and gravel to settle out the waste stream is then pumped into the primary settling tank also known as a sedimentation tank or clarifier where about half the suspended organic solids settle to the bottom as sludge fig 246
 the resulting sludge is referred to as primary sludge microbial pathogens are not effectively removed from the effluent in the primary process although some removal occursin modern wastewater treatment plants the trickling filter is composed of plastic units fig 249
 in older plants or in developing countries the filter is simply a bed of stones or corrugated plastic sheets through which wastewater drips see fig 247 this is one of the earliest systems introduced for biological waste treatment the effluent is pumped through an overhead sprayer onto the filter bed where bacteria and other microorganisms have formed a biofilm on the filter surfaces these microorganisms intercept the organic material as it trickles past and decompose it aerobicallythe media used in trickling filters may be stones ceramic material hard coal or plastic media plastic media of polyvinyl chloride pvc or polypropylene are used today in high-rate trickling filters as the organic matter passes through the trickling filter it is converted to microbial biomass which forms a thick biofilm on the filter medium the biofilm that forms on the surface of the filter medium is called a zooleal film it is composed of bacteria fungi algae and protozoa over time the increase in biofilm thickness leads to limited oxygen diffusion to the deeper layers of the biofilm creating an anaerobic environment near the filter medium surface as a result the organisms eventually slough from the surface and a new biofilm is formed bod removal by trickling filters is approximately 85 for low-rate filters us epa 1977 effluent from the trickling filter usually passes into a final clarifier to further separate solids from effluent fig 246
aeration-tank digestion is also known as the activated sludge process in the united states wastewater is most commonly treated by this process effluent from primary treatment is pumped into a tank and mixed with a bacteria-rich slurry known as activated sludge air or pure oxygen pumped through the mixture encourages bacterial growth and decomposition of the organic material the material then goes to a secondary settling tank where water is siphoned off the top of the tank and sludge is removed from the bottom some of the sludge is used as an inoculum for primary effluent the remainder of the sludge known as secondary sludge is removed this secondary sludge is added to primary sludge from primary treatment and subsequently indigenous anaerobic digestion occurs fig 246 the end product of this process is known as biosolids see section 248 the concentration of pathogens is reduced in the activated sludge process by antagonistic microorganisms as well as by adsorption to or incorporation in the secondary sludge
an important characteristic of the activated sludge process is the recycling of a large proportion of the biomass this results in a large number of microorganisms that oxidize organic matter in a relatively short time bitton 2005 the detention time in the aeration basin varies from four to eight hours the content of the aeration tank is referred to as the mixed-liquor suspended solids mlss the organic part of the mlss is called the mixed-liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss which is the nonmicrobial organic matter as well as dead and living microorganisms and cell debris the activated sludge process must be controlled to maintain a proper ratio of substrate organic load to microorganisms or food-to-microorganism ratio fm bitton 2005 this is expressed as bod per kilogram per day and is calculated aseq 243fmqbodmlssvwhere

 this system comprises a series of aerobic and anaerobic tanks in lieu of a single aeration tankmultisludge system fig 2410b carbonaceous oxidation nitrification and denitrification are carried out in three separate systems methanol or settled sewage serves as the source of carbon for denitrifiersbardenpho process fig 2411
 the process consists of two aerobic and two anoxic tanks followed by a sludge settling tank tank 1 is anoxic and is used for denitrification with wastewater used as a carbon source tank 2 is an aerobic tank utilized for both carbonaceous oxidation and nitrification the mixed liquor from this tank which contains nitrate is returned to tank 1 the anoxic tank 3 removes the nitrate remaining in the effluent by denitrification finally tank 4 is an aerobic tank used to strip the nitrogen gas that results from denitrification thus improving mixed-liquor settling
phosphorus can also be reduced by the activity of micro-organisms in modified activated sludge processes the process depends on the uptake of phosphorus by the microbes during the aerobic stage and subsequent release during the anaerobic stage two of several systems in use are as followsao anaerobicoxic process the ao process consists of a modified activated sludge system that includes an anaerobic zone detention time 051 h upstream of the conventional aeration tank detention time 13 h figure 2412
illustrates the microbiology of the ao process during the anaerobic phase inorganic phosphorus is released from the cells as a result of polyphosphate hydrolysis the energy liberated is used for the uptake of bod from wastewater removal efficiency is high when the bodphosphorus ratio exceeds 10 metcalf and eddy 2003 during the aerobic phase soluble phosphorus is taken up by bacteria which synthesize polyphosphates using the energy released from bod oxidationbardenpho process this system also removes nitrogen as well as phosphorus by a nitrificationdenitrification process fig 2411

tertiary treatment of effluent involves a series of additional steps after secondary treatment to further reduce organics turbidity nitrogen phosphorus metals and pathogens most processes involve some type of physicochemical treatment such as coagulation filtration activated carbon adsorption of organics reverse osmosis and additional disinfection tertiary treatment of wastewater is practiced for additional protection of wildlife after discharge into rivers or lakes even more commonly it is performed when the wastewater is to be reused for irrigation eg food crops golf courses for recreational purposes eg lakes estuaries or for drinking waterthere have been a number of reviews on the removal of pathogenic microorganisms by activated sludge and other wastewater treatment processes leong 1983 this information suggests that significant removal especially of enteric bacterial pathogens can be achieved by these processes table 245
 however disinfection andor advanced tertiary treatment are necessary for many reuse applications to ensure pathogen reduction current issues related to pathogen reduction are treatment plant reliability removal of new and emerging enteric pathogens of concern and the ability of new technologies to effect pathogen reduction wide variation in pathogen removal can result in significant numbers of pathogens passing through a process for various time periods the issue of reliability is of major importance if the reclaimed water is intended for recreational or potable reuse where short-term exposures to high levels of pathogens could result in significant risk to the exposed populationcompared with other biological treatment methods ie trickling filters activated sludge is relatively efficient in reducing the numbers of pathogens in raw wastewater both sedimentation and aeration play a role in pathogen reduction primary sedimentation is more effective for the removal of the larger pathogens such as helminth eggs but solid-associated bacteria and even viruses are also removed during aeration pathogens are inactivated by antagonistic microorganisms and by environmental factors such as temperature the greatest removal probably occurs by adsorption or entrapment of the organisms within the biological floc that forms the ability of activated sludge to remove viruses is related to the ability to remove solids this is because viruses tend to be solid associated and are subject to removal along with the floc activated sludge typically removes 90 of the enteric bacteria and 9099 of the enteroviruses and rotaviruses rao et al 1986 ninety percent of giardia and cryptosporidium can also be removed rose and carnahan 1992 being largely concentrated in the sludge because of their large size helminth eggs are effectively removed by sedimentation and are rarely found in sewage effluent in the united states although they may be detected in the sludge however although the removal of the enteric pathogens may seem large it is important to remember that initial concentrations are also large ie the concentration of all enteric viruses in 1 liter of raw sewage may be as high as 100000 in some parts of the world
tertiary treatment processes involving physicochemical processes can be effective in further reducing the concentration of pathogens and enhancing the effectiveness of disinfection processes by the removal of soluble and particulate organic matter table 246
 filtration is probably the most common tertiary treatment process mixed-media filtration is most effective in the reduction of protozoan parasites usually greater removal of giardia cysts occurs than of cryptosporidium oocysts because of the larger size of the cysts rose and carnahan 1992 removal of enteroviruses and indicator bacteria is usually 90 or less addition of coagulant can increase the removal of poliovirus to 99 us epa 1992acoagulation particularly with lime can result in significant reductions of pathogens the alkaline conditions ph 1112 that can be achieved with lime can result in significant inactivation of enteric viruses to achieve removals of 90 or greater the ph should be maintained above 11 for at least an hour leong 1983 inactivation of the viruses occurs by denaturation of the viral protein coat the use of iron and aluminum salts for coagulation can also result in 90 or greater reductions in enteric viruses the degree of effectiveness of these processes as in other solids separating processes is highly dependent on the hydraulic design and in particular coagulation and flocculation the degree of removal observed in bench-scale tests may not approach those seen in full-scale plants where the process is more dynamicreverse osmosis and ultrafiltration are also believed to result in significant reductions in enteric pathogens although few studies have been done in full-scale facilities removal of enteric viruses in excess of 999 can be achieved leong 1983in addition to nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus and microbial pathogens there are other constituents within sewage that need to be kept at low concentrations these include inorganics exemplified by metals and organic priority pollutants metals and organics are normally associated with the solid fraction of sewage and neither are significantly removed by sewage treatment however when point source control mechanisms are implemented to prevent industrial discharges the concentration of metals and organics within sewage can be significantly reduced in particular over the past 15 years in the united states this has resulted in decreased metal concentrations more recently there has been concern over the presence of pharmaceuticals such as endocrine disruptors in sewagethe next two sections discuss several alternatives to large-scale modern wastewater treatment process discussed in section 242 the first of these are sewage lagoons which are often referred to as oxidation or stabilization ponds these are the oldest of the wastewater treatment systems usually no more than a hectare in area and just a few meters deep oxidation ponds are natural stew pots where wastewater is detained while organic matter is degraded fig 2413
 a period of time ranging from one to four weeks and sometimes longer is necessary to complete the decomposition of organic matter light heat and settling of the solids can also effectively reduce the number of pathogens present in the wastewaterthe following four categories of oxidation ponds are often used in series
aerobic ponds fig 2414a
 which are naturally mixed must be shallow up to 15 m because they depend on penetration of light to stimulate algal growth that promotes subsequent oxygen generation the detention time of wastewater is generally 3 to 5 days
anaerobic ponds fig 2414b may be 1 to 10 m deep and require a relatively long detention time of 2050 days these ponds which do not require expensive mechanical aeration generate small amounts of sludge often anaerobic ponds serve as a pretreatment step for high-bod organic wastes rich in protein and fat eg meat wastes with a heavy concentration of suspended solids
facultative ponds fig 2415
 are most common for domestic waste treatment waste treatment is provided by both aerobic and anaerobic processes these ponds range in depth from 1 to 25 m and are subdivided in three layers an upper aerated zone a middle facultative zone and a lower anaerobic zone the detention time varies between five and 30 days
aerated lagoons or ponds fig 2416
 which are mechanically aerated may be 12 m deep and have a detention time of less than 10 days in general treatment depends on the aeration time and temperature as well as the type of wastewater for example at 20c an aeration period of five days results in 85 bod removal
because sewage lagoons require a minimum of technology and are relatively low in cost they are most common in developing countries and in small communities in the united states where land is available at reasonable prices however biodegradable organic matter and turbidity are not as effectively reduced as during activated sludge treatmentgiven sufficient retention times oxidation ponds can cause significant reductions in the concentrations of enteric pathogens especially helminth eggs for this reason they have been promoted widely in the developing world as a low-cost method of pathogen reduction for wastewater reuse for irrigation however a major drawback of ponds is the potential for short-circuiting because of thermal gradients even in multipond systems designed for long retention times ie 90 days even though the amount of short-circuiting may be small detectable levels of pathogens can often be found in the effluent from oxidation ponds
inactivation andor removal of pathogens in oxidation ponds is controlled by a number of factors including temperature sunlight ph bacteriophage predation by other microorganisms and adsorption to or entrapment by settleable solids indicator bacteria and pathogenic bacteria may be reduced by 9099 or more depending on retention timesuntil the middle of the twentieth century in the united states many rural families and quite a few residents of towns and small cities depended on pit toilets or outhouses for waste disposal in rural areas of developing countries these are still used these pit toilets however often allowed untreated wastes to seep into the groundwater allowing pathogens to contaminate drinking water supplies this risk to public health led to the development of septic tanks and properly constructed drain fields primarily septic tanks serve as repositories where solids are separated from incoming wastewater and biological digestion of the waste organic matter can take place under anaerobic conditions in 1997 25 of the homes in the united states depended on septic tanks approximately 33 of all new homes constructed use septic tanks most septic tanks are located in the eastern united states fig 2417
 in a typical septic tank system fig 2418
 the wastewater and sewage enter a tank made of concrete metal or fiberglass there grease and oils rise to the top as scum and solids settle to the bottom the wastewater and sewage then undergo anaerobic bacterial decomposition resulting in the production of a sludge the wastewater usually remains in the septic tank for just 2472 h after which it is channeled out to a drain field this drain field or leach field is composed of small perforated pipes that are embedded in gravel below the surface of the soil periodically the residual sludge in the septic tank known as septage is pumped out into a tank truck and taken to a treatment plant for disposalalthough the concentration of contaminants in septic tank septage is typically much greater than that found in domestic wastewater table 247
 septic tanks can be an effective method of waste disposal where land is available and population densities are not too high thus they are widely used in rural and suburban areas as suburban population densities increase however groundwater and surface water pollution may arise indicating a need to shift to a commercial municipal sewage system in fact private septic systems are sometimes banned in many suburban areas moreover septic tanks are not appropriate for every area of the country they do not work well for example in cold rainy climates where the drain field may be too wet for proper evaporation or in areas where the water table is shallow high densities of septic tanks can also be responsible for nitrate contamination of groundwater finally most of the waterborne disease outbreaks associated with groundwater in the united states are thought to result from contamination by septic tanksalthough treated domestic wastewater is usually discharged into bodies of water it may also be disposed of via land application for crop irrigation or as a means of additional treatment and disposal the three basic methods used in the application of sewage effluents to land include low-rate irrigation overland flow and high-rate infiltration characteristics of each of these are listed in table 248
 the choice of a given method depends on the conditions prevailing at the site under consideration loading rates methods of irrigation crops and expected treatment
with low-rate irrigation fig 2419a
 sewage effluents are applied by sprinkling or by surface application at a rate of 15 to 10 cm per week two-thirds of the water is taken up by crops or lost by evaporation and the remainder percolates through the soil matrix the system must be designed to maximize denitrification in order to avoid pollution of groundwater by nitrates phosphorus is immobilized within the soil matrix by fixation or precipitation the irrigation method is used primarily by small communities and requires large areas generally on the order of 56 hectares per 1000 people
in the overland flow method fig 2419b wastewater effluents are allowed to flow for a distance of 50100 m along a 28 vegetated slope and are collected in a ditch the loading rate of wastewater ranges from 5 to 14 cm a week only about 10 of the water percolates through the soil compared with 60 that runs off into the ditch the remainder is lost as evapotranspiration this system requires clay soils with low permeability and infiltrationhigh-rate infiltration treatment is also known as soil aquifer treatment sat or rapid infiltration extraction rix fig 2419c the primary objective of sat is the treatment of wastewater at loading rates exceeding 50 cm per week the treated water most of which has percolated through coarse-textured soil is used for groundwater recharge or may be recovered for irrigation this system requires less land than irrigation or overland flow methods drying periods are often necessary to aerate the soil system and avoid problems due to clogging the selection of a site for land application is based on many factors including soil types drainage and depth distance to groundwater groundwater movement slope underground formations and degree of isolation of the site from the publicinherent in land application of wastewater are the risks of transmission of enteric waterborne pathogens the degree of risk is associated with the concentration of pathogens in the wastewater and the degree of contact with humans land application of wastewater is usually considered an intentional form of reuse and is regulated by most states because of limited water resources in the western united states reuse is considered essential usually stricter treatment and microbial standards must be met before land application the highest degree of treatment is required when wastewater will be used for food crop irrigation with lesser treatment for landscape irrigation or fiber crops for example the state of california requires no disinfection of wastewater for irrigation and no limits on coliform bacteria however if the reclaimed wastewater is used for surface irrigation of food crops and open landscaped areas chemical coagulation to precipitate suspended matter followed by filtration and disinfection to reduce the coliform concentration to 22100 ml is required in some cities excess effluent is disposed of in riverbeds that are normally dry such disposal can create riparian areas fig 2420
because high-rate infiltration may be practiced to recharge aquifers additional treatments of secondary wastewater may be required however as some removal of pathogens can be expected treatment requirements may be less the degree of treatment needed may be influenced by the amount or time it takes the reclaimed water to travel from the infiltration site to the point of extraction and the depth of the unsaturated zone the greatest concern has been with the transport of viruses which because of their small size have the greatest chance of traveling large distances within the subsurface factors that influence the transport of viruses are discussed in chapter 19 generally several meters of moderately fine-textured continuous soil is necessary for virus reductions of 999 or more yates 1994wetlands which are typically less than 1 m in depth are areas that support aquatic vegetation and foster the growth of emergent plants such as cattails bulrushes reeds sedges and trees they also provide important wetland habitat for many animal species wetland areas have been receiving increasing attention as a means of additional treatment for secondary effluents the vegetation provides surfaces for the attachment of bacteria and aids in the filtration and removal of such wastewater contaminants as biological oxygen and excess carbon factors involved in the reduction of wastewater contaminants are shown in table 249
 although both natural and constructed wetlands have been used for wastewater treatment recent work has focused on constructed wetlands because of regulatory requirements two types of constructed wetland systems are in general use 1 free water surface fws systems and 2 subsurface flow systems sfs an fws wetland is similar to a natural marsh because the water surface is exposed to the atmosphere floating and submerged plants such as those shown in figure 2421a
 may be present sfs consist of channels or trenches with relatively impermeable bottoms filled with sand or rock media to support emergent vegetationduring wetland treatment the wastewater is usable it can for instance be used to grow aquatic plants such as water hyacinths fig 2421b andor to raise fish for human consumption the growth of such aquatic plants provides not only additional treatment for the water but also a food source for fish and other animals such aquaculture systems however tend to require a great deal of land area moreover the health risk associated with the production of aquatic animals for human consumption in this manner must be better definedthere has been increasing interest in the use of natural systems for the treatment of municipal wastewater as a form of tertiary treatment kadlec and knight 1996 artificial or constructed wetlands have a higher degree of biological activity than most ecosystems thus transformation of pollutants into harmless by-products or essential nutrients for plant growth can take place at a rate that is useful for the treatment of municipal wastewater case study 241
 most artificial wetlands in the united states use reeds or bulrushes although floating aquatic plants such as water hyacinths and duckweed have also been used to reduce potential problems with flying insects subsurface flow wetlands have also been built fig 2424
 in these types of wetlands all of the flow of the wastewater is below the surface of a gravel bed containing plants tolerant of water-saturated soils most of the existing information on the performance of these wetlands concerns coliform and fecal coliform bacteria kadlec and knight 1996 have summarized the existing literature on this topic they point out that natural sources of indicators in treatment wetlands never reach zero because wetlands are open to wildlife reductions in fecal coliforms are generally greater than 99 but there is a great deal of variation probably depending on the season type of wetland numbers and type of wildlife and retention time in the wetland volume-based and area-based bacterial die-off models have been used to estimate bacterial die-off in surface flow wetlands kadlec and knight 1996case study 241sweetwater wetlands infiltrationextraction facility in tucson arizonatucson arizona is located in the sonoran desert in the southwestern united states because of limited water supplies reclamation of wastewater is critical to meet water needs in the region a system was built to provide tertiary effluents derived from an activated sludgetrickling filter system of sufficient quality to be used for landscape irrigation the system is composed of several components that allows for various treatments and storage of tertiary effluent figure 2423 a tertiary treatment plant filters the secondary effluent to reduce turbidity and microorganisms and provides additional disinfection the backwash from the filters is then discharged into an artificial wetland for treatment when the water exits the wetland it is discharged into infiltration basins where it is further treated in times of low reclaimed water demand winter the tertiary effluent may be discharged directly into the infiltration basins the subsurface aquifer is then used as a storage facility the water being pumped to the surface extraction when needed during periods of peak demandthe multiple barriers of conventional and natural technologies are designed to enhance the removal of chemical and microbial contaminants filtration of the secondary wastewater during tertiary treatment allows for reduction of the larger protozoan parasites which are more resistant to disinfection than enteric bacteria and viruses and more effective disinfection in the wetlands protozoan parasites settle out and bacteria and viruses are reduced by inactivation by sunlight uv light and microbial antagonism infiltration of the water through the soil results in further removal of pathogens by filtration and adsorption to soil particles especially viruses
in one study of a mixed-species surface flow wetland with a detention time of approximately four days several other types of microorganisms were examined results showed that cryptosporidium was reduced by 53 giardia by 58 and enteric viruses by 98 karpiscak et al 1996
aerobic digestion consists of adding air or oxygen to sludge in a 4- to 8-foot-deep open tank the oxygen concentration within the tank must be maintained above 1 mgl to avoid the production of foul odors the mean residence time in the tank is 1260 days depending on the tank temperature during this process microbes aerobically degrade organic substrate reducing the volatile solids content of the sludge by 4050 us epa 1992b digestion temperatures are frequently moderate or mesophilic 3040c by increasing the oxygen content thermophilic digestion can be induced 60c by increasing the temperature and the retention time the degree of pathogen inactivation can be enhanced pathogen concentrations ultimately determine the treatment level of the product class b biosolids can contain many human pathogens see section 2481 class a biosolids which result from more stringent and enhanced treatment contain very low or nondetectable levels of pathogens the degree of treatment class a versus class b has important implications on the reuse potential of the material for land application see section 248 aerobic digestion generally results in the production of class b biosolidsanaerobic microbial digestion occurs under low redox conditions with low oxygen concentrations carbon dioxide is a major terminal electron acceptor used chapter 3 and results in the conversion of organic substrate to methane and carbon dioxide this process reduces the volatile solids by 3560 bitton 2005 and results in the production of class b biosolids the advantages and disadvantages of anaerobic digestion relative to aerobic digestion are shown in information box 241

composting consists of mixing sludge with a bulking agent that normally has a high cn ratio fig 2425
 this is necessary because of the low cn ratio of the sludge the mixtures are normally kept moist but aerobic these conditions result in very high microbial activity and the generation of heat that increases the temperature of the composting material factors affecting the composting process are shown in information box 242
 there are three main types of composting systemsthe aerated static pile process typically consists of mixing dewatered digested sludge with wood chips fig 2426
 aeration of the pile is normally provided by blowers during a 21-day composting period during this active composting period temperatures increase to the mesophilic range 2040c where microbial degradation occurs via bacteria and fungi temperatures subsequently increase to 4080c with microbial populations dominated by thermophilic heat-tolerant and spore-forming organisms these high temperatures inactivate pathogenic microorganisms and frequently result in a class a biosolid product subsequently the compost is cured for at least 30 days during which time temperatures within the pile decrease to ambient levelsthe windrow process is similar to the static pile process except that instead of a pile the sludge and bulking agent are laid out in long rows of dimensions 2 m  3 m  80 m fig 2427
 aeration for windrows is provided by turning the windrows several times a week once again if the composting process is efficient class a biosolids are producedin enclosed systems the composting is conducted in steel vessels 1015 m high by 34 m diameter for this type of composting aeration via blowers and temperature of the composting are carefully controlled this results in a high quality class a compost with little or no odor problems however costs of enclosed systems are higher
information box 242factors affecting efficient composting
temperature adequate aeration and moisture must be maintained to ensure temperatures reach 60c to inactivate microbial pathogens
aeration air must be provided via blowers or by turning
moisture conditions must be neither too moist which promotes anaerobic activity nor too dry which limits microbial activity
cn ratio the cn ratio of the substrate should be maintained around 251 to ensure adequate but not excessive amounts of nitrogen for the microbes
surface area of bulking agent shredded material should be used to increase substrate surface area for microbial metabolism 2009 2009since january 2020 elsevier has created a covid-19 resource centre with free information in english and mandarin on the novel coronavirus covid-19 the covid-19 resource centre is hosted on elsevier connect the companys public news and information website elsevier hereby grants permission to make all its covid-19-related research that is available on the covid-19 resource centre - including this research content - immediately available in pubmed central and other publicly funded repositories such as the who covid database with rights for unrestricted research re-use and analyses in any form or by any means with acknowledgement of the original source these permissions are granted for free by elsevier for as long as the covid-19 resource centre remains activesource pepper gerba and brusseau 2006lime stabilization involves the addition of lime as caoh2 or cao such that the ph of digested sludge is equal to or greater than 12 for at least 2 h liming is very effective at inactivating bacterial and viral pathogens but less so for parasites bitton 2005 lime stabilization also reduces odors and can result in a class a biosolid productheat treatment involves heating sludge under pressure to temperatures up to 260c for 30 minutes this process kills microbial pathogens and parasites and also further dewaters the sludgebiosolids are divided into two classes on the basis of pathogen content class a and class b information box 244

brooks et al 2006 evaluated the incidence of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb in biosolids and a variety of other environmental samples and foodstuffs table 2410
shows that class b biosolids did not contain unusually high numbers of arb in fact the relative incidence was less than that found in pristine soil interestingly arb concentrations were also lower than those found in common foodstuffs such as lettuce therefore food itself could be an important route of exposure to arb gene transfer events in soil are thought to be relatively infrequent without selective pressure neilson et al 1994 which reduces the risk of antibiotic resistance gene transfer to human pathogenic bacteria finally note that soil itself is the original source of human antibioticsendotoxin or lipopolysaccharide lps derived from the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria is a highly immunogenic molecule present ubiquitously in the environment fig 51 michel 2003 although most surfaces contain some traces of dust-associated endotoxin it is primarily of concern as an aerosol since most human endotoxin ailments are pulmonary associated sharif et al 2004 exposures to aerosolized endotoxin have been studied regarding occupational exposures to cotton dust composting plants and feed houses castellan et al 1987 exposures to levels of endotoxin as low as 02 endotoxin unit eu per cubic meter derived from poultry dust have been found to cause acute pulmonary ailments such as decreases in forced expiratory volume donham et al 2000 chronic effects such as asthma and chronic bronchitis have been found to be due to exposures of endotoxin from cotton dust as little as 10 eum3 on a daily basis olenchock 2001endotoxin concentrations in a variety of environmental samples were investigated by brooks et al 2006 who showed that the endotoxin level in class b biosolids is similar in magnitude to that of other wastes including animal manures and compost for example swine barns were found to have mean concentrations of endotoxin of 4385 eum3 duchaine et al 2001 while composting plants ranged from 10 to 400 eum3 clark et al 1983 since the relevance of endotoxin to human health is via inhalation the potential for aerosolization of endotoxin during land application of biosolids has also recently caused concern one study shows that endotoxin values measured during biosolids application are comparable to those found in untreated agricultural soils table 2411
 therefore aerosolization of soil particles can result in endotoxin aerosolization regardless of whether biosolids are involved brooks et al 2006 this is not surprising since bacterial concentrations in soil routinely exceed 108 per gram with a majority of bacteria being gram negative soil particles containing sorbed microbes can be aerosolized and hence act as a source of endotoxinwhat levels of endotoxin are considered safe it has been suggested that no more than a maximum air concentration of 1000 eum3 should be considered safe until additional studies have been conducted rylander et al 1983 most of the samples from wastewater treatment plants land application of biosolids and composting sites contain endotoxin levels less than this maximum concentration further it can be noted that despite the presence of endotoxin within these operations there is no evidence linking residential impact to these operations this is likely because beyond these site boundaries endotoxin levels drop quickly to background concentrationsconcern about prions has arisen with the advent of prion animal diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse in the united kingdom and other parts of europe the bse prions concentrate in an animals brain and spinal cord but they have been detected only in sheep blood at low concentrations animal manure would have no or low concentrations of bse prions except possibly for wastes from slaughterhouses ward et al 1984 however the presence of prions in such wastes is uncertain epa 2001 prions are generally transmitted from animal to animal cow to cow sheep to sheep the risk of prion transmission to biosolids from animals is low but can increase with the presence of small amounts of neural tissues or placenta coming from slaughterhouses at present there has been little evidence of prion-contaminated manures in the united statesprions are very difficult to inactivate and require rigorous treatment godfree 2001 the higher the solids content of the waste the more rigorous the treatment required epa 2001 prions are resistant to high temperatures scrapie prions are inactivated at temperatures of 100c or above at 121c only 001 of the prions were resistant to thermal inactivation rohwer 1984 kirchmayr et al 2006 demonstrated that prions in spiked anaerobic sludge survived incubation at mesophilic 35c temperatures but were reduced at thermophilic 55c temperatures when added to soil prions bind strongly rigou et al 2006what are the risks from pathogens in biosolids this is not an easy question to answer partly because there are many different types of pathogens and partly because each environment that biosolids are incorporated into is different that said class b biosolids routinely contain human pathogens principal pathogens of concern in biosolids are identified in chapter 26 the pathogens found in a particular source of biosolids reflect the incidence of disease in the community from which the biosolids are derived pepper et al 2006
little is currently known about emerging pathogens such as the sars virus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome in biosolids however regardless of the pathogen of concern the major routes of potential human exposure to pathogens in biosolids remain the same specifically via air soil and water exposure can also occur via vectors such as flies and to prevent this so-called vector-attraction reduction requirements are enforced nrc 2002 these involve specific biosolid treatment and rapid incorporation of land applied biosolids 6 hhuman exposure to pathogens via air results from the formation of aerosolized biological particles that are referred to as bioaerosols until relatively recently little was known of the risk of infection from bioaerosols generated during land application of biosolids and this topic was utilized by environmental activists to challenge the efficacy of land application national studies across the united states however have demonstrated that the risk is lower than previously thought brooks et al 2005 see also chapter 5in principle pathogens originally present in biosolids applied to land can contaminate surface or groundwater however most soils limit the movement of microbes to groundwater normally significant migration will only occur in coarse textured soils or karst topography with a shallow depth to groundwater viruses have the greater possibility to migrate through soil however they have been found to tightly bind to biosolids and little leaching appears to occur no direct cause and effect has been identified in surface or groundwater near land where biosolids has been applied pathogen survival in and transport through soil are considered together in this section human pathogens that are routinely found in domestic sewage sludge include viruses bacteria protozoan parasites and helminths of those pathogens viruses are the smallest and least complex generally have a short survival period in soil and have the greatest potential for transport in soil survival of viruses has been shown to be temperature-dependent and decreases as temperature increases soil type affects virus survival with longer survival occurring on clay loam biosolids-amended soils than on sandy loam biosolids-amended soil rapid loss of soil moisture also limits virus survivallike virus survival bacterial survival in soil is affected by temperature ph and moisture soil nutrient availability also plays a role for bacteria as do a neutral soil ph and soil at field capacity of the pathogenic bacteria salmonella and escherichia coli can survive for a long time in biosolids-amended soilup to 16 months for salmonella in contrast shigella has a shorter survival time than either salmonella or e coli studies on indicator organisms have shown that total and fecal coliforms as well as fecal streptococci can all survive for weeks to several months depending on soil moisture and temperature conditions pepper et al 1993regrowth an increase in numbers of pathogens is also important when evaluating the survival of pathogenic and indicator bacteria in soil and biosolids compost salmonella e coli and fecal coliforms are all capable of regrowth following land application of biosolids regrowth of actual pathogens is negligible zaleski et al 2005a however regrowth of salmonella can occur in class a biosolids if they are stored prior to land application and exposed to reinoculation via bird or other animal excrement zaleski et al 2005b regrowth has also occurred after composting processes regrowth of fecal coliforms is more common than pathogens and has been documented following land application of class b biosolids pepper et al 1993 regrowth of salmonella in class a biosolids has been shown to occur under anaerobic conditions castro-del campo et al 2007the protozoan parasites often associated with biosolids include giardia and cryptosporidium spp however little research has been conducted on the survival of these parasites in biosolids-amended soil helminths are perhaps the most persistent of enteric pathogens ascaris eggs can survive several years in soilsthe transport of microorganisms through soils or the vadose zone is affected by a complex array of abiotic and biotic factors including adhesion processes filtration effects physiological state of the cells soil characteristics water flow rates predation and intrinsic mobility of the cells as well as the presence of biosolids for viruses the potential for transport is large although viruses can adsorb to soil colloidal particles and to the biosolids themselves thus limiting transport virus sorption is controlled by the soil ph most viruses are negatively charged isoelectric point 36 so that at a neutral soil ph soil sorption is reduced whereas at more acidic soil ph values the viruses are positively charged increasing sorption
the larger size of bacteria means that soil acts as a filter limiting bacterial transport soil would also limit the transport of the even larger protozoa and helminths however microorganisms may be transported through soil cracks and macrochannels via preferential flowpathogen survival and transport in soil should be evaluated from a public health perspective pathogens are routinely present in class b biosolids and are capable of surviving for days weeks or even months depending on the organism and environment therefore site restrictions with duration based on subsequent land use are necessary following land application for many soils contamination of aquifers due to vertical migration of pathogens from land-applied biosolids is unlikely because of the sorption of viruses and the soil filtration potential for larger pathogens in coarse textured sandy soil or high-permeability karst topography however groundwater contamination events are possibleanimal wastes predominantly include manures from cows pigs and chickens animal wastes are pollutants of increasing concern both to the public and to regulatory bodies because they have the potential to contaminate both surface and groundwater animal agricultural wastes can be divided into two production types range and pasture production and confined or concentrated animal productionin range and pasture systems the concentration of wastes is generally much more diffuse or dispersed than it is when large numbers of animals are confined to relatively small areas range and pasture systems have two principal effects on surface water quality 1 increased turbidity through the movement of soil particles into streams rivers and lakes and 2 increased fecal coliform counts in areas of heavy animal usein the past animals were concentrated only intermittently the period of confinement was a transitory phase followed by a return to pasture after such management activities as milking or shearing however animal production is occurring in increasingly controlled environments owing to the success of efforts to raise productivity and diminish climatic feeding and mortality variables larger numbers of animals are being raised in concentrated animal feeding operations or cafosprincipally feedlots dairies swine operations poultry houses and intensive aquaculture the number of cafos more than doubled from 1982 to 1997 increasing from 5000 to 11200 almost every county in the united states has a cafo with more than 10000 animals this shift in production methods has changed the age-old method of reincorporation of animal wastes as manure on the farm where it was produced specialization has largely divorced animal production from the production of crops a concentrated animal facility may be located far from crop production and the same family or the same corporation may not pursue the two types of production the production of large numbers of animals on a small land base has resulted in the stockpiling of wastes at specific locations the construction of large waste-storage ponds and oftentimes waste applications to land in excess of agronomic crop needsmore than 150 microbial pathogens have been identified from all animal species that can be transmitted to man gerba and smith 2005 pathogens can be transmitted from animals to humans when manure is used as a fertilizer for food crops eaten raw and by storm water runoff from manured areas or by percolation to groundwater pathogens commonly associated with produce and surface water contamination include escherichia coli o157h7 campylobacter salmonella listeria monocytogenes and cryptosporidium parvum manure should be composted to effectively eliminate pathogens and applied appropriately to minimize contamination

the mucosal surfaces of respiratory tract provide optimal conditions for efficient gaseous exchange and unfortunately an ideal portal of entry for innocuous environmental antigen and human pathogens consequently the bodys respiratory mucosal surfaces contain a complex array of immune regulatory mechanisms that ensures at least in healthy individuals a quiescent and noninflammatory environment that maintains optimal tissue function 1 2 3 however once a pathogen establishes an infection or the regulatory mechanisms fail a rapid cascade of event leads to the production of inflammatory cytokines that recruit immune cells in an attempt to eradicate the ensuing pathogenantigenic stimuli while minimizing the impact on physiological function of the tissue however this ideal conclusion often does not occur as many human pathogens have evolved virulence and immune modulatory mechanisms that circumvent and disrupt mucosal immune responses resulting in tissue pathology clinical disease and possible longterm sequelaeto help minimize the detrimental impact of respiratory infections vaccines were developed against many of the most prevalent respiratory pathogens including bordatella pertussis whooping cough corynebacterium diphtheriae diptheria haemophilus influenzae type b hib and streptococcus pneumoniae pneumococcal pneumonia and otitis media successfully reducing infant mortality and the burden of infectious diseases worldwide 4 5 6 yet despite the continued success and widespread use of respiratory pathogen vaccines mycobacterium tuberculosis tb and a multitude of respiratory viral infections continue to cause significant morbidity and result in millions of futile deaths each year 7 8 9 world health organization who 2004 global burden of disease influenza virus alone causes seasonal epidemics that can affect 1020 of the global population 10 recent estimates suggest that seasonal influenza viral infections are responsible for 250000500000 deaths annually which can increase during pandemics caused by the emergence of a novel reassortment viral strain who 2004 global burden of disease furthermore the increasing number of deaths attributed to human transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza strains h5n1 will elevate influenza virus associated morbidity and mortality 11 in addition to influenza virus parainfluenza virus respiratory syncytial virus rsv metapneumonia virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sarscov rhinovirus measles and adenovirus are endemic within the human population and can establish acute respiratory tract infection 11 12 13 14 with a few exceptions existing approaches have failed to develop effective vaccines against these viral pathogens ominously the public health impact of respiratory infections is likely to increase in the near future due to aging global populations increasing antibiotic resistance in the case of tb and pneumococcus and altering social attitudes toward vaccination 14 15 16 moreover the continuing emergence of novel respiratory viruses through antigenic recombination events and zoonosis such as the 2009 h1n1 influenza a virus strain highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses sars coronavirus and human cases of monkeypox 11 17 18 taken together with the continued concern of bioterrorism anthrax and smallpox 19 20 adds to the urgent need to better understand the pathogenesis of respiratory viruses and mechanisms of protectionthis review discusses the rationale for developing cd8 tcell vaccines against existing and emerging human respiratory viruses and then reviews our current understanding of antigenspecific cd8 tcell induction and memory formation in the context of respiratory viral infections the argument will be made that applying this knowledge will be critical in future success of cd8 tcell vaccines then we examine how attenuated poxviruses have been developed over the past three decades as candidate vaccines for a variety of mucosal pathogens and discuss how future efforts should focus on understanding in molecular terms why live nonattenuated vaccines result in better cd8 tcell immunity in the final section we discuss how members of tumor necrosis factor receptor tnfrtnf superfamily specifically ox40 cd134 and its binding partner ox40l cd252 are rapidly emerging as key players in the development of protective cd8 tcell memory in lung as such it will become evident that we already have the means to develop a poxvirusbased vaccine delivery system that establishes far better protective cd8 tcell immunity in the lung than anything currently availablemost if not all of todays licensed vaccines work by promoting a robust and longlived immunoglobulin response that prevents initial pathogen infection and ensuing replication resulting in pathogen clearance before the onset of any clinical symptoms apparently this straightforward approach of safely generating neutralizing immunoglobulin via the injection of killed subunit or highly attenuated agents has resulted in many successful vaccines that confer lifelong protective immunity 6 however in the context of highly pathogenic or rapidly mutating viruses that target mucosal surfaces such as the respiratory tract this approach has proven far less successful 6 21 the limitations of generating solely immunoglobulinmediated protection are highlighted by the necessity to annually develop a seasonal influenza vaccine the protective mechanism of current subunit or inactivated influenza vaccines is through the generation of neutralizing immunoglobulins against hemagglutinin ha and neuraminidase na two integral membrane viral proteins essential for infectivity although immunoglobulins against these surface proteins are longlived their functional relevance diminishes rapidly due to antigenic drift in both the ha and na surface glycoproteins 22 23 this continual antigen drift or evolution also explains in part the difficulty in developing an effective vaccine against other intracellular pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus hiv and malaria 6 both of these pathogens continually mutate in the case of hiv or alter in the case of the plasmodium parasite key surface antigens resulting in immunological escape from any inducedspecific immunoglobulin response this continued dilemma has led to the general acceptance that to develop effective vaccines against these types of intracellular pathogens a combination of immunoglobulin and a longlasting memory cd8 tcell response must be generated 24 25 26 this approach has the added benefit of producing crossprotective immunity mediated by cd8 t cells that recognize conserved internal components of the specific pathogens therefore conferring heterosubtypic immunity 27 this would be an ideal strategy in the context of a virus that rapidly mutated its external antigens while maintaining more conserved internal antigens strictly speaking cd8 t cells cannot afford protection against infection per se but can mediate faster viral clearance and provide a substantial degree of protection against challenge with a lethal dose of virus 14 toward this end the scientific community has focused enormous efforts on the development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines that can promote cd8 tcell responses with the assumption that such a strategy will enhance immunological protection through providing additional support to existing antiviral immunoglobulin response to date however the development of effective tcell vaccines against many respiratory viruses remains elusive in the past 10 years immunologists have provided vaccinologists with valuable information on the regulatory mechanisms that govern not only the efficient generation of cd8 tcell responses in the lung but also how different memory cd8 tcell subsets are maintained over time the current challenge is to apply this knowledge in our endeavors to develop safe and effective cd8 tcell vaccinesviruses are obligate intracellular parasites that upon gaining entry into a hostcell hijack the hosts transcription and protein synthesis machinery to generate progeny virions that initiate the next cycle of infection consequently the respiratory epithelium contains an array of virus detection systems such as tolllike receptors tlrs nodlike receptors nlrs and the cytosolic rna helicase family members retinoic acidinducible gene i rig i and melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 mda5 that act in concert to rapidly detect the presence of an invading virus 14 28 29 upon viral recognition a complex interplay between these distinct detection systems results in the activation of an array of transcription factors that culminates in the production of antiviral cytokines and inflammatory mediators 14 28 in addition to establishing a localized inflammatory environment and recruiting innate effector cells this initial antiviral inflammatory program is important for the activation and differentiation of lungresident antigenpresenting cells apcs namely dendritic cells dcs and macrophages 30much of our current understanding of cd8 tcell immunity stems from studying small rodent influenza and parainfluenza infection models 14 31 32 these models have shown the crucial role cd8 t cells play in controlling viral titers during primary infection and generating protection against subsequent infection

 central memory t cells tcm are cd62lhiccr7hi cells that tend to localize in secondary lymphoid tissues whereas effector memory t cells tem are cd62lloccr7lo cells that localize or traffic through peripheral tissues such as the lung considerable interest has been focused on elucidating functional differences between these memory tcell subsets and their capacity to confer protection against secondary infection 24 32 47 48 49 50 51 52 after secondary encounter with antigen tem cells can be stimulated by respiratory dcs without the requirement for further division and can demonstrate rapid cytokine production and lytic activity in contrast resting tcm cells that reside in the lns require migratory dcs for their reactivation resulting in de novo proliferation and a new wave of secondary effector t cells that migrate to the lung parenchyma and airways based on these observations it has been proposed that tem cells participate directly in the initiation of protective memory responses by rapidly producing effector molecules perforin granzyme and antiviral cytokines at the site of antigen encounter while tcm cells contribute to the maintenance andor amplification of the overall secondary tcell response therefore the specific subset of memory cd8 t cells generated by vaccination may critically determine the ultimate effectiveness of vaccine inducedimmune protection against a natural respiratory viral infectionthere is substantial clinical evidence to suggest that protective tcell immunity does not last for more than a couple of years after resolution of a natural infection or vaccination unless the response is boosted by reexposure to the same or crossreactive antigens 57 58 59 similarly in animal models of influenza and sendai virus infection the efficacy of protection against secondary challenge wanes rapidly within 36 months after a primary infection 60 61 62 this decline in protective tcell immunity occurs despite the fact that the number of virusspecific memory cd8 t cells in the lymphoid tissues tcm cells remains relatively high for the life span of animal 61 62 these studies suggest that in the context of a respiratory viral infection tcm cells may not respond expand or relocate to the lung sufficiently quickly to provide immediate protection against disease caused by reinfection or livepathogen challenge postvaccinationmore recent studies have indicated that at 1month postinfection the total numbers of virusspecific tem cells in the lung are substantially higher than the number of tcm cells in the draining lns 62 however detailed kinetic studies have revealed that despite stable numbers of memory cd8 t cells in the lymphoid organs the numbers of lung and airwayresident memory cd8 t cells following a primary sendai virus or influenza infection gradually decline over the first 36 months before stabilizing at very low levels 62 interestingly this decline and stabilization in the number of memory cd8 t cells in the lung directly correlates with a progressive decline in t cellmediated protection from a secondary challenge thus developing strategies that elicit a sufficiently large number of longlived tem cells that are not only cytolytic but also polyfunctional defined as being able to produce high levels of antiviral cytokines ifn tnf and il2 represents a key challenge for next generation vaccines that are able to confer protection against respiratory viruses in this regard it is becoming increasingly evident that the strength and duration of antigenic stimulation play important roles in determining both the frequency and longterm persistence of tem cells this will be discussed belowdespite continued disagreement on the precise details of how memory tcell generation occurs most people accept that the amplitude of a memory tcell pool generated after viral clearance is dictated by the magnitude of the primary effector tcell response this phenomenon has been well studied in a number of infectious mouse models including influenza virus where between five and 10 of the cd8 tcells elicited during the peak of immune response transition into memory t cells 63 the primary determinant of effector cd8 tcell size appears to be a function of the initial amount of antigen present during tcell priming it has been shown that brief periods of antigenic stimulation or antigen availability during priming favor the enrichment of tcm cells whereas prolonged periods support tem cell generation

 24 46 this has important implications for vaccine development against respiratory viruses for example the level and time of antigen exposure that can be provided by attenuated vaccines nonreplicating vectors dna vaccines or protein subunit vaccines might be significantly less than those provided by livereplicating vaccines this is likely to be linked to the capacity of replicating vaccines to divide multiple times and disseminate faster thus increasing the amount and the duration of antigen exposure as will be discussed in more detail below one of the key questions in inducing large effectorcell burst size for new vaccines will be to define the precise mechanisms that regulate the formation of effector t cells in the context of high or persisting antigen loadthe role of antigen in determining the longterm persistence of memory t cells has been intensely debated over the last 20 years initial data from mouse models suggested that tcell memory was short lived in the absence of periodic exposure to antigen 64 however more recent evidence has challenged this idea and suggested that the number of tcm cells can be sustained in the absence of both specific antigen and mhc molecules 65 66 67 further experimental evidence now suggests that a tcm memory pool is maintained at least in part through periodic slow cell division and continuous replacement of cells a process commonly referred to as homeostatic proliferation 68 69 this turnover of a memory tcm pool is achieved through tonic stimulation by cytokines such as il7 and il15 in contrast tem cells are not directly maintained through il15driven homeostatic proliferation 44two different although not mutually exclusive models have been proposed to explain the longevity of tem cells in the absence of reexposure to antigen initial studies suggested that tem cell populations in the lung airways are maintained in an antigenindependent manner by continual recruitment of new cells from the circulation 40 70 the rate of memory cell recruitment was shown to be extremely rapid resulting in replacement of 90 of the population every 10 days and that this can be maintained for periods over 1 year following viral clearance 70 more recent studies extended these observations by demonstrating that antigen can persist in the lung draining lns for several weeks after influenza virus clearance and that this residual antigen contributes to the maintenance of tem cells in the lung airways 71 72 however a small number of circulating memory cd8 tcells generated after influenza virus infection can migrate to the airways in the absence of cognate antigen 73 therefore memory tcell recruitment to the lung airways is controlled by both antigenindependent and antigendependent mechanisms immediately following virus clearance as residual antigen is cleared and the number of memory cd8 tcells localized within the lung airways stabilizes at a low level antigenindependent processes are required to maintain this population over time 73 thus it is clear that the role of persisting antigen after vaccination is a crucial point that has to be addressed during an effective tcell vaccine design against respiratory viruses this evidence clearly demonstrates that the use of conventional nonreplicating attenuated vaccine strains will fail to induce a robust and longlived tem population and therefore have limited application in the design of future vaccines this explains the need to increase the vaccine dose andor number of booster immunizations when highly attenuated viral vaccines are utilized however these approaches have obvious logistical and economic limitations thus to fully realize the potential benefits of attenuated vaccines or simple proteinpeptide immunizations it will be of great interest to identify specific molecules andor pathways that can be targeted to safely lower the activation threshold for antigencurrently intradermal intramuscular oral intranasal intravaginal and even rectal routes of immunization are under active investigation accumulating evidence from many research groups has confirmed that the route of immunization is critical in determining both qualitative and quantitative aspects of a vaccineinduced immune response 74 75 76 with regards to tcell vaccines against respiratory viruses recent studies support the concept that longlived cd8 t cells can be detected in the lung after mucosal but not systemic immunization suggesting that the maintenance of memory t cells are also dependent on the particular route of vaccination two recent studies provide insight into the mechanisms for this phenomenon verbist et al 77 demonstrated that generation maintenance and function of memory cd8 t cells after respiratory influenza infection is independent of il15mediated survival signals in contrast systemically ivinduced memory t cells were dependent on il15 for their longterm survival thus cd8 tcells primed at a mucosal site require distinct signals for their longterm maintenance shiki takamura et al 78 extended these results by showing that intranasally primed memory cd8 t cells possess a unique ability to be reactivated by residual antigen in the mln compared with intraperitoneally primed cd8 t cells resulting in the preferential recruitment and maintenance of intranasally primed memory cd8 t cells in the lung airways furthermore they demonstrated that the inability of intraperitoneally primed memory cd8 t cells to access residual antigen could be corrected by a subsequent intranasal virus infection 78 thus initial cd8 tcell priming in the mln and prolonged presentation of residual antigen in the mln are required to maintain large numbers of virusspecific memory cd8 t cells in the lung airways 78 clearly these findings have to be considered for the rational design of cd8 tcell vaccines against respiratory pathogenspoxviruses are a family of large enveloped viruses that contain a linear doublestranded dna genome ranging in size between 130 and 300 kb pairs that is capped by a hairpin loop at each end 82 they are also unique in that they encode their own transcription machinery enabling poxviruses to replicate in the cytoplasm of an infected cell 82 83 the concept of utilizing liveattenuated poxviruses as an immunizing agent against respiratory viruses can be traced back to the globalsmallpox eradication program 82 83 the strategy for this program involved mass vaccination with vacv an antigenically similar virus to variola major the etiological agent of smallpox disease many liveattenuated vacv strains first generation vaccines were used in different parts of the world 83 lister or listerelstree strain was the most widely used vaccine globally new york city board of health nycboh later produced by wyeth laboratories as dryvax strain was used in the americas and west africa copenhagen strain denmark and the ankara strain turkey were also widely used these vacv variants are known to differ in the expression of several virulence factors that determine their replicative capacity and safety profiles 83 84 it was the ability of these vacv strains to induce robust humoral and cellmediated immunity 82 83 85 that led to the world health organization declaring the eradication of smallpox in 1980 and shortly thereafter routine vaccination with vacv could be discontinued in most countriesserendipitously at the same time as the global vacv vaccination program was terminated novel molecular biological tools had identified vacv as an extremely versatile eukaryotic expression vector 86 87 one of the main properties of vacv and poxviruses in general that provides an advantage over other viral vectors is the relative ease by which large inserts of foreign dna can be cloned into them this allows for the insertion of multiple genes and the creation of multivalent vaccines furthermore poxviruses have the potential to be administered by different routes such as intradermal intramuscular oral intranasal intravaginal and intrarectal routes to generate immunoglobulin and tcell responses over the last 30 years a growing number of reports have described the utility of recombinant vaccinia viruses rvacvs expressing relevant antigens from multiple viral bacterial and parasitic pathogens to confer protection to immunized animals 81 88 89 90 91 92 93the vacv strain most extensively utilized in animal models has been the highly virulent western reserve wr strain which was derived from the nycboh strain by multiple passages in mice for obvious safety reasons the wr strain does not represent a viable strain for use in human vaccine applications moreover the welldocumented severe albeit rare complications following vaccination with first generation vacv strains and the increasing number of immunecompromised individuals have raised legitimate concerns about their widespread use as a vaccinedelivery system in humans 84 thus during the past three decades a major focus of research has been on developing novel highly attenuated recombinant vacv strains rvacv that demonstrate significantly improved safety profiles and can be used in humans as potential vaccines candidates 83 84 
table 1
as briefly mentioned above the safety concerns surrounding the wr and first generation vacvbased vaccine candidates have been addressed through the development of highly attenuated vacv strains 83 84 
table 1
 these include attenuated modified vaccinia virus ankara mva 94 and the copenhagenderived nyvac strain 95 mva is replication deficient in mammalian cells but importantly retains the capacity to synthesize viral proteins while nyvac is a highly attenuated virus that is unable to produce infectious particles in humans both virus vectors are extremely safe and can be used in young children and immunocompromised individuals 84 96 in addition an attenuated avipoxvirusvaccine vector the canary pox like alvac was also developed for use in humans 97 98 due to its restricted tissue tropism to avian cells alvac can be safely used in immune compromised humans 84in recent years mva nyvac and alvac have all been utilized with varying degrees of success as promising vaccine vectors for many infectious diseases including influenza sars hiv hsv tb and malaria 81 84 99 furthermore these novel vaccine vectors have been increasingly used again with varying degrees of success in the development of therapeutic vaccines against several common cancer antigens 81 100 the large number of clinical trials has produced a complicated picture with regards to using these vaccine vectors to generate a robust cd8 tcell response despite a small number of clinical trials providing promising preliminary evidence for cd8 tcell induction 101 102 unfortunately many trials demonstrate a limited induction of antigenspecific cd8 t cell against the infectious disease or cancer target of interest for example the immunogenicity of an attenuated alvac hiv1 vaccine in humans was shown to be low eliciting hiv1specific cd8 tcell responses in less than 25 of normal volunteers 103 104 105 106 similarly the immunogenicity of mva expressing the gag protein consensus of hiv1 clade a and several immunodominant cd8 tcell epitopes was also shown to be unsatisfactory 17 response 107 a smaller study using the same vaccines at a higher dose showed enhanced immunogenicity 40 response but the tcell responses induced were exclusively cd4 tcell driven 108 with regards to respiratory viruses a small phase i clinical trial in healthy adults investigating a novel mvabased heterosubtypic influenza a vaccine mva  np  m1 demonstrated that all volunteers had a significant increase in the number of ifn producing cd8 t cells in their blood at weeks one three and eight after intradermal or intramuscular vaccination 109 this response however rapidly declined over time reaching prevaccination levels by week 52 postvaccination 109 this is consistent with an earlier preclinical study that demonstrated mvainduced t cell responses are followed several weeks later by a dramatic 20 to 40fold contraction a phenomenon that also occurred with dnapoxvirus regimens in which nyvac and alvac were used for boosting 110 another interesting characteristic of mva vaccines was revealed by pillai et al 2011 in which mvaprimed hiv1 gagspecific memory cells were found to be predominantly of the tcm phenotype cd62l and il2 positive 111 similarly after a single immunization with mva vector expressing preerythrocytic malaria antigens reyessandoval et al 112 found that mvainduced accelerated tcm rather than tem generation and consequently failed to protect against malaria these studies suggests that mva in its current form may not be the most effective poxvirus vector for induction of strong and longlasting protective cd8 tcell responses in peripheral tissues such as the lungif one looks back in the literature it becomes evident that these somewhat disappointing clinical results with nonreplicating highly attenuated poxviruses could have been predicted based on studies carried out more than 20years ago a seminal study by morgan et al 113 demonstrated that the virulence of a vacv vector critically influences the protective efficacy of the recombinant vaccine cottontop tamarins vaccinated with a vacvwrbased recombinant expressing the gp340 envelope antigen of epsteinbarr virus ebv were protected against ebvinduced lymphoma but animals inoculated with the attenuated wyeth vacvnycbohbased recombinant were not the precise mechanism for this was not investigated in detail but it appeared to be independent of humoral immunityin summary 30 years of increasing safety and regulatory concerns surrounding replicationcompetent recombinant poxviruses has unfortunately resulted in the widespread use of vaccinedelivery vectors that are ineffective at inducing robust and longlived memory cd8 t cells necessary to confer protection against highly virulent respiratory virusesat the dawn of recombinant poxvirusvaccine research relatively little was known about the precise molecular mechanisms that govern the quantity phenotype and quality of memory tcells following infection with a live replicating virus in the interim we have gained a number of important insights which must be considered in our pursuit of safe and effective poxvirusbased tcell vaccines first replicationcompetent or highly virulent poxviruses in general promote a more potent primary and memory cd8 tcell response compared with that of replicationdefective or highly attenuated vaccine strains second replicationdefective poxviruses predominantly drive the induction of tcm cells over tem cells third in many instances multiple dosing or higher dosing 107109 pfu with replicationdefective or highly attenuated poxvirusvaccine strains are necessary to achieve comparable levels of cd8 t cells to those produced by live poxvirusvaccine strains finally while attenuated poxvirus strains provide good short term tcell protection they are not effective at conferring long term tcellmediated protection as discussed previously these limitations are logically related to antigen load antigen persistence and the ability to effectively stimulate cd8 tcell responses thus a convincing argument can be made that a key challenge in utilizing attenuated poxvirus vectors to develop efficacious tcell vaccines is to define the molecular mechanisms that link virulence and immunogenicity toward this end several recent studies have indicated that key events during initial tcell priming including inflammatory stimuli 24 54 costimulation 114 cd4 tcell help 115 and the cytokine mileu 54 have longlasting programing effects on the quantity phenotype and quality of the memory t cells generated in response to a live viral infection in the following sections we will discuss the importance of tcell costimulatory receptors specifically we will focus on the importance of tnftnfr family members ox40 and ox40l in eliciting protective tcell memory and their potential use as immunological adjuvants to enhance poxvirusbased cd8 tcell vaccinesit has been hypothesized that the coevolution of pathogens and their hosts has been a major driving force behind the development of a highly sophisticated and extremely adaptable vertebrate immune system this coevolution is clearly demonstrated by the fact that many large dna viruses such as poxviruses and herpesviruses possess multiple homologues of cytokines chemokines or the associated receptors of these molecules which can neutralize or modulate host immunity to favor the virus 116 117 118 119 it is assumed that the main goal of these immune modulatory strategies is to enhance viral replication and survival however it is highly plausible that there exists unknown consequences of viral immune evasion strategies that may impact the hosts immune response could it be possible that certain molecular pathways that regulate alternative immune responses such as those involved in autoimmunity allergic or even antitumor responses might have evolved or be differentially utilized as a consequence of viral evasion tactics an obvious example is the large number of costimulatory receptors especially in the immunoglobulin ig and tnftnfr superfamilies that are expressed on t cells and known to be critical for their activity cd28b7 icosicosl and cd2lfa3 typify costimulatory molecules of the ig superfamily 120 121 whereas tnfrtnf family members are typified by but are not exclusive to ox40ox40l 41bb41bbl cd27cd70 gitrgitrl cd30cd30l and hvemlight 114 122 123 124 members of the tnftnfr superfamily are recognized for their ability to stimulate t cells and provide signals to promote sustained tcell clonal expansion and longterm survival 114 122 123 124 this is achieved through the selective targeting of intracellular signaling molecules that promote effector cytokine production cell division and suppress apoptosis 114 122 123 interestingly there are a number of receptorligand pairs within the tnftnfr superfamily that are not constitutively expressed but are induced during specific inflammatory scenarios they are thought to provide late signals that subtly regulate tcell responses in both a quantitative and qualitative manner 114 120 122 why so many costimulatory molecules exist with often apparently similar and overlapping functional attributes remains to be determined several pox and herpes viruses encode tnfr superfamily homologues tnfr itself cd30 and hvem that act as decoy receptors to modulate host immune responses to favor viral replication and persistence 125 126 127 128 it is of interest that recent analysis of the teleost genome an organism in which the first fully functional adaptive immune system was thought to have developed has revealed the presence of many human tnf superfamily orthologs this provides evidence to suggest that many of the tnf superfamily members coemerged around the same time as did antigen receptors 129 interestingly however four ligands were not found to exist within the teleost genome namely ox40l cd70 the ligand for cd27 gitrl and cd30l 129 as briefly discussed above these are important regulators of the later phases of tcell expansion and survival leading to the hypothesis that these ligands may have arisen more recently to allow immune adaptation plasticity and effective development of protective immunity against pathogens to test this hypothesis we recently utilized several poxvirus infection models and investigated the use and role of select tnftnfr and ig family members in initiating and sustaining protective cd8 tcell responsesutilizing a panel of vacv strains with varying degrees of virulence in mice our laboratory recently demonstrated that the relative virulence of a virusvaccine dictates the quantity and protective capacity of the resulting memory cd8 tcells generated 76 130 the three vacv strains used in our study included the highly virulent wr strain and two clinically relevant vacvvaccine strains lister and nycboh all vacv strains are known to differ in their expression of several virulence factors that impact on their replicative capacity in vivo consequently we found that after intranasal or intraperitoneal infection only the wr vacv strain replicated rapidly reaching high titers across multiple tissues 76 and salekardakani unpublished observations and resulting in severe and sustained inflammation in contrast the lister and nycboh strains were cleared more rapidly and were unable to disseminate to the same extent as wrmice infected with an attenuated vacvvaccine strain lister or nycboh via the intranasal or intraperitoneal route generated five to 10fold fewer lung resident virusspecific memory cd8 t cells compared to mice infected with the virulent replication sufficient wr strain 76 similar differences were observed at the peak days seven and eight of the initial effector cd8 tcell response implying that altered molecular regulation at this phase of the response could explain the difference in size of the memory pool generated to highlight the importance of cd8 t cells in protecting against subsequent viral encounter mhc classiideficient mice mhc ii that lack cd4 t cells and therefore can not generate vacvspecific humoral immunity were vaccinated with wr lister and nycboh and challenged 70 days later with a lethal intranasal dose of vacvwr 76 all mice vaccinated with the wr strain the most virulent virus survived the lethal infection and presented mild disease symptoms in contrast no protection was evident in mice vaccinated with either attenuated strain lister or nycboh resulting in comparable mortality and disease severity to that observed in nave unvaccinated mice this demonstrated that a vacv strain capable of replicating to greater titers in multiple tissues and over a longer period of time promotes greater number of persisting antigenreactive cd8 t cells that afford protection against a highly lethal respiratory virus challenge in humans immunization with liveattenuated vacv lister or nycboh elicits what was previously thought to be a good memory cd8 tcell response 85 131 132 the vacvspecific memory cd8 tcell pool has been shown to persist for many years in the majority of vaccine recipients however recent observations have highlighted a rapid decline in memory cd8 tcell numbers does occur in a significant group of individuals over time 133 134 135 this raised concerns as to whether optimal longlived cd8 tcell immunity can in fact be generated using first generation vacv strains our data provides considerable evidence to warrant these concerns as vaccination using the virulent vacvwr promoted far superior numbers of protective memory cd8 tcells this result raised the question as to whether a specific molecular mechanism exists that is engaged during an infection with the virulent wr strain but not the attenuated lister or nycboh vacv strains if alternate molecular control mechanisms are evident they could potentially be harnessed to enhance cd8 tcell responses generated by attenuated poxvirus vaccinesox40 is a member of the tnfr family and is not constitutively expressed on nave t cells but is induced hours to days after tcr engagement 114 122 124 maximal expression is typically observed between two and five days following tcell activation after which ox40 is downregulated implying a delayed mode of action in primary immune responses 114 122 124 consistent with this we recently reported that ox40 was seen on a proportion of vacvspecific cd8 t cells as early as day four and peaked on day five postinfection with vacvwr 136 in our initial studies we found that the development of high numbers of effector cd8 t cells capable of producing both ifn and tnf was strongly impaired when ox40 was lacking on a cd8 tcell responding to vacv 124 136 analysis of the main immunodominant cd8 tcell populations b8r a3l a8r a23r and b2r which account for close to 70 of the whole vacvspecific response demonstrated a global impairment in cd8 tcell priming in the absence of ox40 such that the response was reduced by between 70 and 80 136 we further demonstrated that the engagement and activity of ox40 during a virulent viral infection ensured the generation of a high frequency of persisting and functional memory cd8 t cells that located to the lung 136 most interestingly ox40 driven induction of lungresident memory cd8 t cells correlated directly with a robust protection against a highly lethal intranasal infection with vvwr 76 136subsequently we assessed the requirement for ox40 after infection with the lister and nycboh vacv strains 76 in striking contrast to vacvwr little difference in the frequency of virusspecific effector and memory cd8 t cells was observed in the absence of ox40 signaling thus virulence and host evasion mechanisms of vacvwr result in persistent viral replication and the engagement of costimulatory receptor ox40 subsequently this results in enhanced induction of memory cd8 t cells that afford protection against a highly lethal respiratory virus challengein light of these studies we postulated whether the differential engagement of ox40 applies to other tcell stimulatory receptors 76 in this regard recent data from our group and others have shown that in addition to ox40 cd28 a costimulatory receptor in the ig superfamily 137 138 and cd27 another tnfr family member 139 can be utilized during a vacvwr infection and each can contribute to the generation of effector cd8 tcell responses cd28 and cd27 are distinguishable from ox40 in that they are constitutively present on resting cd8 t cells but their respective ligands b72 and cd70 are similar to ox40l in that they are induced once an apc receives certain inflammatory stimuli 120 137 140 141 in contrast to our ox40 studies we found that cd28 was indispensible for optimal effector cd8 tcell generation regardless of whether mice were infected with lister or nycboh 76 however similar to ox40 deficiency in cd27 resulted in impaired cd8 tcell responses to wr but little or no defect to lister or nycboh 76another interesting distinction between infection with the virulent wr and the attenuated viruses was only evident when vacvspecific tcell responses were assessed during the memory phase cd28deficient mice exhibited defective memory cd8 tcell generation in response to lister and nycboh but not interestingly to wr even though cd28 was required for an optimal effector response to this virus 76 this indicates that in response to vacvwr infection there exists a cd28dependent phase of cd8 tcell priming followed by a cd28independent phase cd27 signaling has previously been shown to prolong cd8 tcell survival beyond the effector phase of the immune response and thus serves to increase the number of memory cells by inhibiting effector tcell death 124 142 143 144 consistent with these results blocking the cd27 and cd70 interactions in cd28deficient mice late in the primary response between five and eight days completely abrogated the cd28independent cd8 tcell responses to vacvwr 76 these results support a model in which a temporal sequence of events is necessary for optimal virusspecific cd8 tcell proliferation survival and memory generation brought about by a specific sequential engagement of costimulatory molecules cd28 ox40 and cd27in summary we show that viral virulence and evasion strategies that impact viral replication dissemination and invariably the inflammatory milieu can lead to differential use of costimulatory receptors for t cells which dictate the magnitude and effectiveness of the cd8 tcell response 
fig 3
 furthermore these data are of high potential significance to vaccination and promote the notion that the use of attenuated viruses may not elicit the best longterm tcell memory because they do not allow molecules such as ox40 and cd27 or their ligands that may have evolved for the purpose of promoting tcell memory to be engaged this provides a hypothetical model that might in part explain the abundance of such stimulatory receptors for t cells and demonstrate that molecular plasticity can occur during antiviral responses where certain immune mechanisms thought nonessential could become highly relevantcontrary to our vacvwr studies but similar to the data with vacvlister and vacvnycboh discussed above the regulation of cd8 tcell responses in other viral settings is variably dependent on ox40 and ox40l signaling initial studies on ox40 and ox40l mice independently infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus lcmv vesicular stomatitis virus vsv theilers murine encephalomyelitis tmev and influenza virus demonstrated no defect in control of viral replication or the generation of effector cd8 tcell populations 124 145 146 147 148 however recent studies investigating the impact of ox40ox40l signaling on memory and recall cd8 tcell responses demonstrated a reduction in the number and secondary expansion of memory cd8 t cells in the lung despite not influencing initial cd8 tcell priming 148 similarly ox40 signaling regulates the accumulation of cd8 t cells reactive with the persistentphase epitopes during a mouse cytomegalovirus mcmv infection 149collectively these data suggest that no two viruses initiate the same combination of costimulatory pathways this raises many questions surrounding the specific signals that initiate the program of costimulatory pathways required for induction maintenance and recall of memory cd8 tcell populations as discussed above the level of virus replication and persistence brought about by virulence and immune evasion strategies is one parameter that dictates the differential use of costimulatory receptors and subsequently the magnitude and efficacy of the ensuing cd8 tcell response furthermore the inflammatory signature initiated by a specific virus strain or the presence of virusspecific virulence factors may also authorize particular costimulatory interactions apc derived cytokines such as il1 il2 il12 and tnf have been shown to influence the extent and length of costimulatory receptorsligand expression 114 124 while a recent lcmv study revealed a differential requirement for type i ifns in controlling the initial expansion and generation of cd8 t cells that is not used in response to a vacv infection 150 furthermore the cd40 engagement tlr ligation and il18 derived signals can also regulate the expression of ox40l on apcs 114 140in summary the extent of viral replication in terms of peak titer and tissue tropism and the unique inflammatory signature of a specific viral infection is likely to influence the use of a specific combination of costimulatory molecules further studies to investigate the spatial and temporal expression profiles of both costimulatory ligands and receptors in different viral settings will almost certainly add to our understanding and help in the development of safe yet effective vaccines against viral infectionsaccumulating evidence from our laboratory and others support the notion that a critical component of any future cd8 tcell vaccine against highly virulent respiratory viruses must be the capacity to i promote robust expansion of nave precursor t cells reactive with viral antigenic peptides ii allow a high frequency of these virusspecific effector t cells to survive over time as memory t cells iii allow high numbers of these memory cells to persist in the lung parenchyma and airways in the absence of persisting antigen and iv to retain high effector function to provide optimal surveillance against subsequent infections as alluded to earlier replicationdefective highly attenuated poxvirus vectors although extremely safe are unlikely to satisfy a number of these important requirements consequently a number of innovative strategies have been developed to facilitate and enhance the immunogenicity of attenuated poxvirus vectors including the use of heterologous primeboost regiments 151 coadministration of tlr agonists 152 cytokines 153 154 155 156 157 and targeting tcell costimulatory receptors 158 159 160our studies highlighted above suggest that attenuated vacvvaccine strains will not elicit the most effective cd8 tcell memory responses in the lungs due to the lack of ox40 and cd27 engagement therefore we investigated whether engagement of ox40 would boost the response to attenuated vacvvaccine strains by treating with an agonist antibody 76 agonistic ox40 treatment during the initial priming of cd8 tcells markedly enhanced the numbers of effector and memory cells not only in the spleen but also in the lungs this was observed regardless of whether vaccination was via the intraperitoneal or dermal scarification route most significantly agonistic ox40 provided strong protection against a lethal respiratory virus challenge in mhc ii mice vaccinated with lister or nycboh which alone were ineffective at preventing lethality the extent of protection when mice were vaccinated with the combination of attenuated vaccine strains and agonistic ox40 was similar to mice vaccinated with the virulent wr strainto extend these results we focused on priming cd8 t cells by subcutaneous immunization with the immunodominant vacv peptide epitope b8r2027 given in ifa 161 this strategy allowed us to assess the role of memory cd8 t cells in the absence of any preexisting vacvspecific immunoglobulin and in the presence of an intact nave cd4 tcell population several weeks later once memory cells had developed mice were challenged intranasally with a lethal dose of vacvwr correlating with our prior data agonistic ox40 provided strong protection in a cd8dependent cd4independent manner in mice vaccinated with a high dose of b8r2027 peptide in that no disease as measured by weight loss was observed it should be stressed that prevention of weight loss during the first seven days of infection is extremely difficult to achieve especially with such highchallenge doses x 300 ld50 that were used in our experiments and therefore an important demonstration of the utility of agonistically targeting ox40 in antiviral protection more interestingly targeting ox40 induced almost complete protection in mice immunized with a low dose of b8r2027 that alone was ineffective at preventing lethality this was reflected in both minimal loss of weight and mortality as well as lung immunopathology 161 as before the extent of protection directly correlated with the number of ifn producing b8rspecific memory cd8 tcells that were generated in the lung after ox40 engagement and the number that accumulated after intranasal infection these findings are reminiscent of those obtained with secondary influenza or sendai virus infection in which the presence of significant numbers of cd8 t cells in the lung before challenge correlated with immunity 162 163the development of polyfunctional cd8 t cells which are considered the most potent memory cells for antiviral immunity is a powerful metric for potency of adjuvanticity 55 agonist ox40 treatment at the time of vaccination elicits highly polyfunctional b8rspecific cd8 t cells that persisted specifically in the lung tissue in high numbers for at least 18months after secondary challenge with vacv and importantly was independent of cd4 tcell help as previously discussed to effectively promote lung tropic memory cd8 t cells both the route of vaccination and the virulenceimmunogenicity of the vaccine vector is paramount collectively our studies demonstrate that intraperitoneal infection with attenuated vacvvaccine strains or subcutaneous vaccination of a viral peptide in the presence of an agonistic ox40 antibody can generate longlasting memory cd8 t cell that persist in the lung therefore targeting ox40 during priming of vacvspecific cd8 t cells elicits fully protective and longlived antiviral cd8 tcell responses in the lung irrespective of the site of vaccination and the context of viral antigenseveral other groups have raised the possibility that triggering ox40 could enhance vaccination efficacy against other viral and nonviral pathogens the use of poxviral vectors that encode an antigen of interest in combination with ox40l has demonstrated enhanced splenic cd4 and cd8 tcell responses to a hepatitis b surface antigen hbsag 164 and improved protective efficacy of a footandmouth disease fmd vaccine 165 furthermore a recombinant poxvirus vector encoding ox40l in combination with b71 icam1 and lfa3 enhanced both cd4 and cd8 tcell proliferative capacity and cytokine production after antigen restimulation in vitro 166 a similar approach in which a hiv1 canary pox vaccine vector was coadministered intramuscularly with an ox40lexpressing canarypox vector resulted in the expansion of hivspecific cd8 t cells detected in the spleen sixweeks postinfection 167 the use of an agonistic ox40 antibody and fusion proteins has also produced very promising results coadministration of an agonistic ox40 antibody with sivgp130 in rhesus monkeys resulted in enhanced virusspecific t cell and immunoglobulin recall responses 168 while the targeting of ox40 using an agonistic monoclonal antibody elicited strong antiviral cd8 t cells during a mcmv infection resulting in enhanced clearance of the virus 149 furthermore stimulation of ox40 in cooperation with 41bb during vaccination with an ovaexpressing poxvirus vector also enhanced ovaspecific memory responses 169 this approach also promoted fungal clearance and enhanced tcell responses against the respiratory fungal pathogen cryptococcus neoformans 170 a summary of these agonistic and vectorbased adjuvant strategies is shown in 
table 2
collectively these studies suggest that ox40 is a promising target for enhancing tcell responses against a variety of antigens and that agonist reagents to ox40 or ox40l encoded within a vaccine vector might be useful in vaccination regimens this strategy could enable the highly desirable ability to retain the use of attenuated vaccines or simple peptide or protein immunization while promote both immunoglobulin and tcell components of the immune response for a more comprehensive insight into the molecular mechanisms of agonistic ox40 therapies reviewed in 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178without doubt the greatest concern with enhancing cd8 tcell responses through the use of agonistic ox40 antibodies or vector encoded ox40l is a hyperinflammatory immune response a clinical trial investigating the propensity of inducing regulatory t cell development through the use of an anticd28 superagonist antibody tgn1412 resulted in six human volunteers experiencing lifethreatening complications 179 consequently future clinical trials targeting tcell stimulatory receptors will undoubtedly face more stringent safety requirements by regulatory authorities to this end toxicity trials in nonhuman primates have already demonstrated that agonistic ox40 antibody therapy is well tolerated and safe therefore providing a strong rationale to pursue clinical tests in humans 168direct interaction between viral pathogens and ox40 itself also raise concerns surrounding the targeting of ox40 to enhance tcell responses recently ox40 was identified as cell entry receptor for both feline fiv 180 181 and hiv 182 by replicating in and subsequently killing ox40 expressing cells both fiv and hiv would preferentially deplete virusspecific t cells that would otherwise mediate antiviral immune responses tcell tropic viruses may also exploit the ox40ox40l axis to aid their dissemination for example infection with human tcell leukemia virus type 1 htlv1 the causative agent of adult tcell leukemia atl enhances ox40 expression in a cooperative process involving nfb and the viral oncoprotein tax 183 intriguingly a small number of atl patients displayed ox40 dependent adhesion of leukemic cells to endothelial cells 184 suggesting that virusinduced ox40 expression could enhance leukemic cell infiltration and viral disseminationviruses can hijack transcriptional activation events triggered by ox40 to induce the expression of their own genes a number of viruses including cytomegalovirus 185 186 and hiv 187 have nfb response elements incorporated into their genomes which can enhance viral reactivation in the case of cmv and viral replication 182 188 the possible influence of ox40 on viral replication survival andor reactivation from latency represents an interesting area for future research finally research into the potential pathogenicity of enhanced tcell responses upon natural virus reexposure is necessary an inappropriate memory tcell response upon reexposure to rsv after vaccination with a formalininactivated vaccine resulted in several infant deaths and countless hospitalizations 189 consequently it would be necessary to determine the safe upper limit for the number of memory cd8 tcells desired and also whether maintaining large numbers of tissue resident lung memory cd8 t cells is detrimental over time in summary although ox40 is a promising target for enhancing protection against infection and reducing viralinduced immunopathology the positive effect ox40 may have on virus replication and survival in infected host cells raises new considerations for its manipulation making the infectious status of the patient of paramount importanceaccumulating evidence now indicates that targeting human ox40 and ox40l holds great promise for future vaccine strategies against highly virulent respiratory viruses and other unmet clinical infectious diseases such as hiv malaria and tb the literature discussed above provide compelling evidence to suggests the targeting of costimulatory pathways such as ox40ox40l or other similar molecules in this family can promote robust expansion of antigenspecific effector t cells in response to safe attenuated vacvvaccine strains and peptide antigen furthermore ox40 stimulation generates longlived memory effector t cells that are capable of surviving at mucosal sites in the absence of persisting antigen while maintaining their effector function to provide protection against natural reexposure there is no doubt that increasing our understanding of basic cd8 tcell biology and the dynamic regulatory influences the many costimulatory pathways have on the generation phenotype maintenance and reactivation of cd8 t cells will facilitate the development of novel cd8 tcell vaccines a key area of research that will provide important insight into the plasticity and adaptation of costimulatory regulation of tcell responses is identifying the differences in inflammatory signature between viruses that elicit potent cd8 tcell responses and those that do not this will enable us to recapitulate the signature of a virulent virus while using a safe attenuated vaccine virus to promote lifelong cd8 t cellmediated immunitythere remains debate over clean hospitals when considering hospital-acquired infections hais1

2 a visual experience of dirty hospitals is automatically linked with infection risk but this is difficult to prove for a number of reasons firstly there are already several known risks for patients acquiring infection in hospital  antimicrobial consumption insufficient isolation rooms and poor hand hygiene for example secondly since cleaning has never been investigated as a discrete scientific entity it is impossible to determine just how important it might be towards overall infection control1 finding the evidence to support cleaning as a significant intervention for preventing infection has been seriously disadvantaged because there are no accepted risk-based standards to verify whether a hospital is truly clean and safe3 finally there is confusion between nursing and domestic personnel over allocation of cleaning responsibilities even established cleaning regimens do not necessarily target high-risk reservoirs due to a lack of evidence and education
visual inspection of the hospital environment does not provide a reliable qualitative nor quantitative assessment of the infection risk for patients2

3 microbes are invisible and they are not necessarily associated with visual dirt the impression of cleanliness is confounded by clutter excess equipment cramped wards and fabric deficits visual assessment will inevitably be subject to bias under these circumstances as well as subject to an individuals perception1 despite this there is general consensus that environmental cleanliness is important for controlling infection this is largely due to historical influences as well as the large number of outbreak reports which nearly always mention cleaning as an integral part of the control package4
there has been much recent interest in the role of the environment in promoting transmission of pathogens as well as articles examining basic principles underlying the importance of cleaning5

6 novel biocides antimicrobial coatings and new types of cleaning equipment are constantly appearing although few have been modelled against patient outcome there is an increasing need to prioritise surface level cleaning in the prevention and control of hospital infection particularly as pathogens are becoming more resistant to antimicrobial agents hospital cleaning in the 21st century deserves further investigation for both routine and outbreak practicesif a microbial pathogen can retain viability on surfaces outside the human body there is a risk that it could be picked up by hands or air currents and transmitted to a patient4 the longer it survives the more likely it will ultimately reach a patient at a vulnerable site and cause infection robust pathogens will persist in an appropriate environmental niche for days unless removed through some cleaning process1

whilst the ability of bacterial spores to withstand intemperate environments is well known survival patterns of vegetative bacteria and viruses in healthcare institutions are less predictable it has been assumed that gram-negative bacilli are more vulnerable to exposure on surfaces and therefore pose less of a risk to patients1 this assumption has been challenged by studies that detail prolonged survival periods for some gram-negative species7 for example escherichia coli and klebsiella spp have been shown to survive more than a year under certain conditions and serratia marcescens up to 2 months7 in contrast methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa has been shown to survive for a year in hospital dust the spores of clostridium difficile for five months and epidemic vancomycin-resistant enterococci vre for up to four years10 11 12
acinetobacter can survive in surface dust for at least a month with some strains reportedly surviving for up to 3 years8
pseudomonas aeruginosa usually only survives for a couple of days but will persist for five weeks on a dry floor7

13 along with stenotrophomonas maltophilia pseudomonas spp demonstrate long-term persistence within biofilm adherent to hospital plumbing components and other water-exposed sites14

15 most respiratory viruses such as coronavirus rhinovirus and influenza can survive on dry surfaces for a few days with gastrointestinal viruses retaining viability for a couple of months norovirus is found in the hospital environment for days after an outbreak demonstrating survivability despite terminal cleaning with bleach-based products16

17 fungi such as candida spp may persist in hospitals for up to four months although there are very few reports detailing the risk of cross-infection from an environmental source7

18

19
given the proven ability of these microorganisms to survive on surfaces for relatively long periods of time it is obvious that the healthcare environment facilitates cross-transmission and outbreaks of many hospital pathogens the risks of cross-transmission are exaggerated by heavy workload understaffing high bed occupancy rates and rapid bed turnover furthermore in an era of cost cutting those with cleaning responsibilities cannot hope to decontaminate all high-risk surfaces as often as required when a hospital is full to capacity and patients with attendant microorganisms are transferred between wards day and night4
pathogens can be recovered from the environment using a variety of microbiological techniques most organisms can be found in the air and ultimately on the floors but almost any surface can host a range of microbes for differing lengths of time these include general surfaces such as shelves and ledges curtains linen and clothes furniture and computers telephones patients beds and items of clinical equipment1

12

20 21 22 23 24 25
gram-negative organisms such as pseudomonas spp and stenotrophomonas are associated with damp places such as taps sinks showers and baths1

13

15

26

27 coliforms such as klebsiella and serratia have been identified from buckets bowls mops and liquids1

28 thus traditional sites for gram-negative microbes have been sites constantly or intermittently exposed to water but this is not always the case dry sites eg patient charts can also host a range of gram-negative organisms23
about 5 of near-patient sites demonstrate presence of gram-negative bacilli indistinguishable to those from the patient22 organisms identified included ecoli enterobacter serratia and klebsiella and these organisms were recovered from a range of sites including linen and nightwear bedside table bed rail and chair door handle infusion pump and respirator and expected bathroom sites the most prevalent site for the patients own isolate was the perineal region of the patients themselves thus demonstrating the major reservoir for gram-negative bacteria22 the perineum has already been highlighted as an important source of environmental contamination for hands of both patients and staff29
pathogens normally resident in the gastrointestinal system such as norovirus c difficile and vre are predominantly recovered from bathrooms toilets or commodes although the propensity for survival of these particular organisms means that they can be found from many other sites in the healthcare environment12

17

30

31 indeed spores of c difficile persist on hands and under fingernails and could be carried between wards on the soles of shoes12

32

33 spores may disseminate through the air confounding attempts at controlling infection and invalidating terminal cleaning protocols34
norovirus easily spreads in air and on surfaces throughout an entire ward although this usually reflects the situation during seasonal outbreaks17 dust-loving mrsa and acinetobacter contaminate rarely cleaned andor inaccessible surfaces such as shelves tops of monitors patient notes and computer keyboards25

35 36 37 38 the most frequently contaminated sites for mrsa on an acute ward are top of the bedside locker overbed table and bed frame22

39 airborne spread of mrsa and acinetobacter has also been documented but remains poorly investigated40 41 42 43 even pseudomonas has been recovered from air and similarly implicated in spread between patients13 the more traditional airborne pathogens ubiquitous aspergillus and bacillus spp are dispersed through the hospital particularly during hot dry weather and often associated with construction or renovation1

44

45
coliforms and pseudomonas may frequent wet sites such as sinks and baths with differences between the recovery rate from sinks on separate wards within the same hospital46 few coliforms persisted in intensive care unit icu sinks as opposed to sinks on medical wards with pseudomonas-type bacteria more frequently isolated from icu sinks than those on the medical wards this was attributed to more frequent dispensing of alcohol and chlorhexidine for the purposes of hand disinfection in icu all environmental bacteria recovered from icu were significantly more resistant to antibiotics than those from the medical wards antibiotic consumption appears to influence the resistance profiles of organisms on floors and other surfaces within a defined local environment such as a hospital ward46
prior room occupancy has been shown to be a risk for acquisition of both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms5

47 48 49 50 51 this suggests that terminal cleaning andor disinfection regimens for isolation rooms containing patients colonised andor infected with mrsa vre c difficile acinetobacter and pseudomonas fail to remove all microbial contamination thus exposing a new admission to the remnants of a persistent environmental reservoir52 given that this risk has been verified by many different authors it strengthens the role of the environment in hai53 a patient admitted into a room previously occupied by an infected patient remains at risk of acquiring the same organism regardless of hand hygiene compliance rates by attendant clinical staff54
once a hospital pathogen reaches an appropriate environmental niche it will persist unless removed through some cleaning process it then has the potential to contaminate hands or be uplifted by air currents and deposited upon a patient or onto surfaces beside the patient29

34

55

56 the greatest risk for infection for most patients emanates from surfaces beside or on beds eg linen bed frames lockers and overbed tables3

24

39

57 contamination of near-patient bedside sites provides an opportunity for everyones hands including those of the patient to acquire pathogens andor transfer them elsewhere29

58

59
items or surfaces that are frequently touched provide the largest risk of contamination by pathogens spread on hands3

25 these sites then act as reservoirs for subsequent dispersal seeding pieces of cauliflower mosaic virus onto a ward telephone allowed researchers to track the movement and spread of the viral marker around the unit from hand-touch site to hand-touch site over the course of hours and days60 a similar community-based study placed viral components onto a door handle in a students flat and charted the movement of the markers from site to site via hands61 these studies confirm the role of hands in mobilising microbial markers between hand-touch reservoirs and the sites most likely to host pathogens in addition the community study showed how direct hand-to-hand contact as occurs during handshaking was able to spread marker virus to a succession of people following initial contamination of a door handle61
many previous studies have demonstrated transient and persistent carriage of hospital organisms on the hands of healthcare workers9

27

29

32

55

62 63 64 65 66 67 68 about 40 nurses hands yield coliforms without prior disinfection although rates depend upon the type of unit in which sampling takes place29

63 another study showed that 17 icu staff carried klebsiella on their hands and that these strains were probably related to those colonising or infecting patients resident on the unit55 of clinical staff caring for patients with c difficile 59 had positive cultures for c difficile
from their hands32 about 17 925 of contacts between a healthcare worker and an mrsa-colonised patient result in transmission of mrsa from a patient to the gloves of a healthcare worker66
staff also acquire organisms directly from the hospital environment29

55

65

69 70 71 72 indeed they are just as likely to acquire pathogens after touching environmental sites as they are after caring for patients65

70 71 72 coliforms can be recovered from the hands of nurses after touching patients washing materials and clothing as well as after bed making sluice room activities handling bedlinen and curtains and even after a drug round29 once acquired hands may then be responsible for contaminating additional environmental sites7

56

73
contamination of hands or gloves with hospital organisms provides a highly plausible route of transmission between patients on a ward7

55

63

64 hand hygiene is an easy practical method of interrupting such transmission but compliance rarely reaches the levels required to remove the risk of hai for many different reasons54

74 even when staff know that a patient is isolated because they are colonised or infected with a hospital pathogen hand hygiene compliance is still only about 5074 it is also possible that hand hygiene is insufficient to stop pathogen transmission70

75 neither chlorhexidine alcohol nor soap and water necessarily remove contamination from hands and some hand cleansing products are ineffective against specific pathogens63

70

76 77 78
there is some evidence that cleaning removes mrsa from the ward environment with benefit for patients35

59 mrsa was isolated from 13 patients on the dermatology ward over a 14-month period80 extensive environmental culturing revealed that a blood pressure cuff and the patients communal shower were positive for mrsa with pulsed field gel electrophoresis pfge demonstrating identical dna typing patterns from the majority of patient isolates and both environmental sources control was achieved after changing of blood pressure cuffs between patients and more stringent cleaning of communal areas80 another mrsa outbreak on a urological ward resisted all the usual infection control interventions such as hand hygiene promotion and isolation of patients81 after the outbreak strain was isolated from the ward environment the number of domestic cleaning hours was doubled from 60 to 120 hours per week and the number of patients affected immediately decreased the cleaning intervention was thought to have played a significant role in the termination of the outbreak and saved at least 28 00081
an outbreak of glycopeptide-intermediate staph aureus gisa in an intensive therapy unit itu proved difficult to control until further control measures including enhanced cleaning were introduced82 again this probably helped to stop the outbreak although it was not possible to determine the relative roles of barrier precautions and environmental decontamination outwith the outbreak situation the effects of enhanced cleaning were monitored on two matched surgical wards in a prospective controlled cross-over trial for two 6-month periods59 there were nine ward-acquired mrsa infections during routine cleaning periods but only four when the wards received extra cleaning notably targeting hand-touch sites and clinical equipment more mrsa patient-days during the enhanced cleaning periods predicted at least 13 new cases instead of the 4 that actually occurred the study concluded that targeted cleaning using detergent wipes and water could be a cost-effective mechanism of reducing mrsa infections59
environmental cleaning might also be important for controlling vre83

84 one study describes the impact of improved cleaning on the spread of vre in a medical icu with and without promotion of hand hygiene compliance85 enforcing cleaning measures along with improved hand hygiene was associated with less surface contamination with vre cleaner healthcare worker hands and a significant reduction in vre cross-transmission among patients the authors concluded that decreasing environmental contamination might help to control the spread of vre in hospitals85 introducing an educational programme contact precautions and reinforcement of environmental cleaning was the response to escalating vre cases in a brazilian hospital86 enhanced cleaning emphasised use of bleach for bathroom surfaces and 70 alcohol for furniture and patient equipment the overall package helped prevent dissemination of vre throughout the hospital including intensive care with a decrease in attack rate from 149 to 033 p  000186 bleach-based terminal cleaning was used for an earlier study to control vre in a haemato-oncology unit again as part of an intervention package84
another package of interventions including extensive cleaning of environmental surfaces and environmental cultures was implemented in three icus by a team in south korea87 during the outbreak a total of 50 patients with vre were identified by clinical and surveillance cultures and 46 had vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium vref pfge analysis of vref isolates during the initial two months disclosed six types and clusters of two major types environmental surfaces were rigorously cleaned three times a day using 5 sodium hypochlorite the outbreak was terminated 5 months after implementation of the interventions with the weekly prevalence rate reduced from 91100 to 06100 patient-days and rectal acquisition rate down from 69100 to 0100 patient-days87
the benefits of cleaning for control of c difficile are well established88

89 following a rise in c difficile cases one hospital introduced enhanced cleaning with hypochlorite into two icus90 one of the icus applied the extra cleaning to all areas including rooms used solely by staff and sensitive clinical equipment was wiped over twice daily using hypochlorite-impregnated cloths the other unit introduced the intensive hypochlorite clean into isolation rooms housing patients already infected with c difficile rates of infection decreased in both units over several months and appeared to be maintained at a lower rate for at least 2 years after the cleaning intervention despite some relaxation of the initial regimen90
increased rates of c difficile infection cdi in three american hospitals prompted terminal room cleaning of those affected with dilute bleach instead of the usual quaternary ammonium compound91 all surfaces floor to ceiling were wiped with dilute bleach applied with towels to thoroughly wet the surfaces the prevalence density of c difficile fell by 48 with a sustained and significant reduction on the rate of nosocomial cdi another group implemented daily cleaning with 055 bleach wipes on two medical wards with a high incidence of c difficile
92 pre-intervention there was a total of 31 new cases of c difficile on the wards after the cleaning strategy there were 4 cases on these wards over the following year representing a 7-fold decrease in cases of c difficile there were no other interventions introduced other than targeted cleaning with bleach wipes92
use of chlorine-releasing disinfectants in rooms contaminated with c difficile spores reduces the number of spores in the environment with some evidence to suggest that this reduces the risk of recurrence and spread c difficile-associated disease of cdad93 evidence is strongest for products with higher concentrations of disinfecting agents eg 5000 mgl free chlorine the benefits of chlorine use might be greater in units where rates of cdad are high eg geriatric rehabilitation or assessment units or in response to outbreaks additionally effectiveness of cleaning agents used in the hospital environment on levels of spores and more important rates of cdad might be related to training and time-constraints of cleaning staff93

94
the importance of cleaning in controlling outbreaks of acinetobacter spp has been emphasised in previous studies95 96 97 one of these describes an outbreak caused by multiply resistant strains of a baumannii involving more than 30 patients in two icus96 environmental contamination was recognised as an important reservoir of the epidemic strains and the outbreak ceased only after both icus were closed for terminal cleaning and disinfection96 another study examined the levels of environmental contamination with acinetobacter in a neurosurgical icu during a prolonged outbreak98 near-patient hand-touch sites frequently yielded the epidemic strain and there was a significant association between the amount of environmental contamination and patient colonisation the conclusion was that high standards of cleaning play an integral role in controlling outbreaks of acinetobacter in the intensive care setting although little is known about the best way to clean in non-outbreak settings98
a further study describes what happened following the introduction of bedside computers in a paediatric burns ward37 there was a sudden increase in the number of patients acquiring acinetobacter and environmental screening demonstrated the organism on various surfaces in the patients rooms especially the plastic covers on the computer keyboards targeted infection control measures that included the use of gloves before using the computer and thorough disinfection of the plastic covers effectively terminated the outbreak before the outbreak occurred no one had thought to include the computers in a routine cleaning specification37
a 3-year prospective study was conducted in intensive care and coronary care units to evaluate interventions including contact isolation precautions hand hygiene active surveillance cohorting patients colonised or infected with pandrug-resistant a baumannii and environmental cleaning with 1100 sodium hypochlorite99 the rate of a baumannii colonisation andor infection was 36 cases per 1000 patient-days before the intervention one year after the intervention the rate of a baumannii colonization andor infection decreased by 66 to 12 cases per 1000 patient-days p  001 and two years later by 76 to 085 cases per 1000 patient-days p  00199
the importance of cleaning in controlling outbreaks of gram-negative microorganisms other than acinetobacter is difficult to ascertain given that enhanced cleaning usually comes as part of an overall package in response to cross-infection or outbreak despite this there is general consensus that environmental cleanliness is important for controlling infection certainly the literature is littered with reports of outbreaks of coliforms traced to discrete pieces of equipment specific environmental site or particular product or practice1 this is probably because terminating an outbreak caused by single source contamination is a lot easier than implementing a routine cleaning regimen that prevents infection from a multitude of general surfaces identification of a single reservoir and eradicating it usually curtails the outbreak28

100 101 102
persistent reservoirs of resistant klebsiella pneumoniae were traced to multiple contaminated sink components in an aberdeen teaching hospital100 more recently four patients in a neurosurgical itu became infected or colonised with extended-spectrum -lactamase-esbc-producing k pneumoniae over a period over 7 months102 an investigation revealed that the source of this outbreak was also a contaminated sink by replacing the sink and its plumbing and improving routines regarding sink usage and cleaning the outbreak was terminated102 biofilm-forming k pneumoniae strains such as those demonstrating prolonged survival in plumbing components are more likely to produce esbls103
another outbreak of resistant k pneumoniae among neonates highlights the risks of reusing disposable equipment101 the investigation showed that most of the babies were infected a few days after birth or just after hospitalisation the only common feature was that those presenting with respiratory distress received mucus aspiration a few days before becoming symptomatic although a new aspiration tube was used for each case the tubes had been rinsed in tap water between each aspiration for the same baby this tap water was not changed between babies and the bowl used was not properly cleaned either the tap water was found to be contaminated with the same type of k pneumoniae101
the lack of evidence for benefits from general surface cleaning alone is well recognised even as a response to an outbreak104 there is one recent report emphasising additional cleaning following the identification of a carbapenemase-producing k pneumoniae in a ward in a uk hospital105 chlorine-based cleaning was implemented throughout the ward including patient-related items enhanced cleaning was only part of the overall infection control package however along with a urinary catheter care bundle patient note tagging hand hygiene emphasis and contact precautions for patient cases105 another report describes an educational intervention to improve hand hygiene and environmental cleaning in an 11-bedded icu106 the number of patients colonised with esbl enterobacteriaciae during a three month pre-intervention period decreased from 70 to 40 during a post-intervention period although it is possible that the initial high proportion of colonised patients represented an underlying outbreak106

pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas originating from water outlets have the potential to colonise and infect patients despite a lack of evidence for specific transmission pathways107 only one previous report details transmission of p aeruginosa from sinks to hands during handwashing27 whilst survival on dry surfaces may be only transient persistent reservoirs of these organisms can be traced to biofilm within sink components water lines and hospital drains13

108 this complex living deposit on internal plumbing surfaces hosts and protects a multitude of water-loving organisms some of which pose a threat to debilitated patients particularly those in itu bacteria within biofilm are more likely to be able to withstand chlorine and other types of disinfectants along with greater capacity for antimicrobial resistance109
various outbreak investigations have shown that recovery of pathogens from water sources surrounding surfaces and patient isolates demonstrate indistinguishable strains of pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas

110

111 an outbreak of burkholderia cepacia on a paediatric unit was attributed to sinks possibly linked with the presence of aerator filters fitted to the taps112 tap aerators have also been shown to be a source of patient colonisation with stenotrophomonas maltophilia
26 for this reason aerators should be replaced with flow straighteners in healthcare premises disinfection using chlorinated products without disruption of biofilm only offers limited control a comprehensive cleaning initiative is required to physically remove the biofilm lining the surfaces of affected plumbing components111

113 these are often difficult to access and require close collaboration between estates and domestic staff complete eradication is almost impossible but regular cleaning and disinfection with chlorine products will hinder further cases if it is part of a long-term maintenance programme4

107
the importance of environmental cleaning in the control of outbreaks of norovirus is widely accepted114

115 all general cleaning especially toilet and bathroom areas should use a chlorine-containing disinfectant or bleach at a specified concentration detergent-based cleaning often fails to eradicate the virus from the environment56 one study recently reported indistinguishable genotypes of norovirus from both patient and environmental sources including detection of viable virus in the environment following terminal cleaning17 the authors found expected reservoirs near toilets in bathrooms but also on numerous types of clinical equipment eg pulse and blood pressure machine alcohol gel containers and near-patient sites persistence of viral reservoirs means that new admissions will be exposed to norovirus and with current pressures to reduce the length of stay there is a higher throughput of increasing numbers of patients vulnerable to norovirus17 without scrupulous cleaning attention outbreaks will quickly resumeoutside hospitals norovirus outbreaks can be devastating in closed or semi-closed communities116 these include sudden and extensive outbreaks in hotels or prisons but outbreaks can also occur in nursing and residential homes cruise-ships and schools117

118 an outbreak reported recently in a primary school involved 79 pupils and 24 members of staff118 subsequent investigation of the outbreak showed that person-to-person contact was a major factor in the transmission of the virus but there was evidence that the environment was also implicated a strain of norovirus indistinguishable from patient strains was isolated from a computer keyboard and mouse in one particular classroom despite cleaning with bleach the previous day public health officials recommended hand hygiene exclusion of symptomatic persons and thorough environmental disinfection with a diluted 150 concentration bleach solution to include sites that were not commonly cleaned118
there is not much point in implementing comprehensive cleaning schedules if cleaning agents or equipment themselves are contaminated poor choice of cleaning methods or agents or inadequate maintenance of equipment will result in environmental contamination of the very surfaces that need attention there are numerous examples of different types of cleaning cloths including microfibre products that spread microbes across surfaces rather than removing them56

73

119 120 121 cleaning equipment may also become contaminated with hospital pathogens and disperse these into the hospital environment1

28

122

123 disinfectants are more effective at killing pathogens than in-use detergents but some hospital pathogens can resist bactericidal effect of a particular agent124 both multi-drug resistant s marcescens and extremely-drug-resistant strains of k pneumoniae have demonstrated increasing tolerance to chlorhexidine125

126 other cleaning fluids can become contaminated with gram-negative bacilli during use indeed some formulations may encourage acquisition of resistance elements by gram-negative organisms127

128
microorganisms use an inadequately cleaned niche to exchange genetic material coding for antimicrobial resistance and other survival mechanisms including resistance or tolerance to disinfectants129

130 once established these hardy strains will ultimately infect debilitated patients130 hospital waste water has been shown to harbour kpc-2-producing k pneumoniae suggesting widespread contamination throughout the healthcare environment131
various scientific methods to measure environmental soil have been devised since visual inspection cannot ascertain the infection risk for patients2 a validated and risk assessed technique is needed to determine cleanliness rather than the subjective assessment currently provided by visual inspection and clipboards chemical atp bioluminescence and microbiological methods have been utilised by the food industry for years and have been tested in hospitals2

3 measurements from these systems have provided a range of values to model against patient risk from these it might be possible to choose an appropriate benchmark for routine monitoring hospital staff need to know exactly which levels are acceptable for patient safety purposes2 3 4

132
currently aerobic colony counts of  255 colony forming units cfu per cm2 on hand-touch sites have been tested as microbiological benchmarks2

3

39

59

132 133 134 these levels have not been standardised for use in hospitals but similar counts have been established in the food industry retail and food manufacturers plus additional agencies also use microbiological standards incorporating the presence of indicator organisms identification of which depends upon risk to human health from the medium monitored135

136 since coagulase-positive staphylococci provide a reliable indicator of environmental hygiene studies examining the utility of microbiological standards in hospitals have chosen both staph aureus and mrsa to help monitor cleanliness3

39

132 133 134

137
atp systems have varying benchmarks depending upon the type of luminometer used these range from 25 to 500 relative light units rlus for 10100 cm2 on hospital surfaces 133

134

138 but there is concern that some systems are not sufficiently sensitive to detect very low microbial counts  10 cfucm2139

140 one study found that benchmark categories of 100 rlus and microbial growth  25 cfucm2 were loosely associated since there was approximately 60 agreement between them on whether a surface should pass or fail134 clearly more work needs to be done on finding the most appropriate method for detecting microbial soil141 atp measurements can be confounded by food and drink residues disinfectants microfibre products and manufactured plastics found in the cleaning and laundering industries2

141

142 chosen benchmarks should reflect patient risk surfaces in outpatient clinics are not necessarily as critical for infection risk as sites beside a ventilated patient receiving intensive care once these benchmarks are established routine monitoring should be able to indicate trends in hospital cleanliness and workload and most importantly when enhanced cleaning activity is required before patients are exposed to serious risk of infection or even an outbreak132

133
there are alternative methods of environmental assessment notably cleaning inspections education monitoring and feedback all of which encourage enhanced performance by housekeepers placing invisible fluorescent markers at key sites for later inspection and feedback for domestic staff also improves overall cleaning compliance along with reduction of key hospital pathogens143 use of atp monitoring demonstrates pronounced effect on cleaners when they received concomitant educational guidance138 domestic staff react quickly to an environmental monitoring programme because they are concerned that their jobs may be at risk4

85 further studies have demonstrated differing effects between direct observation supervision and education of staff as they clean again showing reduction of important hospital pathogens144 145 146 there is a concern that these interventions might lose impact over time since cleaning is physically demanding poorly paid and subject to inadequate staffing147 hence training and continual evidence-based reassessment are required as part of staff developmentnew methods for environmental decontamination are constantly appearing on the market disinfectants tend to be expensive and environmentally unfriendly148 some formulations persist in the water courses underlying towns and cities and exert long-term effects on other biological systems this has encouraged greener alternatives particularly those that ultimately degrade into harmless components examples include ultra-heated steam electrolysed water ozone and hydrogen peroxide amongst others149 150 151 152 electrolysed water products have already shown potential for decontamination of the healthcare environment153

154
in addition to these are novel cleaning materials and equipment such as microfibre scrubbing machines microbicidal gases vapours and anti-fogging or mist systems ultraviolet uv light-emitting devices air ionisers and a range of high-pressure steam cleaners152

155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 a recent paper describes the effect of a newly developed portable pulsed ultraviolet uv radiation device on bactericidal activity and its impact on the labour burden when implemented in a hospital ward161 the use of pulsed uv in daily disinfection of housekeeping surfaces reduced the working hours by half in comparison with manual disinfection using ethanol wipes161
there are new types of antimicrobial coatings available for linen equipment furniture and general surfaces such floors walls and doors163

164 practically anything that can be impregnated with chemicals or coated with microbicidal paint could potentially be marketed as antibacterial for healthcare environments bioactive surfaces or coatings can contain heavy metals or their derivatives such as copper zinc silver or titanium or antiseptics and biocides165 166 167 168 169 170 there is evidence that coating near-patient hand-touch sites with copper reduces organisms such as mrsa and consequently the risk of hai169

171
there are also electrostatic and inhibitory surfaces that repel microbial adhesion and even coatings marketed as self-cleaning163

172 different variations on a theme appear at frequent intervals using ever more innovative technology one recent example is a coating of nano-silver particles combined with titanium dioxide to form highly reactive tio2 ag particles173 this invisible protective nanocoating can be applied onto a range of surfaces under low temperatures which means that virtually all environmental surfaces in a hospital could theoretically be treated173
numerous guidelines emphasise the importance of cleaning but offer little practical advice on how to achieve this or how often sites should receive cleaning attention microbial reservoirs are likely to fluctuate at different sites throughout the day however delivered viable organisms will persist according to their capacity for survival unless removed by an effective cleaning regimen even if cleaning occurs on a regular basis pathogens may recontaminate surfaces or equipment immediately after the cleaning process174 175 176 using agents or surfaces with residual microbiocidal activity to repel contamination would mean that hand hygiene might not be quite so critical although staff should obviously not abandon their hand washing54

177

178 provided such products could be shown to function as postulated without significant toxicity surface cleaning might also become less of an issue although as with clinical staff and hand hygiene routine cleaning practices should still be retained alternatively a high-frequency cleaning regimen would theoretically discourage the accumulation of potential pathogens continually deposited on surfaces179
despite future promise from these products traditional cleaning methods should not be relaxed or abandoned even if the whole hospital is treated to novel cleaning methods or coated with bioactive veneer30 no one single process will remove all relevant microbial soil from the hospital there have already been problems reported with some of the methods mentioned such as microfibre steam cleaning ozone hydrogen peroxide and high-intensity light irradiation121

174

180 181 182 183 184 furthermore concern remains over activity of disinfectants in the field since laboratory testing does not necessarily predict what happens on hospital surfaces185 there are always toxicity and cost issues to consider and potential cross-resistance between disinfectants antiseptics and antimicrobial agents148

186
all novel cleaning methods require a comprehensive assessment in association with patient outcome before widespread adoption in healthcare systems cash-strapped hospitals should not invest in potentially toxic andor expensive cleaning methods or agents without good reason it goes without saying that traditional detergent-based cleaning should also receive a full and thorough appraisal79 it is possible that simply increasing the cleaning frequency of established high-risk sites with detergent could be a crucial factor in reducing infection risk rather than an expensive and potentially toxic biocide79

179
microbiological screening has demonstrated numerous types of pathogen surviving throughout our hospitals there is evidence to show that these resilient organisms pose a real and substantive infection risk for patients the cleaning process could potentially have a huge impact on this risk if it is aimed at the most frequently contaminated sites physically removes or kills viable organisms and takes place a sufficient number of times to inhibit the accumulation of pathogens delivered by air or hands whilst there are a flourishing number of novel disinfectants antimicrobial surfaces and equipment now on the market few have been properly assessed against patient infection risk and potential toxicity represents a long-term environmental threat establishing risk-based standards for all surfaces throughout the hospital would allow monitoring measurement and scientific evaluation for the benefit of all patients and staff187 frequent application of detergent-based cleaning requires urgent appraisal in order to be able to adequately and comprehensively compare future alternatives for cleaning our hospitalsover the past two decades there has been mounting interest in the increasing number of viruses causing unexpected illness and epidemics among humans wildlife and livestock all too often outbreaks have seriously stretched both local and national resources at a time when health-care spending in the economically developed world has been constrained importantly capacity to identify and control emerging diseases remains limited in poorer regions where many of these diseases have their originemerging disease is a term used with increasing frequency to describe the appearance of an as yet unrecognized infection or a previously recognized infection that has expanded into a new ecological niche or geographical zone and often accompanied by a significant change in pathogenicity1 the key message is that these are representative of constantly evolving infections responding to rapid changes in the relationship between pathogen and hostamong 1400 pathogens of humans over 50 of these have their origins in animal species that is are diseases or infections naturally transmitted between vertebrates and humans world health organization according to woolhouse and colleague2 emerging or re-emerging pathogens are far more likely to be zoonotic viruses are over-represented in this group moreover viruses with rna genomes account for a third of all emerging and re-emerging infections emerging pathogens are typically those with a broad host range often spanning several mammalian orders almost certainly many of these infections have been the result of the development of agricultural practices and urbanization figure 1recent interest in emerging infections has focused on three key areas first how the interplay of climate environment and human societal pressures can trigger unexpected outbreaks of emerging disease second the understanding of how viruses can transmit between a reservoir and new host species third identifying those aspects of the disease process that offer opportunities for therapy and prevention to these must be added a broader understanding of how viruses evolve over time clues to which are now being uncovered through looking closely at genetic elements of the host genome responsible for resisting virus invasion meeting these objectives will provide a more rigorous basis for predicting virus emergenceour environment is changing on an unprecedented scale climate change needs to be distinguished from climate variation change is where there is statistically significant variation from the mean state over a prolonged period of timethe most notable manifestations have been the increasing climatic conditions initiated by changes in sea surface temperatures in the pacific known as the el nio southern oscillation in the summer of 1990 an el nio event occurred which in turn led to a period of prolonged drought in many regions of the americas and the emergence of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome conversely a sudden reversal in sea temperature in the summer of 1995 resulted in heavy rainfalls especially in columbia resulting in resurgence of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue and equine encephalitisvector-borne diseases are judged as highly sensitive to climatic conditions although the evidence for climatic change and altered epidemiology of vector-borne disease is generally regarded as particularly sensitive to temperature even a small extension of a transmission season may have a disproportionate affect as transmission rates rise exponentially rather than linearly as the season progresses climatic change can also bring about altered vector distributions if suitable areas for expansion become newly available again the effect may be disproportionate particularly if the vector transmits disease to human or animal populations without pre-existing levels of acquired immunity with the result that those clinical cases are more numerous and potentially more severe increased temperatures and seasonal fluctuations in either rainfall or temperature favor the spread of vector-borne diseases to higher elevations and to more temperate latitudes56
aedes aegypti a major vector of dengue is limited to distribution by the 10 c winter isotherm but this is shifting so threatening an expansion of disease ever northward7the relentless change inflicted by humans on habitats in the name of progress has also had a marked effect on rodent habitats outbreaks of bolivian hemorrhagic fever in bolivia and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the united states have been clearly associated with abnormal periods of drought or rainfall leading to unusually rapid increases in rodent numbers of all species of mammals rodents are among the most adaptable to comparatively sudden changes in climate and environmental conditions small climatic changes can bring about considerable fluctuations in population size inhabiting desert and semidesert areas particularly in food quantity and quality a prolonged drought in the early 1990s in the four corners region of the united states led to a sharp decline in the numbers of rodent predators such as coyotes snakes and birds of prey but at the end of the drought heavy rainfall resulted in an explosion in pion nuts and grasshopper populations which in turn resulted in a rapid escalation of rodent numbers among them deer mice carrying hantavirusesa similar set of circumstances occurred in the beni region of bolivia in the 1960s when a period of prolonged drought was followed by rain an exponential rise in the numbers of calomys callosus field voles followed exacerbated by the use of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt in use at that time to reduce mosquito numbers this had the unfortunate consequence of reducing the local peridomestic cat population that had hitherto kept feral rodent numbers in check the consequence of these sharp climatic changes was the emergence of bolivian hemorrhagic fever caused by the arenavirus machupo this pattern of severe oscillations of rain and drought markedly affect murine species and insect vector numbers and act as an indicator that disease emergence may occur in the period following such changes a similar pattern of events occurred in 1994 when in venezuela an outbreak of what originally thought was due to dengue virus was in fact another example of the emergence of a novel arenavirus8evolving in the old world murines are a comparatively recent introduction into the new world most probably via the bering land isthmus some 2030 million years ago whilst other rodents have declined in number murine rodents have thrived especially in peri-urban areas this means that although species diversity has become less with fewer genera represented those remaining have multiplied many times over it is among species of the family muridae that reservoir hosts of arenaviruses and hantaviruses are to be found in south americadeforestation has accelerated exponentially since the beginning of the twentieth century and in the amazonian basin and parts of southeast asia has had a profound effect on local ecosystems particularly by constraining the range of natural predators instrumental in keeping rodents insects and other potential carriers of infectious disease under control9 the reduction in biological diversity can trigger the invasion and spread of opportunistic species heralding the emergence of disease through increased contact with local human populationsarthropod-borne infections such as congo-crimean hemorrhagic fever could pose a substantial risk to both humans and livestock in europe should climatic conditions raise further the ambient spring temperature infected immature ticks carried on migratory birds would molt in much greater numbers although such an enhancement in molting might be offset by a significant reduction in the number of migratory birds10air travel represents a major risk factor for the global spread of a new infectious agent it is estimated that over 100 million passenger journeys by air are made every year it is feasible to visit as many as three continents in a few hours this is in marked contrast to just 50 years ago when many people rarely if ever traveled any distance from their place of residence frequent air travel is now regarded as a major contributing factor to the spread of emerging diseases this is vividly illustrated by examining the rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars virus in 2003 when the infection was disseminated from china to at least 17 countries in less than a week based on the events of 2003 hufnagel11 have designed a mathematical model that simulates accurately the spread of sars virus to countries that experienced four or more cases the utility of having a model means that once preliminary data are available a prediction can be made as to those regions most at risk moreover the work shows how difficulty if would be to contain an outbreak by vaccination alone were one available once the statistical information is available such a model can be used to predict those regions most at risk in the event of any future sars epidemic were a vaccine available the initial spread of virus might be contained if only a third of the population were immunized in the regions where the outbreak is focused this assumes an index case made a single air journey however this increases substantially to 75 in the event of an index case making two journeys with the whole population requiring vaccination if the same passenger made three trips analysis of air traffic from mexico at the start of the 2009 influenza h1n1 pandemic suggests the risk of spread is particularly great when the volume of air traffic is high but resources to report and trace diseased individuals is restricted12ground transport offers a more favorable route for transmission approximately 17 of all ravel in europe is by public ground transport in contrast air travel represents less than 02 of all passenger kilometers traveled13 in contrast to airliners public trains buses etc are rarely fitted with high efficiency particulate air hepa filtersit is not only humans that travel the international air transport association estimate that around 80 000 wild-caught animals are air freighted each year many being placed in holding facilities close to populated areas whilst in transit even mosquitoes may be carried it is thought that west nile virus wnv entered the united states as a result of an infected mosquito surviving the air journey from the middle east to new york city in 199914the incursion of wnv into north america is an excellent example of a virus expanding into an ecological niche where transmission-competent vectors are already present once established in and around the new york area the availability of vertebrate hosts most notably corvids together with optimal climatic conditions for vector populations enabled the rapid spread of wnv across the united states epizootic outbreaks have occurred frequently with an escalating number of neurological cases among the immunocompromised and the elderly15among all species of mammals members of the family muridae have been the most successful and are found in almost all habitats this family has species that are the natural hosts of almost all arenaviruses and hantaviruses as noted above rodents are highly susceptible to climate and ecological change resulting in variable population numbers among the fastest reproducing mammals field voles can have over 15 broods per year each with an average of six pups this in turn considerably increases the risk of human exposure to any pathogens they may carry as well as stimulating such pathogens to undergo mutational adaptations to the changing ecosystems rodents thrive on contaminated food and water and are excellent swimmers that rodents constitute an important part of the earths biomass is manifested by estimates of rodents consuming at least a fifth of the worlds output of grainthe preeminent property of the arenaviruses is the establishment of a long-term chronic infection in their principle murine reservoir although rodents are divided into over 30 families worldwide arenaviruses are found mainly within two rodent families the muridae and cricetidae eg field voles lemmings gerbils each arenavirus is not necessarily found distributed throughout the populations of any particular host reservoir howeverthe natural reservoirs of the old world arenaviruses are members of the genera mastomys and praomys these rodents included within the family muridae frequent human dwellings and food stores and as a result humans become infected through exposure to the rodents urine nearly all arenaviruses found in the americas are associated with cricetid rodents of open grasslands and foresthantaviruses have emerged as major causes of zoonotic diseases again associated with exposure to rodents belonging to the family muridae there is a tight relationship between virus and its native rodent host with each rodent species being infected with a single virus outbreaks of human disease are thus intimately related to the geographical distribution of the host reservoirthe agent of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is associated with the murine species apodemus agrarius a common field rodent found throughout most of the northern hemisphere this rodent invades outbuildings and food stores entering homes when rodent numbers increase as a result of changing environmental factors for example abnormal rainfall this is best exemplified by the emergence of sin nombre virus in the four corners region of the united states in 1993 the causative agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome the emergence of this agent was totally unexpectedthe four corners outbreak instigated intensive research into how fluctuations of rodent populations precipitate outbreaks of human disease abnormal weather patterns and increased rainfall results in a dramatic increase in the vegetation providing food for rodents thus the environment is able to suddenly sustain a rapidly expanding number of animals as population sizes explode the chances of rodents encroaching into peridomestic areas and households also increases especially when the over abundance of food comes to an end as a consequence there is a rise in the incidence of human illness as individuals have a much greater chance of coming into contact with excreta from persistently infected animals the chance of virus switching into other rodent species also becomes a greater possibility as rodent territories expand and overlapswitching to a new rodent host can have a profound effect on virus evolution adaptation of hantaviruses to new hosts can stimulate the development of new virus phenotypes and hence expansion into new ecological niches examples of this include the divergence of saaremaa virus from dobrava virus nemirov et al17 have suggested this has been the consequence of dobrava virus switching from yellow-striped field mouse apodemusflavicollis to a agrarius the striped field mouse the result is a virus with presumed reduced pathogenicity for humans other examples of host switching include transmission of monongahela virus from peromyscus maniculatis to p leucopus eventually giving rise to new york virus18 and the crossing of puumala virus from clethrionomys species to lemmus species and onto microtus species giving rise to the topografov and khabarovsk virus lineages19during an investigation of the 1998 hendra virus outbreak in queensland australia it was noticed that grazing horses often sought shelter under trees containing bat roosts wild fruit bats in such roosts were found positive for virus and neutralizing antibodies found in otherwise healthy bats20 similarly the related nipah virus found in malaysia and bangladesh has also been associated with pteropus bats youngsters had been exposed to the secretions of fruit bats when picking fruit or processing date palm oil from bat-infested treesbats have long since been known as the principal hosts of lyssaviruses with distinct phylogenetic differences for example between rabies virus strains circulating in bats and terrestrial mammals such as foxes raccoons and dogs the link between genetic variability and spatial epidemiology among the lyssaviruses gives a particularly good insight as to how viruses of wildlife can adapt and emerge into different animal populations rabies virus in europe has switched host many times over the past century adapting rapidly to new hosts as the virus expands into new species with time rabid bats exhibit abnormal behavior losing their natural fear of humans and thus present a greater risk of transmission to humans despite the availability of vaccines and post-exposure prophylaxis rabies remains a major zoonotic threat21given the increasing evidence of bats as reservoirs of emerging infections22 it is worth considering the evolution and diversity of these mammals nearly 1000 species are distributed throughout the world with the majority in areas close to the equator where food sources are most abundant belonging to the mammalian order chiroptera bats are broadly divisible into the old world fruit-eating bats 180 species suborder megachiroptera and the microbatssome 800 species grouped into 17 families within the suborder microchiroptera insectivorous bats are all microbats bats evolved around 50 million years ago with the fruit bats evolving along a very different path to the insect-eating species bats are found in most terrestrial habitats with species distribution varying widely some being restricted to a single island others being found across continents among the latter is miniopterus schreibersii from which negredo et al23 isolated lloviu virus from a cave in north-eastern spain schreibers bats are found throughout southern europe as far south as south africa and as far east as japanfruit-eating bats are not normally cave dwelling normally forming roosts in tree-tops or crevices in decaying trees and thus present opportunities for spread to humans many bats travel long distances for food especially fruit-eating species who respond to ever varying supply of food and who must compete with birds and other animals flights covering distances of 1520 miles from the roost is the norm although some species will forage over a distance of 30 miles in a single night while both insectivorous and fruit eating bats have been shown to harbor zoonotic viruses fruit-eating bats represent the biggest risk for human contact most of the flesh of fruit is discarded from the mouth of feeding animals thus providing ample opportunity for virus spreadseveral species hypsignathus monstrosus epomops fraqueti myonycteris torquata have been successfully infected with ebola virus sustaining the presence of virus in organs and blood for as long as 3 weeks asymptomatic ebola virus infection has been reported in insectivorous bats trapped in central africa and recent exposure to fruit bats has been a feature of at least one outbreak24
rousettus aegyptiacus is one species in which antibodies to both marburg and ebola viruses have been found rousettus species are the exception despite being fruit-eaters these bats form roosts deep within caves marburg virus sequences have also been found in wild-caught rhinolophus eloquens and miniopterus inflatus25 intriguingly filovirus elements have been found in some mammalian species leading to the suggestion that filoviruses have co-evolved with their mammalian hosts over many millennia26pigs have been implicated in several outbreaks of emerging infections starting in september 1998 clusters of human cases of encephalitis began to be reported from the malaysian states of perak and negri sembilan by far the most extensive outbreak was in the village of sungai nipah near the city of bukit polandok almost all of the cases had a direct link to the local piggeries and coincided with accounts of illness amongst pigs 1 to 2 weeks beforehand a total of 265 cases were notified with mortality approaching 40 in march 1999 infection developed in 11 singaporean abattoir workers handing pig carcasses one of which proved fatal initially these outbreaks were believed due to japanese encephalitis je but a number of cases had been vaccinated previously against je virus and there was no evidence of je virus antibodies among the remainder the link with hendra virus soon followed after the isolation of virus from an infected pig farmer the new agent now named nipah virus after the locality it was first reported shares 80 sequence homology with hendra virus with both viruses now being regarded as members of the henipaviruses within the paramyxoviridae family it is clear that nipah virus is widely distributed across northeast india bangladesh and southeast asia with phylogenetic analyses revealing the virus to be diverging within specific geographical localitiessince balayan et al27 first showed that pigs could be infected with hepatitis e virus hev there has been interest in the zoonotic potential of this agent especially in rural areas of the indian subcontinent where a high mortality rate is frequently observed amongst pregnant women hev appears ubiquitous in pigs and poultry regardless as to whether there is evidence of infection in the local community pigs become infected around 3 months of age but suffer only a mild transient infectionthe worldwide distribution of infected pigs means there is ample opportunity for transmission especially in southeast asia where most pigs are kept in family smallholdings antibody prevalence as a result is higher than compared to the general population for example hsieh et al28 found 27 of taiwanese pig handlers were seropositive compared to 8 in the general population swine had become infected by the fecaloral route with pig feces containing large quantities of virus it is not clear whether humans have been directly infected via this route or if there is a common source or reservoircross-species transmission is likely to be dependent upon genotype most swine isolates are genotype 3 or 4 whereas the majority of human infections are of genotype 1 and 2 pigs are not alone in being susceptible to hev with various reports of rats lambs dogs cats goats cattle and chickens also being susceptible chicken isolates are only 62 identical in genome sequence with human and swine isolates leading to the suggestion that hev in poultry may represent a distinct genus29 as with swine hev serological studies have shown that approximately 70 of poultry flocks in the united states are infected with hev30 there is no evidence of transmission from poultry to humans but of course this could change especially since work so far has shown isolates are genetically heterogeneous and thus adaptation could readily occurswine in the philippines have been found to act as reservoirs for reston virus a filovirus related to ebola and marburg viruses this was discovered during an unusually severe outbreak of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome reston virus was first identified in 1990 among non-human primates imported from the philippines to several primate handling facilities in the united states and europe but in contrast to its african relatives reston virus does not appear to cause human illness although there is ample evidence of reston viral antibodies in primate holding facilities31 and among those working with swine32pigs are susceptible to human avian and swine influenza viruses and thus play an important role in the epidemiology of human influenza influenza a virus is one of the comparatively few viral respiratory pathogens of pigs currently three subtypes circulate in swine h1n1 h1n2 and h3n2 in contrast to human influenza the properties of swine influenza differ from region to region the predominant subtype in europe is of avian origin most likely introduced into pigs in 1979 from wild aquatic birds such as ducks in contrast there are two distinct subtypes circulating in north america the classical h1n1 subtype introduced into pigs shortly after the 1918 human pandemic and the second a reassortment between h1n1 with either h3n2 or h1n1 virusesdomesticated pigs have often been regarded as a mixing vessel for influenza viruses and reassortment of the seven viral gene segments presenting an opportunity for new human strains to arise until 2009 however swine influenza was not regarded as a significant cause of serious disease in humans cases of human infection began to emerge towards the end of april 2009 in what is normally regarded as the influenza season in the northern hemisphere beginning first in mexico the new virus subtype often referred to as swine flu by the popular press spread rapidly throughout the world in a matter of weeksanalyses of human isolates quickly showed the unusual nature of this swine-origin influenza virus as being a triple reassortment virus containing genes from avian human and classical swine influenza viruses the ancestors of this virus had probably been circulating in pig populations for over 10 years but had remained undetected33 at the time there was considerable uncertainty as to the pathogenic potential of this virus but data soon showed the severity for humans to be less than that seen with the 1918 pandemic but on a par with the 1957 hong kong pandemic transmissibility appeared higher than is normally the case for seasonal influenza with a higher than normal attack rate importantly younger age groups appeared more susceptible possibly due to partial immunity among older cohorts as a result of being infected during previous pandemicsfrequent contact with companion animals such as dogs cats and horses provide additional opportunities for the transmission of animal diseases to humans although companion animals have been kept within households over the centuries the number of known emerging infections from such sources is remarkably few dogs in particular have been domesticated for over 8000 years and occupy a prominent position in the daily life of many societies search for the cause of respiratory disease in dogs is thus a particular focus for veterinary virologists and the application of modern molecular screening techniques has uncovered a number of canine homologues of human viruses the discovery of a canine flavivirus distantly related human hepatitis c virus hcv raises some intriguing questions as to the origin of hcv in human populations34 although evidence was found of virus in the canine liver there is as yet no evidence of this canine hepatitis c-like virus causing liver disease in dogs whether or not hcv first emerged from dogs remains speculative but the finding of virus in the respiratory secretions of infected dogs certainly indicates a ready route of transmission to humansthe finding of novel flavivirus in dogs has promoted a search for related viruses in other companion animal species by first generating a serological assay using expressed ns3 protein from the canine flavivirus burbelo et al35 have recently found a related virus in eight of 36 seropositive horses belonging to owners in the state of new york there was no supporting evidence of clinical disease among all the animals tested this does not preclude a pathogenic potential for humans of course as with the canine flavivirus described above any persistence of the newly described virus appears to be much lower than the average 50 seen in humans infected with hcv whether or not hcv originates in evolutionary terms from either dogs or humans studies indicate that hcv most likely originated from animal species a conclusion that has hitherto been difficult to accept as hcv does not cause disease in non-human primates as is the case with hepatitis b and other causes of viral hepatitiswild animals held or bred in captivity have long fascinated human societies there is an increasing trend particularly in more affluent economic countries to keep wild animals as pets it is estimated that approximately 350 000 wild caught animals are traded around the world each year adding to the risk of potentially zoonotic infections crossing the species barrier into humans the finding of a new arenavirus in boa constrictors boa constrictor suffering from snake inclusion body disease36 has raised interesting questions as to how common such viruses might be among captive wild animals intriguingly sequence data from this arenavirus showed diversity compatible with a pre-existing relationship between host and virus over time moreover sequences were found homologous to those present in arenaviruses causing severe hemorrhagic fever eg lassa virus but surprisingly the snake arenavirus also shared glycoprotein sequences with filoviruses this would suggest there has been segment recombination at some point in time with a filovirus that subsequently evolved to be the ebola and marburg viruses of todaythe keeping of small rodents and mammals has been linked to zoonotic disease for many decades lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus transmitted as a result of handling persistently infected hamsters being a prime example the keeping of prairie dogs is common in the united states and indirectly led in 2003 to an outbreak of monkey pox in the state of wisconsin37 this totally unexpected occurrence was the result of housing prairie dogs intended for sale in close proximity to small rodents imported from the african continent most notable rope squirrels funisciurus spp and gambian giant rats cricetomys spp although there were not fatalities among the 81 reported cases it presented an opportunity for the spread of monkey pox into the feral mammal population of north america it remains to be seen if wild animals become a source of monkey pox outbreaks in years to come38a worrying complication is the emergence of mild human infections due to vaccinia virus successfully used in the control and eradication of smallpox transmitted from herds of diary cattle in brazil and in buffaloes in india these instances of feral vaccinia may have originated from human vaccines being inadvertently introduced into livestock from whence the virus has been reintroduced into their keepers to cause a disease resembling cowpox39 there is also evidence for vaccinia virus infection among black howler allouata caraya and capuchin monkeys cebes apella inhabiting the amazonian rainforestviruses must bind to one or more receptors on the surface of the target cell in order to enter and infect cells new diseases can emerge when viruses evolve the ability to bind to either a new receptor in a novel target host species or use the homologue of an existing receptor in a new speciesin 2002 an outbreak of sars coronavirus occurred in hong kong and spread to individuals in 37 countries40 there is wide acceptance that sars-cov crossed into the human population of southern china in 2002 from himalayan civets panguma larvata as well as from racoon dogs nyctereutesprocyonoides and chinese ferret badgers melogalemoschata however there is evidence that at least some of these animal infections were the result of cross-transmission in the wet markets of guangzhou and that wild examples of these species caught in the wild did not show evidence of sars-cov infection more exhaustive studies of wild animal populations found sars-cov in chinese horseshoe bats41 however virus from bats could not be isolated directly in human cells adaptation through palm civets or other species seems to be required before adaptation to humans can occurin order to infect humans sars coronavirus binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor but no bat coronavirus has been shown to use bat or human ace2 as a viral receptor raising questions on the mechanism used by coronaviruses to make the species jump from bats to humans42 mutations in the ace2 receptor-binding domain of the s spike protein particularly substitutions of lysine to asparagine at residue 479 k479n and serine to threonine at amino acid 487 s487t are both required for adaptation to human cells42 recent evolutionary studies have revealed that bats have coevolved with an as yet unknown factor that drove rapid evolution of the residue of bat ace2 that interacts with sars coronavirus and that ace2 utilization preceded the emergence of sars coronavirus capable of infecting humans this virus could have pre-existed in bats or could have been a newly created virus resulting from recombination between two bat coronavirus43 this phenomenon may be widespread in animalpathogen interactions for example studies on the evolution of transferrin receptors in canine species demonstrate that canine parvovirus is a re-emerged and not a novel pathogen in dogs44 these evolutionary studies of cellular receptors provide valuable insight into the factors that govern the evolution of receptor use in cross-species transmissioninfluenza viruses can emerge in new hosts through adaptation of the surface haemagglutinin structures to receptors on the new host plasma membrane influenza a viruses originate in aquatic birds preferentially binding to sialic acid residues on the surface of avian or human cells however avian influenza viruses have a higher affinity for sialic acid linked to the galactose unit via an 23 bond whereas human influenza viruses have a higher affinity for sialic acid linked via an 26 configuration45 this reflects the pathology of the disease in birds where the main target organ is the gastrointestinal tract whereas sialic acid on the human respiratory tract contains predominantly 26 linkages influenza virus preferentially replicates in non-ciliated cells of the upper respiratory tract during the early stages of the human illness whereas avian viruses have a preference for 23 sialic acid-coated ciliated cells found only in the lower respiratory tract receptor specificity therefore does not necessarily mean that cross-species transmission will give rise to the same pathology as seen in the donor speciesalthough much is known regarding the interactions between influenza a viruses and host cell receptors there is considerable subtlety in these interactions that is not yet understood for example influenza h9n2 virus circulates widely in birds throughout asia yet does not seem to cause significant human morbidity despite an increased affinity for sialic acid linked via 26 linkages46the study of arenaviruses offers an excellent opportunity for revealing the molecular basis of co-evolution of viruses with their rodent host and their potential emergence as a human pathogen phylogenetically arenaviruses are divisible into old world and new world according to geographical origin with the new world arenaviruses subdivided further into three clades a b and c clade b viruses are pathogenic for humans and share with members of clade a an ability to recognize transferrin receptor 1 tfr1 on cell surfaces although both clade a and clade b viruses recognize murine tfr1 only clade b viruses have evolved the capacity to also bind human tfr1 a single amino-acid change in the viral g1 envelope glycoprotein appears sufficient for this expansion of host range to humans intriguingly arenaviruses may have merged as human pathogens by more than one independent pathway of adaptation clade c new world arenaviruses share with old world arenaviruses an affinity for -dystroglycan a highly conserved cell surface protein involved in adhesion to the extracellular matrix in binding -dystroglycan these viruses can bypass the early endocytic pathway through uptake into smooth vesicles47as with receptor usage small changes to other viral proteins may have a profound outcome on whether or not a new host can support virus replication one example is hepatitis c virus a member of the flaviviridae family attempts to culture the virus in cell monolayers were unsuccessful until a strain from a japanese patient with fulminant hepatitis jfh-1 was isolated this strain contains a modification in the polymerase gene ns5a which for reasons that are incompletely understood has permitted the generation of chimeras representing all of the hcv genotypes that are infectious in culture48high rates of nucleotide substitution rates exhibited by rna viral genomes ensure that rna viruses can adapt rapidly to changes in the levels of host immunity the availability of suitable vectors and the ecology of any animal reservoir infected mammalian cells are deficient in the necessary repair mechanisms to correct errors in template transcription these errors are preserved if they do not prevent the formation of new infectious virus particles for example there have been multiple independent cross-species transmissions of simian immunodeficiency virus siv from chimpanzees to humans which have given rise to pandemic group m and non-pandemic groups n and o clades of hiv-1 a single amino acid change in the gag-encoded matrix protein m30r is present in these cross-species transmissions furthermore when hiv-1 encoding the gag mutation was passaged in chimpanzees this mutation reverted this provides evidence for host-specific adaptation during the emergence of hiv-1 and identifies the viral matrix protein as a modulator of viral fitness following transmission to the new human host49a number of rna viruses possess segmented genomes reassortment of individual segments may occur in the event of a single cell being infected simultaneously with two genotypically distinct viruses reassortment event are known to play a major role in the emergence of new influenza virus strains leading to major changes in pathogenicity for animals and humans alike this process is increasingly recognized as occurring among other rna viruses containing structurally distinct genome segments for example the bunyaviruses in 1997 an outbreak of rift valley fever was detected in northeastern kenya and western somalia following a period of abnormal rainfall around 370 human deaths were recorded mainly in the garissa region of kenya surprisingly however there was evidence of rift valley fever virus rfv infection in only 23 of cases the cloning of pcr products revealed the existence of a new recombinant bunyavirus one that contained the l and s rna segments of bunyawera virus and an ill-defined m segment distantly related to ngari virus a bunyavirus previously reported from senegal in 197950 ngari virus is widely distributed across sub-saharan africa and as far south as madagascar the result in the garissa outbreak was the emergence of a new recombinant virus with substantial virulence for humans this new recombinant virus occurred independently of rfv infection during the outbreak the number of infections also the result of environmental factors that equally resulted in an elevation of rfv activityalthough not a zoonosis the recently described schmallenberg virus of ruminants in europe illustrates how unexpectedly members of the bunyavirus genus within the family bunyaviridae can spread preliminary analyses of the s rna segment show a close relationship between schmallenberg virus and members of the simbu serogroup normally found in asia51genetic recombination is known to pay an important role in generating new coronaviruses and such events may increase the likelihood of cross-species transmission as well as determine the severity of disease outcome52 this may explain the greater genetic diversity of sars-cov isolated from bats compared to humans and civets there is a marked difference between human sars-cov and bat sars-like coronavirus in the s gene bearing the cellular receptor domain with only 7678 amino-acid identity in the major spike s proteinproinflammatory responses also play a pivotal role in determining disease outcome with viruses manipulating host innate immune responses in order to promote entry and dissemination and host cells have also evolved countermeasures that give rise to genetic arms races with both virus and host competing against the other following initial infection of a host cell many host restriction factors recognize viruses and directly inhibit replication hiv and siv are recognized by several host restriction factors in their respective primate hosts tripartite motif-containing protein 5 trim5 is a species-specific host restriction factor that restricts the replication of hiv-1 in old world monkeys such as rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys rhesus trim5 restricts hiv-1 infection by interacting with the hiv-1 capsid at an early stage of infection and is believed to be involved in the innate immune response to retroviral infection recent studies investigating experimental cross transmission of siv from sooty mangabeys have revealed that trim5 exerts selective pressure during the initial stages of cross species transmission to rhesus macaques due to attenuation of infection rather than an outright block to infection53 however rhesus trim5 does not restrict siv isolated from macaques and human trim5 does not restrict hiv-1 infection54 although the introduction of single amino-acid mutation in the spry domain of trim5 can restore its ability to recognize and restrict hiv55 different primate orthologues of trim5 have recognition specificities for different retroviral capsids and infection is only blocked when recognition occurs56 similarly apolipoprotein b mrna-editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3g apobec3g and tetherin are two host proteins that restrict the replication of retroviruses including hiv and siv by inducing degradation of the viral proteins and by inhibiting viral release the retroviral proteins viral infectivity factor and viral protein u counteract apobec3g and tetherin respectively5758 recently a study of four african green monkey subspecies which can be infected with divergent strains of siv highlighted that even in nonpathogenic infection there is ongoing evolution of simian apobec3g in the absence of ongoing disease in response to these changes both natural isolates from long-term infected individuals and viruses from experimentally infected individuals adapt to retarget the host restriction factor59 these studies highlight the ongoing conflict between virus and host and may contribute to the species specificity of closely related retroviruses recent studies have shed light on factors that determine the pathogenicity of siv and hiv-1 in different host species hiv-1 and siv infection of humans and rhesus macaques respectively are associated with chronic immune activation and production of tumor necrosis factor- from macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation60 in contrast in chronically infected sooty mangabeys the macrophage response to lipopolysaccharide is inhibited figure 2 a finding consistent with a suppressed chronic immune activation in non-pathogenic infection that is not observed in pathogenic infectionsthere have been several recent examples of viral subversion of the host innate immune system in order to promote infection and dissemination viruses must cross epithelial and endothelial barriers in order to invade organs such as lung gut and brain which are protected by sheets of polarized cells that restrict the passage of substances across these layers these do not express viral receptors on their apical surfaces human type 5 adenoviruses use two receptors constitutive androstane receptor car and 35 integrin in order to infect airway epithelial cells although the mechanism of infection at the apical surface has been unclear since both viral receptors are not expressed at the apical side of the cells yet both are required for viral infection car and 35 integrin are not normally available for viral binding being a component of tight junctions and the basolateral membranes of polarizedepithelia respectively however macrophages respond to viral infection by secretion of il-8 cxcl8 that in turn triggers the delocalization of 35 from the basolateral membrane to the apical cell surface thus transforming the cell into a potential host for replication61 thus it is conceivable that viruses crossing from one species to another may utilize secondary receptor elements shared between closely related species as a means of initiating infection in a new hostin a landmark study everitt and colleagues62 have shown that the action of interferon-inducible trans-membrane protein m3 ifitm3 can profoundly alter the course of influenza virus infection in humans the genotypes of ifitm3 found in hospitalized patients correlated with lower levels of ifitm3 expression leading to uncontrolled virus replication in the lungs and lower respiratory tract disease in those individuals with no acquired immunity to the infecting virus genotypemeasles virus initially infects macrophages and dendritic cells in the airway before crossing the airway epithelium and infecting lymphatic organs measles virus uses slamcd150 as a viral receptor but this is not expressed on all target cells which led to the notion that another receptor was also used for measles virus infection using well-differentiated primary airway epithelial cell sheets several groups elegantly demonstrated that following measles replication within lymphoid tissue virus uses the junction protein nectin-4 to bind to the basolateral lung side of polarized epithelia where it replicates and disseminates to nave hosts6364 these studies highlight the necessity of using in vitro culture systems that closely mimic the physiology of the cells in vivo65ebola viruses can effectively inhibit host interferon type i responses mainly due to the inhibitory properties of vp35 macrophage infection induces proinflammatory cytokines promotes endothelial leakage and stimulates bystander apoptosis of lymphocytes although the latter does not abrogate the development of a specific cd8 cytotoxic t-cell response expression of tissue factor on the surface of macrophages triggers a coagulation cascade thus promoting hemorrhagedomains on vp35 block the function of the helicase retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 which in concert with melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 are cellular sensors of virus infection and trigger a type i interferon response interestingly the vp35 structures are largely similar between pathogenic ebola virus and the not pathogenic to humans reston virus however the reasons why ebola reston is not pathogenic for humans remain unclear ebola virus vp24 also contributes to the inhibition of innate immunity by preventing the accumulation of antiviral siginal transducers and activators of transcription stat-1 in the nucleus there are some differences between how interferon signaling is suppressed between marburg virus and ebola virus marburg virus blocks both stat-1 and stat-2 activation through the effects of vp40 rather than vp35 as is the case with ebola virus66 recent studies have revealed that lassa virus can also suppress interferon signaling through the c terminal domain of its nucleoprotein which both resembles and functions similar to an endonuclease it can hydrolyze dsrna but not ssrna or dna67 this is the first time a virus has been shown to have dsrna specific exonuclease activity and in addition the first time a virus has been shown to counteract ifn responses by blocking interferon regulatory factor 3 translocation to the nucleus by actually digesting the pathogen-associated molecular patternthere is evidence that ebola and marburg viruses have co-evolved with one or more mammalian reservoirs taylor and colleagues26 have suggested that filoviral gene sequences are present in the genome of small mammals as diverse as shrews and south american marsupials this latter observation indicates that other filoviruses are yet to be discovered in the new world or that south american species harbored ancestral filoviruses that gave rise to present day ebola and marburg virusesoutbreaks of emerging diseases vary widely in duration frequency and case numbers some can be predicted as occurring annually for example influenza whereas many decades may elapse between episodes as is the case with marburg virus planning a single integrated strategy against all eventualities is therefore almost impossible a task compounded by considerations as to likely emergence of escape mutant in populations vaccinated against known diseases the emergence of strains resistant to antiviral therapy or even the recycling through livestock of attenuated vaccines designed for use exclusively in humansimproved epidemiological surveillance of infectious diseases is the foundation for immediate and long-term strategies for combating emerging diseases this needs to be supplemented by adequate training of clinicians and diagnostic microbiologists in all aspects of the control of infectious disease unfortunately cutbacks in available resource have marginalized specific training in emerging infections in many countries as well as limited the availability of containment facilities necessary for the safe handling and characterization of positive isolates this shortfall in capacity is most acute in sub-saharan africa where many serious outbreaks occur although it has to be said that progress has been made most evidently in gabon and uganda where specialized facilities aided by the us centers for disease control now complement local expertise integration with the veterinary community is essential several one medicine programs have been instigated to better serve economically developing nation strengthen their overall capacity to react quickly and effectively in the face of emerging disease outbreaksit is imperative that veterinary scientists are involved in any suspected zoonotic outbreak valuable time was lost in 1999 when the first cases of west nile virus occurred in new york city among both humans and birds68 historically there has been little integration of animal and human public health yet the techniques and methods for diagnosing and controlling infectious disease are similar regardless of affected speciesdifficulties can arise in correctly identifying the cause of a human disease as being zoonotic for many years chronic fatigue syndrome was regarded as being viral in origin a view apparently confirmed when lombardi et al69 reported xenotropic murine leukaemia virus-related virus xmrv as a possible etiological agent this virus was found during a study of human prostate tumor cells that contained integrated dna sequences homologous to retroviruses these workers went on to claim the presence of xmrv in around 100 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome with subsequent estimates of 33 prevalence among blood donors however these results were not reproducible70 and a lack of sequence diversity in presumptive isolates characteristic of retroviruses undergoing transmission from person to person strongly suggested the presence of a contaminant71 this link with xmrv has been retracted but serves to illustrate the inherent difficulties in associating disease with a specific etiological agent objective interpretation of the data was also hindered by public pressure groups frustrated by the scientific communitys apparent lack of progress in defining the cause of chronic fatigue syndrometechnology can play a major role in predicting disease emergence as for example the use of satellite imagery to detect changing patterns of vegetation in response to rainfall the use of satellite maps taken over east africa accurately predicted the outbreak of rfv amongst livestock as a consequence of increased vector activity72 the use of the internet has become an essential tool in containing disease outbreaks allowing for rapid dissemination of serological clinical and molecular sequencing data such rapid communications played a vital role in combating the sars outbreak in 2003 and also in identifying the spread of swine-origin h1n1 influenza virus in 2010time is of the essence in the control of emerging disease outbreaks with delays leading inevitably to an escalation in numbers of cases that can threaten to overwhelm both locally available manpower and capacity73 the immediate closure of hospitals was pivotal in limiting the spread of ebola virus in the original outbreaks in sudan and zaire in 1996 the importance of early recognition and the availability of local expertise has been confirmed recently as this year in uganda where the discovery of the bundibugyo strain of ebola virus in 2000 led to the strengthening of capacity at the virus research institute at entebbe by the us centers for disease control several outbreaks have occurred in uganda over the past decade recent cases of ebola virus in july and august 2012 have been rapidly diagnosed as a result of this regional investment in infrastructure thus preventing its spread to kampala the ugandan capital however outbreaks may spread even in countries fully equipped to deal with infectious disease outbreaks unless there is the foresight to critically review clinical and epidemiological data quickly and instigate the appropriate control measures the slow reaction led in 2003 to the spread of sars virus from hong kong40emergence of new infectious diseases is not a new phenomenon however it is arguably the rate at which new infections are being discovered that has accelerated in the past half century it is some comfort that emerging viruses linked to disease are invariably newly identified member species within well-characterized virus families but this may change as we discover vast numbers of hitherto uncharacterized viruses in what is now commonly referred to as the virosphere indeed it is reckoned by some that viruses represent the largest proportion of biomass on the planet if one takes into account an almost infinite number of viruses in the oceans if this is the case the human immune system does well to protect the species against a constant challenge from viruses constantly mutating and adapting to the environment and ecosystems around usviruses can evolve faster than mammals by many orders of magnitude being near instantaneous compared to the scale of mammalian adaptation over years and decades this may be less so for arthropod-transmitted viruses where the generation time of the vector is measured in weeks if not days thus emergence of vector-borne diseases represent a major threat in the short term once conditions for adaptation result in emergence and an extension of host range as a consequence as was the case for chikungunya virus in 200557predicting the rate of virus evolution is difficult however most approachable is the prediction of single point mutations viruses are over-represented among emerging diseases particularly those with rna genomes as their replication results in a higher rate of mutation compared to those with dna genomes considerable data exists for influenza a viruses for examplehow can the effects of emerging diseases be mitigated a number of criteria need to be addressed table 2 first surveillance is key and for this to be effective there needs to be an effective integration of medical and veterinary public health surveillance systems as vividly illustrated by the incursion of west nile virus into north america in 1999 second effective training in the early diagnosis of disease requires an emphasis on clinicians being skilled in recognizing that the early signs of infection may represent something unique and potentially serious third it is for those that govern communities to recognize and take into account the likely impact of environmental developments on ecosystems and disease emergence taking environmental impact studies beyond conservation of natural habitats and species finally much more needs to be done to understand how viruses overcome the innate immune response when crossing the species barrierconsiderable international effort is now being made to collect and record samples of viruses and microorganisms from wild animal populations and potential arthropod vectors in order to expand the current molecular databases by making available extensive catalogues of genome sequences it is expected that newly emerging agents would in future be more readily identified and thus control measures put in place much more rapidlyonce passage between humans becomes the sole route of transmission a virus can no longer be regarded as causing an emerging disease at this juncture a balance has been found between the evolving viral genome and the ability of the human immune response to limit the infective process thus at any one moment in time many emerging diseases can be viewed as in this process of adaptation prior to reaching the typical hostparasite balance a balance between replication and survival of the hostin the long term however we need to adopt a holistic approach whereby the drivers of emergence are measured in terms of accelerating those processes of adaptation and co-evolution within ecosystems disease emergence is but one manifestation of the challenge the human race has to meet as our environment is threatened by mankinds use of the resources our planet has to offer the only certainty is that as human societies become ever more grouped in cities and impose ever widening environmental change the emergence of new disease threats from unexpected directions will only increase we must think laterally and always expect the unexpectedffrs have been used in industrial settings such as construction manufacturing and mining since the 1970s starting in the 1990s these devices found new applications in health care settings3 initially ffrs were recommended as the minimum level of protection to reduce exposure to infectious aerosols from patients with tuberculosis47 later similar recommendations8 were made for outbreaks and pandemics involving pathogens with potential for aerosol transmissionffr use in health care settings has unique challenges and risks unlike industrial settings some models of niosh-certified ffrs commonly called surgical n95 respirators are also cleared for sale by the fda as medical devices9 according to the fdas 510k premarket notification database10 the first clearance for a surgical n95 respirator product code  msh occurred in 1996 after ffrs were first recommended by cdc as the minimum level of protection for health care workers hcws treating patients with tuberculosis4 and niosh updated its certification requirements to create the n95 class of filters1 most 2231  71 of the surgical n95 respirator models in the fda database were cleared after 2005 which coincides with a period of increased interest in these types of products due to concerns about an infectious disease pandemicbecause of the concerns that previously used ffrs may be contaminated with infectious material ie act as a fomite the factors that a health care employer considers in formulating ffr use policies eg single vs reuse for its employees are also different from employers in industrial settings despite this concern ffrs are reused under certain conditions in health care11 in the health care context reuse is defined as a hcw donning the same ffr for a series of close patient contacts and doffing it at the end of each of the close patient contacts before it is discarded even when ffr reuse is practiced or recommended discussed in the next section restrictions are in place eg discard when ffr is contaminated or damaged becomes difficult to breathe through and so on which limits the number of times the same ffr is reused thus ffr reuse is sometimes referred to as limited ffr reuse options for limited ffr reuse were provided when ffrs were first introduced as the minimum level of respiratory protection for hcws in close contact with patients with tuberculosis46another related ffr use practice termed extended use involves donning a ffr and wearing it for multiple patient encounters without doffing and redonning between patient visits thus the same ffr is worn continuously for up to several hours across multiple patient encounters before it is doffed this practice is only practical when bundled with the practice of cohorting which involves locating patients with a common diagnosis in the same unit ward or zone extended use can be implemented separately from reuse ie like single use discard the ffr once it is doffed or combined with reuse compared to single use and reuse recommendations for extended use in health care are fairly recent the first time extended use of ffrs was identified as an option was during the 2009 h1n1 pandemic12both extended use and limited reuse of ffrs allow the employer to reduce its consumption of ffrs prolonging existing supplies during a pandemic or respiratory pathogen outbreak or to save money and reduce waste during day-to-day operations eg close contact with tuberculosis patients by using fewer ffrs13 similar to the benefits found for industrial settings this commentary examines recommendations related to extended use and limited reuse of ffrs in health care key scientific and policy issues are highlighted along with considerations for policy makers to weigh when making decisions on whether to recommend extended use andor limited reuse of ffrs during routine health care situations and for public health emergencies involving respiratory pathogens that have the potential for aerosol transmission finally key knowledge gaps are discussed to identify additional data needs that could enhance understanding of the risks for transmission of diseases associated with ffr extended use and limited reusetable i summarizes past and current recommendations for extended use and limited reuse of ffrs cdc recommendations were selected for this analysis because of their widespread recognition in health care in 2007 cdc published general infection control guidance for isolation precautions which included a list of all pathogens and medical procedures in which respiratory protection was recommended14 for certain pathogens affecting defined populations eg tb or infectious agents of special interest to health care eg epidemiologically important organisms such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and influenza cdc publishes detailed specialized infection control guidance for this analysis we selected all of the respiratory pathogens in which specialized infection control guidance was published as either interim or final recommendations and included the use of respiratory protection n95 ffr or higher this strategy provided a diversity of respiratory pathogens for analysis these situations include two recent outbreakspandemics 2004 sars and 2009 h1n1 flu two routine situations tb and seasonal influenza and two pathogens of concern avian influenza a h5n1 and avian influenza a h7n9
cost can be a consideration for adopting extended use and limited reuse practices as it was in adopting the recommendation to allow limited reuse of ffrs when working in close contact with tb patients however the cdc recommendations on limited reuse and extended use have primarily considered the specific pathogens involved and the specific characteristics of the event the first key factor is whether contact transmission is possible for the pathogen contact transmission of pathogens occurs through direct or indirect contact with the patient or the patients environment via blood or body fluids eg respiratory secretions for pathogens in which contact transmission eg fomites is not a concern limited reuse of ffrs has been determined to be a viable option for tb the cdc maintains that a respirator classified as disposable can be reused by the same hcw as long as it remains functional and is used in accordance with local infection control procedures 15 infection control guidelines for tb 14 recommend only airborne precautions contact isolation precautions are only needed if extrapulmonary lesions are draining which occurs rarely contact transmission of tb is thought to be highly unlikely16this contrasts with the recommendations for seasonal influenza where contact with contaminated surfaces and objects is considered a possible mode of transmission17 in situations where airborne precautions are recommended and contact precautions are recommended or contact transmission is possible the second key factor in the cdc recommendations is the likelihood of a localized shortage of the ffrs needed to protect hcws during high-risk procedures the use of ffrs for protection of hcws during routine infectious disease procedures generally does not result in a ffr shortage as evidenced by cdcs guidance to wear a ffr during aerosol generating procedures agps on patients diagnosed with seasonal influenza this does not include an option for ffr extended use or reuse17cdc recommendations for avian influenza a h7n918 indicate that ffrs should be discarded after leaving the patient room or patient care area ie single use cdc recommendations for avian influenza a h5n119 do not specifically mention single use extended use or limited reuse but instead refer back to the general cdc infection control guidance14 which specifies single use these recommendations are consistent with the other four recommendations in table i based on the potential for contact transmission of these pathogens and that ffr shortages are unlikely in the near-termhowever during periods of high usage eg public health emergencies such as an influenza pandemic20 or widespread respiratory pathogen outbreak supplies of ffrs can quickly become depleted because most hospitals maintain only a small inventory of ffrs not surprisingly shortages were reported at the hospital level during both the 2004 sars outbreak and the 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic2123 in a recent evaluation of respiratory protection programs in california hospitals it was reported that half of the hospital managers interviewed n  48 reported shortages of ffrs during the 2009 h1n1 outbreak due to increased demand and supplier lag time in filling orders11 during the 2004 sars and 2009 h1n1 events recommendations were made allowing the option for extended use and limited reuse although both recommendations acknowledged situations in which these strategies would not be appropriatefor sars cdc stated in its interim guidance that health care facilities may consider reuse as long as the device has not been obviously soiled or damaged eg creased or torn and if a sufficient supply of respirators is not available24 the recommendation recognized the importance of preventing contamination through contact with infectious material on the outside of the respirator cdc also addressed concerns about a shortage of ffrs during the 2009 h1n1 flu pandemic with supply-conserving strategies for hospitals that included the possibility of extended use and limited reuse of ffrs with extended use preferred over limited reuse1225 reuse of ffrs was reported to occur quite often in california hospitals during 2009 h1n1 as either a response to shortages or as standard practice 81 of survey respondents indicated that their hospital had a plan to implement reuse while only 125 indicated plans to apply extended use11most n95 ffrs contain a polypropylene electret filtering medium within the layers of a ffr figure 1 the electret filtering medium has been shown to capture and retain a majority of airborne biological particles compared to the layers next to the face and farthest from the face although particle size could affect particle deposition location2728 electrets and other similar types of nonwoven air filter media are not unique to ffrs29 they are commonly found in various dust collection systems eg vacuum cleaners clean rooms and home heat ventilation and air conditioning hvac systems recommended replacement life for electret filters in air cleaning systems is typically 3 months of normal use as the fundamental mechanisms diffusion interception impaction electrostatic and so on of these types of filters do not readily degrade over time with normal use
only a few studies have been done to verify ffr performance in extended use or reuse type scenarios moyer and bergman30 conducted a laboratory evaluation of the intermittent use short-term use once per week of n95 filters over several months filtration efficiency was reduced to below 95 for filters from 2 of the 3 manufacturers after 9 and 13 weeks of simulated reuse researchers at the institut de recherch robert-sauv en sant et en scurit du travail irsst validated the long-term filter performance of a single n95 ffr model 31 for inert particles below 200 nm filter efficiency levels remained above 973 even after 5 hr of particle loading ie continuous use not surprisingly another study found that samples from 19 of 21 n95 ffr models stored for up to 10 years had expected levels of filtration performance32fit is a measurement of the efficacy of the seal between the ffr and the face of the wearer components of the ffr such as straps face seal material shape and adjustable nose bands influence ffr fit several studies have analyzed strap performance and fit for multiple donnings of ffrs roberge et al measured the restorative forces of straps for five simulated donnings and reported reduction in the strap load for each successive donning with the majority of the reduction occurring after the first donning33 however the ffr model with the lowest restorative strap performance load was still able to pass fit-testing bergman et al examined the effect of ffr reuse on fit by measuring the fit factors of 6 ffr models donned by 10 subjects up to 20 times with wear times of approximately 2 min between each donning34 ffr fit gradually decreased over multiple consecutive donnings however good fit was observed for some subjects on some models even after 20 donnings the best levels of fit were observed for the first five donnings likely because of the relatively little wear on ffr components eg head straps and nosepieces compared with later donningsit was concluded from that study that five donnings could be performed before fit factors started to drop below 100 catastrophic failure of the ffr eg complete head strap breakage nosepiece becomes damaged and so on should have no effect on risk if users diligently perform device inspection procedures required during the ffr donning process fit of ffrs is also a concern for extended use where the ffr may become wet and deformed due to moist exhaled breath and facial perspiration hauge et al measured real-time fit while hcws performed three 10-min simulated patient care scenarios it was determined that initial fit was predictive of fit during the tasks as the five subjects with initial fit factors greater than 200 registered simulated workplace protection factors greater than 400 and the three subjects with initial fit factors less than 200 had simulated workplace protection factors ranging from 132 to 32635 although the tasks were only a combined 30 min the study design could be considered an extended use scenario covering three patient encountersfew studies in health care settings measure workplace protection factors wpf wpf is a measure of the protection provided by a properly functioning respirator when correctly worn and used in the workplace and is determined as the ratio of the particle concentration outside the respirator over the particle concentration inside the respirator infectious bioaerosols are hard to detect and differentiate from non-infectious bioaerosols36 furthermore assuring compliance during all periods of exposure in the health care setting is challenging37 several studies in other workplaces have assessed protection over extended periods of continuous use by measuring the wpfs up to 224 min in a steel foundry38 172 min in a concrete factory 39 and 60 min on farms40 all three studies concluded that the n95 ffrs provided levels of protection consistent with expectations ie protection factors were  the assigned protection factor of 10 with reported geometric mean wpf values ranging from 18 to 223 no evidence of reduced protection as a function of time was noted in these studies the aerosol challenge encountered at the farm locations consisted of biological aerosols such as endotoxins and fungal spores which are more closely related to the bioaerosols in a hospital than to the dust encountered at the foundry and concrete factoryoverall the scientific studies provide evidence that extended use is unlikely to reduce the protection afforded by a ffr see table ii and support the cdc tb infection control guidance which states in the frequently asked questions section disposable respirators can be functional for weeks to months however as noted in table ii some additional cautions may apply for reuse reuse involves multiple repeated uses donnings of the same device and it is possible that some components straps nose clips and so on could begin to degrade over time and reduce protection these effects are likely specific to each model of ffr but the only study published34 to date on this topic suggests that limiting ffr reuse to no more than five donnings or reuses would provide an adequate safety marginone of the consequences of extended use is the need to wear the ffr continuously for up to several hours compared with single use or reuse in which the ffr would only be worn during the period of close contact with the patient typically less than 1520 min thus questions have been raised regarding the safety of long-term ffr use and if safe how long hcws can physiologically and psychologically tolerate extended useniosh researchers found that ffr use caused no or minimal increases in heart rate respiratory rate and transcutaneous carbon dioxide as well as no differences in oxygen saturation on test subjects during 1 hr of low-moderate treadmill exercise when compared with wearing no respirator control4143 they also reported that 2 hr of continuous ffr use at low-moderate work rate did not cause a change in core body temperature42 and there was no significant increase in ffr deadspace heat or humidity after the first hour44 taken together these studies suggest that ffr use for 12 hr should cause minimal physiological stress to individuals medically cleared to wear ffrsa study by researchers affiliated with department of veterans affairs reported how long 27 hcws could tolerate multiple bouts of 2-hr-long extended use periods interspersed with 1530 min breaks45 median tolerance times of 66 hr and 58 hr were reported for the two ffr models without exhalation valves only 16 and 18 of the 27 subjects using those two models were able to complete all four 2-hr use periods of continuous use the most reported reason for stopping use was head and facial discomfort eg heat in a follow-up analysis of the same data it was concluded that ffr discomfort negatively affects respirator tolerance over time but respirator intolerance is not associated with perceived self-reported exertion46although the number of participants was small a recent study reports greater tolerance of extended use of ffrs among hcws47 they reported that 9 of 10 study participants nurses were willing to wear ffrs for the entirety of two full 12-hr shifts stopping only to eat and drink because it was the end of their shift or because the ffr was too uncomfortable the nurses tolerated ffr continuous wear for an average of 223 min on day 1 and 145 min on day 2 and experienced little physiological burden however discomfort increased with time and the nurses reported feeling more short of breath the longer they wore respiratory protection transcutaneous carbon dioxide levels increased over time but were not clinically relevant in that carbon dioxide levels did not reach the requirement for clinically defined hypercapniaa study conducted in a teaching hospital in brazil considered changes in appearance and possible physical damage resulting from ffr reuse48 a new n95 ffr was distributed to each nurse once per month and reused as needed until the next new n95 ffr was provided the researchers found that within 5 days the majority of the distributed cone-shaped ffrs exhibited visible wear and tear indicating possible physical damage caused by folding them for storage in a pocket and visible stainsdirt on the ffr interior and exterior surfaces although the performance of the respirators was not assessed the data suggest that some models may be more suitable for reuse eg those that fold easily or that hospitals should enforce some restrictions on reuse eg replace every 5 days rather than every 30 daysoverall the available scientific studies provide evidence that hcws will experience greater discomfort during periods of extended continuous wear of ffrs but this discomfort will likely be tolerable for most hcws continuous ffr use over extended periods of time up to 12 hr is unlikely to harm workers see table ii who have been medically cleared for respirator use furthermore because hcws need to take occasional breaks during their work shift eg to use the rest room eat or drink and so on ffr extended use of greater than 4 consecutive hours is unlikely in most settingsthere are no published studies that quantify the amount of pathogens on ffrs used in clinical settings however simple mathematical models can be used to provide some estimates in one study influenza aerosol concentration breathing rate of the wearer time of patient interactionffr use and particle retention efficiency of the ffr were used as inputs to a linear model to estimate influenza contamination levels inside and on the surface of the ffr cffr52 using this model an increase in any parameter results in higher levels of cffr ie total number of pathogens on the ffr for a typical hcw scenario using model input values estimated from the peer-reviewed literature the model calculated that cffr would be approximately 4500 influenza viruses given an influenza aerosol concentration of 12000 viruses m3 a breathing rate of 1140 m3hr1 a particle retention efficiency of the ffr of 0991 and a 20-min patient interactionffr use time the values for influenza aerosol concentration and wear time found in the literature varied more than other parameters used in the model thus for extended use which involves longer wear times the number of pathogens available for transfer to the hands is increasedthis model illustrates the need to take into account hcw procedures eg agps which can increase cffr by up to 2200 and the potential for administrative controls such as source control of patients eg asking patients to wear facemasks which can reduce cffr by up to 715354 in addition to administrative controls the use of engineering controls such as local exhaust ventilation might reduce cffr similarly previous recommendations issued during the sars outbreak suggested the use of a surgical mask or faceshield on top of a ffr to reduce cffr26 although subsequent work has identified a number of potential concerns including regulatory compliance with this approach55 while developed for influenza this model could be used to approximate cffr resulting from any respiratory pathogen if estimates of the concentrations of the pathogen near the breathing zone of the hcw could be obtainedgiven that ffrs can become contaminated with pathogens when used in close contact with infectious patients the next factor under consideration is how long these pathogens can survive remain infectious and for some types of microorganisms grow propagate on the ffr surface some studies in the early 1990s found that under ideal conditions eg humidity 78 fungi and certain bacteria could grow on filters made of cellulose because they are capable of digesting cellulose5657 however modern post-1995 ffrs are made of polypropylene which cannot serve as a nutrient for bacteria58studies confirmed that surrogates for tb were not able to grow on polypropylene-based filter media even under incubation conditions5861 although bacteria were found to survive for several days this was not considered a concern because contact transmission for tb is considered unlikely see table i these studies lent support for the ffr reuse guidance being drafted at that timerespiratory viruses have received more recent attention while growth is not an issue because these pathogens require a host organism to propagate their persistence or survival on surfaces is a concern in general the evidence indicates that viruses are more persistent on nonporous substrates compared with porous materials such as ffrs bean et al reported laboratory-grown influenza a and influenza b survived for 2448 hr on hard nonporous surfaces but survived for 812 hr on porous substrates62 similarly another study63 found that influenza remained viable for 8 hr on ffr samples but infectivity dropped below detection limits at 24hrhowever tiwari et al examined the persistence of two avian respiratory viruses including influenza h13n7 on various substrates and although they found that both viruses survived longer on nonporous surfaces than on porous ones the viruses remained active for up to 6 days64 in one laboratory study ph1n1 was detected on ffrs for up to 6 days with an average of 90 reduction 1 log in viability during this time period65 similar findings were found using ms2 phage as a surrogate for respiratory viruses66 a surrogate for sars coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus was shown to remain viable for 24 hr on ffr samples with an estimated 99 2 log reduction in titer67another study found that inactivation of 6 bacteriophage spiked on a n95 ffr surface was highly sensitive to environmental conditions with a 1 log reduction over 24 hr at 40 relative humidity versus 4 log reduction over 24 hr at 60 relative humidity68 although it is difficult to generalize from these conflicting findings it is clear that for reuse during a work shift with short storage times 1 hr most of the trapped pathogen will remain viable some reduction in viability might occur for overnight 12 hr or weekend 24 hr storage depending upon storage conditions temperature humidity light and so on and pathogen type and strainin many cases where pathogens remain persistent and pose a contact threat cleaning and disinfection regimens are routinely used for example countertops exam tables and other surfaces of patient rooms are often cleaned when a patient is discharged research has been conducted on cleaning and disinfecting procedures for ffrs for possible reuse by the same hcw although the results appear to be promising the practice is not currently recommended6972 and thus is not a viable solution at this time to reduce the fomite potential of a reused ffrrecent improvements in antimicrobial chemistries have allowed some manufacturers to begin incorporating these technologies into ffrs there are now a few surgical n95 ffrs incorporating antimicrobial technologies product code  ont that have been cleared by the fda as medical devices9 interestingly one device has been cleared by the fda with claims of 8 hr of continuous use unfortunately none of these devices has been evaluated in the peer-reviewed literature for claims regarding their ability to reduce fomite potential however several studies7377 have looked at the ability of prototypes or devices not cleared by fda that incorporate some type of antimicrobial chemistry in them to render trapped pathogens inactive over time ie storage time between uses these studies suggest that efficacy of antimicrobial ffrs for this application is dependent on the pathogen antimicrobial agent storage conditions and specific test method used which makes generalization of findings difficult737881 although promising the lack of conclusive evidence suggests that additional work is needed before ffrs incorporating antimicrobial technologies can be factored into ffr reuse recommendationsbecause ffrs can become contaminated with pathogens likely to remain infectious during typical extended use and reuse scenarios the next factor to assess is the likelihood of pathogens transferring from the ffr to the hands of hcws unfortunately no studies exist that quantify the percentage of pathogen transferred from the ffr to the hands of hcws however similar to estimating contamination levels models can be used where estimates of the key input parameters are available a simple model for estimating the amount of pathogen transferred to the hands chand of hcws from contaminated ffrs uses cffr the number of pathogens on the ffr as discussed above transfer efficiency of the pathogen et and contact area of the hands ah and the ffr affr
chandcffrahaffretunfortunately no peer-reviewed sources are available on the transfer efficiency of relevant pathogens from a ffr to skin and others surfaces however an unpublished conference presentation reports the transfer efficiency of a bacterium bacillus atrophaeus from ffrs to synthetic skin as 0005 and 005 for touching and rubbing respectively82 other microbial transfer studies for porous surfaces have shown similar results for example rusin et al reported transfer efficiencies for a bacterium micrococcus luteus of 013 from a 100 cotton substrate and 006 from a 5050 cottonpolyester substrate even lower transfer efficiencies 001 from those surfaces were reported for bacteriophage prd-183 another recent study compared the transfer efficiency of bacteria and viruses from several porous and nonporous surfaces to the fingers 84 in general the lowest transfer efficiencies were found for porous surfaces under low relative humidity isoelectric point and hydrophobicity of the surface were also important factorsas discussed previously cffr can be estimated for simplicity we use the influenza values reported above from fisher et al as a surrogate for all respiratory pathogens52 the contact area of the hands depends upon the action of the hcw table iii for extended use it is likely that only the finger tips are used to touch the ffr surface eg to reposition the ffr the total surface area of the volar portion of the fingertips has been estimated to be 734 cm285 however when implementing ffr reuse the proper donning process requires a user seal check step which requires the user to cover the entire ffr surface by cupping both hands around the filter surface in this situation ah would be very similar to affr which has been estimated to be approximately 175 cm2 but varies among the various ffr models assuming uniform deposition of the pathogen over the surface of the ffr applying input values of 4500 ffr1 for cffr and 01 as an approximation for et to the equation results in an estimated 45 pathogens being transferred to the hands of the hcw during the user seal check step and 1 pathogen for each touch involving a fingertip
while the model above indicates that some pathogens from a contaminated ffr could transfer to the hands other factors also affect the risk of infection steps in the fomite pathway such as the transfer of viable pathogens from hands to respiratory tract ports of entry transport of viable pathogens to the site of infection and the infectious dose of the pathogen are not unique to extended use and reuse of ffrs but are common to any potential fomite a full assessment that takes into account these steps is beyond the scope of this commentary however the model developed by nicas and sun indicates that each successive step in the fomite pathway further reduces the number of infectious pathogens reaching the site where infection can occur reducing the risk of self-inoculation from practicing ffr extended use andor limited reuse51in theory extended use should not present a significant self-inoculation hazard as ideally the hcws hands should never come in contact with the contaminated filtering surface when proper doffing protocols are followed86 however the rebmann study47 reported that hcws touched or adjusted their ffr on average 1020 times per 12 hr shift even with this amount of contact our analysis based on the data and the models discussed above suggests that very few pathogens are likely to make it to the site of infection each time the hand or fingertip comes in contact with the ffr thus extended use is considered minimal risk for typical patient interactions table ii when coupled with training and education to reinforce proper use eg dont touch the ffr surface and adherence to hand hygiene recommendationsreusing ffrs provides multiple opportunities for the hands of hcws to come in contact with any infectious microbes on the respirator surface and thus involves a higher level of risk compared to extended use table ii hcws hands would presumably contact the contaminated ffr surface when placing the ffr onto the face adjusting the position of the ffr and flexible strap across the nasal bridge if applicable and when performing the user seal check a requirement after donning a respirator and after each adjustment to the respirator similar to extended use fomite risks from ffr reuse can be mitigated through training and education to reduce unnecessary touching of the ffr and rigorous adherence to hand hygiene steps to limit ffr contamination eg masking patients use of engineering controls face shields and so on can also limit fomite risks as chand is proportional to cffrconcerns have been raised that extended use of ffrs could result in additional opportunities for pathogen transmission to co-workers and patients due to reaerosolization of trapped pathogens to the environment from a sneeze cough or through rough handling several studies have addressed this issue most recently fisher et al examined virus reaerosolization from ffrs and concluded that the risk of virus transfer to the environment from the ffr was negligible a finding key to extended use and reuse87 ffrs were challenged with virus-containing droplet nuclei with a size range of 065 to 70 m with the majority 11 m and challenged with reversed airflow to simulate a sneeze or cough the highest reaerosolization of 021 occurred with a droplet nuclei challenge while a droplet challenge led to reaerosolization of less than 00001 these findings are consistent with earlier studies that examined reaerosolization of bacteria and inert particles qian et al and willeke and qian reported the reaerosolization of less than 02 for bacteria deposited on n95 ffrs as aerosols and challenged with a reverse airflow consistent with a violent sneeze or cough8889 kennedy and hines found that less than 03 of polystyrene latex microspheres reaerosolized from ffrs when dropped from a height of 3 feet90 while birkner et al reported the average release of 0006 polystyrene latex microspheres were released from ffrs dropped from heights up to 137 m91overall these data provide evidence that the risks of secondary exposure due to reaerosolization or rough handling associated with ffr extended use or limited reuse can be considered negligible table ii similar to the fomite concerns discussed above secondary exposure risks could increase as cffr the number of pathogens on the ffr increases ie higher cffr  higher levels of reaerosolized pathogen so steps taken to limit ffr contamination eg masking patients faceshields local exhaust ventilation systems should be implemented where possiblein situations where patients are under contact precautions such as those co-infected with common health care pathogens with the ability for prolonged environmental survival eg vancomycin-resistant enterococci clostridium difficile and norovirus it may be prudent to have hcws discard ffrs after close contact because these pathogens could be transferred to other patients via the unclean hands of the hcwsharing ffrs among hcws could also result in a secondary risk if at least one of the users is infectious symptomatic or asymptomatic for example a specialized face mask containing electret filter media similar to those found in n95 ffrs was worn in one study 92 to successfully collect infectious virus from the exhaled breath of symptomatic test subjects because of respirators ability to trap respiratory pathogens sharing a contaminated ffr could result in disease transmission however proper labeling training and education can be effective at limiting any inadvertent sharing of ffrs during reusewe also conducted an internet search and reviewed ffr extended use and reuse recommendations issued by other united states agencies eg fda and osha and professional organizations eg association for professionals infection control and epidemiology9394 in terms of ffr extended use and limited reuse we identified no major discrepancies among the recommendations from the association for professionals in infection control and epidemiology apic osha and the cdc recommendations intable i for example osha tb guidance795 indicates that disposable respirators ie ffrs can be reused by the same hcw as long as the functional and structural integrity of the respirator is maintained and the outside of the filter is inspected before each use for signs of physical damage or soiling and discarded if signs are presentwhile osha is responsible for regulating employers to provide a safe workplace for their employees and cdc makes public health recommendations that are often adopted by hospitals fda has a different role in health care settings the fda regulates the manufacture and labeling of medical devices96 medical devices are cleared by the fda under the food drug and cosmetic act based upon data submitted by the manufacturer to support the claimed intended use of the product under 21 cfr 8784040 fda classifies surgical n95 respirators as a type of surgical apparel intended to be worn by operating room personnel during surgical procedures to protect both the surgical patient and the operating room personnel from transfer of microorganisms body fluids and particulate material as part of the labeling requirement fda recommends that manufacturers state whether a device is intended to be a reusable device or a single-use disposable device9some surgical n95 respirator models are cleared by the fda with claims of being a single-use device while other manufacturers do not make such claims10 for surgical n95 respirators labeled as single use only extended use or limited reuse could be considered as an off label use of these products fda has specific requirements for reuse reprocessing of single-use medical devices97 unfortunately as discussed earlier in this manuscript some hospital use practices for these types of medical devices such as limited ffr reuse were first recommended47 and put into practice prior to fdas involvement there is also a general lack of awareness among infection control professionals and safetyemployee health administrators in understanding fdas role in regulating surgical n95 respirators98 these factors contribute to the prevalence of industrial n95 ffrs used in health care settings these industrial n95 ffrs are niosh-certified ffrs but have not been cleared by the fda as medical devices several of these industrial n95 ffrs were stockpiled by the cdc in the strategic national stockpile99in the future the different regulatory and policy perspectives will need to be factored into ffr extended use and limited reuse recommendations for example recommendations for operating rooms where soiling and potential contamination from blood borne pathogens will likely occur might be different in those situations limited reuse should only be considered after consultation with the surgical n95 respirator manufacturer and local hospital infection professionalswhile significant progress has been made since 2006 some knowledge gaps remain to be filled further enhancing an understanding of the risks involved with ffr extended use and limited reuse various models related to fomite transfer were presented where little experimental data are available for use as inputs in particular data on actual ffr contamination levels from various health care situations and transfer efficiency of pathogens from ffrs to the hands are limited while several papers have been published on survivability of various respiratory pathogens on ffrs and the effectiveness of antimicrobial technologies it is not known how generalizable the results are which makes it difficult to fully assess risk well-designed and carefully controlled studies carried out using consistent test methods appropriate to ffr reuse might reduce some of these uncertaintiesmoreover the infectious dose of various pathogens for the various transmission routes is not well understood an issue further complicated by newly emerging pathogens and strains research and development efforts such as project breathe better respiratory equipment using advanced technology for health care employees3 that promote the development of better respirators for health care workers are needed to identify novel technologies and designs eg launderabilty a no touch user seal check and so on to address some of the additional concerns posed by extended use and reuse the paucity of data on many of the practical aspects of ffr extended use and reuse also suggests that additional studies are needed to validate preliminary findings regarding the acceptable number of donnings and to develop best practices for storage labeling and educationtraining surveillance data on ffr usage including extended use and reuse during routine operations and public health emergencies are needed to better understand the possible benefits eg cost savings ability to extend existing supplies reducing the burn rate and so on of ffr extended use and limited reusethe primary purpose of this article is to assess recent scientific findings to assist policy makers when making decisions on whether to recommend that employers in health care settings permit ffr extended use andor limited reuse during routine operations and for future public health emergencies the authors acknowledge that the evidence discussed above is not always as sufficient as desired to develop evidence-based policy decisions however decisions on how to protect exposed workers must be made in the present and cannot wait until additional evidence is available in the interim the available evidence can be useful for policy-based and pragmatic public health decision ideologies100 as discussed by rosella and coauthors 100 emerging public health situations require a balance between various factors both evidential and policy considerations are important policy makers need to use the best evidence available to them even when it has substantial limitations acknowledge the uncertainties and account for them in as practical a way as possiblefor recommending ffr extended use andor limited reuse for routine events policy makers should weigh the increased risks for disease transmission from ffr extended use and limited reuse against the inconvenience cost and waste of single use in public health emergencies policies on ffr extended use and limited reuse should weigh the risks for disease transmission against the risk of disease transmission associated with sacrificing because of ffr shortages eg foregoing respiratory protection or using surgical masks for pathogens or activities where n95 ffrs are recommended decisions regarding whether ffr extended use or limited reuse should be recommended need to continue to be pathogen- and event-specific the two most important factors driving this decision should be whether the pathogen is likely to spread in part via contact transmission and whether the event could result in or is currently causing a ffr shortagethis analysis of recent research post-2006 generally supports cdc guidance issued since 2004 for ffr extended use and limited reuse for routine events such as tb and seasonal influenza during agp as well as the public health emergencies such as the 2004 sars and 2009 h1n1 flu pandemics while recent findings largely support these cdc recommendations some new cautions and limitations should be considered in recommendations issued in the future as discussed subsequentlyextended use offers a lower risk of self-inoculation compared to limited reuse given that the hcws hands should ideally rarely contact the contaminated ffr surface training and education should be stressed to reinforce the need for strict adherence to guidance to minimize unnecessary contact with the ffr surface and strict adherence to hand hygiene practices extended use poses no additional health risk to a medically cleared respirator user and despite the additional discomfort should be tolerable for most hcws for these reasons extended use should be preferred over limited reuse even though ffr reuse requires the least change to current practiceslimited ffr reuse would allow the hcw to doff the ffr to provide a brief respite from the psychological and physiological factors that decrease ffr comfort but increases the potential for contact transfer when donning the used ffr and performing the user seal check however fomite transfer models indicate that the potential for transfer of pathogens from ffrs to the hands of the wearer is small suggesting that limited ffr reuse can be employed with minimal additional risk in most cases an exception is reuse of ffrs after agps where higher ffr contamination levels are likely to occur education and training should be emphasized to reinforce the need for proper hand hygiene when redonning the ffr including inspection of the device for physical damage and performing a user seal check strict adherence to these steps should further reduce the potential to transfer virus from the hands to the points of entry of infectionwhile limited ffr reuse remains a viable option for reducing usage rates and for situations involving a pathogen that does not spread via contact transmission data suggest that ffr protection can begin to be reduced for some models after multiple donnings or uses guidance should emphasize the need for the employer to consult with the respirator manufacturer regarding the maximum number of donnings or uses suggested for the ffr models used in that location or to presumptively limit the number of reuses to no more than five to ensure an adequate safety margin in the absence of new information to the contrarythe new outbreak of covid-19 has recently become a serious threat to the health of people around the world covid-19 is caused by the sars-cov-2 which is a single-stranded positive-sense rna virus that causes infection and respiratory failure swerdlow and finelli 2020 wu et al 2020 and has led to the thousands of people deaths thienemann et al 2020 following the who announcement the global emergency committee identified the need for early detection quarantine and prompt treatment as a global concern sohrabi et al 2020 because people with the virus do not have clinical symptoms such as fever cough etc in the early stages for this reason there is not enough information on how to disinfect and disinfect surfaces and hands human-to-human transmission through air food and water and the presence of the virus in human wastewater and waste there are several factors involved in transmitting the virus these conditions can be included in environment and human behavior fig 1 the distribution of human population migration social interactions climate change deforestation habitat invasion agricultural growth and direct contact with domestic and wild animals fall into this category barratt et al 2019 dehghani and kassiri 2020 on the other hand the effect of environmental factors such as ambient temperature humidity etc relating to the covid-19 pandemic fig 1 has not been sufficiently investigated how the virus enters the body eyes ears mouth and nose is not well known by the release of aerosols and droplets containing sars-cov-2 in human societies however previous findings in the epidemic of a virus similar to sars-cov-2 can be used in this regard sun et al 2020 because the methods of transmission are not currently known therefore cdc recommends standard precautions contact and air and eye protection glasses or face shields cdc 2020b e it has been reported that even with personal protective equipment ppe it is still possible to get infected dai 2020 because there is no convincing evidence to support the effect of ppe use in the prevention of infection yang 2020 the significant concern about sars-cov-2 is its transmission dehghani and kassiri 2020 according to the who there is no certainty about the persistence of the sars-cov-2 on surfaces however the virus appears to act like other coronaviruses and can survive on the surface for at least several hours parry 2004 for this reason the following health points in public places hospitals and residential houses has a significant role in controlling the transmission of the disease who 2020a dealing with covid-19 and preventing its rapid and dangerous spread is a global challenge therefore the fight against this disease requires global management however due to the potential variability of this disease according to the type of climate and other environmental factors its prevention and control should be investigated quickly and seriously askari et al 2018 when a new pandemic occurs a lot of health advice is given anyway it should be noted that these methods may not be the most accurate and correct but following them can be effective until sufficient knowledge is obtained nevertheless a hierarchy to deal with sars-cov-2 transmission involves three steps 1 self-care 2 control of environmental factors and 3 the use of ppe lai et al 2020 this study aimed to investigate the effect and role of various factors including environmental factors climate change water transfer air and food disinfection of surfaces and hands in the transmission and prevalence of covid-19 pandemicscurrently due to the prevalence of covid-19 in most parts of the world one of the primary concerns is the relationship between environmental factors such as rising summer temperatures and the rapid prevalence of coronavirus abbasi et al 2020 wang et al 2020b one study observed the relationship between the numbers of positive daily sars-cov-2 cases with three environmental factors maximum relative humidity maximum temperature and maximum wind speed in four cities in china and five cities in italy in this study the relationship between the prevalence of the covid-19 with maximum air humidity and wind speed was negligible and statistically not significant although in most cases with increasing humidity and wind speed the prevalence has decreased the association between covid-19 prevalence and maximum ambient temperature was negligible to moderate also with increasing temperature in most of the studied cities the prevalence of the disease has decreased bhattacharjee 2020 the study by chin et al 2020 reported the resistance of the sars-cov-2 at 4 c for a long time but at 70 c its resistance was 5 min in general heat high or low ph and sunlight make it easier to kill the coronavirus who 2020b however the results of a study also showed that the virus is stable at different phs of 310 at room temperature chin et al 2020 a new study of 24139 positive sars-cov-2 cases was conducted in 26 regions in china its results show that with a 1 c increase of the minimum ambient air temperature the cumulative number of cases decreases by 086 fig 1 wang et al 2020baccording to the cdc sars-cov-2 transmission through food food packages and food handlers has not been identified as a risk factor for the disease however based on the available evidence and the persistence of the virus on the surfaces between a few hours and a few days cdc suggested washing and then disinfection as the best way to control this virus seymour et al 2020b sanitary recommendations are also recommended when relocation and preparing food such as washing hands regularly separating raw meat from other foods cooking at high temperatures and storing food in the refrigerator eslami et al 2015 seymour et al 2020c the most important health recommendations for staff involved in preparing and distributing food include complete personal hygiene such as covering the nose and mouth by bending the elbow during sneezing or coughing isolating employees with covid-19 symptoms or having contact with these patients and following the minimum distance 6 feet or 18 m between employees also providing multiple points for hand washing and disinfection at work and washing and disinfection of surfaces with high contact by diluted sodium hypochlorite 01 seymour et al 2020cguaranteeing safe water collecting sewage and maintaining effective hygiene during infectious diseases including covid-19 pandemic play a key role in supporting human health eslami et al 2018 who 2020b the risk of covid-19 appears to be low through the stool of an infected person there is evidence that sars-cov-2 may lead to intestinal infection and be present in the stool bhattacharjee 2020 studies show that approximately 2 to 10 percent of confirmed sars-cov-2 cases have been associated with diarrhea chen et al 2020 huang et al 2020 wang et al 2020a two studies have reported the detection of residual sars-cov-2 viral rna in the stool of patients with sars-cov-2 holshue et al 2019 xiao et al 2020 yet only one study has reported the sars-cov-2 from a cultured stool sample who 2020b in the latest study the report of the presence of the sars-cov-2 virus in sewage has been confirmed the presence of the virus in the wastewater even when the prevalence of the virus is low indicates that the sars-cov-2 can survive in the sewage this finding could be a sensitive tool for tracking and monitoring the rate of virus rotation in communities lodder and de roda husman 2020 medema et al 2020 some studies have reported that coronavirus can remain in water or wastewater sources for days or weeks qu et al 2020 due to the evidence of the virus surviving in aquatic and sewage environments its presence in water resources is dependent on essential factors such as temperature sunlight and the presence of organic compounds that the virus can adsorb to and protect themself against sunlight the presence of other antagonistic microorganisms can also affect its survival in water resources according to the latest who report there is no evidence that human-type coronavirus has been transmitted through contaminated drinking water naddeo and liu 2020 in general coated viruses are less environmentally friendly and are more sensitive to oxidants such as chlorine the sars-cov-2 is likely to be significantly inactivated more rapidly than human intestinal viruses without water-borne diseases in contact with oxidants who 2020bresearch has shown that newly infected patients have no clinical symptoms and can easily be the source of the spread and transmission of sars-cov-2 this transmission can be through sneezing coughing talking to other people at close range and through the foul airflow li et al 2020 zhi 2020 based on the available evidence it is not thought that air diffusion is one of the main transmission routes dehghani and kassiri 2020 non-invasive ventilation high flow oxygen therapy intubationextubation nebulization open suctioning of airway secretions bronchoscopy induction of sputum bag and mask ventilation cardiopulmonary resuscitation etc are the principal causes of sars-cov-2 aerosol release in airflow cdc 2020d for example the role of environmental pollution in several hospitals has been evaluated following the outbreak of mers-cov in 2015 in korea as well as experimental studies on the survival and stability of mers-cov on surfaces and air bin et al 2016 there is also the possibility of air stability for sars-cov-2 therefore the use of viral filters and closed suctioning airflow changes and negative pressure air pollution in closed environments with the probability of infection is recommended malhotra et al 2020 thus people in contaminated environments should use a mask and if there is no mask should use face masks bowdle and munoz-price 2020 facial hair can provide a way for sars-cov-2 to penetrate malhotra et al 2020 using non-standard masks can also exacerbate the incidence of sars-cov-2 jones and xia 2018 besides wearing a mask in some health workers has shown symptoms of claustrophobia respiratory distress discomfort and skin irritation barratt et al 2019 the most available type is the n95 mask which according to studies can be sterilized and reused by hydrogen peroxide gamma rays from co60 uv rays dry and wet heat and ethylene oxide in the meantime the use of radiation is preferable to other methods card et al 2020 cramer et al 2020 kenney et al 2020 gamma co60 with a dose of 10 kg can sterilize the n95 mask used in sars-cov environments and kill the virus feldmann et al 2019 however high doses of radiation may damage the fibers of the mask and allow air to pass through without purification but it does not have secondary radiation and its side effects harrell et al 2018 hydrogen peroxide is also a useful antiviral and has no adverse effects on the respiratory tract viscusi et al 2009 enhanced traffic control bundling etcb was very effective at the time of the sars-cov outbreak due to the similarity of this disease with covid-19 the application of this strategy can prevent the transmission of the disease through the air yen et al 2020 in this way patients with clinical symptoms quarantined other people use disinfectant and ppe during patients visits to the hospital this process has been approved in the control of other epidemic diseases such as ebola and sars-cov and is currently being implemented in covid-19 pandemics ong et al 2020 schwartz et al 2020b yen et al 2015 the possibility of transmitting bioaerosols with the ability to move up to 6 feet through the air has also been reported in the internal environment of ophthalmologists cdc 2020c as a result hepa filters have been used for ventilation still air-born emissions for sars-cov-2 have not yet been reported according to available evidence it is not confirmed that air can be one of the principal causes of transmission therefore it can be predicted that if any suspended matter is created in the air of medical centers the transfer will be easy who 2020anumerous factors are contributing to the spread of global diseases such as covid-19 which is spreading worldwide these conditions include ecology and human behavior these cases have been directly and indirectly involved in the occurrence of some problems and diseases barratt et al 2019 dehghani and kassiri 2020 most coronaviruses are pathogenic and can cause acute respiratory syndrome so far 7 types of them have been identified gorbalenya 2020 roush et al 2019 the transmission and evolution of the sars-cov-2 from bats to scaly anteaters pangolins and then to humans has been reported dehghani and kassiri 2020 this process is now present in humans through aerosols but transmission through secretions such as stool has not been confirmed in addition to these cases the transfer through bandages can also be considered there have been no reports of sars-cov-2 transmission by blood-borne arthropods such as mosquitoes shankar et al 2020 wu and mcgoogan 2020 some studies have associated insects such as beetles and domestic insects which are the main mechanical carriers of pathogens by contact with contaminated surfaces and patients secretions involved in transmission graczyk et al 2005 kobayashi et al 1999 vazirianzadeh et al 2014 sars-cov-2 excretion by stool has been confirmed in some patients therefore feeding domestic insects and beetles from the stool and its mechanical transmission can play a significant role in the transmission of the disease parry 2004 they can transmit more than 100 pathogens through the legs body hair mouth feces and vomit in this regard the elimination of mechanical carriers is very important not only in residential homes but also in public places there are several ways to control these organisms including improving environmental hygiene such as putting garbage in closed bags and trash cans controlling sanitary landfills sanitary toilets proper sewage disposal systems and preventing the accumulation of manure nearby and residential areas jobara 2016 clinical and laboratory wastes from sars-cov-2 detection in suspected individuals secretions such as blood 1 and feces 26 can also be a major source of the virus chang et al 2020 iwen et al 2020 but no study has shown the presence of the virus in the urine wang et al 2020c finally if such waste is not properly managed sars-cov-2 can be transmitted through mechanical transmission by insects cdc 2020ahuman-to-human transmission of the sars-cov-2 occurs most often when people are in the communal stage of the disease or carrier and have no symptoms or when they are with mild symptoms the important ways of transmitting the virus are through droplets infected hands and skin-to-skin contact as well as inanimate surface contact kampf et al 2020 studies show that sars-cov-2 stays for more than 9 days and be resistant like other coronaviruses such as sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers can live on inanimate surfaces such as metals glass and plastic at room temperature also at ambient temperatures of 30 c and above the duration of sars-cov-2 is reduced kampf et al 2020 some studies have suggested that a temperature of 56 oc for 90 min or a temperature of 67 oc for 60 min can cause sars-cov-2 to be inactive henwood 2020 kampf et al 2020 showed that at room temperature and 50 humidity the resistance of the virus was more than 30 in one study the stability of sars-cov-2 on different surfaces confirmed that the virus was more resistant to smooth surfaces than others according to the results of this study the virus remains stable at temperatures of 22 oc and relative humidity of 65 for 4 days on surfaces such as glass and banknotes and 7 days on smooth surfaces such as steel and plastic it also stays on rough surfaces such as fabric and wood for up to 2 days chin et al 2020 another investigation which examined environmental levels of sars-cov-2 virus in hospital centers found that the most important environmental levels of infection were self-service printers 20 used in chinese laboratories desktops and keyboards 168 door handles 16 telephones 125 and medical equipment 125 ye et al 2020 studies show that students touch their face with their hands an average of 23 times an hour 56 of it is the touch of the skin 36 is the lips 31 is the nose and 31 is the eyes kwok et al 2015 although sars-cov-2 is not available on the surface of complete information on viral load it can be said that by reducing the frequency of touching surfaces by hands and disinfecting surfaces the amount of virus load on surfaces can be reduced kampf et al 2020 the who has recommended that cleanliness be done with water and detergents to ensure environmental cleanliness and then the use of common environmental disinfectants such as sodium hypochlorite who 2020c the most well-known methods of surface disinfection to remove sars-cov-2 virus are in short the use of ethyl alcohol 6270 or hydrogen peroxide 05 or sodium hypochlorite 01 dilution ratio 1 to 50 with a contact time of 1 min henwood 2020 who 2014 other biocidal agents such as benzalkonium chloride 00502 or chlorhexidine digluconate 02 are also applicable but their effectiveness is less than previous who 2014 the effect of hand soap on disinfecting surfaces from the sars-cov-2 virus was investigated the results of this study show that the virus is inactivated by contact with soap for 5 min chin et al 2020 the cdc has also recommended a water temperature above 65 degrees to disinfect surfaces seymour et al 2020a one of the most important concerns at the pandemic period of coronavirus is disinfection and sterilization of surgical masks and n95 for reuse the significant thing is that these devices are disposable and cannot be reused in normal conditions however in cases of shortage and under certain conditions they can be reused up to 5 times by disinfecting and sterilizing them the use of thermal methods of at least 50 c for at 30 min is highly recommended as a disinfection and sterilization method for n95 masks in one study the use of uc radiation with a 100 wcm2 power with a contact time of 15 to 20 min for sterilization of n95 mask was suggested card et al 2020 in another study the use of hydrogen peroxide hp vapor was used in a short time to sterilize the n95 mask seymour et al 2020a hydrogen peroxide gas is suitable for disinfecting devices used for patients with viral infections it also does not hurt patients respiratory system and can be used to disinfect hospital rooms schwartz et al 2020apreliminary health advice when spreading epidemics is to observe hand hygiene and use ppe some of the reasons for not following the recommendations occur at the individual group and community levels at the time of the epidemic such issues are particularly well addressed among medical staff nevertheless some hand disinfectants are not effective in eliminating the pathogen pittet 2001 in other words a disinfectant should be used that will affect the pathogen and the virus in question at the same time as the covid-19 pandemic the effectiveness of hand sanitizers can prevent the virus from spreading because the main way to prevent the transmission of pathogens is body contact lack of public access to such materials is also a significant issue at this time the effectiveness of home disinfectants has been investigated by who seymour et al 2020d its main ingredients are alcohol glycerin and hydrogen peroxide after that spray on the hands and drying is done automatically by exposing it to the air lack of hand disinfection and contact with parts of the body ears eyes nose and mouth can cause covid-19 in one study alcohol-based hand rubs or soap and water hand wash were shown to be effective in preventing covid-19 sequentially if the disinfectant dries the above-mentioned items should be used again before contact with the patient or any use of the hand malhotra et al 2020 although there is evidence that hand hygiene can reduce respiratory illness it has not yet been proven that it can reduce the transmission of sars-cov-2 yang 2020 so far no eye infections have been reported in patients with the sars-cov-2 but very few viruses have been seen in tears and conjunctival discharge it can be seen that the eye may not be the main entrance of sars-cov-2 into the body and cause respiratory infections sun et al 2020 however eye infections can be caused by respiratory and nasopharyngeal infections it can be very efficient especially during close contact between the patient and the clinical staff the use of masks and goggles along with hand disinfection has shown a significant reduction in person-to-person transmission yang 2020 also since sars-cov-2 is not only transmitted through the air and can survive on the surface for a while the importance of hand disinfection cannot be ignored otter et al 2016 besides infected people can contaminate the surface they touch which may include a large number of household items and appliances who 2020a in this way even infected people should disinfect their handsreviews of studies have shown that reducing the frequency of touching surfaces by hands and disinfecting surfaces can reduce the amount of coronavirus load on surfaces and the rate of transmission the most important solution is to disinfect surfaces clean surfaces with water and detergents and then disinfect with ethyl alcohol 6271 or hydrogen peroxide 05 or sodium hypochlorite 01 with 1 min contact time despite the lack of evidence of sars-cov-2 transmission by blood-borne arthropods such as mosquitoes some studies have identified insects such as beetles and domestic insects which are the main mechanical carriers of pathogens through contact with contaminated surfaces and patients secretions also its transmission through the air with a minimum distance of 6 feet water and sewage and food has not been provided so fardistinguishing viruses whether exogenous or endogenous from other forms of life including parasitic genetic elements is an ambiguous but not impossible task there are characteristics shared by all viruses that set them apart from other self-replicating systems viruses are obligate molecular parasites that rely on only one type of genomic material either dna or rna and use a proteinaceous genome package to facilitate dispersal while viruses are not metabolically active organisms their phenotypic variation results in differential replication success thereby ensuring they are subject to the laws of evolution virus taxa like organisms more frequently investigated evolutionarily clearly change through time and to profound degrees unlike the cellular macrobiota however our observations of viral transformation are very direct and never from examination of a large-scale past timeline such as the fossil record if observed proportions of certain character state changes in viruses were applied to megafauna hypotheses regarding the amount of time required to manufacture these changes would most likely be on the order of hundreds of thousands to millions of years yet critical changes in such factors as host range habitat capsid and envelope proteins morphology and life-history characters are common in some viruses within the time of a typical research projectas with all forms of life the pace and direction of viral evolution are determined by the selective environment that is occupied this environment is both multidimensional and continually changing while constantly driving the increase in population fitness the differences in viral as opposed to say multicellular selective environments are mostly in quantity not quality in other words the fundamental nature of selection is not influenced by organism complexity fitness must always move uphill yet the character of selective pressure is determined by an organisms necessities for survival it could also be argued that because of the limited sequence space of viral genomes the high probability of genetic drift during transmission bottlenecks extremely large population sizes and at least for many rna viruses the high mutation and recombination rates viruses exhibit greater mobility through the space of their selective or adaptive environments than do more complex organisms moya 1997evolutionary ecology is the study of how organisms respond and have responded evolutionarily to the selective environments in which they exist the environment is defined as the physical biological and stochastic elements with which an organism interacts and uniquely determines the type and degree of natural selective pressure exertedviruses have both general and specific requirements for replication and existence all viruses require the use of a host cells atp ribosome nucleotide trna and amino acid resources many viruses also require use of other cell functions and components such as replication and splicing machinery often viruses will utilize more advanced host characteristics especially when dealing with the demands of transmission here they may take advantage of host ecology feeding habits sexual behavior social structure etc to facilitate hosthost transferno matter the level one characteristic that is shared by all viruses fundamental reproductive strategy is host exploitation if a hosts biology possesses a component that can be used to augment reproduction of some viral strain then chances are it typically is but as with all organisms these requisite conditions are a double-edged sword in that while they allow perpetuation of a given virus population their variability selects for survival of only a subset of phenotypes from that population thus while viruses are not typically subjected to the types of soft selection resulting from resource competition that many plant and animal species experience their natural selection is often more commonly unpredictable and determined by probabilistic conditionsviruses lack of relative complexity is clearly not paralleled in their adaptability and nowhere is this more apparent than in their seeming omnipresence every extant species genome is thought to act as a viral host and perhaps a thousand different virus types are known to infect homo sapiens alone investigation of the evolutionary ecology of viruses seeks to explain observed patterns of viral diversity by invoking mechanisms that take into account evolutionary response to the environments in which they exist such research relies heavily on very disparate areas of science for instance mere description of such fundamental virus characteristics as appearance life cycle and tissue tropism is only possible through the tools of biochemistry and molecular biology answers regarding virus population dynamics such as growth and size fluctuation are often provided by epidemiological research and evolutionary interpretation and prediction are formulated using concepts of theoretical population biology this area of inquiry is quite young and is destined to expand with increasing sophistication in data collection and in analytical methods and technology the exponentially growing database of molecular information and the continual emergence of viruses as pathogens
knowledge about the evolutionary ecology of viruses has valuable multidisciplinary applications as well for example it may aid investigation of emerging infectious diseases of all types by providing models of host switching ie successful occupation of an additional host taxon for sustained transmission it can make contributions to medical virology by giving researchers information about specific viral ecological requirements thereby opening up possible routes of antiviral treatment or immunization such inquiry also assists theoreticians in many ways by providing real-life models for population genetic phylogenetic ecological and even mathematical researchour discussion of viral evolutionary ecology will begin with examination of viral fitness and selection with special emphasis on the many levels at which these concepts can be applied we continue with discussion of ecological concepts such as niche species taxon interactions life-history evolution and specialization we will finish by looking at theoretical concepts such as sequence space and fitness peaks and relating such ideas to actual patterns of virus diversity and diversificationevolution by natural selection is a temporal process resulting from differential reproductive success of phenotypes that allows persistence of corresponding genotypes through generations traditionally this change is measured as a statistical difference in some population parameters between separate generational cohorts of a given taxonomic group usually population or species the direction and extent of this change is determined by a combination of stochastic and environmental factors that are specific for a given time space and taxon therefore the offspring of individuals or groups selected for reproduction in one biological circumstance are by no means guaranteed to thrive in the following generation since the selective environment may be slightly or radically different an admittedly poorly defined and at times controversial evolutionary term adaptation essentially refers to characters that arise and persist as a result of such selection and thus confer upon their bearers the ability to succeed genetically in a specific environment adaptation can also refer to the actual process of acquiring such traits many different levels of characters can thus be considered as adaptations point mutations coding region products multigene assemblages behavioral traits and even populational characters may all endow their possessors with reproductive advantage and thus evolutionary persistencetechnically the fitness of a unit under selection refers to the contribution it makes to the overall genetic makeup of the subsequent generation relative to other such units in theory selected units can be genes cells individuals populations and even phyla lewontin 1970 williams 1966 fitness is thus directly related to a units comparative degree of adaptedness the concept of fitness as applied to viruses and other microparasites has been discussed at length elsewhere may 1995 anderson and may 1991 domingo and holland 1997 fitness and its measurement are central themes in any discussion of evolutionary ecology no matter the organism and thus warrant clearer elucidationfitness can be examined in various ways first by using fishers 1930 net reproductive rate r
0 which is merely the number of viable offspring produced per individual over their life-span which for viruses is equal to the infection of one cell or one host as will be discussed r
0 is a conceptually convenient metric especially when considering the absolute fitness of an organism for instance the potential for occupation of a host population by a specific virus but may be misleading when interpreted as a measure of relative fitness since alone it provides no information about individual reproductive rate compared to the population reproductive rate over the same time-span the competing virus with the highest r
0 can have the highest probability of long-term survival but determining this probability for an individual would require comparison of all relevant r
0s in a population or group therefore r
0 for an individual can be greater than 1 implying reproductive success but this provides no information about individual performance with respect to population growth as a whole therefore an individual with r
0  1 may actually have high relative fitness under conditions of population decrease provided the individuals rate of decrease is correspondingly smaller
r
0 also does not take into account variation in generation time and is therefore not always useful when examining fitness over absolute time in other words one phenotype may actually confer a lower r
0 than another yet still exhibit relatively higher reproductive output ie higher fitness if its generation time is appropriately shorterbecause of these shortcomings in r
0 it is advantageous to use instantaneous growth rates for both the individual  and the population as a whole r since these are independent of generation length and thus measure reproductive output per unit t of absolute time giske and colleagues 1993 have described a particularly useful relative fitness term  that measures an individuals reproductive output relative to that of its population as the difference between  and r therefore  is a measure of fitness that is both instantaneous in real time and relative as such any positive value of  indicates increasing proportional representation of a particular phenotype in a population even when r
0  1 or   0 provided r is sufficiently small relative fitness in this sense is both more accurate since it accounts for variation in generation length and perhaps more applicable since it describes an individuals reproductive performance in light of that for its population as a wholeas will be discussed below these concepts must be applied to viruses on at least two completely separate levels within intra- hosts and between inter- hosts taking into consideration the purely endogenous nature of some agents does not influence the partitioned application of the two notions since new host inoculation regardless of the route is key to evolutionary persistence the theme unifying both types of fitness however is competition between viral strains taxa for reproductive substrate in the case of intrahost evolution this substrate is host resources cellular molecular while in the case of interhost evolution it is the actual occupation of the hosts themselvesany ecological system is composed of species and individuals interacting both with each other and with abiotic conditions such interactions result in regulation of population sizes as individuals compete for limiting resources this is similarly the case in viruses reproducing within a susceptible host or host tissue viral population sizes must obviously be regulated lest they grow to infinity but the forces influencing such limits differ in their relative contributions between viral host ecosystems and species ecosystemsfactors that influence species population change may include density-dependent interactions such as competition for resources inter- and intraspecific and predation but also abiotic factors like physical environmental characteristics and probabilistic conditions such factors also exist in viral host ecosystems but some have a much greater influence than others on a smaller level however an individual host can be looked upon as an ecosystem there are many biotic and abiotic components that interact in both predictable and unpredictable ways to influence the growth properties of viral populationsresources ie reproductive substrate required by viruses inside a host include living cells of given tissue types once an intrahost virus population has become established the relative abundance of infectible cells is usually extremely high and in a holistic sense not a limiting factor this is demonstrated by the observation that in most viral infections less than 1 of the susceptible host tissue is actually infected griffin 1997 however the ecological concept of metapopulation dynamics may have some application in this case this notion assumes that populations are spatially structured so that they are actually aggregates of smaller local subpopulations and that migration between these subpopulations is significant enough to influence local dynamics hanski and simberloff 1997 while this is most commonly applied to sexually reproducing organisms and popularly utilized in topics of conservation biology it is possible that the metapopulation concept could be useful in understanding viral intrahost evolutionary patternssince cellular resource competition is in general not a primary force regulating viral population dynamics it may have some significance at the microspatial level for instance very localized infection of tissue could produce a confined abundance of viral particles with limited access to mechanisms of dispersal which under optimal conditions could carry them to other sources of infectible cells this accumulation of both viral particles and non-infectible cells would result in isolated competition and subsequently produce selection for either quick and successful cell invasion or dispersal to more fertile areas successful dispersal may give rise to other local subpopulations and result in similar selective pressures the concept of metapopulation dynamics has never been applied to viruses in such a context but may be worth further investigation when endeavoring to understand intrahost viral reproduction and adaptive evolutionresource competition may also be manifest under some circumstances of extreme viral induced cytopathicity for instance near the end of an infection that has resulted in high cytopathology or even necrosis of specific tissue required for virus replication in such a situation there may theoretically be a much larger population of infectious virus than available reproductive substrate can support this gives rise to competitive conditions in which some may survive due to their superior ability to effectively occupy remaining cells and the remainder go extinct it is conceivable that such may be the case in diseases like aids in which cd4 cells required for hiv replication have been extensively consumed thus resulting in the reproduction of only a small portion of existing viral particles in fact up to 60 of cd4 lymphocytes may be infected with hiv during aids viremia bagasra et al 1993 hsia and spector 1991 patterson et al 1993 schnittman et al 1990in nearly all cases the most significant power guiding intrahost viral population dynamics is perhaps neutralization by host antiviral immune defenses the relationship between viral growth and immune response has of course been studied quite extensively from a clinical standpoint and most recently from the perspectives of evolution and population biology wassom 1993 garnett and antia 1994 bonhoeffer and nowak 1994 kilbourne 1994 bangham 1995in many ways the virus-immune interaction mimics a typical predatorprey type relationship and can be understood fundamentally using the lotka-volterra ecological model of species interactions lotka 1932 volterra 1926 the goal here is an interpretation of the temporal growthdecay dynamics of an intrahost virus population and cells andor products manufactured by the host to neutralize virus infection in the absence of any counteractive forces an intrahost population of viruses will grow exponentially as
1dvdt  rv
where v is the number of viruses ie prey present at time t and r is the per-capita rate of population growth per time unit as discussed previously viruses cannot grow at this rate indefinitely however and population growth is diminished in our model at a rate proportional to the potency of host antiviral responses therefore if the quantity of host antiviral components immune cells antiviral compounds etc are collectively represented by i ie predatory influences which has an overall per-virus neutralization effectiveness coefficient of a ie the probability of viral death on contact with these components then the growth of virus populations becomes
2dvdt  rv-aiv
in many host systems the presence of adaptive antiviral elements that react against specific viral types is related to the concentration of those viral particles the population dynamics of this particular association has not been investigated from an ecological standpoint as thoroughly for viruses as it has for macroscopic organisms yet it was shown that b-cell populations in mice persist in relation to the amount of antigen present in the animals periphery on which the b cells rely for continued stimulation and that competition actually exists between b-cell subtypes for this limiting resource mclean et al 1997 if such density dependence occurs for immune components as well the population change therein may be described in terms of an equation similar to 23didt  faiv-qiwhere f is the rate of immune component increase commonly due to stimulation by viral antigens and q is the per-capita rate of immune component degradation death therefore it should be clear that faiv represents the intrinsic rate of increase of the immune response and that this is proportional to v the amount of virus present within a hostthe first potential virus-host cell interaction to be acted upon evolutionarily is cell surface receptor binding specificity of surface receptor usage is likely connected at least to a certain extent with the occurrence of particular molecules proteins carbohydrates glycolipids exposed on the surface of those candidate host cells that are likely to provide an optimal overall environment for virus replication in other words many receptor specificities may have arisen as methods of cell type identification in viruses since viruses are continually under selective pressure to infect tissue with the highest potential for long-term virus propagation this is an important variable in the course of viral infection since it is often the only barrier preventing replication within a given cell or tissue typefor instance human poliovirus receptor is found only on primate cells mclaren et al 1959 the virus does not naturally replicate in other mammals but is fully capable of doing so in mice once its genome is artificially introduced into host cells holland et al 1959 more recently winkler and colleagues 1998 discovered a human polymorphism in the stromal-derived factor sdf-1 gene that delays the onset of aids in patients homozygous for a variant allele it is thought that the variant upregulates the expression of sdf-1 which is a ligand for the cxcr4 cell receptor the cd4 molecule and this cell surface protein act together as coreceptors for t-tropic hiv strains that normally arise late in infection competitive interference from the increased presence of sdf-1 may actually be protecting susceptible cells from hiv binding and subsequent endocytosis thereby postponing disease symptoms receptor specificity can thus have profound implications for the pathogenicity and evolutionary expansion of viruses into new tissue types and host ranges and will be discussed laterreceptor specificity may also be related to the normal cellular function of the receptor molecule that is since the first viral replication objective is typically cellular internalization selective pressure must exist to increase the efficiency and rapidity with which this occurs therefore it would benefit the infecting virus to utilize surface receptors whose normal molecular purpose it is to transport objects across the cell membrane furthermore it may be additionally advantageous to select among all the possible transport receptors those that can internalize the given virus type most effectively in this way selection can shape the use and specificity of the employed surface receptors to optimize infection along these same lines it may be easy to see how many viruses could have adapted to employ as receptors those cell components that affect endocytotic mechanisms and conditions needed for viral entry and uncoatinganother group of common targets for evolutionary modification includes those cellular components that enhance viral reproductive rate at the stages of transcription translation and replication of viral genes a comprehensive listing of specific viral tactics used to optimize these activities would be quite large and beyond the scope of this chapter yet some patterns definitely exist and warrant mentioning for instance the genomes of numerous viruses are configured so that those gene products that are translated early in infection are involved in and often direct the ensuing transcription andor translation of late genes such early proteins may also act as trans-acting downregulators of their own expression on approach to threshold concentrations in addition many viruses have developed the ability to use host factors to control transcriptionperhaps discussion of viral tactics of immune suppression should begin with examples of viruses that replicate within cells that are involved either directly or indirectly in the antiviral response as mentioned an obvious way to disable a hosts antiviral capability is to destroy components of the response or the source of those components for instance the replication cycle of numerous viruses of vertebrate taxa requires cells of the host immune system such as macrophages monocytes lymphocytes natural killer nk cells antigen presenting cells apcs or stromal cells see table i
and griffin 1997 for a review this strategy provides two clear evolutionary benefits to such viruses a source of viral progeny and a reduced host antiviral reaction
although potentially extreme and relatively rare cytocidal replication within such tissues can obviously have a direct negative impact on the hosts ability to destroy viral pathogens the ability of viruses to endure host antiviral reactions is facilitated in infectious bursal disease virus of chickens and infectious pancreatic necrosis virus of trout by cytolytic infection of b lymphocytes this lysis results in a significant loss of these cells and subsequent humoral immunosuppression due to decreased antibody production tate et al 1990 saif 1991 muller 1986more common among viruses is cytopathic infection of immune cells replication within the host immune cells by many viruses usually does not result in rapid and essential death of these cells yet may impair cell function to such a degree that the antiviral response is weakened  all to the potential benefit of the resident virus population a mammalian target immune cell of viral replication for which a great deal of research has been undertaken is the t lymphocyte lentiviruses are particularly known to infect t cells in humans see table i as well as in other mammals but other viruses such as some herpesviruses may also infect these cells such infection frequently results in abnormal proliferation of t cells t-cell growth resulting from htlv-1 infection for example is known to impair immunologic function but the subsequent effect on viral population growth is unknown hiv is also known to have profound effects on host immune function mainly through its replication within cd4 t cells and monocytes which is a likely contributor to the high viremia exhibited during the final stages of infection in this case the utilization of immune cells may not be as beneficial ecologically as it might appear and for a very simple reason that is while the destruction of cd4 cells may promote viral replication by decreasing antiviral pressure it simultaneously diminishes the amount of reproductive substrate available for replication see abovea very prevalent viral technique of immunosuppression involves utilization of proteins whether viral or cellular to disrupt the host antiviral response many viruses have the ability to sabotage production or function of host cytokines using their own gene products such abilities of individual viruses give rise to obvious evolutionary benefits not only for that individual but also for other members of the infecting viral population many host molecules  including interferons interleukins and other cytokines  are susceptible to the action of immunosuppressive viruses see table ii
 the action of these molecules may be at the level of prevention of transcription eg hbv terminal protein or translation eg adenovirus e1a inhibition of cytokine activated enzymes eg rnase-l inactivation in hsv infection or sequestration of the molecules via complement binding eg ifn- receptor decoy produced by myxoma virus to name a few viral gene products may also interfere with other aspects of the host antiviral response such as antigen presentation vaccinia virus hsv and downregulation of host cell genes required for proper
antiviral function eg mhc i and ii icam lfa-3 this subject is discussed in greater detail as an evolutionary topic belowviruses may avoid contact with a functional immune response by becoming antigenically invisible for instance some viruses that utilize vertical transmission do not elicit a specific antiviral response at all due to the inability of the immune system to recognize them as foreign one such strategy is well exemplified by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus lcmv infection in mice in this system viruses that infect adult mice are effectively cleared from the host principally by way of an lcmv-specific cytotoxic t-lymphocyte ctl response zinkernagel and welsh 1976 byrne and oldstone 1984 moskophidisy et al 1987 ahmed et al 1988 matloubian et al 1994 mice that are infected in utero or perinatally however retain high lifelong titers of infectious lcmv throughout their bodies this persistence is made possible by the lack of a specific ctl-mediated antiviral response due to clonal deletion of lcmv-specific t cells during mouse ontogeny buchmeier et al 1980 ahmed et al 1984 moskophidis et al 1987 pircher et al 1989 jamieson et al 1991 the early and pervasive presence of lcmv particles antigen results in immunologic acceptance of the virus by the host yet still allows for a completely functional immune response against other pathogens and their antigensone certain way to avoid destruction by an intact immune system is to avoid or limit direct interaction with its components altogether this can be accomplished in a number of ways among which is viral persistence including the possibility of replication within immunologically privileged tissue that is inaccessible to the host antiviral response for instance many types of herpesviruses varicella zoster herpes simplex lie latent in nonreplicating sensory neurons that are poorly penetrated by the immune system these viruses may periodically move through axons to epithelial or ophthalmic sites for replication where they may eventually be suppressed by the immune response but never actually leave the host permanently some viruses will replicate within tissues that experience little or no exposure to antiviral host defenses human polyomaviruses bk and jc as well as cytomegalovirus benefit from limited t-cell effectiveness within kidney epithelial tissue by replicating there and thus avoid destruction quite efficiently ahmed et al 1997other viruses may evade immune contact by completing sufficient replication and transmission before a significant host antiviral attack can be fully executed many viruses that replicate to high concentrations quickly employ this technique such viruses operate under conditions of three relevant thresholds 1 the intrahost virus population size that triggers an immune response 2 the intrahost population size that allows for interhost transmission 3 the amount of time it takes an antiviral reaction to decrease the viral concentration below the transmission threshold
figure 1
provides a simple illustration of intrahost population growth for an imaginary acutely infecting virus under this model a virus can only survive evolutionarily in a host population given the following specific conditions the threshold viral concentration for effective interhost transmission b must be exceeded for sufficient time as to allow for occupation of a new susceptible host this time will vary inversely with the quantity of infectious virus being shed by the host a virus must therefore employ reproductive strategies that can include maximizing the amount of time it is being shed in adequate numbers ed andor minimizing b or conversely maximizing a the threshold concentration triggering a host antiviral response this appears to be analogous to the strategies used by many well-examined viruses such as influenza measles rhinoviruses and vzv to name just a few
under the conditions of this model a virus may also exhibit a  b in which case an antiviral response is effectively never activated and the virus will be transmitted satisfactorily as long as its concentration remains above b this latter strategy might only be evolutionarily stable for viruses of limited pathogenicity since host mortality usually limits sustainable viral spread also subpopulations within a given host might differ in the shape of their respective curves and values for a b c d and eyet another adaptation used to evade host antiviral defenses that has arisen in many viruses with rna genomes is rapid and continual production of antigenic variation high mutation rates in some viruses hiv fmdv as well as reassortment of genomic segments of others influenza virus give rise to a quasi-species also referred to as a mutant or variant swarm population structure within an infected host andor host population holland et al 1982 both et al 1983 mateu et al 1989 bachrach 1968 nowak et al 1990 1995 wolinsky et al 1996 the result is genomic variation that is manifest as phenotypic diversity in the form of multiple antigenic types present in a single host at one time see fig 2
 this heterogeneity may cause high overall mortality rates for the virus but at the same time it provides assurance that at least a small proportion of variants will avoid host neutralization due to the inability of the specific antiviral response to act both effectively and simultaneously on every antigenic type that exists or arises domingo and holland 1997 reviewed the fitness and evolution of rna viruses in relation to their mutability quite thoroughlythis adaptation has perhaps no duplicate in species predatorprey evolutionary ecology it may however be thought of in relation to negative frequency-dependent selection a condition that does exist in many species predator-prey interactions in this case rarer phenotypes eg antigenic variants are favored as long as they remain relatively uncommon once a variant rises in frequency the probability that it will be recognized by a predator species or host immune system increases accordingly and thus its growth rate will be reduced usually to the advantage of immunologically less conspicuous mutants it is in this way that the virus evades contact with antiviral components and persists within a host as a heterogeneous population it appears to be a unique strategy however to avoid predation in that the adaptation is indeed the process of mutability the virus damages itself rather than the host tissuein fact viruses such as coliphage q fmdv vsv and hiv have such high mutation rates that they are near the point of error threshold that is to say slight increases in their mutation rates would result in failure of sufficiently accurate stable genomic perpetuation and subsequent extinction of the viral strains nowak and schuster 1989 eigen and biebricher 1988 holland et al 1990 the biological nonviability of mutation rates beyond the point of error threshold has even been demonstrated experimentally for vsv and poliovirus holland et al 1990concepts such as quasi-species and population fitness evoke notions of group selection a somewhat controversial topic among evolutionists group selection favors those characters that promote the survival of populations or taxonomic levels higher than that of the individual but either decrease or do not affect individual fitness the actual contributions of group versus individual selection to the evolutionary process are difficult to discern especially with respect to situations in which the two appear to act in opposite directions however when considering viruses and other microparasites this idea may be helpful if not necessary to explain the evolutionary maintenance of certain traitsquasi-species actually provide very good examples of group selection in action under these circumstances selection on the individual is weak when compared to that acting on the entire spectrum of mutants since the representation of a given genotype is determined by a combination of 1 its own relative replication rate and 2 the frequency with which it arises from the mutation of other parental forms in a mathematical sense selection is thereby both acting on and shaping the largest eigenvalue of an immense mutation transition matrix that represents the mean replication rate of the quasi-species after nowak 1992the influence of group selection on quasi-species evolution has been examined experimentally by de la torre and holland 1990 in their study small numbers of highly fit vsv mutants were introduced into large quasi-species populations of lower relative fitness it was found that these mutants only rose to dominance when they were planted above threshold quantities otherwise they were displaced by the original population such evolutionary dynamics may appear to contradict the classic neo-darwinian doctrines regarding competition and survival however it is a reality of viral existence that the reproductive success of the individual oftentimes is determined by the characteristics of the population in which it existsthe previous discussion focused on adaptive strategies used by individual viruses or strains as the case may be to compete with other such units within a particular host it should be evident that many such traits may both singly and in combination exclusively improve the fitness of the viruses in possession of those traits viral phenotypes that affect individual host cells or cell products on an intracellular level usually contribute to the fitness of the bearer these possibilities for fitness enhancement include most strategies of individual replication improvement such as receptor specificity use of transcription factors and enhancers such possibilities also include many techniques of localized host antiviral response impairment such as disruption of antigen processing or presentation intracellular ifn signaling and diminished antiviral recognitionthere are however other types of individual viral characteristics that appear to confer survival advantage to the viral population as a whole typically by having more widespread effects on the host organism as an example many viral gene products that interfere with host antiviral response stimulation act as decoys for immune product binding or sequester such products these tend to have extracellular site-of-action effectsas elegantly demonstrated by bonhoeffer and nowak 1994 the consequence of these intracellularextracellular trait relationships is maintenance of such populational phenotypes when they are associated with increased transmission probabilities and thus long-term evolutionary success but this maintenance can only exist under conditions in which mutation rates are below a threshold that is determined to a large extent by relative transmission advantages ie interhost selection of the new mutant versus its ancestral population the authors show that at the intrahost level mutants defective for the unselfish character are selectively neutral and thus will drift to fixation at a rate approximately equal to the rate of production of such mutants these authors point out that such strategies are more likely to arise under unusual stochastic circumstances such as those of transmission founder effects or intrahost genetic drift yet to persist in viral types with low mutation rates such as dna viruses
when considering competition between viruses within an infected host it is crucial not to forget that the one and only sought-after evolutionary reward is transmission to a new susceptible host in addition host replication rates generation times are usually much longer than those for the individual viruses infecting them because of this infecting viruses are capable of rapid comparative rates of adaptation and evolution transmission probability is commonly assumed to be positively although by no means linearly correlated with within-host virus concentration as well as infected host life-span which will be discussed below as such with respect to intrahost viral competition it has been demonstrated that individual viral fitness is a composite of both reproductive rate and ability to withstand or evade host antiviral defenses accordingly viruses increase their fitness by increasing the ratio between reproductive rate and antiviral avoidance ie ra from eq 2 relative to other viruses against which they compete bonhoeffer and nowak 1994although rarely if ever discussed transmission probability also involves a substantial spatiotemporal component in other words for a functional virus to be transmitted to a new host ie from the old host it must be present in the right place at the right time clearly there is a strong stochastic element at work here however differential selection of specific tissue types and alterations in timing of progeny release may have significant ramifications in terms of the fitness of viral strains it is in this way that viruses may enhance their evolutionary success without specifically changing their population sizes or growth rates and thereby not causing excess host damagelong-distance intrahost movement in plant viruses is an essential component of reproduction for example viruses often need to be shed on multiple plant surfaces that may be spatially diffuse in order to facilitate vector-mediated transmission intrahost transport is perhaps most extreme in systemic plant viruses since distances can be very large eg as in coniferous trees and this subject has been investigated for reviews see carrington et al 1996 deom et al 1992 maule 1991 mushegian and koonin 1993 long-distance movement in plant viruses usually takes place in the sieve elements and cells of the phloem plant viruses are known to utilize movement proteins mps that facilitate both cell-to-cell and long-distance transport mps have been identified in many plant viruses but the biochemical and molecular mechanisms involved unfortunately are largely unknown mps are frequently capsid proteins as has been demonstrated in tobacco mosaic virus dawson et al 1988 saito et al 1990 red clover necrotic mosaic dianthovirus xiong et al 1993 vaewhongs and lommel 1995 cucumber mosaic virus cmv taliansky and garcia-arenal 1995 and tobacco etch potyvirus dolja et al 1994 1995 among others replication proteins such as those involved in genome duplication have also been identified as necessary for long-distance movement in brome mosaic virus traynor et al 1991 and cmv gal-on et al 1994much less research has focused on intrahost replication of virus that is temporally determined it is conceivable that a virus type might maximize its intrahost replication only within a very specific time-frame in order to maximize the probability of transmission for example this may be pertinent with respect to solitary animal species that congregate only at very specific times of the year for breeding under such circumstances natural selection might favor a reproductive strategy in which a resident virus population exists at low persistent concentrations during most of the year but turns on high-level replication in order to be shed during a time of year when transmission probability is consistently and predictably highest there are numerous avian and mammalian hormones for instance whose release is dependent on photoperiod that could realistically activate or suppress viral replicationfurthermore high replication might even be coordinated with the onset of virus-induced disease symptoms in infected individuals that might be associated with or promote hosthost contact and thus viral transmission these examples are of course merely conjectural but may warrant further investigation since such temporal coordination of replication is not only biologically realistic but also evolutionarily intriguingof relevance here is polyomavirus infection in mice mccance and mims 1979 report that virus that infects female mice at birth is only detectable at high levels late in gestation when it is transmitted to newborns and persists at low levels otherwise in addition virus replication was also activated in nonpregnant females injected with sex hormones related to pregnancy implicating them as the stimulators of viral reproduction this appears to be a viral replication strategy that is timed to coincide with a high-probability transmission windowin summary the host cellular tissue and organismal environments are vitally important selective realms that contribute profoundly to the adaptation and diversity of viruses intrahost selective pressure may be compared with that within a species ecosystem in an overall sense resources require optimal not maximal consumption on an individual level negative interspecific interactions predation should be minimized and reproductive rates high just as with cellular species viral traits that may arise or be selected for in one particular environmental scenario time and place do not guarantee indefinite evolutionary stability selective pressure within a particular host may similarly be contradictory to selective pressure imposed by requirements of interhost long-term survival for instance as with cellular species where ecological continuance will not occur under conditions of resource overexploitation virus populations will not persist evolutionarily when host resources are consumed beyond the point of sustainability the effect is a balance between adaptations that allows sufficient harvest of host tissue without jeopardizing prospective abundance of the host as a source of reproductive substrateinterhost fitness is measured by the relative ability of viruses within a single host to successfully occupy new hosts examination and comprehension of this is best accomplished mathematically using simplified models of population change it is first useful to partition the total host population into the number of individuals who are susceptible to viral infection x those who are infected and infectious y and those recovered from infection that are permanently immune to subsequent infection z we can show how these respective subpopulations change using simple differential equations after anderson and may 1991 garnett and antia 1994 bulmer 1994 that resemble eqs 2 and 34dxdt  n-xyx
5dydt  xy- y
6dzdt  y-zzwhere n is the total host population size ie x  y  z  is the coefficient of virus transmission ie probability of new host occupation upon contact between a susceptible and infectious host  is the per-capita virus-independent host birth and mortality rate this is partitioned into susceptible host birthmortality rate x infected host birthmortality rate y and recovered host birthmortality rate z so that   x   z  is the rate of host recovery from infection ie 1average duration of infection and parameter  is the per-capita virus-induced mortality rate virulence here we are assuming population equilibrium and therefore equality between birth and mortality rates the overall dynamic can be visualized in figure 3
individual interhost fitness for viruses can be measured as intrinsic fitness using fishers net reproductive rate r
0 which has been adapted by anderson and may 1982 for microparasites as
7r0  xy    
if r
0  1 a virus cannot persist in a totally susceptible host population alternatively if r
0  1 all such host individuals will eventually become infected likewise these relationships give rise to a threshold susceptible host population size required for survival of a virus given the specific nature of its virulence transmission and immune clearance characteristics as
8x      
an infecting virus population with r
0  1 will thus grow in size while eq 8 holds true and if the susceptible host population falls below this threshold the viral population size will decreaseinterhost r
0 instantaneously measures the absolute fitness of an infecting viral population that is regardless of variation in generation time length however by itself r
0 is not valuable as an estimate of relative fitness as it provides no information about a strains reproductive output in comparison to that of strains infecting other members of the host population therefore it is helpful to use a term that defines the instantaneous reproductive rate of a virus population within a host population in other words the instantaneous rate of spread of a viral infection through a host population represented by eq 5 for an infecting virus strain we now can examine its relative fitness using one value by finding the difference between r
0 and dydt since they are both measured instantaneously as with  described abovealthough a highly simplified model that admittedly lacks certain biological realities 4 5 6 effectively demonstrate common interhost selective pressures and represent a good starting point for discussing interhost viral evolutionary ecology merely for convenience we describe here a continuous-time model it is however certainly possible and perhaps desirable to employ discrete-time models based on virus host andor vector generation times days seasons or other temporal intervals relevant to the specific ecology of the infection cyclealthough perhaps not necessary for illustrative purposes it would also be possible to increase this models accuracy and its subsequent complexity by the incorporation of additional variables representing host and viral population growth and other factors for instance a rate parameter for individual loss of immunity may be included ie  as in fig 3 that serves to change the dynamic by enlarging the presence of susceptible individuals and consequent transmission opportunities also intraspecific competition density dependence may be included in growth of both virus and host populations that is to say host population sizes are regulated by extrinsic variables that are independent of viral infections yet dependent on the relative presence of other conspecific individuals therefore population growth will in theory slow asymptotically as population size reaches the species carrying capacity other factors relevant to the dynamics of viral infection include population structure and spatiotemporal distribution of the potential hosts environmental heterogeneity and genetic makeup of the host population for relevant and insightful reviews see anderson 1991 and frank 1996 1997
equation 7 with the help of figure 3 outlines the prime adaptive pathways available for viral interhost fitness enhancement that is favorable adaptations can be ones that increase host-host transmission  decrease virulence  or decrease host recovery  it also illustrates a complicated interrelationship of fitness characters fitness can be improved via effects on a number of attributes and the magnitude of the improvement is directly related to the status of other selective conditions and adaptations as well as ecological conditions the effects of such adaptive changes also depend critically on the type and degree of interdependence of these factorsthe relationship between viral virulence and transmission is one that has been investigated extensively at first glance it might seem unusual that all viruses are not avirulent since relative fitness appears to increase as  approaches zero it may also seem intuitive that harm to the host should obviously be minimized since viruses are obligate parasites requiring living tissue for propagation however the reality of virushost biology is that transmission is generally positively and host recovery negatively related to virus density and as virus density increases so too does pathogenicitymortalitypathogenic effects have numerous etiologies most of which ostensibly fall under the dominion of intrahost characters cytolytic effects viral protein toxicity tissue tropism immune responses etc but these may have numerous implications for interhost fitness as well in almost all models of parasite ecology it is assumed that while transmission coefficients increase as intrahost parasite virus density increases this relationship is rarely linear however host mortality or morbidity will occur near some threshold virus density at which point the de facto transmission of intrahost viruses is zero the effect is a balancing of pathogenic effects and overall transmission that is closely related to conditions in the host populationfor many years an accepted presumption was that high virulence indicated the evolutionary youth of a parasite-host relationship because it was assumed that not enough time had elapsed for such parasites to acquire abilities of benign host occupation an abundance of theoretical and to a lesser degree empirical work has since shown how virulence can be selected for in virus populations a particularly important model of virulence is related to host population size and the corresponding prospects for viral transmissionit has been observed that highly virulent 99 fatality myxomavirus evolved to stable lower albeit still very high levels of virulence 5070 fatality following introduction into a completely susceptible rabbit population in australia fenner and ratcliffe 1965 anderson and may 1982 extensive virus-induced diminishment of the host population resulted in evolutionarily stable emergence of a less virulent myxomavirus strain see fig 4
 in this instance myxomavirus strains of high virulence killed their hosts too soon after inoculation and as a result were transmitted to new hosts infrequently since transmission occurs via a mosquito vector that only feeds on live rabbits strains of very low virulence also exhibit an interhost fitness disadvantage because they are usually cleared by host antiviral defenses before their populations reached sizes necessary for mounting of effective transmission stages b in fig 1 from this example the influence of host population structure can be seen that is levels of virulence are often determined by and proportional to the frequency with which interhost transmission opportunities arise so that low virulence can typically be selected for when host-host contact is infrequent and vice versa bull 1994 myxomavirus virulence is discussed in more detail belowlevels of viral virulence are also often associated with transmission pathway fine 1975 herre 1993 lipsitch et al 1996 it is well accepted that exclusive vertical transmission from parents to progeny through the germ cell line of viruses will strongly select against parasite-induced host injury this is intuitive since a reduction in host fertility of any kind will mean a reduction in virus fertility this can be seen in many plant viruses that replicate to very high levels with little pathogenic effects cooper 1995 in addition this opens the door for mutualistic relationships between virus and hostexceptions to this rule have been hypothesized to exist in cases where strictly endogenous viruses evs confer on the host resistance to similar more pathogenic exogenous viruses or those in which sex ratio distortion is used to counter the negative effects on host fitness hurst 1993 weiss 1993 lipsitch et al 1996 lwer et al 1996 more frequently disputed however is the existence in viruses and other parasites that rely on both horizontal and vertical transmission of a virulence continuum that is established by relative dependence on both types of transmission ewald 1987 1994a evidence does exist in support of such a continuum in nematode parasites of fig wasps herre 1993 and mosquito microsporidian parasites ewald and schubert 1989 but this has never been demonstrated in viruses despite the existence of numerous viral groups that rely on both modes of transmission eg roseplant citrus hiv htlv furthermore lipsitch et al 1996 have constructed mathematical models that demonstrate how increased opportunities for horizontal transmission can actually select for decreased virulence at virushost equilibrium by increasing viral prevalence and shifting a greater fraction of actual transmission events to the vertical routethe preceding discussion of virulence neglects to mention virulence as an adaptation that has actually arisen or persisted due to specific selective pressure for example it has been hypothesized that virulence represents a way to increase vector-mediated transmission by disabling a normally mobile host thereby allowing easier vector feeding access ewald 1983 1994aarboviruses such as dengue virus togaviridae and yellow fever virus flaviviridae rely on mosquito vectors for transmission and cause fever muscular aches andor encephalitis which typically result in host inactivity the hosts virally induced sedentary state may facilitate mosquito vector feeding and therefore interhost transmission in this case viral virulence may actually enlarge the transmission coefficient  and as such increase viral fitness so far however large-scale empirical investigation of such adaptive virulence has not been undertaken
additionally it is likely that many specific symptoms of viral infection that have negative effects on host fitness but which increase transmission are viral adaptations maintained by natural selection for instance such symptoms as coughing and sneezing caused by viruses infecting respiratory regions adenoviridae rhinoviruses coronaviridae paramyxoviridae orthomyxoviridae diarrhea caused by enteric viruses rotaviruses caliciviridae astroviruses and lesions caused by many sexually transmitted viruses as well as some poxviruses all have clear adaptive significance when considering interhost transmission routes since they shed infectious particles into a suitable spatial and often temporal configuration for new host invasionin many cases virulence may be the result of viral reproduction within atypical hosts or host tissue in such cases the virus is not utilizing cell types to which its replication characters have naturally adapted usually the result is an evolutionary dead-end because nonproductive infection premature host death or improper viral shedding all preclude sufficient interhost transmission and persistencemany human hemorrhagic fever viruses  including some hantaviruses machupo virus sin nombr virus and ebola virus to name just a few  are thought to use nonhuman mammalian or vertebrate hosts for their natural maintenance often as avirulent vertically transmitted occupants childs and peters 1993 peters and leduc 1995 peters 1997 when these viruses occasionally infect humans and presumably other mammal species the evolutionary response in the virus if any must be minuscule since viral progeny produced in these nonnatural hosts are rarely transmitted effectively within the new host populationit is interesting and also important to note that the myxoma viral strains introduced into australia were actually of south american origin and that the rabbit pests oryctolagus cuniculus on which they were used were of european origin the virus actually exhibits very low almost silent pathogenicity in its natural hosts new world sylvilagus species regnery and miller 1972 yet as mentioned it was extremely lethal to the virgin rabbit populations in australia this is an excellent example of increased viral pathogenicity in relation to reproduction in taxa to which a virus has not evolvedsimilarly during a normal host infection cycle many viruses may be exposed to other tissue types that support replication or at least viral entry such encounters might result in irregular reduced or no viral progeny production and as such could have catastrophic overall fitness effects for the virus this is often the case for a number of viruses  such as poliovirus hiv and reoviruses  which can upon proper exposure infect cells of the central nervous system and exhibit a high degree of virulence yet acquire no epidemiological persistence
it must be stated that incidences of rogue replication such as these are important evolutionary mechanisms that rarely but significantly may lead to the genesis of new stable virushost relationships and will be discussed in detail below in a general sense however this type of virulence may only be relevant to the host population whose existence may be affected by losses from perhaps frequent zoonotic encounters see morse 1997 the viral strains that replicate under these circumstances are almost always doomed yet this circumstance may occasionally but essentially lead to a successful host taxon jump or even adaptive radiationmev represents an infectious agent that is very transmissible horizontally exists stably in human populations of suitable size often causes a decrease in host fitness and is usually fully cleared from the host with lifelong immunity mev is very effective at occupation of new hosts because it is transmitted as an aerosol and thus does not require direct hosthost contact is not inactivated upon drying and merely requires susceptible host inhalation for establishment of a new infection because of this mev has a very high transmission rate  in fully susceptible populations which subsequently results in potentially explosive reproduction r
0 this is exemplified by the 1951 mev outbreak in southwest greenland christensen et al 1953 in this instance the extraordinary transmissibility of mev is demonstrated in the fact that one infected host gave rise to 250 new infections ie r
0  250 following exposure to many individuals during a large social congregation in the end 985 of the local population of 4320 people were infectedmev-induced mortality used here as a measure of host fitness decrease during virgin host epidemics ie epidemics in host populations that lack previous exposure to the virus can be as high as 05 per infected individual black et al 1971 cliff and haggett 1985 this is thought to be positively related to size of inoculum aaby 1988 a breakdown in nursing care during epidemics neel et al 1970 malnutrition aaby 1988 scrimshaw et at 1966 chen et al 1980 and early or late age at infection carrada bravo and velazquez diaz 1980 aaby 1988 panum 1940in modern-day immunologically experienced populations mev mortality per infected individual rarely exceeds 10 and it is typically far below 1 in developed nations babbitt et al 1963 black 1991 however infants are at an elevated risk for mev-induced mortality which significantly affects host population growth since these individuals will obviously not reproduce before death therefore mev clearly has a negative effect on host fitness which subsequently decreases future transmission opportunities in addition mev results in lifelong immunity that additionally decreases transmission potentialthe interaction among mevs transmission dynamics virulence and immune response causes the virus to be maintained with widely fluctuating boom and bust population sizes through time at the heart of this dynamic is the influence of herd immunity host population sizes host population structure dispersal mechanisms and seasonality as well as many other extrinsic variables on mev population change it is estimated that host population sizes of less than 250000 are incapable of permanently sustaining mev transmission and existence bartlett 1957 mevs potentially high virulence and generation of lifelong immunity both work to decrease its transmission potential and evolutionary fitness yet this is counterbalanced by its extreme infectivity which ensures that under the proper conditions mev will thrive for reviews on measles epidemiology see garenne 1994 and black 1991htlv-1 is a persistent virus that infects cd4 lymphocytes and is capable of transforming infected cells after approximately 1040 years of host occupation thereby giving rise to adult t-cell leukemialymphoma atl another htlv-1 disease known as tropical spastic paraparesis tsp also called htlv-1-associated myelopathy results from progressive demyelination of long motor neurons causing paralysis and is seen mainly in 20- to 50-year-old female hosts htlv-1 infection may also induce immunosuppression resulting in an increase in opportunistic infections nakada et al 1984newton et al 1992 odoherty et al 1984 most htlv-1 infections are asymptomatic but approximately 14 of infected hosts will develop disease symptoms white and fenner 1994the human immune system cannot clear htlv-1 from the body so that the duration of infectiousness is lifelong the number of unsusceptible hosts in a population is therefore always effectively zero htlv-1 differs from viruses such as mev in that occupation of a host is long term and interhost transmission is both inefficient and infrequent htlv is transmitted between hosts almost exclusively via infected cd4 lymphocytes yamamoto et al 1984 yamade et al 1993 seto et al 1991 ruscetti et al 1983 de rossi et al 1985 replication is very slow and this is most likely due to tight gene regulation by viral proteins hosthost transmission takes place through sexual intercourse nakano et al 1984 tajima et al 1982 via blood transfusion okochi et al 1984 sato and okochi 1986 and from mother to fetus or infant by passage of infected lymphocytes through the placenta or in breast milk kinoshita et al 1984 komuro et al 1983 tajima et al 1982 yamanouchi et al 1985 nakano et al 1984rates of seroconversion following infected-male-to-female sexual transmission have been estimated at 608 and for infected-female-to-male at 04 murphy et al 1989 seroconversion following contaminated blood transfusion a relatively infrequently used pathway has been reported at 3060 manns and blattner 1991 although the primary route of htlv transmission appears to be from mother to offspring this method does not appear to be highly efficient for instance hirata and colleagues 1992 investigated the offspring of htlv-1-infected mothers and found that 16 were infected at birth they also observed among breast-fed infants that 27 of those breast-fed for more than 3 months and 5 of those breast-fed for less than 3 months were infected and 13 of bottle-fed infants were positive for htlv-1htlv-1 is a slowly replicating virus that is maintained exclusively in human populations the lack of an effective host antiviral response as well as the viruss low replication rate ie resource consumption allows an intrahost population to successfully persist for many years a very low probability per unit time of interhost transmission as well as a low probability of host damage death accompanies this persistence thus htlv-1 is an example of a parasite that employs an alternative life history to that of a more opportunistic replicator like mev htlv-1 manages to keep r
0  1 by exhibiting a very low transmission probability while remaining relatively unobtrusive within its host for a very long time this long period of infectiousness will probably but not necessarily result in transmission to a new hosts there is thus heterogeneity in an htlv-1 populations overall transmission but not so much that it is lost from a host population because this variance is counteracted by htlv-1s host availability susceptibility and its protracted sit and quietly wait intrahost replication tacticspdvs have segmented genomes containing up to 28 covalently closed dsdna circlets fleming and krell 1993 krell et al 1982 blissard et al 1986ab stoltz 1993 stoltz et al 1984 they are found only in endoparasitic wasp species of the families brachonidae and ichneumonidae pdv genomes are integrated throughout the chromosomes of both male and female wasps fleming and krell 1993 and are only transmitted vertically in mendelian fashion fleming and krell 1993 stoltz 1990 the viruses replicate exclusively within cells of the females ovarian calyx during a specific stage in development and are subsequently released into the oviduct fleming and summers 1986 1991 fleming and krell 1993 webb and summers 1992 during oviposition within a susceptible larval lepidopteran host the eggs are coated with viral particles and thus transferred into the host body cavity vinson 1977a norton and vinson 1977 vinson and scott 1974 1975 once inside the lepidopteran pdv genes are expressed in various tissues fleming and krell 1993 blissard et al 1986ab 1989 strand et al 1992 theilman and summers 1986 1988 harwood and beckage 1994 harwood et al 1994 but no further viral replication takes place stoltz 1990 blissard et al 1989 strand et al 1992the pdv-derived proteins assist development of wasp larvae by impairing lepidopteran immune attack against the wasp eggs thus serving a protective function in addition viral products actually alter the developmental rate of the lepidopteran host so as to allow for optimal tissue consumption by the young wasps it has been shown that pdvs alone or in combination with wasp venom provide these functions that are actually essential to reproduction of their parasitoid hosts asgari et al 1997 shelby and webb 1997 vinson 1977b davies et al 1987 davies and vinson 1988 vinson and stoltz 1986 edson et al 1980 vinson et al 1979 guzo and stoltz 1985 kitano 1982 1986 stoltz et al 1988 tanaka 1987 tanaka and vinson 1991 pdv replication within the wasp is highly localized both in space and time and essentially causes no significant adverse organismal effects fleming and summers 1986 norton and vinson 1983 theilmann and summers 1986 not surprisingly there is no antiviral response from the waspthe pdv life history incorporates a reproductive strategy that differs dramatically from viruses like mev and htlv-1 since wasp host fitness is actually enhanced by pdv survival and reproduction this might be equivalent to assigning a negative value to  in eqs 5 7 and 8 pdv evolutionary persistence is thus maintained by small but predictable transmission rates between hosts under some life-historicalecological circumstances this strategy might not be viable but since infection is lifelong there is no virus-induced host fitness loss but rather gain and these conditions lack great variance and the virushost relationship is stableit is clear that viruses need not exhibit pathogenicity to exist it is unfortunate however that our knowledge about viral taxa appears to increase with the pathogenicity of those taxa nevertheless what is of great interest to the evolutionary ecologist is reconstruction of the virulence history of virus lineages to determine what conditions either have led or may lead to an increase or decrease in the negative effects on host fitness caused by viral infectionfor example was occupation of ancestral wasp species by some pdv predecessors actually pathogenic and along those lines perhaps modern pdvs descended from a once benign commensal parasite that gained a replicative advantage over its competitors by assisting with reproduction of its host one may also speculate that mev ancestors were at one time harmless human occupants and that some change in their replication that resulted in host damage conferred upon the virus a reproductive advantage this fitness advantage may have resulted in cladogenesis which gave rise to the mev we see todaylikewise there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that hiv-1 has existed in the human population for many years prior to the aids epidemic of the late twentieth century williams et al 1960 1983 corbit et al 1990 zhu et al 1998 it has been suggested that its previously silent residence was altered in response to changes in human social conditions eg population density urbanization transportation sexual promiscuity and intravenous drug use which allowed for greater transmission opportunities and thus permitted even promoted changes in virulence ewald 1994ab lipsitch and nowak 1995 levin and bull 1994 zhu et al 1998 such a change in life cycle may have resulted in a modern adaptive radiation that is today manifest as the hivaids epidemicpiecing together the viral evolutionary past to resolve such patterns might often be a formidable task to say the least yet the existence and presumed stability of multiple levels of virulence in extant virushost relationships as well as the observable short-term changes in such levels are strong evidence that variation in pathogenicity is a common evolutionary maneuvermany viruses of terrestrial organisms whose transmission routes rely on direct exposure to the environment are surprisingly sensitive to degradation from ultraviolet radiation desiccation and temperature cooper 1995 there are however some viruses that rely on contact spread that actually remain infectious through long periods of environmental exposure canine parvovirus is shed in feces and is extremely stable in the external environment including prolonged exposure at 60c and ph 39 which may actually contribute to its propensity for host-range shifts parrish 1993 in fact canine parvovirus was disseminated worldwide less than 2 years after its emergence also smallpox is known to remain infectious within dried skin crusts for many years tyler and fields 1990many insect viruses utilize multiparticle occlusion within proteinaceous crystalline structures to enhance environmental stability blissard and rohrmann 1990 adams and mcclintock 1991 these include the nuclear polyhidrosis viruses npvs and granulosis viruses gvs both of which are mostly lepidopteran-associated baculoviruses and also cytoplasmic polyhidrosis viruses cpvs and entomopox viruses both of which infect a broader range of host taxa each such occlusion body is derived from either a nuclear or cytoplasmic locale and may include only a few or as many as tens of thousands of viral particles each cooper 1995 occluded viruses may remain infectious in the external environment for long periods of time and under extremely harsh conditions this is most likely related to their reliance upon environmental exposure on plant surfaces and in soil prior to their subsequently being ingested by a potential host insect occluded npv particles have been observed to remain infectious after 21 years of laboratory storage and following exposure to ph 29 cooper 1995viruses may also improve their interhost fitness without host damage by influencing their spatial presence this may involve dissemination over large areas or shedding into very small but appropriate locales for new host occupation the employment of vectors to effectively transmit small quantities of virus represents a very specific mode of interhost transmission while the use of vehicles such as wind broadcasting of many aerosol-transmitted viruses illustrates a more general or even random approachrespiratory viruses of vertebrates are acquired by inhalation and thus transmitted through the air such viruses that have adapted to transmission during circumstances of close host proximity are usually inactivated fairly easily when desiccated or exposed to light and ionizing radiation chessin 1972 killick 1990 cooper 1995 however they may remain infectious for long periods under the proper conditions high humidity little direct sunlight cool temperatures and likewise be transported over great distances infectious foot-and-mouth-disease virus fmdv has been known to be distributed via air currents over 150 km across the english channel donaldson et al 1982 it is perhaps even conceivable that sensitivity to ionizing solar radiation may contribute to the seasonality of many human respiratory viral infections
in addition to the use of weather conditions for improving their spatial presence many viruses are also shed within body fluids or fecal material which may aid their existence in the appropriate habitat for transmission for instance most human enteroviruses are ingested through the oropharynx and shed within feces to the external environment sexually transmitted viruses both enter and exit the host via the urogenital tract and are contained within bodily fluids that are associated with or even employ these portalsan important aspect of vector-mediated transmission for the virus is its alleviation on host density dependence that is to say the reproductive fitness of a virus that relies on some mobile vector is influenced not only by the number of available hosts but also the number of vectors such that r
0 now becomes
9r0  2nnfvfhvhwhere  represents overall vector population density fv and fh represent proportions of infected vectors and hosts that survive into a stage of infectiousness respectively 1v and 1h represent the duration of vector and host infectiousness respectively ie the inverse of recovery rates probability of transmission  is squared because it is applied to both transmission from an infected host to a vector and from that vector to a new host the equivalence of these values is unrealistic but satisfactory for our purposesfrom eq 9 it can be seen how vector-mediated transmission can actually be partially independent of host density ross 1911 bailey 1975 anderson 1982 this is especially true of mobile vectors in which viruses are transmitted as an incidental effect of feeding under such circumstances survival of the vector depends on host visitation feeding at a relatively fixed rate regardless of how many hosts are present vectors will therefore engage in a constant number of host contacts that is largely independent of host densitythe above depiction gives rise to a vectorhost density threshold required for stability of this type of system that is dependent on the overall magnitude of transmission as
10nn  12 vhfvfhafter begon et al 1990 because of this such a system of transmission may be used to a viruss advantage only under certain environmental conditions for instance when host populations are small or very dispersed direct host-to-host contact may either be too infrequent or the probability of identical habitat usage by hosts may be too small to support necessary levels of direct host-virus contact transmission a vector in these situations would be valuable since it often will possess search abilities and ensure proper virus dispersal regardless of host spatial distributionan additional situation where vector-mediated transmission may arise and persist is when vectors are abundant or make frequent host-to-host contact in such cases although the hosts may have either direct frequent contact common space utilization or both certain viruses may increase their transmission efficiency by employing the exclusive or partial use of vectors for additional host occupation and access to portals of entrysuch may be the case in many well-studied tropical arboviruses such as the dengue viruses and yellow fever virus yfv these viruses are transmitted via the mosquito aedes aegypti in both urban and sylvan areas of africa and south america where the vector flourishes because of climate warm temperatures large amounts of standing water etc the co-occurrence of the existent host population structures and environmental conditions may alone be conducive to direct transmission of viruses in general but the large presence of the mosquito must contribute substantially to its utilization in virus transmission not surprisingly yfv transmission is known to increase with increased fecundity longevity and density of ae aegypti monath 1989 in fact indices exist that use mosquito presence and activity to measure risk of yellow fever epidemic service 1974 bang et al 1979 1981 monath 1989specific cases are known of human-induced environmental changes that have fostered mosquito population growth which afterward resulted in increased viral disease prevalence eg adames et al 1979 in addition numerous examples exist of viral epidemics following unusual weather events that are attributed to changes in vector populations such as the culex pipiens-facilitated st louis encephalitis outbreak of 1933 holland 1996 proposed that dengue a humanmosquitohuman-transmitted virus outbreaks in recent human history are likely driven by changes in human population size and mobility and inadequate vector control unfortunately detailed studies examining the precise relationship between absolute transmission rates and vector populations are limited but there is growing concern regarding the impact of global climate change on insect populations and resultant increases in viral infections see lovejoy 1993 mcmichael and beers 1994 jetten and focks 1997 it is conceivable even likely that future increased opportunities for vector-mediated transmission may bring about evolutionary adaptations that result in vector usage by viruses that previously did not rely on this inoculation routea very important system of vector-mediated virus transmission occurs in sessile organisms of which plants are particularly well researched in this case viruses cannot rely on host mobility to assist in spatial dissemination and direct contact between plants is often but not always too infrequent to support sustained hosthost transmission thus many plant viruses rely on vertical transmission intrahost persistence large intrahost populations environmental stability vector-mediated transmission or some combination thereof to sustain their existence within plant populationsplant virus transmission via aphids order homoptera family aphididae is especially noteworthy according to one investigation of 288 aphid species examined 227 were found to transmit plant viruses eastop 1983 in fact the green pea aphid myzus persicae is known to solely transmit over 34 different potyviruses kennedy et al 1962 most aphid-borne viruses are carried by mechanical noncirculative modes meaning they are retained externally on the vectors feeding apparatuses or body surfaces and as such are acquired and lost with great ease especially during molting for this type of mechanical vectoring vector-mediated viral transmission is usually complete within a very short time seconds or minutes depending on environmental conditions therefore viruses transported by this mechanism will exist in populations where great distances do not separate individual hosts such that viral transport times through adverse environmental conditions are minimalarthropod vectors may remain infectious for longer periods when the virus is retained inside the insect whether circulating in the hemolymph in which case the arthropod serves as a mechanical vector or actually replicating within cells of the vector in which case the arthropod serves as a propagative vector such internal carriage techniques result in longer periods of vector and hence virus infectiousness thereby increasing  in eqs 9 and 10 and are more common in the arboviruses of animals than in the vector-transmitted viruses of plants this includes the upper extreme of vector infectivity transovarial transmission in which vertical and even venereal infection of progeny and other conspecific arthropods results in their ability to transmit the virus it is very likely that this association has arisen as an adaptation for viruses to overwinter in temperate regions reeves 1974 mclintock 1978 rosen 1987viruses that employ complex transmission procedures such as transovarial transmission are exposed to yet another dimension of natural selection intravector selection selection is certainly taking place between viral units for uptake into survival within as well as transmission from feeding vectors there is perhaps no finer demonstration of viral interhost adaptive efficiency than the adeno-associated viruses genus dependovirus and the satellite viruses of plants that actually rely on replication of another virus for facilitation of their own replicationanother potential virulence-free way to improve viral fitness via hosthost transmission is to increase  by maximizing the infectivity of individual viral progeny an increase in the capability of virus progeny to occupy susceptible cells upon contact would result in a high probability of infection per contact this will subsequently decrease the number of descendent virions needed and therefore decrease virus-induced host mortality  in cases where virulence and virus replication are linked some viruses like reovirus and adenovirus can have particle-to-plaque-forming-unit ratios approaching 1 meaning that nearly all viral progeny are able to originate a new infection given the proper host cell exposure however the paucity of data on this topic prevents more exhaustive historical discussion about virion infectivity as an evolutionary adaptationthe venue of interhost competition is illustrated in figure 5
 this demonstrates the main evolutionary challenge for virus populations within an infected host as follows the overall virus objective is occupation of a new susceptible host that will give rise to further such occupation the obstacle is transport both accurate and abundant sometimes through abiotic or non-host media the solution is adaptative mechanisms that 1 do not significantly diminish intrahost fitness and 2 do not result in parasitism so potent that host resources are devastated the adaptations that arise will have effects on the evolution of hosts vectors and other parasites which will in turn feedback to influence the viruss selective environment direction of selection for interhost viral adaptation is governed fundamentally by the ease with which viruses pass between hosts which in turn is determined by susceptible host density host behavior antiviral abilities host population structure environmental makeup spatiotemporal heterogeneity vector characteristics and virushost genetics as well as myriad other factorsfor any taxonomic unit individual population species etc the adaptive landscape may be viewed as composed of the relationship of fitness to the collection of possible phenotypes that influence reproduction this is discussed in greater depth below as illustrated in figure 6
 each individual character or phenotype can be viewed as having fitness effects that are typically greatest in one dimension only ie for one or a few replicative functions the net evolutionary effect however is a composite of a particular traits influence on fitness in an aggregate adaptive landscape that takes into account the combined relative survival and reproduction probabilities of the characters movement through these landscapes may be facilitated by the potential for high genetic drift of some viruses especially due to random sampling of genotypes during transmission domingo et al 1985 gebauer et al 1988 also high mutation rates of many rna viruses may likewise hasten ascension of adaptive peaks eigen and biebricher 1988 however landscapes are not static they are perpetually shifting through evolutionary time and this will promote movement to and subsequent movement up optimal peaks transformation of the topography is driven by abiotic environmental variation viral evolutionary change and by host evolution including responses to these changesthe evolutionary ecologist focuses on the variables that cause changes in the adaptive landscape the selective environment and the evolutionary outcome of existence in these landscapes while viruses presumably exist in every cellular organism individual virus types may only occupy a very narrow range of conditions rarely if ever addressed in the field of virology is hutchinsons 1957 concept of ecological niche since the same fundamental laws of evolutionary change apply across all forms of life the ecological niche is an essential component of any discussion about virus natural history indeed the seemingly unbounded viral diversity was and is patterned by the existence of manifold selective backgrounds in which viruses are able to survive and reproduceto begin with a working definition of ecological niche is required all organisms are capable of existence within a specific range of conditions both abiotic and biotic for example an organism can survive within a certain temperature range survival success usually follows a specific probability distribution eg normal with increasing temperature another environmental condition say ph may confer a different survival distribution therefore when considered concurrently an organisms area of potential survival with respect to these two variables may be represented as a distinct two-dimensional space the dimensions being temperature and ph the number of conditions is increased to generate a multidimensional n-dimensional space or hypervolume in which the organisms population is capable of continued existence this represents the fundamental niche the set of conditions under which an organism is capable of survival and reproduction in the absence of competition or predation if the dimensions are expanded to include not only abiotic but also interactive biotic factors the result is an organisms realized niche the subset of the fundamental niche that can be occupied in the presence of competition and predation
ecological niche should not be confused with habitat which refers to the actual location of or set of conditions that give rise to a niche ecological niche is therefore a species characteristic and habitat is a place population organism or tissue that can and usually does contain more than one niche for instance a vertebrate body contains numerous habitats tissue types etc that jointly or separately contain distinct niches sets of conditions that allow for replication of certain viruses furthermore as habitats are often composed of numerous niches it is the obligation of the organism ie the virus to by way of adaptive characters evolve strategies for utilization of those niches and in the process perhaps give rise to new taxa in this way viral and host diversification is guaranteed given the existence of nichesvirus types like all organisms display varying degrees of restriction with respect to the conditions under which they will reproduce obviously there is no virus that can successfully replicate in all cell types of all tissues of all host species complete identification of all the niche components of even a simple organism is nearly impossible but determination of a few of the primary ones is often sufficient to uniquely characterize a taxon accurate description of a generalized virus niche distinguishing the viruses as a unique taxonomic group separate from all other parasites and life-forms has not been attempted what can be proclaimed however is that all viruses require a functional intracellular host environment that includes 1 protein translation machinery 2 energy resources atp 3 amino acids and 4 nucleotides many viruses also require additional host cellular resources dna replication machinery rna splicing machinery transport mechanisms assembly mechanisms membrane structure membrane functions and other distinctive translational mechanisms using this as a starting point one can construct an exclusive portrait of specific viruses in terms of their replication optima relative to other organisms viruses may seem highly specialized with respect to the niches they occupy viruses frequently replicate in one cell type of one host species only but there exists great variation in degrees of viral specificity across families as will be demonstratedtwo very crucial attributes defining viral ecology and subsequently driving evolution are tissue tropism and host range or specificity the tissue tropism of a virus includes all the tissues that can naturally be infected by that virus regardless of the degree of pathogenicity or productivity host range includes all of the taxa in which a virus can replicate also regardless of pathogenicity or reproductive potential there are of course viral generalists who rely on more than one tissue type of more than one host organism and viral specialists that can only infect one or a few tissue types in one host species or subspecies the process of adaptive radiation discussed below may occur when a virus type happens to successfully exploit a new niche by way of expanded host range or novel tissue occupation and is therefore a primary source of viral diversity and even disease emergencethe proximate determinants of tissue tropism include ability of the virion to bind to enter and release its contents within cells ability of the viral genes to be translated and replicated ability of the viral macromolecules nucleic acids structural and nonstructural proteins to be transported and assembled and the ability of the virus to remain functional infectious in the extracellular environment virus tissue tropism is therefore strongly influenced by the types of cellular membrane receptors carbohydrates glycoproteins transport proteins etc intracellular functional proteins replicases transcription factors splicing and translation machinery organelle function host genetic makeup and components that cause viral replication dysfunction proteases nucleases modification enzymes or virus neutralization since host range is primarily determined by the permissivity of the cell types occurring therein viruses obviously can only occupy species that house tissue types for which the virus exhibits some degree of tropism other determinants of natural host range include antiviral capabilities as well as more inconstant host characteristics that may influence sustainable transmission such as population size spatiotemporal population structure habitat usage diet and behaviorviruses are known to temporarily infect host species and host tissues that fall outside of the normal reproductive maintenance cycles to which those viruses have evolved some viruses are in this way able to replicate in a variety of cell types for instance hantaviruses naturally persist in rodent populations where they are maintained as avirulent infections of the lung and kidneys lee et al 1981 under certain conditions humans who come into close contact with aerosolized hantaviruses can be infected and this is often manifest as a hemorrhagic fever with occasional kidney failure due to viral tropism for and damage to renal tissueebola viruses are an excellent illustration of the ability of a virus to replicate in both diverse species and tissue the natural history of ebola viruses is largely mysterious but the four known subtypes are thought to be maintained in african nonhuman primates or other mammal populations and can sporadically be transmitted to humans and many other species of primates mice and guinea pigs the extraordinary feature of ebola virus replication is its ability to use many host tissue types for instance ebola virus particles or antigens have been found in such diverse tissues as liver spleen lymph nodes lung gastrointestinal tract and even the sweat glands of the skin murphy et al 1990 peters 1997it cannot be said that viral groups capable of such aberrant replication are ecological generalists since this activity is rarely evolutionarily stable hantavirus and ebola virus transmission between humans is not epidemiologically sustainable however as is discussed below the ability of viruses to explore novel habitats in an evolutionary search of fertile or empty niche space is a major contributor to their diversificationthere are numerous examples of virus types that have evolved to replicate within new host species but in cell types that are part of homologous tissue for example using molecular phylogenetic techniques taber and pease 1990 demonstrated how the host species usage of paramyxoviruses evolves faster than does tissue tropism by mapping tissue tropisms and host species onto a phylogeny derived from the f glycoprotein dna sequence they were able to show how viruses that primarily infect respiratory tissues parainfluenza viruses sendai virus are evolutionarily clustered despite the fact that they occur in diverse vertebrate speciespapillomaviruses often cluster phylogenetically into monophyletic groups whose viral taxa exploit one tissue type eg genital versus epidermal epithelial yet encompass more than one host species chan et al 1995 1997 in addition no single papillomavirus type is known to infect more than one host species despite being evolutionarily related webster et al 1995 most influenza a virus strains  which naturally occur in horses humans whales mink seals pigs and a variety of birds  primarily infect either the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts of all these taxa many but not all polyomavirus types persistently infect the kidney epithelium of humans macaques baboons bovines and mice the alphaherpesviruses are found in many vertebrate species including primates canines bovines cervids catfish felines rodents and birds roizman 1993 these viruses will remain latent only in the sensory ganglia during most of these infectionsthis is not to say however that change in a viruss cellular tropism does not occur or is even infrequent to the contrary many viruses not only utilize more than one intrahost tissue type during the normal course of infection but the process of tissue tropism expansion is a commonly observed phenomenon in viruses for instance through in vivo and in vitro studies hiv has been found to replicate within practically any human tissue including most hematopoietic cells fibroblasts bowel retina cervix testes lung brain kidney gastrointestinal epithelium skin and heart armstrong and home 1984 cohen et al 1989 ho et al 1984 1985 levy et al 1985 nelson et al 1988 popovic and gartner 1987 tschachler et al 1987 levy 1993mev exhibits both obligate and nonessential multitissue utilization during its course of its infection mev replicates in tissues throughout the body including monocytes macrophages and t cells as well as in respiratory tissue and epithelial tissues of the oropharynx conjunctiva skin and the alimentary canal grist 1950 hall et al 1971 katz et al 1965 kempe and fulginiti 1965 frazer and martin 1978 it is also capable of replication in the bladder central nervous system spleen and local lymph nodes
bowen and colleagues 1997 constructed and compared arenavirus molecular phylogenies with those of their rodent hosts and detected multiple instances of virushost cospeciation in addition they determined that pathogenicity had arisen independently many times during arenavirus evolutionthere also exist generalist viruses that have evolved to rely on more than one tissue type of more than one host species the most obvious example is viruses that depend on propagative vector-mediated transmission such as arboviruses of vertebrates eg many alphaviruses flaviviruses bunyaviruses and some rhabdoviruses of plants such viruses must replicate within disparate tissue types of phylogenetically very distant organisms ie arthropods and vertebrates or arthropods and plants in order to achieve successful interhost transmissionfor instance within hematophagous mosquito vectors arboviruses such as the equine encephalitides chamberlain et al 1954 chamberlain and sudia 1955 yellow fever virus bates and roca-garcia 1946 semliki forest virus davies and yoshpe-purer 1954 vesicular stomatitis mussgay and suarez 1962 and the dengue viruses kuberski 1979 to name a few replicate within the mesenteronal epithelial cells of their mosquito vectors afterwards they are transferred via the hemolymph to the salivary glands for further replication hardy 1988 during hemocoel translocation mosquito-borne arboviruses may also replicate within alimentary tissue reproductive organs ganglia muscle pericardium and malpighian tubules hardy 1988 in addition to their tissue versatility many arboviruses are also capable of using more than one vector species for instance yfv has been shown to be transmitted via aedes aegypti beaty et al 1980 aitken et al 1979 aedes dorsalistaylori monath 1979 aedes mascarensis
beaty et al 1980 haemagogus equinis dutary and leduc 1981 and amblyomma variegatum saluzzo et al 1980the distant phylogenetic relationship between arthropods and vertebrates makes obligate replication in both taxa a fascinating evolutionary feat and yet even some plant viruses rely on replication within arthropod vectors these include rhabdoviruses such as lettuce necrotic yellows virus stubbs and grogan 1963 sowthistle yellow vein virus behncken 1973 and strawberry crinkle virus richardson et al 1972 which all use aphid vectorssome virus types appear to rely on more than one nonvector host species for normal maintenance an excellent and well-investigated example of this is influenza a which is naturally perpetuated through populations of many wild birds especially aquatic species wherein it is rarely pathogenic despite the fact that all the known subtypes are represented hinshaw et al 1980 alexander 1986 strains of influenza a especially h1n1 have been known to move between swine and humans webster et al 1992 hinshaw et al 1978 schnurrenburger et al 1970 and are all but conclusively determined as being derived from avian reservoirs webster et al 1992 1995 influenza a is also found in many other vertebrate species including horses and sea mammals and based on serological and phylogenetic analysis it is thought that interspecies transmission is frequent in these cases as well gorman et al 1991 webster et al 1992 1995 thus influenza a is capable of existence in more than one species and is quite frequently transmitted between species this characteristic is thought to be related to the mutability of its genome through reassortment and rapid mutation accumulation scholtissek et al 1977 1978 1993 scholtissek 1995 yamnikova et al 1993 reinacher et al 1983 domingo and holland 1994 and thus may not be as common in dna viruses or viruses with nonsegmented genomesevolution through acquisition of new phenotypes possibly representing key innovations has been observed in many viruses for example feline panleuk-openia virus fpv is incapable of sustained replication outside its normal host range canine parvovirus cpv is strongly suspected as being derived from fpv since it is genetically very similar and is capable of replication in both canines and felines cpv did not exist before the late 1970s and spread worldwide in less than two years parrish et al 1988 cpv and fpv differ in only three amino acids of their vp2 capsid proteins position 93 is asparagine in cpv and lysine in fpv position 103 is alanine in cpv and valine in fpv and position 323 is asparagine in cpv and aspartic acid in fpv parrish 1997 using site-directed mutagenesis parrish 1997 was able to demonstrate that cpv viruses that were otherwise normal but contained lysine at position 93 were able to replicate in feline cells but lost their ability to replicate in canine cells furthermore otherwise normal fpv that contained asparagine at positions 93 and 323 were able to replicate in both canine and feline cells it is highly probable that these latter two mutations represent a key ecological innovation that recently facilitated parvoviral occupation of a new host niche and therefore enabled rapid and extensive spread of parvovirus into the world population of caninesporcine respiratory coronavirus prcv emerged in 19831984 and became enzootic in almost all european countries within 2 years pensaert et al 1986 brown and cartwright 1986 jestin et al 1987 have 1990 rasschaert et al 1990 have determined that this virus differs from the more established porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev by only four genomic deletionsin a third example cell tropism in hiv has been found to be changed by few mutations in the v3 region of the gp120 envelope glycoprotein which can give rise to strains capable of replicating in macrophages hwang et al 1991 shioda et al 1991 1992 in addition during the normal course of hiv infection different tissue-tropic strains may arise that are distinguishable from their parental viruses not only by the tissue from which they are retrieved but also by their phenotypes and genotypes for instance hiv isolates collected from blood are very capable of syncytia formation and are also t-cell tropic those collected from bowel tissue are only slightly capable of syncytia formation and only slightly t-cell tropic however hiv collected from brain tissue seem incapable of syncytia formation and are not t-cell tropic barnett et al 1991 cheng-meyer et al 1989 these examples illustrate heritable viral variation in differential tissue tropism and host range arising in very short time periodsemerging properties such as multiple tissue tropisms large host ranges and propagative vector-mediated transmission provide illustrations of how the great adaptability of viruses enables them to withstand ecological pressures and to exploit opportunity from these examples it is clear that viruses will evolve to occupy new habitats hosts tissues etc by way of heritable characters that allow them to invade niches contained thereinadaptive radiation has been defined as the diversification into new ecological niches of taxa derived from a common ancestor futuyma 1986 it should be emphasized however that diversification especially for viruses and other parasites need not be driven by adaptive viral mechanisms and may merely be the result of host mechanisms such as diversification and phylogenetic tracking geographic isolation and asymmetrical cladogenesis care must therefore be used when interpreting viral evolutionary change as adaptive that is whether a viral group has diversified due to the acquisition of expanded reproductive abilities driven by ecological obstacles or openings presented to it or merely because of the probabilistic conditions of its existence it is necessary to authenticate the presence of synapomorphic adaptive characters that provide some specific selected function to conclusively demonstrate that viral adaptation is the source of a phylogenetic radiationthe red queens hypothesis van valen 1973 predicts that when two or more populations exist in direct competition for some resource the processes of adaptation and counter-adaptation must be continually occurring in order for both populations to survive the name is derived from lewis carrolls through the looking glass in which the red queen states now here you see it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place clarke and colleagues 1994 examined fitness changes in distinct competing clonal populations of vesicular stomatitis virus vsv cultured in vitro to accomplish this they used quantitative relative fitness assays to measure fitness changes in vsv populations that initially were competitively equal when sequentially passaged together one of the vsv populations was inevitably totally displaced by the other winner and loser strains were then mixed with the ancestral wild-type strains to examine absolute fitness changes in all cases the derived virus populations were able to outcompete and displace their ancestral populations in this important experiment evolutionary change continually proceeded in such a way that overall survivability of present generations surpassed that of previous ones and was lower than those of the future in other words populations are competing in a zero sum game where they must adaptively run just to stay at the same relative fitness level van valen 1973 this effect has only been experimentally examined in vsv therefore whether or not it occurs in the evolution of other viruses especially dna viruses cannot been addressed herethe barley yellow dwarf virus bydv system provides another interesting example of virusvirus competition these viruses are aphid transmitted and infect a wide range of grass species worldwide historical records of bydv isolated from oats in new york state between 1957 and 1976 indicate that of the two main viral subtypes bydvmav and bydvpav the percentage of diseased plants infected with bydvmav have decreased from 90 to 0 while the prevalence of bydvpav increased during the same period from 3 to 98 rochow 1979 and apparently still shows signs of superiority miller et al 1991
power 1996 has examined direct and indirect viral interactions that may be contributing to the competitive dominance of bydvpav she maintains that bydvpav may be winning an evolutionary battle because of its interactions with aphid vector species that are favoring higher transmission rates for instance bydvpav can potentially use more than one aphid species for transmission sitobion avenae and rhopalosiphum padi whereas bydvmav only uses s avenae in addition r padi was found to be a more efficient transmitter of virus than s avenae gray et al 1991 power et al 1991 morphological alteration of vectors as a result of viral infection may also be enhancing the spread of bydvpav aphids are polymorphic species having both winged and nonwinged adults gildow 1980 1983 has shown that r padi and s avenae adults are winged with significantly higher frequency when feeding on bydvinfected plants furthermore s avenae adults were found in separate experiments to be more frequently winged when feeding on bydvpav-infected plants than when feeding on bydvmav-infected plants gildow 1980 power et al 1991 point out that the competitive benefits of such viral-induced changes may include increased vector dispersal which may therefore provide bydvpav with a transmission advantage over bydvmavthe vsv experiment and bydv-group observations illustrate two possible outcomes of competitive viral interactions coexistence with ongoing adaptive change and competitive exclusion niche differentiation is another possible outcome of competitive interactions that allows stable coexistence between competitors but has so far not been examined in viral systems competition between two viral taxa for an obligate but finite resource niche component can and does eventually result in exclusion of one by the other as demonstrated above in clarke and colleagues 1994 research however intertaxonomic competition in the presence of more than one fundamental niche may result in alteration including expansion or contraction of the niches used by the individual competing populations niches can be differentiated by resource partitioning in which coexisting populations evolve the ability to utilize different resources thereby avoiding direct competition for viruses this type of partitioning might involve replication in separate cell or tissue types of a particular hostniche differentiation may also occur by utilization of similar host resources but in different temporal or spatial contexts this may include either infection of the same host population but at different times of the year or perhaps infection of different populations of a single host species that are geographically or otherwise environmentally separatecharacter displacement may be an observable condition indicative of niche differentiation this involves the evolution of measurable phenotypic differences between taxa existing in sympatry that do not exist in populations that are not involved in competition this may be the result of ultimately and give rise to proximately viral usage of different resources cell types vectors etc it is easy to imagine sympatric disparities in a viral surface protein for instance examples of sympatric disparity patterns are however rare in those species of macroorganisms traditionally investigated ecologically and not surprisingly have never been sought in microorganismscompetition may not be the only virusvirus interaction that exists that has a direct and often directional impact on individual viral fitness coinfection of a single host with two or more distinct virus types may also result in a change in the type or degree of pathogenic effects caused by one or the others replication an increase in virulence caused by coinfection may decrease the length of host infectiousness thereby diminishing transmission rates of one or all resident virus types this effect may be interpreted mathematically by inclusion of additional terms in eq 7 and figure 3 which define the rate of coinfection of two or more viruses as well as the effects of such coinfection on host fitness virulence and immunityexamples of multiple viral infections producing symptoms that are not found during single infections with any of the individual viral types involved have been documented contag and colleagues found that lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus induced paralytic poliomyelitis in mouse strains that expressed endogenous murine leukemia virus but not in other mouse strains contag et al 1989 contag and plagemann 1989 pedersen et al 1990 discovered that coinfection with feline leukemia virus felv and feline immunodeficiency virus fiv amplified fiv-induced immunodeficiency in 1995 atencio and colleagues discovered that 100 of newborn mice coinfected with moloney virus a retrovirus that causes murine leukemia momlv and a2 strain polyomavirus pyv exhibited stunted growth runting this effect was not observed in mice singly infected with momlv and was observed with much lower frequency in mice singly infected with pyvalthough poorly understood altered or enhanced pathogenicity caused by mixed infections may be the result of direct virusvirus interactions such as potentiation of replication of one virus when the gene products of another virus are present in the same host tissue it may also be caused by indirect effects such as presence of the hosts immune-related molecules cytokines antibodies etc that are induced by infection of one virus and that might potentiate replication of another however regardless of the mechanism viruses whose overall fitness is weakened by the intrahost presence of another viral type must adapt to avoid overcome or tolerate the coinfection-induced variation in pathogenicity and coinfecting replication rates if they are to persistcompetitive virusvirus interactions need not be direct in the sense of two or more viruses coinfecting a host simultaneously infection of a host or host population with one virus type can conceivably influence infection of that same host with a different virus either at some time in the future or simultaneously by inducing crossreactive adaptive immune responses against other viruses or by altering cells such that they are rendered uninfectiblefor instance as reviewed by weiss 1993 and best et al 1997 proteins derived from endogenous retrovirus genes may act as replication inhibitors of similar exogenous agents by blocking host cell receptors this has been observed in the case of the fv-4 gene of mice which originated from an endogenous retrovirus fv-4 is an envelope protein that appears to prohibit infection by potentially pathogenic ecotropic murine leukemia viruses by binding to host cell surface receptors thereby preventing fusion and entry of other closely related virus types kozak et al 1984 weiss 1993 this type of effect is also thought to occur in the chicken ev-3 gene also of retroviral origin which blocks the cell receptors used by rous-associated virus-o crittenden et al 1974in the case of protective endogenous retroviruses it is easy to see the fitness advantage conferred upon both the host and the virus itself and the resultant ecological barrier to which potentially infecting exogenous viral agents are exposed this generates selective pressure reinforcing the role of endogenous retroviruses as host guardians that exclude phylogenetically similar exogenous potential competitors while at the same time favoring divergence in the reproductive capabilities among those potentially pathogenic viruses under exclusion this may also provide a competitive exclusion explanation for the observation of a lack of exogenous viruses that are phylogenetically close to endogenous viruses of humans as well as an apparent lack of endogenous versions of the lentiviridae and spumaviridae lwer et al 1996specific host immune response to infection with one virus type may also be crossreactive to other distinct viruses thus preventing their occupation of host individuals or populations such forms of indirect competition may also bring about and perhaps even drive viral evolutionary change the most famous example of this occurrence is likely the exclusionary relationship between cowpox and smallpox infections in the late eighteenth century edward jenner demonstrated how humans exposed to relatively avirulent cowpox were resistant to infection with its more deadly relative smallpox virus jenner reprinted in 1959 immunological effects such as this are usually the result of similarity in antigenic makeup between the viruses which causes crossreactivity of specific antiviral defense mechanisms against related typesa common interspecies or intertaxonomic interaction that has profound effects on evolutionary change is predation despite the ubiquity and quantity of viruses on our planet there have been very few attempts to explore the possible existence of grazing organisms that rely on viral biomass for nourishmentin a 1993 publication gonzlez and suttle looked at phagotrophic consumption by marine nanoflagellates and determined that viruses and virus-like particles made up a significant portion of these microorganisms total nutritional intake the authors further note that these nanoflagellates engage in selective grazing of viruses in that they actually ingested different viral particles at different rates perhaps implying an ecological and evolutionary stability of this feeding practice gonzlez and suttle 1993 while this is an interesting phenomenon there exists no additional evidence to suggest that host-unrelated predation has any influence on the course or pace of viral evolutionary change as it does in numerous other organismsit is important here to make a distinction between these two processes something that in the literature is occasionally neglected reassortment only occurs when two or more viruses with segmented or diploid such as lentiviruses genomes coinfect a host cell the genome segments are randomly packaged into progeny virions and as a result the progeny may be composed of genomic segments from more than one parent the outcome of this reassortment is a genomically diverse assemblage of offspring as cleverly pointed out by cann 1995 two coinfecting influenza viruses each with eight original genomic segments may give rise to 28  256 potential progeny genomesrecombination is a process whereby genetic material is exchanged between individual nucleic acid strands of the viral genome which results in the formation of descendant nucleic acid strands composed of material from two or more parental strands recombination may be caused by polymerase copy choice or by strand breakage and re-ligation and can occur between either homologous or nonhomologous regions of the genomic strands detailed molecular descriptions of these processes are beyond the scope of this chapter but see nagy and simon 1997 and scholtissek 1995 for reviews on these subjectsmany important evolutionary leaps have undoubtedly been influenced as well as initiated by close viral interactions interviral recombination and reassortment generate diversity in infecting viral populations and thus in addition to mutation represent mechanisms that produce the phenotypic raw material upon which selection acts the evolutionary role of genetic exchange differs from mutation however in that exchange allows for more rapid and extreme evolutionary modification in other words the sequence space of an organism can be thought of as every possible combination of nucleotides in its genome eg 4v possible genome sequences may exist where  is the genome length most of these potential genome compositions are not biologically viable and are thus never observed in nature likewise other gene combinations may allow viral replication but only under specific circumstances determined by environmental conditions that may or may not exist at a given time still other genetic progeny may exhibit very efficient and successful replication comparatively therefore possessing high fitness and existing symbolically near the top of a fitness or adaptive peakhowever existence atop a fitness peak may not be as optimal as it sounds for instance other taller peaks may simultaneously be present in a particular landscape or may emerge in the future that may not be accessible by way of the normal mutational mechanisms no matter how high the mutation rates this is because the probabilistic attributes of the mutational process preclude quick and prodigious alteration of the genome and will usually produce small stepwise changes that correspond to movement of short distances through sequence space therefore once a genome has summitted an adaptive peak any other small motion would constitute a decrease in fitness  an improbable occurrence save for the effects of random drift general movement through adaptive landscapes is discussed more thoroughly and eloquently by wright 1931 1932 1982 kauffman and levin 1987 and coyne et al 1997 the specific adaptive landscape of viruses is also discussed by chao 1994 scott et al 1994 eigen and biebricher 1988 and domingo and holland 1997 niche expansion or shift in the form of changes in host range tissue type preferences vector usage pathogenicity or combinations of these and myriad other biological traits may represent movement of viral populations between fitness peaks or hills throughout their adaptive spacegenetic exchange between viruses is very evident both in vitro and in situ of greatest evolutionary significance is the generation of recombinants that exhibit phenotypes that differ from both all individual viral parents the ensuing changes may yield expansion of replication capabilities including changes in cell type preference interspecies hosthost transmission or even changes in vector utilization mixed infections in the laboratory between parent viruses whose replication might otherwise be restricted to infection of only one or another cell type will frequently result in production of viral recombinants capable of replication within both cell types as an example using mixed infections of lepidopteran cell lines kondo and maeda 1991 developed recombinants between various npvs that subsequently exhibited expanded host ranges the outcome was that coinfection of bombyx mori npv bmnpv with autographa californica npv acmnpv resulted in recombinants that could replicate in previously nonpermissive cell types another example is provided by the efforts of spector et al 1990 who found that experimental coinfection of hiv and a murine amphotropic retrovirus resulted in hiv pseudo-types capable of infecting both cd4 human cells and mouse cells these retroviral recombinants thus exhibited expansion in potential host range as well as tissue tropismthe occurrence of interviral genetic exchange in nature is supported by many lines of direct and indirect evidence and is thought to be a major contributor to host range expansion tissue tropism changes periodic epidemic and epizootic infection emerging infections and changes in viral pathogenicity hiv and other primate lentiviruses have been investigated quite extensively in this respect as reviewed by katz and skalka 1990 temin 1991 sharp et al 1995 robertson et al 1995ab burke 1997 and dornburg 1997 recombination especially involving regions of the envelope gene within and between primate immunodeficiency viruses has been an important evolutionary mechanism contributing to successful host-range expansion and widespread diversification of the groupretroviruses are known to recombine have sex not only within populations but also with host endogenous retroviruses weiss et al 1973 coffin 1982 risser et al 1983 stoye and coffin 1985 stoye et al 1988 temin 1991 with some herpesviruses isfort et al 1994 and with other exogenous retroviruses sharp et al 1995 robertson et al 1995ab as illustrated in figure 8
 lentivirus phylogenies constructed using single genomic regions often exhibit consistent branching patterns but incongruencies can be strongly apparent when trees for identical taxa are built using different regions of the genome li et al 1988 gao et al 1992
robertson et al 1995ab jin et al 1994 louwagie et al 1995 mccutchan et al 1996 sabino et al 1994 salminen et al 1997 dornburg 1997 such phylogenetic disparities indicate that many lentivirus genomes are actually mosaics representing the products of hybridization events between distinct viral types these interactions then gave rise to the evolutionarily successful new viruses we observe today perhaps exhibiting aggregate or even novel phenotypesthe frequency of recombination in lentivirus envelope genes has a strong parallel in the phage world tail fiber proteins are the functional analogues of lentivirus envelope glycoproteins in that they are both involved in host cell attachment specificity and genome entry as discussed by kutter et al 1996 and haggrd-ljungquist et al 1992 the makeup of tail fiber genes of many phages including mu p1 p2 and t4 are clearly derived from genetic exchange between viral types this should not be surprising as viral proteins that control cell host range can be thought of as passkeys that allow entry into reproductive nichesit is highly likely that recombination in the lentiviruses phages and perhaps other viruses is not only a significant cause of host rangetissue expansion and emergence but is also maintained and promoted to some extent by selective pressure related to this very attribute that is to say niche exploration perhaps in the form of interspecies transmission reproductive substrate variation itself may be imposing directional selective pressures that facilitate and preserve the characteristic of recombinationnewly occupied adaptive peaks may be quickly ascended by rna and retroviruses since these viruses have high mutation rates and exist as quasi-species that can evolve very rapidly due to the presence of enormous genetic variance under such circumstances voyages through sequence space either pay off quickly as when an adaptive peak is discovered resulting in viral diversification or cladogenesis or fail quickly resulting in viral extinction in these cases the interaction coinfection with recombination of different viral types may be highly favorable there may also be similar selective mechanisms operating on the integrase proteins of many viruses including retrovirusesthe equine encephalomyelitis complex alphaviruses represent an excellent example of viral use of recombination for evolutionary diversification the evolution of these viruses is reviewed and discussed extensively by weaver et al 1994 1997 strauss 1993 and scott et al 1994 phylogenetic analysis has revealed how recombination in these viruses has resulted in the acquisition and exchange of genes and traits between different viral types which has given rise to many evolutionarily successful taxonomic groups which persist today strauss 1993 has shown how western equine encephalitis virus weev is actually a recombinant between eastern equine encephalitis virus eeev and sindbis virus the recombination is manifest biologically not only in the pathogenicity of weev which is similar to that of eeev but also in the viruss vector specificity culex mosquitoes which differs from that of eeev culiseta mosquitoesgenetic reassortment has often been implicated as a primary driving force in the evolution of influenza viruses allowing both for host species jumps and for the evasion of specific host antiviral responses reviewed in webster et al 1992 scholtissek 1995mutation is not only a frequently inadequate method of generating requisite evolutionary diversity it also has the potential when coupled with random genetic drift to cause significant decreases in fitness following a drastic reduction in population size the probability of fixation of deleterious mutations which occur with much higher frequency than advantageous ones is enhanced by the improbability of subsequent reversions haigh 1978 chao 1991 and a lack of restorative mechanisms muller 1964 this is termed mullers ratchet since mutations in subsequent colonizing populations are accumulated in an irreversible fashion similar to the advance of a ratchet muller 1964 the end-result is a decrease in fitness caused by an increasing mutational load and this has been observed in numerous viral systems in vitro significant fitness decreases following plaque-to-plaque transfers bottlenecks have been demonstrated for vsv duarte et al 1992 1993 rna phage 6 chao 1990 chao et al 1992 fmdv escarmis et al 1996 as well as in the dna-based cellular microorganism salmonella typhimurium andersson and hughes 1996viral bottlenecks occurring in nature have been investigated to a limited extent see domingo et al 1985 gebauer et al 1988 but their frequency is most likely common during certain hosthost transmission events and intrahost colonization of secondary replication sites domingo and holland 1994 domingo et al 1996 in viruses susceptible to the effects of mullers ratchet due to transmission dynamics or other aspects of their host colonization biology genetic exchanges via recombination and reassortment may represent a buffer that prevents population fitness loss due to an otherwise extensive accumulation of deleterious mutations this mechanistic relief valve has been suggested as a selective determinant supporting the evolution and maintenance of genetic exchange in rna viruses by chao 1991 1992 and chao and colleagues 1992genetic exchange in viruses whether through recombination or reassortment translates into the production of genetic and phenotypic diversity which is of undeniable significance in viral survival as well as viral evolution although largely ignored as an ecological interaction genetic exchange in viruses is a process that involves extremely close association coinfection of a single cell between individual viruses whose phylogenetic relationship may be somewhat arbitrary this interaction has the potential to influence the evolutionary path of the existing viruses and even the power to create new viral taxa the degree and direction of the resulting evolutionary change is intimately dependent on the virus types involved the conditions of the interaction both host and virus population characteristics other coevolutionary interactions as well as many other probabilistic componentsunfortunately this review represents an inadequate introduction to the evolutionary ecology of viruses which remains largely unexplored as a discipline the primary basis of this shortcoming is the representational scope of scientific data that exists for viral taxa as is apparent by our recurrent use of specific virus types in illustration eg hiv there is a clear overrepresentation of information on viruses that 1 infect humans or economically important biota and 2 are pathogenic the skewed distribution of data type may be an inaccurate representation of the viral universe that exists on our planet therefore while the existent virology literature may be immense and thus allow elucidation of amazing phenomena our knowledge about chemistry biology and evolution will certainly be enhanced by investigation of new and unusual viruses this limitation also precludes the types of large-scale generalizations about virus biology and evolution that can occasionally be made regarding other organismswhat hopefully has emerged from our discussion as presented in this chapter is the condition and capacity of the selective environment in determining the evolutionary path of viruses this selective environment is partitioned into many compartments each of which has a role in shaping the overall adaptive landscape in addition we hopefully have demonstrated the extreme range of virus adaptability that allows these beings to parasitize genomes in essentially any of their possible manifestations and to subsequently exhibit overwhelming diversity the mechanisms that are employed in diversification adaptation genetic exchange mutation niche segregation cospeciation contribute fundamentally to the broad range of their variation we have attempted to illustrate this in figure 9
 which demonstrates the evolutionary history of imaginary virus taxa in relation to their hoststhe existence of viruses will also induce evolutionary responses in their hosts which in turn feeds back as changes in the virus adaptive landscape changes in this landscape rarely appear to be so profound as to end all genome parasitization the study of viral evolutionary ecology will assist researchers in many disciplines as they endeavor to explain and predict changes in viral reproduction including the emergence of viruses as pathogens in the more conspicuous species such as homo sapiens
the authors would like to thank steve frank christon hurst esteban domingo donald burke mark lipsitch and walter fitch for their valuable and insightful commentsapoptosis is a highly conserved physiological type of cell death which is required to eliminate damaged used-up and misplaced cells within a multicellular organism kerr et al 1972 hotchkiss et al 2009 in contrast to necrosis or necroptosis which often leads to pathological chronic inflammatory immune reactions due to cell lysis apoptotic cells do not fall apart but are discretely eaten up by macrophages and other non-professional phagocytes in a regulated and non-inflammatory manner vanlangenakker et al 2012 apoptosis is induced by two distinct yet tightly interconnected signaling pathways the extrinsic fig 1
 and the intrinsic fig 2
 apoptotic pathways the extrinsic pathway is triggered by extracellular ligands such as those of the tnf superfamily fasl tnf or trail which specifically bind to their respective surface receptors causing their oligomerization strasser et al 2009 guicciardi and gores 2009 gonzalvez and ashkenazi 2010 li et al 2013a li et al 2013b a conformational change on the cytoplasmic side of these receptors leads to the recruitment of the adapter protein fadd whose function is to attract pro-caspase-8 from the cytosol to the death receptor in order to bring two monomeric pro-caspase-8 molecules in close proximity for autoprocessing and subsequent activation fig 1 this complex referred to as death inducing signaling complex disc then interacts with already dimerized effector pro-caspase-3 andor -7 which become activated through caspase-8-mediated cleavage followed by autoprocessing active effector caspases then cleave numerous substrates that lead to the disruption of the cytoskeleton inhibition of dna repair initiation of dna fragmentation and the exposure of so-called eat-me signals which mediate the uptake and elimination of apoptotic cells by macrophagesthe extrinsic death receptor pathway is indispensable for the execution and limitation of both innate and adaptive immune responses cells of the innate immune system such as dendritic or natural killer nk cells generate a rapid antiviral immune response by directly detecting viral products such as dsrna by toll-like receptor 3 tlr by upregulating death ligands such as fasl trail and tnf andor by killing infected cells by granule exocytosis nk cells medzhitov 2001 later during adaptive immunity virally infected cells are killed by antigen-specific cytotoxic t cells ctls via both the perforingranzyme and the faslfas pathways chavez-galan et al 2009 subsequently activated t cells are eliminated by activation-induced cell death involving faslfas-mediated killing of the same or an activated neighboring cell after an acute infection arakaki et al 2014 this ensures that highly proliferative superfluous killer cells are disposed of accordingly preventing the development of autoimmune or leukemic cells it is therefore not surprising that viruses have evolved strategies to inhibit the death receptor signaling pathway at several steps although these cells may still be killed by granule exocytosis benedict et al 2002 hay and kannouraki 2002 as a consequence infected cells are at least partially protected from cytolysis by ctls nk cells or neighboring cells which express fasl or trail upon activation ashkenazi and dixit 1999 and tnf may not be able to induce a sufficient inflammatory responsefor example the shope fibroma virus rabbit poxvirus produces a tnf receptor ortholog tnfr2 which neutralizes tnf smith et al 1991 fig 1 other tnfr orthologs have been identified in the genomes of lepri- and orthopoxviruses including cowpox crmb hu et al 1994 and smallpox crme reading et al 2002 and in the genome of cmv ul144 orf benedict et al 1999 they can either be expressed in the plasma membrane of infected cells or be shed as soluble decoy receptors for example myxoma virus t2 protein upton et al 1991 reading et al 2002 these tnf signaling inhibitors clearly contribute to the high virulence of poxviruses because they are mutated in vaccinia viruses an attenuated form of smallpox in addition a trail receptor ortholog trailr2 was detected in the genome of avian leukocytosis virus brojatsch et al 1996 on the other hand adenoviruses use several proteins encoded in the e3 gene region to promote the internalization and lysosomal degradation of fas tnfr trailr1 and r2 shisler et al 1997 tollefson et al 1998 stewart et al 1995 benedict et al 2001 finally several viruses produce proteins capable of blocking extrinsic death receptor signaling at the level of the disc ie by either inhibiting caspase-8 activation or its proteolytic activity for example the viral flip proteins vflips are inactive caspase-8 homologs which are recruited by fadd to form a disc that lacks caspase activity thome and tschopp 2001 krueger et al 2001 subramaniam et al 2013 in addition they can recruit traf2 rip nik and ikk2 which favor the inductionactivation of nfb a crucial anti-apoptotic transcription factor kataoka et al 2000 subramaniam et al 2013 vflips are present in the genome of -herpesviruses including equine herpesvirus 2 ehv-2 herpesvirus saimiri hvs kshv kaposi bovine herpesvirus bhv-4 and moluscum contagiosum virus mcv bertin et al 1997 thome and tschopp 2001 benedict et al 2002 the vica protein produced by the hcmv viral gene ul36 also associates with caspase-8 and blocks its activation but it has no sequence homology with caspases skaletskaya et al 2001 last but not least the crma protein from cowpox virus is able to inhibit the proteolytic activity of caspase-8 by binding to and blocking the catalytic center zhou et al 1997the intrinsic apoptotic pathway is activated by the lack of soluble survival factors or hormones cellcell or cellmatrix interactions deprivation-induced cell death also called anoikis the exposure of cells to pathogens such as fungi bacteria or viruses or the treatment with genotoxicdna damaging stimuli irradiation chemotherapeutic drugs toxins or pro-oxidants agents which stress the endoplasmic reticulum inhibit protein kinases proteasomal degradation transcription translation or perturb the cytoskeleton fig 2 youle and strasser 2008 hotchkiss et al 2009 chipuk et al 2010 the critical step of this pathway is the permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane momp which results in the release of several apoptogenic factors from the intermembrane space of mitochondria one such protein cytochrome c binds to the adapter apaf-1 which then recruits cytosolic pro-caspase-9 into a heptameric complex called the apoptosome fig 2 in a similar way as caspase-8 aggregates on the disc monomeric caspase-9 dimerizes on the apoptosomal platform leading to proximity-induced autoprocessing and activation active caspase-9 then cleaves and activates effector caspase-3 and -7 other proteins released from mitochondria either stimulate yet unknown caspase-independent cell death processes or they enhance caspase-9 and -3 activation fig 2 for example smacdiablo and htr2aomi bind to xiap a member of the inhibitors of apoptosis proteins iaps xiap is an endogenous caspase-9 and -3 inhibitor which prevents accidental autoprocessing and activation of these caspases in healthy cells deveraux and reed 1999 shi 2002 upon sequestration by smac or omi xiap no longer binds to caspase-9 or -3 therefore allowing the full activation of these caspases in response to apoptotic stimuli activating the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway fig 2since momp results in both caspase-dependent and independent cell death signaling it is a crucial life-or-death decision checkpoint a point of no return fig 2 this checkpoint is controled by the bcl-2 family of proteins youle and strasser 2008 chipuk et al 2010 the bcl-2 family is subdivided on the basis of structural conservation of so-called bcl-2 homology bh domains and comes in three flavors the pro-apoptotic bh3-only proteins bim bid bad bik bmf hrk puma noxa only share a ca 2030 amino acid long alpha-helical bh3 domain with the rest of the bcl-2 family they act as sentinelssensors of apoptotic stimuli which activate the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway happo et al 2012 depending on the apoptotic stimulus particular sets of bh3-only proteins get transcriptionally induced or posttranslationally modified migrate to and insert into the mom and then activate at this site a second pro-apoptotic subclass of bcl-2 family proteins the so-called effectors bax and bak happo et al 2012 for example bim is transcriptionally induced by foxo3b in response to growth factor deprivation or phosphorylated by jnk during thymic selection and upon exposure to uv or gliotoxin happo et al 2012 geissler et al 2013 by contrast puma and noxa are target genes of p53 after genotoxic stress bid is proteolytically cleaved to truncated tbid by caspase-8 in response to death receptor ligands such as fasl trail or tnf defining a second so called type ii death receptor pathway that crosstalks with the mitochondrial pathway youle and strasser 2008 chipuk et al 2010 happo et al 2012bax and bak directly induce momp they contain bh1 bh2 and bh3 domains which form an elongated hydrophobic binding pocket interacting with other members of the bcl-2 family suzuki et al 2000 czabotar et al 2013 brouwer et al 2014 volkmann et al 2014 westphal et al 2014 borner and andrews 2014 in healthy cells bax resides inactive in the cytoplasm suzuki et al 2000 schinzel et al 2004 and constantly shuttles between the cytoplasm and the periphery of the mom without stably inserting in the membrane retrotranslocation wolter et al 1997 edlich et al 2011 bak on the other hand is stably inserted into the mom but held in check by inhibitory proteins such as vdac2 and bcl-2 survival factors wang et al 2001 cheng et al 2003 willis et al 2005 three bh3-only proteins bim tbid and puma are capable of directly activating baxbak on the mom letai et al 2002 cartron et al 2004 kuwana et al 2005 gavathiotis et al 2008 czabotar et al 2013 recent structural analysis of the activation process suggests that after their translocation to and insertion into the mom bim and tbid bind to the hydrophobic pocket in baxbak via their bh3-domain czabotar et al 2013 brouwer et al 2014 this changes the conformation of bax and bak in a way that their bh3-regions become exposed for dimeric interaction with the hydrophobic pocket of another bax or bak molecule dewson et al 2009 czabotar et al 2013 brouwer et al 2014 for that purpose the bh3-only protein has to dissociate from the hydrophobic binding pocket which explains why direct interaction between bh3-only proteins and baxbak is only transient and difficult to detect biochemically presumably through an additional interaction site in the rear part of the molecule baxbak dimers can then assemble into multimers dewson et al 2009 it is not yet clear if these multimers form a protein pore or perturb the lipid bilayer of the mom to rearrange into a lipid pore that may be generated by a hemifusion intermediate montessuit et al 2010 bleicken et al 2014 borner and andrews 2014 newest findings from lipid nanodiscs and fluorescence measurements indicate that baxbak may form pores of different sizes depending on whether they are monomeric di- or multimeric xu et al 2013 volkmann et al 2014 at one point the pores are large enough to allow the passage of cytochrome c or even bigger molecules such as smac and omi to the cytoplasmthe third subgroup of the bcl-2 family is formed by the anti-apoptotic proteins bcl-2 bcl-xl mcl-1 bcl-w and a1 youle and strasser 2008 chipuk et al 2010 they also contain bh1 bh2 and bh3 domains and some even have an additional bh4 domain at the n-terminus the 3-dimensional structure of these survival factors looks very similar to that of baxbak muchmore et al 1996 suzuki et al 2000 however in contrast to baxbak they are unable to undergo conformational changes to expose their bh3-domain multimerize and form pores except under unphysiological conditions such as low ph minn et al 1997 schendel et al 1997 instead their hydrophobic binding pocket interacts with bh3-only proteins in a high affinity manner on one hand this inhibits the pro-apoptotic action of bh3-only proteins on the other hand pre-bound bim tbid and puma can be released from the bcl-2 survival factors by other bh3-only proteins activated by apoptotic stimuli such as bik bad bmf hrk and noxa borner and andrews 2014 bim tbid and puma can then directly activate baxbak as described above this explains the effectiveness of bh3-mimetics in anti-cancer therapy these are small molecule compounds that bind with high affinity to the hydrophobic pocket of bcl-2 survival factors and thereby release pre-bound bim tbid and puma for momp activation oltersdorf et al 2005 happo et al 2012 it turns out that many cancer cells do not only upregulate bcl-2 survival factors but also bim tbid and puma a mechanism called addiction certo et al 2006 this may explain the high sensitivity of cancer cells to be killed by bh3-mimetics such as abt-267 abt-199 and others tse et al 2008 wilson et al 2010 vandenberg and cory 2013 apart from interacting with bh3-only proteins bcl-2 survival factors also sequester accidently activated bax and bak in healthy cells since active baxbak expose their bh3-domain this region can interact with the hydrophobic pocket of bcl-2 survival factors and hence baxbak are inhibited chen et al 2005 willis et al 2005 willis et al 2007 uren et al 2007 this may also constitute one of the mechanisms by which mom-inserted bak is kept in check by bcl-2 survival factors when large amounts of baxbak are bound by bcl-2 survival factors bh3-only proteins can displace appreciable numbers of baxbak molecules from bcl-2 and therefore make more pore-forming proteins available for the activation of momp youle and strasser 2008 borner and andrews 2014 since bcl-2 survival factors are able to sequester both the activators bh3-only proteins and the effectors baxbak of momp and momp triggers both caspase-dependent and -independent cell death overexpression of these survival factors is the most efficient way to block apoptosis even allowing clonogenic survival which caspase inhibitors are not able to do borner 2003given the importance of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway for apoptosis induced by numerous stimuli viruses have acquired gene products which mimick the action of bcl-2 survival factors to potently inhibit momp in their host cells functional homologs of bcl-2 are collectively called vbcl-2s they are present in various members of the poxviridae f1l n1l m11l a179l orfv125 herpesviridae bhrf1 balf1 vmia ksbcl-2 mhvbcl-2 adenoviridae e1b-19k and birnaviridae vp5 family of viruses fig 2 benedict et al 2002 galluzzi et al 2008 postigo and ferrer 2009 while some of them like e1b-19k have extensive sequence homology with cellular bcl-2 survival factors in all regions white 1998 others such as fpv039 from fowlpoxvirus only retain sequence homology with the bh1 and bh2 domains while orfv125 of parapoxvirus is homologous in the bh1 and bh3 regions galluzzi et al 2008 westphal et al 2007 banadyga et al 2007 other vbcl-2s such as vaccinia virus f1l and n1l myxoma virus m11l and vmia from cytomegalovirus do not even show any sequence homology with mammalian bcl-2 proteins galluzzi et al 2008 however the crystal structure of some of these vbcl-2s reveals a close conservation of the bcl-2 family structural conformation thus it is not the primary amino acid sequence andor the conserved bh-domains per se which determine the function of a bcl-2 survival factor but the helical bundle structure that makes up the hydrophobic pocket where bh3-only proteins and baxbak are sequesteredother viral proteins inhibit the intrinsic mitochondrial signaling pathway by modulating bcl-2 family members on the transcriptional level or via post-translational modifications the tumor suppressor p53 is known to induce the transcription of the bh3-only proteins noxa and puma in response to genotoxic stress oda et al 2000 nakano and vousden 2001 and growth factor deprivation jabbour et al 2010 contributing to the elimination of stressed and damaged cells fig 2 cells lacking functional p53 survive and proliferate and accumulate gene mutations eventually leading to cancer harvey et al 1993 also p53-deficient mice are more prone to certain viral infections indicating that p53 is not only crucial to prevent cancer but also to induce apoptosis of some infected host cells therefore viruses have evolved strategies to inactivate p53 the sv40 large t antigen binds to p53 and sequesters it in an inactive complex lane and crawford 1979 linzer and levine 1979 the human papillomavirus hpv e6 protein and the adenovirus e1b-55k protein induce the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of p53 scheffner et al 1990 werness et al 1990 steegenga et al 1998 querido et al 2001 also the x protein of hepatitis b virus hbx interacts with p53 and prevents its transcriptional activation of target genes thereby inhibiting apoptosis wang 1995 fig 2 a similar strategy is used by the measles virus v protein which blocks apoptosis by sequestering the p53 homolog p73 cruz et al 2006 a p53-independent mechanism to inhibit momp is exploited by the human t cell leukemia virus type i htlv-1 which uses the tax protein to activate the bcl-xl promoter and to repress the bax promoter tsukahara et al 1999 moreover viruses can effectively block both the intrinsic mitochondrial and the extrinsic death receptor signaling by engaging the transcription factor nfb sun and cesarman 2011 nfb induces transcription of the survival factor bcl-xl the caspase-8 inhibitor flip or inhibitor of apoptosis proteins iaps which often directly or indirectly act as caspase inhibitors didonato et al 2012 for example herpes simplex virus-1 hsv-1 through its envelope glycoprotein d uses a tnfr family member herpes virus entry mediator hvem for host surface binding and infection activation of this receptor triggers a signaling cascade that leads to nfb activation and apoptosis inhibition medici et al 2003 sciortino et al 2008 similarly the major b cell-transforming protein in ebv lmp1 mimics activated cd40 and engages tradd and trafs which are crucial adaptors used by tnfr to activate nfb thereby lmp1 prevents b cells from localizing to the follicle and protects cells harboring latent virus from interactions with t cells uchida et al 1999 finally the nef protein of hiv wolf et al 2001 and the us3 protein kinase of hsv-1 munger and roizman 2001 were found to mediate phosphorylation of the bh3-only protein bad thereby preventing it from inducing apoptosisanother possibility for viruses to interfere with apoptosis signaling is to block caspases as pointed out above cowpox viruses can effectively block initiator caspase-8 of the extrinsic death receptor pathway because this pathway is strictly caspase-dependent zhou et al 1997 the major initiator and effector caspases of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway caspase-9 and caspase-3-7 are held in check by cellular iaps in particular xiap fig 2 deveraux and reed 1999 shi 2002 however momp also leads to caspase-independent death signaling fig 2 therefore blocking caspase-9 andor -3 by viruses may not be sufficient to save infected host cells from apoptosis this explains why an iap-ortholog strategy is infrequently used in mammalian viruses in contrast to baculoviruses infecting insect cells taylor and barry 2006 accordingly although african swine fever virus and entomopoxviruses encode viral viap such as msepv and amepv these proteins do not contribute to the virulence of these viruses neilan 1993 taylor and barry 2006 fig 2in addition to the activation of the fas signaling pathway described above ctls and nk cells also kill virally infected target cells via the perforingranzyme pathway after successful activation these cells release perforin and granzyme a and b from their cytotoxic granules at the immunosynapse where they contact the virally infected cell via mhc-ipeptidetcr and costimulatory molecular interactions chavez-galan et al 2009 ewen et al 2012 thiery and lieberman 2014 fig 2 perforin oligomerizes into variously sized high molecular structures in the target cell membrane metkar et al 2015 most likely through membrane lipid perturbation similar to what is proposed for bax and bak on the mom bleicken et al 2014 perforin forms a pore which allows the entry of the serine proteases granzyme a and b metkar et al 2015 fig 2 while granzyme a provokes a still not entirely identified caspase-independent death pathway and is also responsible for inflammatory responses pardo et al 2009a pardo et al 2009b joeckel and bird 2014 granzyme b induces classical apoptosis in the target cell by two pathways i a direct cleavage and activation of caspase-3 and ii the cleavage of bid similar to what caspase-8 does and the triggering of baxbak-mediated momp pardo et al 2009a pardo et al 2009b ewen et al 2012 thiery and lieberman 2014 viruses counteract the granzyme b killing pathway by expressing vbcl-2 survival factors alternatively they produce inhibitors of granzyme b such as the l4-100k assembly protein from adenovirus andrade et al 2001 crma from cowpox virus which also inhibits caspase-8 komiyama et al 1996 or serp2 encoded by the leporipoxvirus myxoma virus turner et al 1999 fig 2 all these inhibitors clearly block granzyme b action in cell free systems but while the l4-100k protein also potently inhibited granzyme b-mediated cell death andrade et al 2001 this could not be effectively observed with cells overexpressing crma or serp2 or infected with poxviruses mllbacher et al 1999 barry et al 2000 screpanti et al 2001 pardo et al 2009a pardo et al 2009bin the following section we focus on rna viruses fig 3
 but similar mechanisms have either been reported or are expected to occur for dna viruses goubau et al 2013 unterholzner 2013 irrespective of whether virus replication and spread are blocked and viruses are finally eliminated by non-apoptotic or apoptotic mechanism the infected host cells first have to recognize ie sense the respective viruses this places the molecular mechanisms of sensing at the heart of all anti-viral effects including the initation of cell death virus spread is prevented if host cell apoptosis occurs before a virus can form progeny or if an infected cell is successfully eliminated by ctls if however the virus can inhibit cell death by expressing own survival factors after infection or if it kills cells after its reproduction it can successfully propagate and evade the immune system the best known antiviral sensing mechanism of hosts for rna viruses triggers the so called type i interferon response takeuchi and akira 2009 ivashkiv and donlin 2014 type i interferons such as ifn and ifn are transcriptionally induced after viral infections and play a critical role in mounting innate responses against viruses fig 3 they are secreted and bind to specific interferon receptors on the same as well as on neighboring cells in order to ensure a spreading of the antiviral state to as many cells as possible activated interferon receptors then trigger a signaling cascade via the janus protein kinase-signal transducer and activators of transcription pathway jak-stat that results in the induction of ifn-stimulated genes isgs which can interfere with the viral life cycle at different steps induce host cell apoptosis or both fig 3 ivashkiv and donlin 2014 two major components of this ifn-induced signaling system are the rna-dependent protein kinase pkr garcia et al 2007 and the 25-oligoadenylate and rnase-l systems hovanessian 2007 activation of rnasel leads to the degradation of viral rna therefore blocking further rna replication and transcription on the other hand pkr activation inhibits host-cell protein translation via the phosphorylation of elongation initiation-factor 2a eif2 garcia et al 2007 fig 3 in addition active pkr was proposed to induce host cell apoptosis via nfb and irf-1 activation which then upregulated fasl and trail respectively tan and katze 1999 jagus et al 1999 although trail is induced by ifns in a variety of paradigms of viral infections and may indeed contribute to apoptosis of host cells it is unclear if this is really mediated via the pkrnfb axis allen and el-deiry 2012 also nfb often acts as a cell death protective rather than apoptosis-inducing transcription factor didonato et al 2012 moreover we recently reported that pkr was not required for apoptosis induced by the rna virus sfv although it was clearly activated and blocked protein synthesis via eif2 phosphorylation el maadidi et al 2014in order for a host cell to sense a virus it has to recognize it as non-self this occurs through two principle mechanisms first viruses are detected on the host cell surface by so-called pattern recognition receptors prr which bind to pathogen associated molecular patterns pamps on the virus and other pathogens pichlmair and reis e sousa 2007 kumar et al 2011 a major class of cell surface transmembrane prr are the toll-like receptors tlrs whose pamp-binding domains contain leucine-rich repeats lrr tlr3 tlr7 trl9 detect viral nucleic acid ligands such as long dsrna ssrna or cpg dna respectively mostly in the endosomal compartments subsequent to endocytosis of the virus after binding they recruit adaptor proteins such as trif for tlr3 or myd88 tlr7tlr9 which bind specific members of the traf adaptor and activate the irak kinase families this ultimately leads to the nuclear translocation of nfb and irf3 and irf7 transcription factors through respective phosphorylation and activation of the ikb kinase ikk  and ikktbk1 complexes pichlmair and reis e sousa 2007 bowie and unterholzer 2008 kawai and akira 2008 kumar et al 2011 fig 3 nfb and irf37 then cooperate to induce the transcription of ifn and ifn recently it was reported that activation of the tlr3 pathway by the synthetic dsrna homologs polyic can induce apoptosis by recruiting caspase-8 to tlr3 weber et al 2010 estornes et al 2012 in an earlier report trif an adaptor for tlr3 was shown to induce apoptosis in a faddcaspase-8-dependent manner kaiser and offermann 2005 fig 3 in all cases caspase-8 was activated by proximity-induced dimerization and then cleaved and activated caspase-3 fig 3 this defines a novel death receptor- and mitochondria-independent death signaling pathway involving caspase-8viruses evolved strategies to inhibit this signaling pathway downstream of tlrs to avoid the transcription of type i interferons for instance the ns3-4a protease of hepatitis c virus hcv cleaves the adaptor trif roy and mocarski 2007 while the ns5a protein decreases the expression of tlr4 tamura et al 2011 vaccinia virus uses its a46 protein to inhibit all tlr-adaptors myd88 mal trif tram the a52 protein to block traf6 and the protein kinase irak2 the b14 protein to antagonize the ikk complex and the k7 protein to prevent the ikktbk1 complex from activating irf37 bowie and unterholzer 2008 the latter strategy is also used by hcv ns3 rabies virus phosphoprotein and hantavirus g1in addition to the recognition of viruses in the endosomal compartment cells also contain viral sensors in the cytosol pichlmair and reis e sousa 2007 kawai and akira 2008 takeuchi and akira 2009 these are the rig-like helicases rlh rig-i mda5 and lgp-2 yoneyama et al 2004 kato et al 2006 rig-i and mda5 both contain two caspase recruitment domains cards an atpase and a helicase domain fig 3 the helicase domain is used to recognize different kinds of nucleic acids while mda5 mainly senses long viral dsrna molecules rig-i is often activated by short dsrna fragments and ssrnas that have a 5 triphosphate pichlmair and reis e sousa 2007 this concept ensures that cellular rnas whose 5 ends are either capped or contain monophosphates are not recognized by rlhs activated rig-i and mda5 then use their card domains to interact with the mitochondria-located adaptor protein mavs also known as ips-1 visa or cardif kawai et al 2005 meylan et al 2005 seth et al 2005 xu et al 2005 fig 3 mavs in turn then triggers ikk as well as ikktbk1 phosphorylation that activate nfkb and irf3 and irf7 transcription factors for ifn and ifn induction takeuchi and akira 2009 similar to tlr3 signaling sensing through rig-imda5mavs is heavily antagonized by viruses influenza ns1 binds the rig-imavs complex and thereby interferes with its signaling moreover paramyxovirus v and polivirus are able to inhibit the function of mda5 finally hcv ns3-4 abrogates mavs signaling by cleaving it from the mitochondrial membrane similarly mavs is degraded by mitochondria-targeted hepatitis a virus 3abc protein bowie and unterholzer 2008 the latter examples show that mavs functions on mitochondria and suggests that this organelle either plays a so far unrecognized role in antiviral type i interferon signaling or that mavs also mediates apoptosis and thereby crosstalks with baxbak-induced momp indeed besch et al reported that both rig-1 and mda5 could induce apoptosis of human melanoma cells in a type i interferon-independent manner ie at a step before ifn induction besch et al 2009 the molecular mechanisms of this new death signaling pathway had however not been defined at that timerecently we published new insights into the mechanisms of host cell apoptosis induced by a single stranded positive-sense rna virus which does not encode for any cell death protective proteins el maadidi et al 2014 semliki forest virus sfv is a neurotropic virus that kills mice during the first 21 days of their life probably due to the induction of apoptosis of immature neurons strauss and strauss 1994 it also causes encephalitis in various animals but is mostly apathogenic for humans fazakerley 2002 we and others however found that sfv induces effective apoptosis of a variety of human and mouse cells in vitro via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway ie requiring baxbak and the induction of momp ubol et al 1994 grandgirard et al 1998 murphy et al 2001 urban et al 2008 after infection sfv produces high amounts of dsrna during the rna replication cycle and although it is not entirely clear whether dsrna is the trigger for sfv-induced apoptosis and how it could activate baxbak via which bh3-only protein see below fig 3 we reported that sfv-induced apoptosis is clearly rna replication dependent urban et al 2008 moreover baxbak double knock-out cells are not entirely protected from sfv-induced apoptosis but exhibit a baxbak-independent cell death that still requires caspases but does not involve death-receptor signaling we then found that this novel baxbak-independent death signaling pathway requires a mda5-mediated activation of mavs on mitochondria el maadidi et al 2014 mavs recruits caspase-8 from the cytosol to mitochondria forming a novel death inducing signaling complex that is capable of processing and activating caspase-3 and inducing apoptosis fig 3 our results indicate that not only the tlr3trif axis can induce apoptosis in addition to activating nfb irf37 and an antiviral type i interferon response kaiser and offermann 2005 weber et al 2010 estornes et al 2012 but the same can be achieved by the mda5mavs pathway el maadidi et al 2014 both baxbak- and death receptor-independent death signaling pathways use the initiator caspase-8 on novel death platforms tlr3trifcaspase-8 or mavscaspase-8 to activate caspase-3-7 fig 3 whether this innate immune signaling pathway also accounts for interferon responses andor apoptosis in response to dna viruses which use tlr9 hemmi et al 2000 and other intracellular sensors such as cgassting sun et al 2013 or dai takaoka et al 2007 remains to be determined interestingly it was recently shown that ips-1mavs may also mediate innate immune signaling in response to dna viruses zhang et al 2011 unterholzner 2013 thus this novel mitochondria-associated pathway may be used as a general defence mechanism of host cells against virusesanother possibility how cells can sense and react to virus infection is by mounting an er-stress response li et al 2013a li et al 2013b this is particularly the case for rna viruses such as alphaviruses where the envelope proteins are co-translationally inserted into the er membrane and travel through the exocytotic system to the cell surface for virus budding li and stollar 2004 he 2006 barry et al 2010 jheng et al 2014 in this case the high amount of er-localized viral proteins induce a classical unfolded protein response upr while upr responses are often cell protective by triggering the transcriptional upregulation of chaperones such as bipgrp78 which help in the folding of the massive amount of proteins a persistent prolonged upr response for example via the irexbp1 pathway can also lead to apoptosis of the infected host cells lin et al 2007 sano and reed 2013 lu et al 2014 in this case the transcription factor chop1 is activated which upregulates the bh3-only proteins bim and puma leading to baxbak activation and momp via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway reimertz et al 2003 puthalakath et al 2007 ghosh et al 2012 viruses would then counteract host cell death by the expression of bcl-2 orthologs vbcl-2ssome viruses have developed strategies to actively kill their infected hosts probably to avoid the presentation of viral antigens to the adaptive immune system if this happens viruses have replicated and assembled into new virions so that host cell apoptosis does not eliminate the virus as well both the activation of the extrinsic as well as the intrinsic apoptosis pathways have been observed targeting the extrinsic pathway the nef protein of hiv downregulates cd4 and mhc-1 from the cell surface by crosslinking these proteins to the endocytic compartment piguet et al 1999 as a consequence membrane-bound tnf and light are constitutively expressed on the surface of t cells potentially contributing to the cytotoxic effects of hiv on infected t cells and uninfected bystander lymphocytes lama and ware 2000 moreover hcmv and reoviruses were shown to actively induce the expression of trail sedger et al 1999 vidalain et al 2000 and hsv and hcmv can enhance the expression of fasl raftery et al 1999 raftery et al 2001 this mechanism is thought to constitute another viral immune evasion tactic to eliminate infiltrating immune cells such as ctls and dcs by counterattackto activate the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway the vpr protein from hiv-1 induces swelling of mitochondria and mom permeabilization in lymphoid and transformed cells stewart et al 1999 jacotot et al 2000 muthumani et al 2002 deniaud et al 2004 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov 7a protein can directly inhibit bcl-xl and other survival factors tan et al 2007 although to date viruses have not been found to express bh3-only orthologs there is increasing evidence that they somehow activate cellular bh3-only proteins to engage the baxbak pore machinery on the mom however the exact molecular mechanism how this is done has remained enigmatic the tat protein of hiv-1 was shown to release bim from its inhibitory contraints on the cytoskeleton so that it can directly activate baxbak puthalakath et al 1999 chen et al 2002 whether bim indeed is held in check at the cytoskeleton is largely debated moreover the mechanism of release has not been investigated ifn production in response to vesicular stomatitis viral infection has been shown to induce expression of noxa galluzzi et al 2008 but the transcription factors involved were not identified based on the finding that viruses can activate p53 and its homologs such as p73 kaelin 1999 it is possible that noxa and maybe also puma are transcriptionally induced by these factors in response to certain infections cruz et al 2006 liu et al 2014 alternatively virus-specific protein kinases could phosphorylate bh3-only proteins as it was shown for the us3 protein kinase of hsv-1 on bad munger and roizman 2001we have recently shown that bim phosphorylation on three sites by jnk12 enhances its proapoptotic activity toward baxbak activation geissler et al 2013 moreover we have obtained evidence that dsrna produced by sfv does not only trigger a baxbak-independent death signaling pathway involving the formation of a mitochondrial mavscaspase-8 complex see above el maadidi et al 2014 but also uses a so far unknown bh3-only protein to activate baxbak and momp papaianni et al submitted fig 3 how dsrna links to such a bh3-only protein is currently investigated in our lab finally it is possible that virus-encoded proteases may cleave bh3-only proteins such as bid these proteases are required for the viral life cycle because they process large non-structural and structural polypeptide precusors into mature viral proteins strauss and strauss 1994 since they often show degenerate substrate specificity they could cleave important components of apoptosis signaling and thereby activate them for example plv viruses express proteases 2apro and 3cpro which activate caspase-dependent apoptosis barco et al 2000 goldstaub et al 2000 calandria et al 2004 in addition hiv-encoded protease is known to process and activate caspase-8 both in vitro and in t cells which then leads to bid cleavage and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis nie et al 2002 indeed bcl-2 overexpression protects cells from the pro-apoptotic effects of the hiv-protease and prevents apoptosis induced by hiv-1 infection of human lymphocytes strack et al 1996there is increasing evidence that innate immune signaling via tlrs and intracellular prrs do not only trigger an antiviral interferon response and other mechanisms to limit the replication assembly and spread of viruses but they also cooperate with the intrinsic baxbak-mediated mitchondrial pathway to induce apoptosis of the infected host cells as discussed above some viruses have clearly evolved strategies to counteract both the intrinsic as well as the innate signaling branch so that they can effectively replicate and reproduce however other viruses such as sfv and other alphaviruses do not express any cell survival factors and may therefore use these pathways to kill their host cells after their successful reproduction eg to evade detection by the immune system while we clearly understand how virus-encoded decoy receptors caspase-8 and other caspase inhibitors as well as bcl-2 orthologs work to inhibit apoptosis of infected cells we need to further understand how viruses manage to activate bh3-only proteins andor directly perturb the balance between bcl-2-like survival factors and pore-forming baxbak proteins on the mom further challenges will be to identify all the components of the tlr3trifcaspase-8 and mavscaspase-8 complexes which seem to constitute novel discs enhancing baxbak-mediated momp and to investigate if other viruses such as dna viruses also use innate signaling strategies to kill their hosts irrespective of whether viruses use apoptotic or anti-apoptotic mechanisms to win their competition with the host a better understanding will continue to provide considerable insight into both viral and cellular biology from initial virus sensing to viral clearance or persistence it is the hope that this will ultimately lead to the generation of more effective vaccines against virusesviruses and their hosts engage in evolutionary arms races in the form of continuous molecular level changes that determine the mechanisms of infection and defense 14 the evolutionary dynamics are determined in large part by host susceptibility and viral pathogenicity and ultimately depend on molecular interactions between genes and their products 57 these relentless evolutionary arms races drive genetic diversity in both host and pathogen 2 8 9 more generally host-pathogen interactions have been proposed as a major factor in the evolution of biological complexity 1013if we consider humans and other higher organisms as potential hosts they will usually evolve at much slower rates than the viruses that infect them 14 at the same time these hosts are highly complex organism and will usually have far greater resources in terms of potential defense mechanisms and more generally in terms of genetic information to deal with the viral infections viral entry will commonly involve binding interactions with receptors on the host cell surface 15 16 most host cells will have a large number of cell surface receptors many of which are involved in essential functions such as detection of signaling molecules eg hormones or nutrients but which can be usurped by viruses as cell entrance mechanisms 17 18 functional redundancy among receptors is common for example nectins are cell entry receptors of herpes simplex virus hsv and are involved in cell adhesion functional redundancy within the nectin family and also other cellular adhesion proteins can compensate for particular nectins 19 also in humans there are 19 known chemokine receptors which activate the same chemokine signaling pathway but some of these have highly specific receptor binding ligands whereas others may bind multiple ligands 20 interestingly some viruses produce mimics of chemokine receptor binding ligands or may encode their own chemokines and chemokine receptors 21 for example ccr5 and cxcr4 act as co-receptors for hiv-1 entry 22 and the respiratory syncytial virus rsv produces its own version of the chemokine cxc3 which binds to the host receptor cx3cri thus facilitating rsv infection 23while there are multiple mechanisms of infection and resistance across many levels virus entry into the host cell is the first and essential step that must succeed for a viral infection to proceed 15 16 thus preventing virus entry has been often been the preferred strategy for therapeutic development 15 24 25 on evolutionary timescales hosts can evade receptor-mediated viral entry in several ways including amino acid changes at the binding sites to inhibit protein interactions or by regulation of receptor gene expression several previous studies have provided evidence of evolutionary arms races at the level of virus-receptor protein interactions for example transferrin receptor-1 tfr1 is a key regulator of iron uptake in mammalian cells and is up-regulated when intracellular iron concentrations are low 17 however tfr1 is also used for cell entry by viruses such as the mouse mammary tumor virus mmtv and the machupo virus clear evidence of positive selection has been found both on the binding sites of tfr1 for mmtv and machupo virus and on the corresponding sites in the virus proteins that bind these 2629 mutations at these residues affect receptor-binding interactions and change virulence and host susceptibility suggesting an ongoing evolutionary arms race regulation of host cell surface receptors can also be an effective defense strategy against virus entry 24 25 30 31 for example there appears to be significant variation across human bladder cells for mrna and protein expression levels of the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor car gene another virus-targeted receptor thus the t24 bladder cell line has very low car expression and is resistant to virus entry whereas rt4 cells have high car expression level and are highly susceptible to infection 32 thus regulatory changes affecting cell surface receptor levels are related to susceptibility to viral infection clearly however there may be a tradeoff between reduced receptor expression and the fitness gained by reduced infectivity which may explain why there are many more published examples of virus-receptor coevolution than for receptor expression evolution virus-receptor coevolution is also easier to study so ascertainment bias may also be a factorthus hosts may adopt different resistance mechanisms at different system levels eg receptor binding vs regulation however little previous research has focused on how these different levels of defense mechanisms may evolve in the context of host-pathogen co-evolution computational models such as the gene regulatory network evolution model also known as the wagner model that combine a complex genotype-phenotype mapping describing a gene regulatory network with evolutionary dynamics have previously been used to address a range of questions concerned with evolution of biological complexity 33 34 in previous studies the gene regulatory network evolution model has been extended to account for different system levels including transcription factor tf-dna binding interactions 35 and protein-protein interactions ppi 36 at the microscopic level or between two different populations 10 at the macroscopic level these previous studies 10 36 showed how robustness and evolvability can evolve to be distributed across different system levels depending on the model conditions here we integrate protein-protein interactions virus-receptor binding and gene regulatory networks which control receptor expression in the context of an evolutionary model that represents both host and pathogen populationsviral proteins commonly evolve to mimic receptor binding sites in order to enter host cells through cell surface receptors 21 2629 we introduce a model where the host receptor and the corresponding viral protein are represented as linear sequences and binding is quantified by a similarity score under the assumption that a close match corresponds to better binding and a higher probability of viral entry hosts can evolve to block viral entry either via binding site mismatches or by regulatory changes in receptor protein expression we further investigate how hosts evolve resistance to different types of viruses specialists that target a single receptor vs generalists that target many receptors we consider how the balance between receptor binding and regulation evolves in the context of host-pathogen co-evolution and the need for virus to enter the host cell and the host to block virus entry more generally we consider what evolutionary conditions might drive a shift from protein-protein interaction towards gene regulation and thus increased biological complexity a key question in the field of evolutionary biology 37 38 furthermore because we specifically consider host-pathogen coevolution our study begins to address how complex immune systems may have evolvedthe individual gene regulatory network grn structure and gene expression dynamics largely follows the original gene regulatory network evolution model 3941 with 3 primary differences i host individuals are represented by a grn together with a set of receptor binding site sequences ii populations follow the dynamics of an sis model and iii the selection pressure on

since receptor-virus protein binding enables virus entry and determines whether the infection succeeds the viruss ability to target multiple receptors and hosts ability to escape virus protein binding will have a significant impact on host resistance and viral pathogenicity hence we measured the number of targeted receptors across a variety of different conditions we next show how the number of targeted receptors can change depending on the receptor binding complexity protein sequence length l the number of required expressed receptors n

d as each simulation proceeded we measured the frequency with which multiple receptors are targeted simultaneously and also used the gini coefficient to measure the unevenness in the distribution of targeted receptors among the newly infected hosts throughout the simulation see methods thus for example when the frequency of multi-receptor matching is low this indicates that mostly a single receptor is being targeted by the virus however this does not guarantee that the virus population targets the same specific receptor or whether different subpopulations are targeting distinct receptors in this case when the gini coefficient of targeted receptors is high this indicates that all viruses target a common receptor and when the gini coefficient is low this implies that the matched receptor for each host is different and that viruses have diversified into subpopulations by targeting different receptorswhen binding complexity l is low viruses can target different receptors by means of a few amino acid mutations whereas when receptor binding complexity is high targeting multiple receptors is more difficult since the different receptors are likely separated by more mutations hence as shown in fig 3 when l is short multiple receptors are often targeted simultaneously and the frequency of each receptor being targeted is not highly variable low gini coefficient considering this more permissive receptor binding lower 
seqm increases the chances for multiple receptor targeting when l is short additional file 5 figure s4 c d on the other hand when binding complexity is high a single receptor is usually targeted and the gini coefficient is close to 1 indicating there are usually one or two dominant targeted receptors fig 3 furthermore in this case reducing the receptor binding threshold does not help viruses target multiple receptors additional file 5 figure s4 c d these results indicate that for complex receptor binding one or two receptors are targeted for virus entry and that there is no switch from one targeted receptor to another fig 3 based on this observation as expression of more distinct receptors is required higher n
er multiple receptors can be targeted and at the same time the gini coefficient decreases only when receptor binding complexity is low short l on the other hand when receptor binding is complex long l increasing n
er does not allow more receptors to be targeted by viruses additional file 5 figure s4 a b hence the number of required expressed receptors only impacts the strategy of the virus when the receptor binding is less complex short l interestingly the survival rate of offspring from infected parents also affects how the viruses target receptors as we explained in the previous section a low survival rate from infected parents k
i causes the host population to become sick the mean host population size is less than the initial population and the population is composed of more infected hosts than healthy hosts and thus the population size decays consequently as shown in fig 6d e and f we observe that variation within the host population decreases suggesting that viruses will need to specialize on binding to specific receptors additional file 5 figure s4 e f specific receptor targeting as a consequence of high disease related death rate 
d arises for the same reason as for low k
i additional file 5 figure s4 g h we tested the effect of diversity in the initial virus population on the number of targeted host proteins we compared a case with a highly diverse initial virus population to the default case of two initial viruses thus given an initial population of 15 distinct founder viruses each three viruses were chosen to bind a distinct host receptor with l  30

r  5 we could not find a significant difference from the 2 founder case here the frequency of multi-receptor targeting was 016  014 and unevenness of targeting receptors gini coefficient was 070  008 in sum receptor binding complexity l affects viruses by determining the variety of targetable receptors although this also is dependent on parameters such as n
er and 
seqm also indirect causality between host population diversity and parameters k
i and 
d has an influence on the specificity of targetable receptors so far we considered how viruses behave and choose infection strategies for different conditions we next explore how hosts react to virus infection strategies differently depending on the various environments
hosts can adopt two different resistance strategies in the model 1 gene regulatory network rewiring to switch a targeted receptor off and 2 protein binding site changes to block protein binding to a targetable receptor here we consider how hosts balance the usage of these two strategies and what conditions determine their relative preference at each time step the most frequently targeted receptor is identified among the set of newly infected hosts and from here we measure how often successful resistance events use network rewiring to shut down the most targetable receptor rather than protein sequence changes we proceed by counting the fraction of hosts who resisted successfully and that do not express the most frequently targeted receptor if there are multiple equally frequent most targeted receptors we use the mean frequency across those receptors the fraction of resisted hosts using network rewiring was measured at every time point we then accumulated these measurements over all time points throughout the simulation and if the overall use of network rewiring resistance was higher than protein level resistance we counted the simulation as preferential to rewiring we subsequently measured the fraction of simulations for which this occurred to quantify the relative use of rewiring across many simulations using this measure we find that grn rewiring is preferentially used as protein binding complexity increases fig 4 this outcome relates to the number of targeted receptors since when protein binding is more complex the virus most often targets a single receptor and therefore down-regulating the targetable receptor is usually an effective strategy conversely when protein binding is low complexity viruses are able to enter the host cell by binding multiple receptors and therefore rewiring is a less effective host strategy for resistance as the host protein mutation rate 
hp decreases hosts also use grn rewiring more often due to the reduced ability to catch up with the relatively fast-evolving virus proteins fig 4 as we increase the number of receptors that need to be expressed n
er then combinatorially there are fewer possible phenotypes for a given number of required receptors and viruses have more chances to bind to the different receptors so that the frequency of resistance using grn rewiring decreases additional file 6 figure s5 a reducing the protein matching threshold also favors the protein interaction level additional file 6 figure s5 b lastly at low survival rate k
i from infected parents and at high disease related death rate 
d viruses tend to target more specific receptors which is due to population size decay and low population diversity additional file 5 figure s4 e  h in fact as shown in additional file 7 figure s6 g i the potential for resistance which will be explained in the following paragraph via network rewiring increases however the small population size and low variation do not allow this potential to be realized this explains the apparently contradictory result of additional file 6 figure s5 c d where the observed as opposed to potential number of resistance events occurring via grn decreases when k
i is low but also when 
d is high hence unlike with l n
er and 
seqm we observed that low k
i and high 
d did not promote resistance via network rewiring additional file 6 figure s5 c d in sum hosts choose a resistance mechanism depending on the virus infection strategy and their defense ability relative to viruses how fast they react to the fast evolving viruses in the next section we consider the temporal dynamics of hosts with respect to regulatory network and receptor protein binding evolution
in the previous section we showed that hosts determine the resistance strategy between grn rewiring and protein binding site mutation depending on factors such as binding site complexity and mutation rate relative to that of the virus we now consider the evolution of the potential within the population to resist future virus contact events for each virus in the infected group we selected all susceptible hosts in the population that can be potentially infected by that virus and measure how efficiently each host can avoid infection via a random mutation either in its grn or in protein binding sites every regulatory interaction in the grn was mutated multiple times and we then measured how often it switched to becoming resistant as a consequence of these network perturbations similarly for each matched receptor we mutate the receptor using the host protein mutation rate at each site as would occur during the simulation and measured the average fraction of such perturbations that caused a switch to resistance the reason for using the same protein mutation rate that is used within the simulation rather than a single random amino acid mutation for the perturbation is that the impact of a single site amino acid mutation differs depending on the protein binding site length l for example when l is long a chance of switching from infectious to resistible is very low whereas when l is short a host can easily switch from infectious to resistiblefor resistance acquired via regulatory rewiring the ability to resist increases only when the protein complexity is high fig 5 a blue and green lines while it does not increase when the protein binding complexity is low red line it is plausible that when the protein binding complexity is low since network rewiring is not a good resistance strategy fig 4 due to multiple receptor binding site matches by viruses fig 3 it is unnecessary for individuals to evolve network rewiring potential and for this reason few perturbations are expected to change receptor gene expression to switch the targetable receptor off in contrast when the protein binding complexity is high so that the targeted receptor is specialized to one receptor fig 3 and switching targetable receptor off by network rewiring is adopted by hosts fig 4 hosts evolve the potential to resist by network rewiring in contrast for resistance via protein mutations we observed that under all conditions hosts rapidly evolve the ability to acquire resistance via protein binding site changes fig 5b and additional file 7 figure s6 because the protein binding site mutations can directly affect virus protein binding
we also observed that there is an apparent tradeoff in that as the resistance ability via rewiring increases fig 5a with receptor binding complexity the ability to resist using binding site mutations decreases compare order of curves in fig 5a vs fig 5b the complexity of the protein-protein interaction appears therefore to be an important factor driving the transition toward resistance using regulation and thus leading to higher grn complexity as expected when the protein mutation rate is low hosts will use grn rewiring more for resistance as a consequence of the limited capacity for protein mutations to coevolve with the viruses additional file 7 figure s6 a b the ability to resist using network rewiring also depends on the number of required expressed receptors n
er as more receptors are required to be expressed n
er viruses have a greater probability of targeting more than one receptor hence as shown above in additional file 6 figure s5 a the fraction of simulations where grn rewiring is used in preference to protein mutation decreases for higher values of n
er however for the same reason hosts are under pressure to evolve the ability to resist using network rewiring more when more receptors are required to be expressed additional file 7 figure s6 c d in the additional file 5 figure s4 c d in higher matching threshold 
seqm condition viruses are not able to target multiple receptors and the fraction of simulations where grn rewiring is preferentially used also increases additional file 6 figure s5 b consequently high 
seqm results in evolution of the potential to resist infection using grn additional file 7 figure s6 e f a lower survival rate from infected parents induces viruses to target specific receptors additional file 5 figure s4 e f therefore for such viruses hosts are evolved to increase the ability to resist using grn rewiring to shut down the targetable receptor additional file 7 figure s6 g hso far we explored various conditions that can promote the evolution of the ability to resist using grn rewiring interestingly receptor binding complexity balances the usages of grn rewiring vs amino acid mutations for resistance resistance via protein binding site mutation is much higher than that using network rewiring under all conditions this may explain why receptor binding site mutations have been reported often for virus entry defense mechanisms in contrast to resistance via regulatory changesin many previous studies it has been shown that antagonistic coevolution between host and pathogen populations correlates with increased genetic diversity 13 45 we checked that the diversity of the regulatory network the phenotype and the protein sequence all increase throughout the coevolution phase additional file 8 figure s7 to quantify diversity we used the margalef index 46 an ecological measure of biodiversity that takes into account the expected increase in species sampled as a consequence of increased sample size documentclass12ptminimal

we showed that regulatory changes can be used to suppress expression of cell surface receptor genes leading to a blocking of virus entry changes in the expression of virally-targeted receptors has been shown to block virus transmission experimentally for example in both dengue virus denv 25 and hepatitis c virus hcv 24 sirnas can be used to eliminate cell surface receptors and suppress virus entry and infection at the same time specific receptors can be intentionally expressed in the context of tumor gene therapy for example allowing adenovirus vectors to be used 31 32 to deliver apoptosis-activating genes to kill tumor cellstwo mechanisms of resistance were addressed in our model rewiring of gene regulatory networks and receptor binding site mutations the balance in usage between these two mechanisms depends on various conditions as the protein-protein interaction at the cell surface increases in complexity in our model represented by the binding site length viruses tend to target a specific receptor and hosts preferentially use network rewiring more often than receptor amino acid changes in contrast when the receptor binding site has lower complexity viruses are able to enter via multiple receptors and hosts evolve receptor amino acid changes to escape viral protein binding one can ask why is it that in nature examples of resistance via receptor amino acid mutations appear to be more common than network rewiring in the examples of dengue virus denv and hepatitis c virus hcv resistance through experimentally-induced receptor down-regulation it was shown that since there several alternative receptors expressed on the cell surface that viruses can use to enter host cells multiple inhibitory sirnas for different receptors worked better than a single sirna for one receptor although both studies showed that it was difficult to block infection completely 24 thus for example hcv can enter human liver cells via several cell surface receptors including cd81 tetraspanin claudin1cldn1 low density lipoprotein receptor receptor ldlr and scavenger receptor class b type 1 sr-b1 in our model when receptor binding has low complexity multiple receptors are targeted by viruses and receptor amino acid mutations are used preferentially over network rewiring given this observation the capability of viruses to use alternative receptors for host cell entry is a plausible explanation of why resistance using network rewiring changes is difficult in practice another possible reason for more frequent protein level resistance could be related to the level of functional redundancy among receptors higher n
er indicates less functional redundancy among receptors and we found that protein level resistance was favored for higher n
er additional file 6 figure s5a although functional redundancy is often observed in receptors such as nectin and chemokine receptors as described in introduction it is plausible that viruses evolve to target receptors whose absence cannot be compensated for so that hosts have to express all or nearly all required receptors for their normal function which makes it difficult to use network level resistancein order to investigate the importance of including the complex grn for controlling receptor gene expression we compared our model with one that did not contain gene regulatory interactions for receptor coding genes we designed this model by using a diagonal matrix regulatory network both for tf genes and for the receptor coding genes complex gene regulation by tfs were removed by having a diagonal matrix with 1 s for the regulatory gene network to satisfy the minimum number of required expressed receptors n
ern
r  35 we set the initial density of non-zeros on the diagonal for the receptor coding genes with probability 07 here mutations can occur only on the diagonal of receptor coding genes and no regulation from other genes is possible compared to this model the benefit of having a complex grn is that the network is capable of evolving increased potential for resistance using network rewiring as shown in fig 5a for complex protein binding long l as an example here in the case of complex protein binding where a specific receptor is targeted it is not possible for the potential for resistance to change because there is only a single entry on the diagonal which can change the expression of the targeted receptor we compared the preference for grn level resistance between these two models we found that the preference of grn rewiring decreased for the model without gene regulatory interactions additional file 9 figure s8a furthermore in order to express at least n
er receptors for the normal host cell function down-regulating a receptor gene for resistance can be deleterious and therefore hosts need to be able to change the expression of multiple receptors simultaneously in particular to compensate for receptor down-regulation we found that the systems with complex grns evolve the ability to switch the expression of multiple receptors additional file 9 figure s8b and methods whereas without the grns multiple receptor expression change is impossible given a single mutationalthough defending from infection at the level of virus entry would appear to be an effective resistance mechanism the host evolution rate is usually too slow relative to most virus populations and furthermore viruses are often capable of entering host cells via interaction with multiple receptors for these reasons host strategies may have evolved preferentially to allow viruses to enter cells but to focus defense mechanisms to the post-entry stage by evolving innate and adaptive immune systems for example a previous study of north american house finches showed rewiring of gene regulatory networks to up-regulate immune related genes in a relatively short timespan of just 12 years 7in addition to network rewiring and receptor amino acid mutations mutations causing premature stop codons can be used by hosts to block virus entry ccr5 cc-chemokine receptor-5 is a co-receptor for hiv entry that facilitates virus entry a ccr5 allele carrying a 32-bp deletion ccr532 in the open reading frame generates a premature stop codon leading to an inactive receptor protein 47 48 homozygous ccr532ccr532 carriers show high immunity to hiv infection and heterozygous wtccr532 carriers show partial resistance to hiv cell entry or delayed progression of the disease a similar example is an allele of the tvbr receptor involving a 4-bp insertion which contains a stop codon resulting in protection against avian sarcoma and leukosis virus aslv entry in chicken 49 of note is that even though these stop codon-containing alleles can block virus entry they work effectively only in homozygous form in contrast to alleles encoding regulatory repression which may be effective in single copy formentry to the cell is the first step in all virus infections evolving barriers to infection at the level of entry to the host cell can become an effective resistance mechanism although many examples of defense mechanisms have been reported that are based on disruption to cell surface receptor binding sites due to copy number variation and mutations producing stop codons have been reported examples of resistance by gene regulatory changes in receptor expression levels are less commonly observed we built a host-virus coevolution model where hosts are represented using both receptor amino acid sequences and gene regulatory networks grns that control expression of the cell surface receptor genes we explored a range of evolutionary conditions that might determine the balance of host resistance mechanisms at the grn level compared to protein interaction level we observed that the complexity or length of the receptor binding site l is one of the key factors that have a significant impact on both the infection strategy of the virus and resistance mechanism of the host when l is short viruses evolved to be generalists and target multiple receptors for cell entry in this case hosts evolve to a counter-strategy that uses binding site mutations to defend against virus protein binding in contrast when l is long viruses evolve to be specialists and focus on targeting one particular receptor whereas hosts evolve a counter strategy at the network level that uses regulatory changes to turn off the expression of the targeted receptor considering examples of virus entry such as hepatitis c virus where viruses can make use of multiple receptors for entry to the cell it is plausible that viruses predominantly evolve low complexity receptor binding and that in these cases hosts evolve to use protein binding level resistance mechanisms rather than grn level mechanismsin todays atmosphere of emerging infectious diseases and the effect global warming will have on both vectors ie fliesnichols 2005 and microbial pathogens researchers clinicians and physicians must be aware of how these pathogens are obtained from the environment how they remainpersist ma and leulier 2018 obadia et al 2017 within the vectorhost how they are transmitted to either our food products our foods or to various hosts and finally how they might affect various tissues or organs of the host historically and even recently most pathogen research concerning adult dipterans has focused on the midgut lehane and billingsley 1996 and hindgut christofi and apidianakis 2013 ignoring the foregut at the same time some authors junqueira et al 2017 tomberlin et al 2017 present reviews and papers on the association between flies and their bacterial interactions but focus mainly on identifying the microbes found in the guts of field collected flies with no reference as to where the microbes might be within the guts ie foregut midgut or hindgut it is important to know this because one should be able to identify whether the fly species in question is an oral versus a faecal vector and this might impact preventative control strategies for a general review of the digestive system of drosophila melanogaster with some emphasis on the crop and how this system relates to gut microbiota immunity and interorgan signalling one is directed to the paper by miguel-aliaga et al 2018this present review briefly mentions the legs and proboscis of adult flies as they are related to mechanical transmission of microbes the review is mainly concerned with the foregut and its associated structures which include the dorsal oesophageal bulb the postertior part of the foregut known as the proventriculus but especially focuses on the importance of the ventral diverticulated crop various aspects of the crop as the first internal organ the microbes encounter when a fly eats how it functions or is regulated and its involvement in pathogenmicrobe storage or transmission are discussedat the same time as research focuses on pathogen involvement of the foregut numerous laboratories are examining the flymicrobe relationship for information that will ultimately help researchers better understand vector competence and microbial virulence factors not all microbes imbibed by a fly are involved in a symbiotic relationship but those that are certainly are part of nutritional mutualism between the two ma and leulier 2018 this review will also present current research as it relates to nutritional mutualism between the fly and its microbial associates research into nutritional mutualism will be discussed and should provide information that will help those studying pathogenic relationships between the fly and microbethe diptera comprise about 20 of all insect diversity yeates and wiegmann 2005 and as a consequence the game of evolution has produced very interesting survival strategies for this important order the morphological and anatomical structures of adult dipterans ie legs wings mouthparts and numerous setae covering the entire body provide perfect sites for the acquisition tenacity or adhesion to the microbes and transmission of bacteria viruses and fungi by the vector adult flies have many structures that evolved and are involved in the carriage of microbes viruses and fungi from one site to another which includes the proboscis and legs barro et al 2006 tan et al 1997 the pads of the pulvilli are located between the tarsal claws on the legs they contain setae that can serve as sites for microbial attachment and they could facilitate both survival and transfer to another site by the hitchhikers sukontason et al 2006 cayol et al 1994 showed that spores of the fungus rhizopus stolonifera syn rhizopus nigricans ehrenb causing decay rot of post-harvested fruit were trapped by the hairs on the legs of ceratitis capitata wiedemann some adult flies especially fruit flies having dorsal pouches or oesophageal diverticulated bulbs located in the foregut house beneficial bacteria flies possessing a sponging sucking mouthpart have a labellum that evolved from the two labial lobes which became modified for taking up fluids and these dipterans have been shown to be vectors of various pathogens or beneficial microbes to both plants and animals these cited studies usually focused on the presence of pathogens either on the surface of the body ie mechanical transmission brits et al 2016 or within the digestive tract of the fly and they discuss how microbes might be transferred from the uptake source to a host food source an example of this is the work of machota et al 2013 who examined the external body parts of adult anastrepha fraterculus wiedemann and showed that they contained various fungi causing rot of bunches of grapes most reports are concerned with special structures of the fly that house the symbionts or the presence of the pathogen within the fly midgut which is the site of nutrient digestion and absorption into the hemolymph other than just reporting that microbes viruses and fungi were found on the proboscis or in the midgut few reports have focused on the role the mouthparts oesophageal bulb or the crop in the various fly microbe virus fungi associations these are front-end structures that initially contact or collide with various microbes prior to entering the midgut and eventually the hindgut and hemolymph quite often these front-end collisions can result in microbe initiated cases of food and animal disease outbreaks which could cause serious gastrointestinal problems in humans and domestic animals for some dipterans this front-end association with microbes can also be beneficial to those insects where a symbiotic association has been demonstratedin this review pathogensnot only those that are vectored by an adult dipteran and causing problems for the plant and animal host but also pathogens that affect the adult fly will be considered throughout the text the term microbes or microorganisms will often be used to collectively include bacteria viruses and fungi here i have also attempted to bring attention to the importance of these three important front-end structures ie legs the mouthparts oesophageal bulb the crop and the proventriculus of the fly in various microbe relationships these structures are shown in the following diagram
as discussed in miller and spoolman 2014 microbes are everywhere as well as are flies the ability of dipterans to fly inevitably puts them into direct contact with numerous habitats all of which contain their own suite of microbes eg dung fruits other animals and the phyllosphereeg that microenvironment where microbes inhabit plants blakeman 1981 the phyllosphere is where most adult dipterans spend more time landing walking resting and feeding on various food substances present on the phyllosphere than elsewhere this was aptly shown for the screwworm cochliomyia hominivorax coquerel by thomas 1991 who reported that 418 of the flys time budget was spent on grooming walking and feeding ie all of which would have put them in contact with numerous microbes and while grooming would have spread them over the body considerable observations have been made of adult dipterans with their proboscis extended presumably feeding on something but the naked eye sees nothing what they were probably doing is salivating and gleaning or grazing on the microbes lindow and brandl 2003 or other substances ie dried honeydew bird droppings aluja et al 1989 present on the phyllosphere this has been substantiated by yee 2008 who stated grazing a behaviour in which the mouthparts rapidly move up and down and touch plant surfaces without discrete substances visible to the human eye was seen more frequently in flies sic rhagoletis indifferens curran on leaves than on fruit for some tropical adult fruit flies bacteria may be the natural source of food drew et al 1983 thus there is strong evidence that some adult dipterans ie especially tephritids drew and yuval 2000 and possibly many other flies not reported feed by grazing on the plentiful supply of bacteria and fungi present on plant surfaces dickinson 1976 lindow and brandl 2003 sacchetti et al 2008 there are many other substances on the surface of plants that are not so obvious to the human eye rthay 1883 classified 135 insects visiting the tiny pycnidia of various rust fungi and reported that of the insects visiting to feed on their sugary exudates 474 were adult flies what has not been reported in most of these cases is whether ingested material enters the crop oesophageal bulb andor the midgut also i will later provide an answer to the question do microbes ever get lodged into and remain within the pseudotracheal furrows of the labellummany dipterans are able to abrade the plant surface using their labellar prestomal teeth or other structures such as labellar hooks on the tip of the proboscis fig 1
 as rutnen 1961 noted the phyllosphere is an ecologically neglected milieu and one that needs further investigation when it comes to dipteran feeding and vectoring potential i am unaware of any studies that take flies seemingly feeding on nothing and examining the crop or oesophageal bulb for ingested microbes or other materials the only paper that appears to examine the phyllosphere for microbes is that of zhang et al 2010 where they found a novel mosquitocide of bacillus thuringiensis strain llp29 isolated from the phylloplane of magnolia denudata desrwithout a doubt several outbreaks of human enteric pathogens as well as plant diseases have occurred and often have been associated with flies the main questions in all of these reports are where did the microbes originate and can they be transmitted from the point of origin to a human or another organism or substrate modern agriculture especially organic farming often uses animal manure as an additive for various types of vegetables being grown several studies have been conducted to test whether various enteric pathogens can survive andor gain entrance into various leafy vegetables lim et al 2014 these studies mainly focus on whether the pathogens can gain entrance into the plant and also examine their survival times when animal manures are applied using different application methods it goes without saying where there is animal manure or rotting plant material there will be flies and also microbes that can be transmitted to plant food tissue solomon et al 2002 it has been shown that many fly species are able to transmit various human food pathogens barreiro et al 2013 greenberg 1973 as well as plant pathogens what has not been done however is to prepare a comprehensive treatment of the involvement of the mouthparts the dorsal oesophageal bulb the foregut diverticulated crop and the proventriculus as sites involved in microbial acquisition adherence transmission and release onto or into a new host or food source since so many reports involving microbes and flies focus on the midgut lehane and billingsley 1996 and some on the hindgut it was decided to give special attention in this review to the foregut and mouthparts this is the main objective of this reviewpseudotracheae figs 1 and 2 are special grooved structures formed by chitinous rings resembling tracheae ie thus the name on the surface of the labellum of most adult dipterans where they act as channels delivering the diet to and emptying it into the prestomium or oral opening fig 1 pseudotrachea have highly modified and variable ring tips which are associated with type of diet elzinga and broce 1986 it has been reported by zaitzev 1983 for the bombyliidae that there are two types of pseudotracheae ie dentaterounded or flattened tips figs 1 and 3 which can be closed by increasing the hemolymph pressure and spinoseelongated and pointed tips and most common in the syrphidae which remain rigid and cannot be closed the latter see fig 2 are probably used for scrapping plant materials to obtain nutritious fluids pseudotrachea may function as sieves or filtering devices in labellar stages iiiv of the fly as described early by graham-smith 1930 pseudotracheae are reported to have three functions when closed they act as a filtering system to prevent large particles from entering into the pseudotracheal furrow or food canal sela et al 2005 thus they regulate the size of food particles which might include microbes that ultimately enter into the crop oesophageal bulb andor midgut thereby acting as canals delivering the liquid diet to the oral aperture in some adult dipterans the pseudotracheal tips are modified and can act as abrading or scrapping structures of the diet which is usually not liquid eg intact plant tissue bird droppings or dried honeydew fig 1 inset lastly some believe the pseudotracheae help deliver saliva uniformly over the labellar lobe or disk when feeding on non-liquid foods when feeding on liquids the internal pressure of the proboscis which is caused by air entering the air sacs of the proboscis causes the pseudotracheal canals to separate thus producing a larger space leading into the food furrow figs 13 kobayashi et al 1999 showed that escherichia coli can proliferate for up to 24 h after feeding within these food furrows in fact 3 days after feeding they reported the pseudotracheal canals became packed with an unknown thread-like material fig 3 kobayashi et al 1999 did not mention what this material was but based on other studies it looks like biofilm material fig 4 lee et al 2011 in their discussion kobayashi and others stated the labellum seems to provide an adequate environment for proliferation of ehec-o157 and other bacteria and proposed a new term bioenhanced transmission with reference to their study because it was more than simple mechanical transmission but involved proliferation of the bacteria in many of the examples that follow few studies have shown that microbes increase in number within the crop lumen if they do the term bioenhanced transmission would be appropriate thus regurgitation from the crop is not merely an example of mechanical transmission when feeding on non-liquid diets the pseudotracheal ridges are usually closer together and provide a filtering system it is this filtering-system arrangement that directly affects ingestion of microbes as shown in fig 5
 green fluorescent protein gfp-expressing e coli are seen lodged up against the pseudotracheal ridges of the adult mediterranean fruit fly and results using fluorescent microscopy only showed bacteria on this area of the labellum sela et al 2005 as one examines more closely the labellar lobes in the med fly the pseudotracheal rings become modified into spines interlocking and acting as a filter to allow only particle sizes 05 m or less in size to enter the digestive system fig 5 coronado-gonzalez et al 2008 sela et al 2005 also suggested the mouthparts may be the major vehicle involved in transmission of pathogens to fruit evidence has also been provided either using culturing techniques or microscopic images fig 5 inset that microbes can remain on the flys labellum thus examination of fly mouthparts of both non-blood feeders as described above and blood feeders like stomoxys calcitrans l de castro et al 2007 using culturing techniques has shown the mouthparts of flies have various structures aiding in transferring microbes from one source to another because s calcitrans is known as an interrupted feeder it has been reported to mechanically transmit via its mouthpart numerous types of microbes baldacchino et al 2013 de castro et al 2007 more information however is needed to show how long microbes can remain on the mouthparts and whether they are viable when transmitted to another host in addition it is important to remember that regurgitation from the fly crop continually supplies the lobes of the proboscis with fluids and microbes stored within the crop and once the mouthparts are contaminated the grooming behaviour of the fly can move the microbes to the legs wings and other body partsprestomal teeth fig 6 are chitinous rigid blade-like structures that are sometimes bifurcated at their tip and are believed to be formed from pseudotracheal rings they are located on the inner walls of the prestomium of some fly species not all fly species have them compare fig 1 which lacks them with fig 6 showing a fly with them the s fuscipennis fly in fig 1 however has labellar hooks which are different but are suggested to aid the fly in scrapping and abrading dry intact plant material or honeydew for nutrients stoffolano et al 2015 any fly having the ability to evert the labellar lobes from stage iv to vi position as defined by graham-smith 1930 possess prestomal teeth thus flies having sponging mouth parts and possessing prestomal teeth have been reported to transmit microbes by cutting open the protective tissue of the host thus exposing the inner tissues to pathogens thus infection it has long been known that prestomal teeth aid those species having them in the transmission of microbes to the now exposed host tissue they are feeding upon sukontason et al 2003 prestomal teeth have been shown in musca autumnalis de geer broce and elzinga 1984 kovacs sz et al 1990 to abrade living tissue eg eye of a cow which can open a wound to infection by various microbes eg infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis caused by the bacterium moraxella bovis hauduroy geden and stoffolano 1980what enters the digestive system of a fly is influenced by mouthpart structure elzinga and broce 1986 these authors also noted pseudotracheal diameter is an important trait reflecting what the diet of the adult is in nature flies such as tsetse glossina sp and horn flies haematoba irritans l feeding solely on blood have mouthparts for piercing blood vessels and directing the blood meal into the midgut as reported by friend and stoffolano 1991 but sometimes blood goes into the crop such a case is the horn fly where adults are obligatory blood feeders even though blood seldom goes to the crop olafson et al 2014 found a few gfp labelled salmonella enterica serovar montevideo within the crop lumen of the horn fly fig 7
there is little doubt the structure of the labellum and its associated parts aids flies in acquiring microorganisms that enter the digestive system which includes the crop or oesophageal bulb and yet these microbes can make up such an essential and large part of the fly diet this is especially true of the tephritidae mouthpart structure and deployment of the diet in fruit flies is discussed by coronado-gonzalez et al 2008 where some species such as c capitata have a labellar filtering mechanism figs 2 and 5 aiding in selecting out large particles and permitting the flies to ingest only liquids containing particles less than 05 m which includes sizes  05 m ie if the fly feeds on bacteria belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae thus mouthpart structure and the way the labellum is positioned regulates what enters the crop or oesophageal bulb and the rest of the digestive system blood feeders such as s calcitrans that require sugars put the sugar meal into the crop while blood goes directly into the midgut foster 1995 there are reports however of blood going into the crop in this species as sometimes is also reported for tsetse most non-blood feeders direct meals into the midgut if it is not full but once filled other ingested foods ie carbohydrates or proteinaceous nutrients go to the crop for storage stoffolano et al 1995 tang and ward 1998 a major misconception about the adult crop of non-blood feeding flies is that it is only for sugar storage which is not true once the midgut is full numerous non-blood feeding flies put various nutrients ie liquid dung decaying animal fluids as well as rotting plant fluids etc into the crop van geem and broce 1986the structure of the dorsal oesophageal bulb eb ie dorsal versus a ventral diverticulum see diagram and fig 8
 has been well studied in the adults of the apple maggot r pomonella walsh ratner and stoffolano 1984 and the olive fly bactrocera oleae gmelin capuzzo et al 2005 using histological techniques pseudomonas spp were found in the eb marchini et al 2002 the eb is found in both sexes appears to be unique to the tephritidae and throughout adult life the endosymbiotic bacterial density within the lumen increases and is greater than elsewhere in the gut based on ultrastructural evidence it suggests the eb also functions in fluid transport possibly aiding in maintaining a relatively constant environment for the microbes within the eb the production of a fibrous mass in r pomonella figs 9 and 10 appears to physically keep the symbiotic bacteria fig 8 within the lumen of the bulb these fibres are produced by eb intimal shedding fig 9 there was no evidence of bacteria being attached to these fibres in the apple maggot ratner and stoffolano 1984 this is unlike the report for the endosymbiont candidatus erwinia dacicola capuzzo within the oesophageal bulb of the olive fly b oleae where the authors reported bacteria were within a mass suggestive of a biofilm capuzzo et al 2005 estes et al 2009 a general review of the dorsal oesophageal bulb found in the foregut of fruit flies and their associated endosymbiotic bacteria is provided by mazzon et al 2012 in some studies there is evidence of the associated bacteria being found within the crop estes et al 2009 but this may be a temporary storage site and may act as a supply depot for bacterial movement into the eb when the fly regurgitates fruit fly adults are known to regurgitate or bubble as a way of eliminating water from the food aluja et al 2000 and it has been suggested regurgitation may also be a way to inoculate the fruit with the bacteria which could escape with the regurgitate hendrich et al 1992 later i will discuss another possibility where the crop is reported to house a lekking pheromone from the salivary glands and regurgitation is the mechanism for the males depositing it on the underside of leaves regurgitation is also the main mechanism by which sand flies expel leishmania pathogens to the host rogers et al 2004evidence that the proventriculus in drosophila and probably other fly species is of ectodermal origin and its formation involves the notch signalling pathway and cytoskeletal reorganization during the development of foregut-associated organs which would include the crop fuss et al 2004 later singh et al 2011 identified multipotent stem-cells at the foregutmidgut junction in the cardia and reported the daughter cells that migrated upward formed the anterior midgut while those cells that migrated downward formed the oesophagus and crop in their review of the digestive tract of adult d melanogaster lemaitre and miguel-aliaga 2013 define the proventriculus as being part of the foregut in the diagram provided earlier it is obvious that the foregut terminates within the bulbous donut-shaped structure that houses both the proventriculus and cardia the cardia is where the anterior midgut cells form an arrangement that is mushroom-like surrounds the foregut region and is termed the valvula cardiaca fig 19 of lehane and billingsley 1996 more will be said about this later when discussing that some authors report the microbes they are studying are located within the proventriculuscardia regionin addition to serving as a storage organ for various nutrients the ventral diverticulated crop of adult dipterans is an extremely important organ for storing or housing various pathogenic or beneficial microorganisms ingested when the fly feeds stoffolano and haselton 2013 the crop has been ignored as an important organ in flies but closer examination of the literature and recent research has shown it provides a vital internal and safe habitat for numerous microbes after all it is the first site for nutrient storage which also usually contains microbial hitchhikers with the meal thus one is naturally led to ask what role does the crop play in the hostmicrobial scenario before answering that question lets look at various aspects of the crop itselfthe ventral diverticulated crop is a unique structure separating the diptera from other insect orders it is composed of two lobes and a duct connecting the lobes to the foregut just anterior to the entrance of the proventriculus see diagram and figs 11 and 12
 this organ has historically been known only as a storage organ for nutrients difficult to find because they may be sparse or short-lived in nature a recent review has taken a fresh look at this organ and in addition to nutrient storage it also serves as a vessel for housing numerous microbes beneficial to the fly or pathogenic to humans domestic animals and plants stoffolano and haselton 2013 in addition the crop organ has been shown to play a major role in the regulation of feeding behaviour of adult flies dethier 1976 and a neural connection between the corpus cardiacumbrain and the crop has been demonstrated stoffolano et al 2010 cognigni et al 2011 lemaitre and miguel-aliaga 2013 fig 12 throughout the evolution of this important insect group ie the diptera the crop organ has taken on different roles that are behaviourally expressed but include the crop which has facilitated survivalevolution of the diptera some of these different roles in which the crop is involved are various behaviours that will be briefly discussed below however the main focus of this review is on the importance of the crop as it relates to flymicrobial associationsvery few detailed studies of the structure andor role of the diverticulated crop of different dipteran species have been published it is surprising because it is the first internal site for storage of nutrients along with microbes imbibed by the fly the cuticular lining of the crop duct and lobes is an extremely important structural layer and more will be said about this latter its impermeability has been known for a long time and consists of the epi- and endocuticlar layers figs 13 and 14
 this relatively isolated vessel provides for both nutrient storage and at the same time produces an ideal environmental site for microbial survival or presence without leakage of its contents into the hemolymph and any reverse movement from the hemolymph into the lumen of the crop lobes the crop produces an isolated environment for nutrients and microbes that have together gained entrance abbott 1945 moloo and kutuza 1970 here the microbes are isolated from the major insults of the midgut ie drastic ph changes and relatively high antimicrobial peptide amp production plus harsh ambient environmental conditions sibley et al 2008 stated the crop is lined with an epithelium which is not exactly correct what they meant to say is the epithelium produces the cuticular lining of both the crop duct and lobes and is separated from the lumen by the cuticle it is a well-known fact that the crop organ is lined with a cuticle a thin dense epicuticle and a light thicker endocuticle lining the entire foregut smith 1968 stoffolano et al 2010 fig 13 using tem to examine the crop of viral infected adult house fly lietze et al 2009 showed the virus was initially and mainly located within the lumen of the crop but one micrograph showed the virus was on the opposite side of the lumen ie hemolymph side somehow it appeared to be able to pass through the crops cuticular lining the authors were unable to explain this it is this impermeable cuticular barrier of the crop organ that makes it so important for the survival or destruction of certain pathogens and other microorganisms thus being within the crop lumen some of these microbes must be able to withstand the amps produced by the labellar and salivary glands ferrandon et al 1998the best known early papers on the muscles of the dipteran crop duct and lobes are those of thomson in phormia regina adults thomson 1975a showed that as the crop volume increased so did the muscle contractions of the lobes he developed a model for crop function based on the various pumps and sphincters also he suggested the muscles operated independently of nervous control and their contraction rates were based on stretch thomson 1975b fig 15
 it wasnt until stoffolano et al 2010 using a spider toxin specifically against stretch activated channels that the crop muscles of p regina were shown to be activated by stretch activated channels initially crop muscle function was based solely on mechanical properties of the muscles but later studies show the muscle contractions are modulated by various neuropeptides dromyosuppressinricher et al 2000 nichols 2003 myosuppressin in aedes aegypticalkins et al 2017 phote-hrth or phormia terraenovae robineau-desvoidy hypertrehalosemic hormonestoffolano et al 2014 and serotonin liscia et al 2012 liu et al 2011 using a serotonin antibody showed a serotonergic nerve going ventral and inside the crop duct nerve bundle ie for p regina fig 16 of adult s calcitrans but failed to investigate where it terminated with the exception of gough et al 2017 on drosophila suzukii few studies have reported where the nerves terminate on the crop of any fly species in p regina the crop duct nerve bundle fig 16 carries numerous neurons delivering several peptides to the crop recently it has been shown with adult anastrepha ludens loew that the crop nerve bundle also contains numerous dense core droplets suggestive of being neuropeptides and that these may also be involved in modulation of the crop muscles guilln et al 2019 later a discussion of the recent work on mechanisms regulating crop contraction and the relationship of the mosquitos crop to microbles will be providedtwo extensive papers demonstrate a tissue tropism effect of a pathogen ie one bacterial and the other viral on the adult drosophila crop in the first study it was shown that the pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa schroeter remained mainly within the crop lumen but somehow destroyed both the epithelial cells of the crop and also the muscular architecture of what appears to be the circular muscles of pump 4 in p regina figs 17 and 18
 sibley et al 2008 in another report mulcahy et al 2011 were the first to notice pathological effects of p aeruginosa on the crop of adult drosophila tissue destruction of the crop in this fly probably resulted from a pathogenic effect from an internal hemolymph direction because the crops cuticular lining should keep its contents separate from the hemolymph sibley et al 2008 suggested that death of the fly was probably due to a lack of normal digestive function if it is pump 4 muscles that are affected research has already shown in p regina that this pump is essential for pumping fluids out of the crop and into the midgut for digestion or out onto the proboscis during regurgitation such a pathological effect would surely affect the normal digestive and regurgitation function stoffolano et al 2014the second example is that of a rna virus ie drosophila c virus belonging to the dicistroviridae family which is a natural pathogen infecting adult drosophila chtarbanova et al 2014 one aspect of tissue tropism associated with this virus is the effect on the smooth muscles surrounding the crop lobes various techniques were applied to infected versus control flies showing that the crop of infected flies had reduced contractions the muscles associated with the crop lobes were impaired and electron microscopy showed distinct pathology compared to control flies in conclusion the authors state that continued studies on the drosophila and dcv virus model could ultimately aid in reducing arbovirus transmission in other flies to their vertebrate hosts structural evidence also exists on the viral effect on the muscles of the salivary glands of tsetse but the crop muscles were not examined guerra et al 2015 recently bil et al 2016 using immunohistochemical techniques for the p terraenovae hypertrehalosemic hormone phote-hrth of adult sarcophaga crassipalpis macquart showed receptors for this hormone were found in the fat body brain midgut and also located in the foregut specific region not reported the authors did not specifically designate the crop in their paper but probably receptors on the hemolymph side were on the muscles surrounding the crop thus the effect of a pathogen on crop functioning by resident pathogens within the crop lumen or within the hemolymph can act at various levels of crop function this aspect of crop research is an area in need of future investigations because crop malfunction by manipulating chemicals or viruses that modulate its function could ultimately lead to death of the fly as shown by gough et al 2017 for d suzukii and chtarbanova et al 2014 for d melanogasterblood feeding and non-blood feeding flies have different midgut designs blood feeding flies can rapidly increase the size of their midgut in order to store a huge blood meal an example is the greenhead tabanid tabanus nigrovittatus macquart which can take up to 35 l of blood into the midgut and 1450 l of sugar into the crop stoffolano 1983 non-blood feeders however cannot expand their midguts to any great extent and rely on the crop as their main extensible food storage organ a good example is the adult queen blowfly p regina which can take up to 18 l into the crop but only 2 l into the midgut stoffolano 1995 in the evolution of the diptera i believe the diverticulated crop of flies was initially designed for the storage of ephemeral nutrients difficult to obtain either because they were randomly available or when found they needed to be rapidly consumed because in nature they may be dissipated or consumed by others evolutionarily speaking in those early dipterans it is difficult to imagine that microbes were not included with their diet with the advent of domestic-community living by humans and the advent of agriculture a major source of nutrient ie blood from people and domestic animals now became available the majority of dipterans taking this blood feeding path however still relied on carbohydrates ie nectar andor honeydew stored within the crop these carbohydrates proved essential for maintenance flight and reproductive energetics downes and dahlem 1987 foster 1995 and they were put into the crop whereas the blood meal went to the midgut stoffolano 1983 because these nutrients often contained a considerable amount of water prior to efficient flight the adults had to unload water from both the crop storage tank and midgut storage meal blood feeders solved the problem of removing water in the blood meal by possessing a very efficient diuretic system where they urinated water very rapidly from the anus non-blood feeders however lacking such an efficient diuretic system removed water from the crop meal by evaporation via the process known as bubbling hendrich et al 1992 stoffolano et al 2008 photos exist of some blood feeding flies producing small clear droplets of fluid from the crop presumeably this crop regurgitation mechanism works for some blood feeders but must be further examined do male mosquitoes produce this crop regurgitation bubble to eliminate water from their nectar meals production of these bubbles not only serves as a way of getting rid of the water in the meal by surface evaporation but for some fly species the adults drop the bubble and later re-ingest it while for others bubbling can even serve as a nuptial gift aluja et al 2000 stoffolano and haselton 2013 a recent report gomes et al 2018 suggests that bubbling may also be involved in temperature regulation i suggest that only in the case where the need to eliminate water from the meal within the crop did this organ become involved with bubbling only later in dipteran evolution did the crop become involved in some of the other functions to be discussed these other functions ie nuptial gift giving lekking pheromone deposition etc should also require modification and re-wiring of the neural andor possibly adding more neurohormonal control or modulation over regurgitation the evolutionary impact of microbes in association with foregut structures in the diptera needs to be examined in various dipteran groups and may prove some of these are rather uniqueregurgitation by flies has been previously defined as the expulsion of food material from the crop thus regurgitation is different from vomiting because vomiting involves the muscles of the abdomen of mammals not insects forcefully pushing material from the stomach forward whereas regurgitation in flies only involves the foregut ie the crop and doesnt involve any reflex involving the abdomen in addition vomiting usually involves a reflex whereby the organism rapidly removes any noxious material from its stomach whereas regurgitation is not a process normally used to remove noxious materials from the crop because toxic materials are usually avoided by being sensed via the tarsal labellar andor pharyngeal gustatory neurons instead regurgitation is a normal behavioural and physiological process having evolved only in many dipteran species with some exceptions in the hymenoptera until two recent publications it was believed that regurgitation doesnt involve explusion of noxious foods using d melanogaster kang et al 2012 used gr66a-gal4 to express the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily a trpa1 member 1 ie both chemosensitive and thermosensitive isoforms in the trpa1 mutant background and then heated the flies to 32 c flies were starved with water and then satiated with water before heat activation the observed regurgitation would be simply explained by the fact that activation of some population of gr66a aversive neurons induced regurgitation based on the study it is not clear whether labellar tarsal or labral sense organ gr66a  neurons are responsible for this regurgitation response the other more recent paper by daz-fleischer et al 2019 however notes that when some species of fruit flies are fed polyols there is an increase in the percentage regurgitation which was usually followed by death the authors note that presumably death due to continuous regurgitation of fluids from the crop resulting in acute dehydration and death within 2472 h it is important to know in this study whether the polyols if just touched to the chemosensilla would invoke this response plus knowing whether the polyols made it to the foregutmidgut regions and contacted pharyngeal neurons what needs to be confirmed in both studies is whether any of the chemicals contacted the foregut pharyngeal sensilla located outside of the crop kang et al 2010 in an earlier paper looked at the proboscis extension response per reduction in response to electrophiles this study suggested that the per response decreased with repeated application to the labellum and the authors implicated a role for internal pharyngeal neurons based on presumed intake of the stimulus if so stimulation of these receptors might provide the input inducing regurgitation i make these points because the report by chen and dahanukar 2017 using molecular techniques showed that the pharyngeal v5 neuron in adult drosophila was responsible for a behavioural response to l-canavanine a chemical know to activate many bitter taste neurons and to elicit aversive behaviour in drosophila definitely more information elucidating the exact wiring of the receptors and their locations in adult flies needs to be provided before implying they are involved in crop function thus regurgitationthere are a few reports showing blood from the midgut or crop is involved in regurgitation but in most of these cases it is a pathological condition bryant et al 2010 baldacchino et al 2013 noted that stomoxys sometimes keep blood in their crop and this may serve as a friendly environment of pathogens during the next blood meal which they termed immediate transmission the pathogens could be expelled by regurgitation to another host allowing for inter-herd pathogen dissemination however the crops were never examined for microbial pathogens adult flies do not vomit to avoid confusion of terms focus in this review will be on crop emptyingstorage and where its contents eventually end up rather than reference to the overall general process of nutrient removal from the foregut ie which normally occurs via regurgitation two examples of regurgitation have been reported as the mechanism for the transfer of a pathogen from the fly crop to the eye of the host the first example has been suggested for musca domestica linnaeus passing chlamydia trachomatis busacca into the eye of another human during feeding forsey and darougar 1981 the other example is for adult face flies m autumnalis where the fly has been shown to obtain the pathogen and causative agent of infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis or pinkeye by feeding on the eye secretions of infected hosts and putting it into the crop this imbibed solution is then transmitted to another host eye via regurgitation while feeding glass and gerhardt 1983 a similar mode of transmission involves regurgitation of the pathogen from the sand fly to its host rogers et al 2004 doud and zurek 2012 reported not only was the crop of the house fly the main site of bacterial proliferation of enterococcus faecalis andrewes and horder but they suggested regurgitation of crop materials was the major process for contamination sasaki et al 2000 were one of the first groups to suggest that e coli 0157h7 was transmitted to food via regurgitation regurgitation also appears to be a normal behaviour of feeding in certain fruit flies aluja et al 2000 and this process has been shown or suggested to be involved in plant pathogen transmission flies often produce droplets or bubbles at the tip of the proboscis figs 19 and 20
 these droplets can be either re-ingested or dropped on various surfaces on which the fly may be feeding thus it has been demonstrated or suggested that regurgitation is the process whereby pathogens are picked up stored within the crop and then deposited onto either food de jesus et al 2004 or onto a new host graczyk et al 2001 it has also been suggested that house flies consuming e coli o157h7 added to cow manure regurgitate their crop contents ie manure and pathogen onto spinach where the pathogen may even multiply within the regurgitated droplet wasala et al 2013 fig 21 comparing regurgitation in four different fly species el-bassiony and stoffolano 2016 showed adult house flies regurgitated significantly more times than did the other three species all of which were larger this propensity to regurgitate in house fly may contribute to it being an excellent oral route vector of various pathogens rather than just an anal-route vector graham-smith 1930 and many others noted while feeding on dry substrates or foods flies regurgitate the crop contents rather than salivate thus the crop liquids which can include secretions from the salivarylabellar glands plus any nutrients ingested aid in liquefying the dry diet prior to sucking it up into the crop using crop fluids to dissolve dry foods makes evolutionary sense because it saves on the physiological cost of producing saliva certainly flies must conserve water coronado-gonzalez et al 2008 reported regurgitation of crop contents is mainly the way adult tephritidae feed while vijaysegaran et al 1997 showed for adult bactrocera not given water and now dehydrated were unable to ingest dry or semi-solid diets ordax et al 2015 demonstrated in the laboratory for adult medfly c capitata ie a polyphagous feeder as an adult when fed erwinia amylovora burrill one of the most important pathogens of apples and pears was able to harbour the pathogen for up to 8 days inside the digestive tract and 28 days on the wings and other body parts the authors did not mention that if the pathogen remained within the crop as they suggested and the fly bubbled or regurgitated its contents would cover the proboscis surface and could explain its longer presence of 28 days on other body parts which was spread by grooming they reported the pathogen was always present in the crop but they made no attempt to isolate it from the crop even though cayol et al 1994 showed that regurgitation of the fungus rhizopus stolonifera was mainly recovered by crop regurgitation one word of caution with respect to regurgitation is that nigg et al 2004 who demonstrated that when performing consumption studies on flies one has to consider the effect of regurgitation they reported that regurgitation resulted in a 100 overestimation of actual consumption when using the j-tube method for anastrepha suspensathe crop for certain species of diptera is important as a liquid storage tank and when its contents are dumped onto a dry diet they aid in its liquidification prior to sucking it back up into the crop future studies reporting on regurgitation in flies should clearly state and be specific where the material being studied or analysed came from and not to just use the generic terms foregut midgut gut or digestive tract they should also if possible report where the diet goes ie the midgut or crop or both when ingested adult house flies must regurgitate or salivate on solid food in order to feed because of this geden et al 2008 noted that regurgitation should be an important aspect in the transmission of the salivary gland hypertrophy virus to another fly using electron microscopy they showed the presence of what they believed to be virus particles within the crop fig 14 and on the mouthparts of infected flies fig 5 inset these viral particles on the mouthparts could result from continual crop regurgitation whose contents should also contain the flys own salivary secretions in their study lietze et al 2009 showed that the crop of flies fed on the virus along with a solute contained sufficient virions and that when crop contents were physically injected into a non-infected fly it was sufficient to cause symptomatic conditions
dethier 1976 provides a historical account of the research concerned with the various factors and controls regulating crop emptying at the time of his book research focused on what factors influenced crop emptying and the movement of its contents which were destined for digestion in the midgut how long it takes for the crop to normally empty greatly influences how long any pathogens or microbes remain within the crop this is important because the crop provides a safe haven for microbial survival prior to either their exposure to the insults of the midgut or external environment in order to evaluate the role of the crop and midgut of p regina in storing enough protein for egg development stoffolano et al 1995 showed that within a 4 h feeding period on homogenized liver females had stored enough protein in both their crop 184 l and midgut 22 l to produce fully matured eggs in just one feed by 26 h after feeding females had emptied 75 of the contents from both the crop and midgut most interesting was the protein concentration in the midgut increased with time and the authors suggested it was due to elimination of water from the crop contents by bubbling ie regurgitation other than the report by sibley et al 2008 almost nothing is known should there be any about the impact of microbes within the crop or midgut lumen on emptying or filling of the cropnon-haematophagous flies solved the problem of excessive water in the crop by a behaviouralphysiological process known as bubbling or droplet formation stoffolano and haselton 2013 this involves moving fluids out of the crop bypassing the midgut and pumping the fluids out of the oral opening and onto the tip of the proboscis as a droplet here the fly can retain the droplet for various periods of time while letting the water evaporate and then reingesting the droplet but not dropping it or sharing it with another fly currently the suggested function for bubbling or droplet formation and retention is to get rid of excessive water from the crop contents hendrich et al 1992 this excessive water in the diet and within the fly when ingested reduces flight efficiency and can also prevent extreme osmotic problems within the midgut nicholson 1998 an interesting article is that of wckers 2000 who states that as plant sap goes through the digestive tract of the ingesting plant feeding sap insect the osmotic effect of the sugars are modified and reduced with respect to osmotic effect it would be informative to determine if this bubbling process also facilitates concentration of microbes by changing the water content of the diet also whether it is involved in adding more amps from the salivary and labellar glands to the diet by concentrating them needs to be determined another aspect worthy of future research is to examine the droplets for salivary and labellar gland amps thus substantiating schleins original observation that the crop of sand flies is a sterilization organ schlein et al 1986 which will be discussed latermost dipterans relying on feeding on any exposed substrate whether it is the skin of an animal or plant surface have to deal with ingesting not only beneficial but pathogenic microorganisms often these ingested nutrients along with the associated microorganisms are directed to the crop where either the flys own amps or bacteriocins riley and chavan 2007 from symbiotic or commensal bacteria are involved in controlling pathogens from reaching sufficient levels to cause pathogenesis to the fly this crop cleansing by amps from the salivary or labellar glands may also serve a function in reducing the numbers and types of pathogens the midgut has to deal with we know almost nothing about the role of amps and other substances from the salivary and labellar glands within the crop lumen on microbial recognition and destruction as reviewed by kuraishi et al 2013 for the midgut of drosophila how effective are these substances within the crop lumen or is most of the pathogenic cleansing left to the midgut coronado-gonzalez et al 2008 reported most adult tephritidae feed by regurgitating crop contents rather than just using their own salivary secretions when feeding on dried nutrients such as bird droppings or honeydew many of these tephritids also use their crop contents to establish trap lines by regurgitating droplets in a line fig 22
 once deposited the individual producing them revisits the droplets and re-ingest them aluja et al 1993 this trap-line feeding process is also believed to be another way of getting rid of excessive water in the diet which was within the crop lumen thus trap-lining also possibly concentrates the microbes originally present within the crop by letting water evaporate from the drops before reingesting them whether the microbes multiply within the deposited droplet and what action might the flys own amps have within the dropped droplet on any microbes remains to be demonstrated how individuals involved in this type of trap-lining behaviour control destruction of pathogenic bacterial fungal or viral levels within the droplets prior to reingesting them has not been investigated multiplication of e coli o157h7 in a regurgitated droplet by adult house flies on spinach has been demonstrated wasala et al 2013numerous dipterans in various families have evolved the behaviour of forming a droplet from fluids found within the crop that are either kept on the tip of the proboscis and shared directly with a female during mating trophallaxis fig 23 or dropped in front of her as a nuptial gift aluja et al 1993 paiero and marshall 2014 stoffolano and haselton 2013 it is generally believed these droplets come from crop emptying and may represent a nuptial gift to the female aluja et al 1993 stoffolano and haselton 2013 at present no known studies have been reported to examine the contents of the shared droplet andor whether its contents aid in female fitness knowing adult flies ingest both beneficial and pathogenic microorganisms while feeding one needs to explore the role of the crop and its contents as a sterilization organ nayduch et al 2013 reported finding the antimicrobial peptide defensin within the crop of adult house flies fed staphylococcus aureus rosenbach the presence of defensive molecules against various microbes within the crop needs further research more studies need to focus on how the crop serves as an organ facilitating the destruction andor limitation of pathogenic microorganisms from establishing and multiplying to damaging levels but not destroying beneficial microbes does the male transfer only beneficial microorganisms to the female freidberg 1982 for staphylococcus aureus suggested material from the male was transferred to the female during the labellum to labellum contact and this trophallaxis behaviour might also involve the transfer of symbiotic microorganisms this needs to be confirmed in those dipterans that engage in nuptial gift giving since amp synthesis is generally expensive does the male also include amps and other defensive molecules produced in his labellar andor salivary glands with his droplet gift to the femaleconsiderable literature exists demonstrating flies can mechanically transmit numerous pathogens but caution must be taken to assure that regurgitation hasnt also occurred the biological modes of pathogen transmission involve the oral-route the anal-route or both in this review mainly the oral route has been discussed because it directly involves the crop organ or the oesophageal bulb the term bioenhanced transmission was proposed by kobayashi et al 1999 because for some pathogens there is evidence that there is an increase in microbial numbers within the digestive tract especially the crop bioenhanced transmission was reported for e faecalis and acetobacter thailandicus by the house fly and the crop was reported as the major site of proliferation they also showed that the pathogen remained within the crop for 96 h post-ingestion doud and zurek 2012 a thailandicus remained in the crop of d melanogaster after 510 days pais et al 2018 and bacillus cereus remained in the crop of m domestica for up to 24 h nayduch and burrus 2017 in an attempt to see if adult house flies could transmit campylobacter jejuni gill et al 2017 showed that when fed the bacterium it was still found in the vomitus regurgitant from the crop 4 h after feedingfor some synanthropic calliphoridae sarcophagidae and muscidae regurgitation often involves the transfer of food borne and human or domestic animal disease causing pathogens to unwanted substrates or sites greenberg 1973 roberts 1947 wasala et al 2013 nazni et al 2005 reported finding numerous microbes in the vomitus ie regurgitant of adult house flies from various regions of peninsular malaysia and from three different habitats in the following discussion focus will be placed on some of the interactions taking place within the crop lumen and also some of the strategies the pathogens use to survive within the cropflies have long been known to be vectors of numerous pathogens especially of food borne pathogens in fact macovei and zurek 2006 macovei and zurek 2007 discuss and present evidence of adult house flies being involved in transmission of microbial resistant genes to sites of food settings where these pathogens are present within the fly in some studies was not reported in fact few studies reported where horizontal transmission of resistance occurs as stated previously when reports mention pathogens in the foregut of the fly they are generally referring to their storage or presence within the crop lumen not until relatively recent have reports been made that horizontal transmission of antibiotic resistance specifically occurs within the crop macovei et al 2008 petridis et al 2006 a detailed review of the importance of insects especially flies as vectors which are able to make connections between farms and urban environments with respect to antibiotic resistance traits is provided by zurek and ghosha 2014 while davari et al 2010 report on resistance to antibiotics of flies from slaughter houses and hospitals in several of the cases reported the fly crop was listed as the main site where horizontal transmission occurred doud and zurek 2012 research may prove that the importance of flies in the transmission of microbes to foods or hosts may be lesser of a problem than the flies vectoring resistant genes which occurs within the cropthe labellar glands of dipterans are class 3 epidermal glands whose function for years remained unknown dober and stoffolano 1976 it wasnt until ferrandon et al 1998 using a drosomycin-gfp reporter transgene showed expression of the antifungal peptide drosomycin in what the authors called barrier epithelia and showed the amp drosomycin was produced in the labellar glands do the labellar glands secrete other chemicals involved in the innate immune system of adult flies yes in sarcophaga peregrine robineau-desvoidy yamamoto-kihara et al 2016 reported the secretion of a new c-type lectin from the labellar glands which they call clpt ie c-type lectin producing tissue the labellar glands and the salivary glands both produce drosomycin in d melanogaster which is not systemically induced the labellar glands have also been shown to produce defensin against gram-positive bacteria and mechnikowin against fungi tzou et al 2000 it was suggested that drosomycin produced by these two glands aids in destroying microorganisms prior to entering the midgut ferrandon et al 1998 and as shown in table 1 of their paper there was some expression in the crop whether this was due to the expression in the crop epithelia or just drosomycin within the crop lumen is uncertain ferrandon personal communication the amps of both the labellar and salivary glands are not systemically induced antimicrobial productsthey are independent of the toll pathway and reportedly respond to the pathogen they are being exposed to ferrandon et al 1998an interesting evolutionary pathway in the diptera occurred when some families pursued blood feeding as their main feeding strategy haematophagous flies can be either strict obligatory ie feeding only on blood or non-obligatory blood feeders ie feeding on blood and various carbohydrates such as nectar blood feeding involved modification of the mouthparts capable of cutting into the skin penetrating and sucking up the blood destined for the midgut and not the crop they also had to evolve special midguts and mechanisms ie neuropeptide diuretics to handle the water in the blood meal these haematophagous flies obtain their meal directly from blood vessels with little exposure to skin surfaces which harbour the majority of pathogenic microbes the blood meal itself is fairly free of pathogenic organisms non-blood feeders however use the labellar lobes to obtain maximum nutrient intake and remove large particles from the meal with the pseudotrachea these labellar lobes cover a greater surface area compared to the terminal mouthpart of obligatory blood feeding flies when feeding elzinga and broce 1986 as a consequence non-blood feeders consume with their meal larger numbers of microbes usually destined for the crop to deal with this non-blood feeding flies evolved labellar glands capable of producing amps or other immune chemicals to deal with the pathogens contained within the imbibed nutrient two major blood feeding groups ie stomoxydinae and culicidae lack labellar glands patton and cragg 1913 an interesting example however is with the tabanidae where only the female feeds on blood while both sexes require carbohydrates which are then stored within the crop this suggests the presence of labellar glands is involved in feeding on nectar in both sexes and may aid in providing immune chemicals while the female also feeds on the surface contaminated blood-pools the labellar glands in this group of flies are very large fig 25
 phylogenetic information is needed concerning which dipteran groups have labellar glands the type of feeding they employ what materials are stored within the crop and what amps and possibly other chemicals having an antimicrobial effect are found there comparative studies within the diptera are needed if we are to truly understand the role of the foregut with respect to various microbes and the diversity of this group may provide unique and different strategiesthe crop has often been referred to as a site where some digestion of food materials takes place and the enzymes within the crop come from the salivary glands and not the midgut dimitriadis and papamanoli 1992 stoffolano and haselton 2013 calling the crop a sterilization organ in sand flies led schlein et al 1985 to suggest that both the labellar fig 26 and salivary gland secretions were responsible for the antimicrobial effect within the crop knowing that various chemicals having an antimicrobial effect are produced in these glands it seems obvious depending on the diet and the fullness of the midgut the secretions are first shunted to the crop where they have their action prior to the crop contents being directed to the midgut for digestion ie preaction cleansing by these chemicals before dispensing the diet to the midgut a surprising find was the study of gusmo et al 2007 who reported for the first time the finding of various microbes of the genus bacillus and serratia sp and the yeast pichia caribbica within the lumen of the ventral diverticulum or crop of adult a aegypti they proposed that these microbes were obtained when the adults fed on tropical nectars and may aid in sugar digestion also they suggest that their presence within the crop lumen may prevent their destruction ie bacillus serrati and pichia by midgut factors which would include blood and that these microbes could then be released into the midgut when needed we know very little about what type of microbes are ingested when adult flies feed on nectar this will be discussed belowthe majority of research on mosquitoes has involved the role of blood as a factor that initiates egg development and since blood normally does not enter the crop research on the mosquito crop has been ignored as has research on males that dont imbibe a blood meal fosters 1995 review on the importance of sugar in the diet of both males and females however has opened a new chapter in mosquito biology because carbohydrate intake ie nectar etc goes to the crop in both sexes at the same time there has been a new focus on the importance of microbes in insects in general gusmo et al 2007 using 16s rdna for bacteria and 28s rdna for yeast were the first to report several species of both bacteria and yeast in the diverticulated crop of a aegypti the yellow fever mosquito which can vector several important viruses ie chikungunya zika and dengue they suggested that these microbes might be involved in sugar metabolism obtained from nectar most interesting is the report of sharma et al 2014 who noted that there are more microbes in the salivary glands of anopheles culicifacies ie major malaria vector in india than in the gut as previously stated salivary secretions from adult dipterans usually ends up in the crop and sharmas group did not investigate this because the adult crop in mosquitoes has been ignored very few physiological studies have focused on mechanisms of crop regulation recently calkins et al 2017 examined some of these in adult female a aegypti and found the factors involved in the modulation of crop contractions are very similar to those previously reported in other dipterans stoffolano and haselton 2013 being such an important vector of microbial pathogens to humans these studies on the crop and microbes of mosquitoes opens up a new avenue of research that may ultimately provide a mechanisms in addition to the attractive toxic sugar bait atsb technique wongthangsiri et al 2018 that is providing a new control strategy for insect pestsseveral adult dipterans overwinter in an adult reproductive diapause m autumnalis stoffolano and matthysse 1967 phormia regina and protophormia terraenovae greenberg and stoffolano 1977 d melanogaster schmidt et al 2005 d suzukii wallingford et al 2016 bactrocera tryoni clarke et al 2019 and each in different ways may prove to be a useful system in evaluating the effect of diapause on host immunity and microbial survival especially involving the crop during adult diapause metabolism is generally reduced flies tend to aggregate in hibernation sites feeding is reduced reproductive events are reduced or stopped and there is a general reduction in locomotion several of these traits should put flies into greater contact with microbes which could present the host with a dilemma ie engaging the immune system which can be metabolically costly or succumbing to the stress factor of infection when adult flies diapause in a temperate climate where snowfall prevents them from feeding versus those that diapause in a climate where they can still feed the later group are probably more exposed to microbial contact than when snow prevents feeding because without a snow cover these flies usually still feed ie taking foodmicrobes into the foregut areain two interesting papers sinclair et al 2013 and ferguson and sinclair 2017 discuss cross-tolerance and cross-talk as they relate to cold survival and the impact cold has on the immune system of insects their point is well presented that during cold periods of stress ie diapause the immune system is upregulated taking this into account three examples of diapause in adult dipterans will be discussed and existing information on the involvement of their foregut will be presentedthe first and probably the most agriculturally important is the spotted winged drosophila without a doubt d suzukii presents a major threat to the soft small fruit industry it appears to be the only drosophilid species by which the female can penetrate unbroken fruit using its serrated ovipositor once inside the fruit the larvae are not easily killed by insecticides thus control strategies must look at other possible weak links in the adult life cycle there is a voluminous literature on ways in which to attack this pest one aspect that needs research is to attack what may be its weakest link ie its adult diapause and its associated microbes wallingford et al 2016 agree with this by noting that a better understanding of diapause would lead to a more targeted management strategy jakobs et al 2015 were one of the first groups to investigate the genetic overwintering plasticity of the adults their conclusion was that the fly did not have the ability to overwinter in extreme temperate regions yet it has using a metagenomics approach fountain et al 2018 concluded that the microbiome of wintering adults from four different woodland areas in s e england showed no major differences in their microbiomes in their study there was no snow cover preventing the flies from feeding on various substrates they also suggested that by feeding during the winter season adults replenished their microbiomes by feeding the idea of gut microbiome replenishing has been challenged by pais et al 2018 and was previously discussed a similar study to fountain et al 2018 needs to be done on the microbiome of the crop ie the crop has been ignored in this species in a temperate area where snow covers the ground preventing feeding what effect diapause stress has on upregulating immune factors and how this impacts resident or casual microbes also needs to be examinedhaving originated in africa d melanogaster certainly has exploited its genetic plasticity to expand its worldwide distribution survival in regions of cold temperatures requires an adult insect to enter a reproductive diapause and this it has accomplished its geographic variation with respect to diapause incidence was reported by schmidt et al 2005 while greater details on the physiological metabolic immune responses and gene regulation while in diapause have been reported for this sleeping beauty model dipteran kubrak et al 2014 as previously suggested during overwintering and diapause stress the authors demonstrated that four immune genes were greatly induced or upregulated during diapause the authors suggest that this upregulation of immune genes might be due to the often sessile or inactive life of diapausing adults making them more susceptible to microbial contact or ingestion numerous papers have reported on microbes within the gut of adult d melanogaster but none of them separate the foregut or crop from the rest of the gut the study by pais et al 2018 challenged the hypothesis that flies replenished the microbiome by feeding and showed that there was a mutualistic relationship with a thailandicus and the bacteria mainly resided within the crop their study did not include diapausing flies so it remains to be determined whether wild flies collected during the diapause state from the field still have bacteria within the crop is it a thailandicus and is the bacterium surviving within the crop in a biofilm bactrocera tryoni the queensland fruit fly is found mainly on the australian continent where it creates a serious threat to the fruit industry the fly has now expanded its range into temperate australia and this has created a major survival problem for the fly unlike most other tephritid species it has now been shown that the adults overwinter in a reproductive diapause and this may help explain its expansion ability into temperate climates clarke et al 2019 thaochan et al 2010 reported that one group of bacteria firmicutes was found mainly within the adult crop what now needs to be shown is what happens to these bacteria during diapause and if they dont survive how does the adult replenish the system does the diapause condition which has been shown to upregulate the immune system deplete or destroy the microbes inhabiting the foregut especially the crop or does the fly in the spring replenish its foregut microbiome by feeding on leaves or fruits that contain firmicutes leff and fierer 2013the importance of biofilm formation has gained considerable attention recently because of its importance to the medical and health professions plus recent focus by the food industry donlan and costerton 2002 and the health consequences resulting from their formation is significant an updated definition of biofilm is cells irreversibly attached to a surface or interface embedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances which these cells have produced and including the noncellular or abiotic components but also other physiological attributes of these organisms including such characteristics as altered growth rate and the fact that biofilm organisms transcribe genes that planktonic organisms do not provided by donlan and costerton in their 2002 review which gives a comprehensive definition encompassing most previous ones evolutionarily speaking it should be beneficial for microbes to somehow attach to various surfaces if they are to survive and not lose contact with their host the topic of adhesion related to various microbes fungi epstein and nicholson 2006 bacteria garrett et al 2008 is of current interest because this is a significant and initial part of any biofilm formation it also is an important topic with respect to designing surfaces for storing and packaging foods if biofilms can form on most surfaces one can assume insect surfaces whether external or internal such as the chitinous lining of the foregut ie crop etc should provide a suitable substrate very little if any information is available on the foregut cuticle of dipterans as a substrate for microbial adhesionbacterial biofilms have seized the attention of researchers such as veterinarians percival et al 2011 and food safety professionals lindsay and von holy 2006 while research has also included fungal biofilms fanning and mitchell 2012 james et al 2011 peiqian et al 2014 one aspect of biofilm formation in need of further study is the effect of host ageing on adhesion as far as i could find no one has looked at the effect of a flys age on biofilm formation within the host especially in wild flies the question that also needs to be answered is whether the cuticular lining of the foregut is degraded with age thus the age structure of a wild population especially if it has a diapause may have some effect on microbial acquisition storage and transfermicrobes will proliferate if the conditions are suitable the insect wing surface is presumably covered by a different cuticle than that of the foregut yet wings of insects have been shown to be very resistant to microbial attachment or penetration hasan et al 2013 ivanova et al 2012 in the insect crop however the process of regurgitation and crop contraction may often eliminate microbes before they have time to form a biofilm if the fly feeds on the same nutrients the microbes are proliferating in it goes without saying that if maintained within the crop lumen for a sufficient period microbial proliferation and possibly biofilm formation should take place unfortunately most field or laboratory studies on adult dipterans and associated microbes have not critically examined flies for biofilm formation within the foregut especially the crop lumen in addition to the formation of biofilm formation within the crop lumen it should be noted that the salivary and labellar glands both produce amps that end up within the lumen andor within the dorsal oesophageal bulb what effect the amps have on biofilm formation in these two structures has not been investigated recently gordya et al 2017 explored the structure and anti-biofilm effect of amps from the salivary glands of larval calliphora vicina using several pathogens they found these amps to be effective against biofilm formation by three human pathogens ie e coli staphylococcus aureus and acinetobacter baumannii and suggest that amps from different organisms might be useful in treatment and prevention of antibiotic-resistant biofilms similar studies need to be initiated on the effect of amps from the salivarylabellar glands of adult flies on biofilm formation on the proboscis as shown in fig 3 or within the adult foregut the use of the crop vessel assay described below fig 28 wang et al 2017 might also prove useful a specific case in point is the study of kassiri et al 2015 where they examined adult house flies from hospitals in iran and showed 80 of the flies carried one or more species of medically important fungi they did not however explore where these pathogens were located within the flies this does not mean biofilm formation does not occur elsewhere in the digestive tract than the crop especially studies such as those on tsetse where they show the significance of biofilm formation within the midgut lumen for the symbiotic microorganisms found there maltz et al 2012 also estes et al 2009 showed biofilm formation by the endosymbiont candidatus erwinia dacicola within the dorsal oesophageal bulb and crop of their host bactrocera oleae and once these biofilms formed the endosymbionts could not be removed when adults were fed chlorox or various antibiotics later in the review i will mention a crop vessel bioassay potentially useful to explore the effect of quorum sensing inhibitors cady et al 2012 on biofilm formation in any fly speciesrecently biofilm formation in the fly crop has been given attention by using drosophila as a model mulcahy et al 2011 yet other future studies especially on wild flies such as house fly other fruit flies and many blowflies should provide information as to where and if the biofilm is forming within the adult insect ie crop midgut or rectum mulcahy et al 2011 showed biofilm formation within 24 h of feeding on pseudomonas aeruginosa while joyner et al 2013 reported p aeruginosa within the crop of adult house fly but made no mention of a biofilm being formed why in the one species did a biofilm form in drosophila while in house fly there was no mention of biofilm formation the study of kobayashi et al 1999 showed an unknown fibrous material was plugging up the pseudotracheal canal but did not identify the substance fig 4 because they worked on e coli i searched the literature and found a paper showing the biofilm of this pathogen which looks very similar to the fibrous material they found lee et al 2011 this however needs to be confirmed not only in house flies but in other flies information on adult field collected flies and biofilm formation similar to that of the non-dipteran sharp shooter leafhopper species and the vectored pathogen xylella fastidiosa wells is desperately needed if we are to obtain a complete picture of flies as important microbial vectors in their study alves et al 2008 showed biofilm formation in the insects foregut any nutrients the fly ingests into its crop usually are the same nutrients numerous microbes are using as their own nutrient source thus it is not surprising microbial proliferation has been reported in the crops or foregut of d melanogaster erwinia carotovora subsp carotovora de jaczko et al 1983 fig 27
 and m domestica e faecalis doud and zurek 2012 aeromonas hydrophila chester mcgaughey and nayduch 2009 and pseudomonas aeruginosa joyner et al 2013 the crop environment is not as hostile as the midgut which means it can favour pathogen proliferation and biofilm formation it is an ideal site for any pathogen requiring a relatively safe haven while being transmitted to a new environment it has been shown that erwinia carotovora subspecies carotovora spores do not survive well in their natural environment but inside the crop of d melanogaster they are protected and obtain a free ticket ride to their ultimate plant host where they are either regurgitated or passed with the faeces de jaczko et al 1983a recent report phoku et al 2016 showed adult house flies are vectors of mycotoxigenic fungal spores and can transfer these to human food sources the study did not however mention whether these spores were in the crop or any other part of the flys alimentary system since mycelium have been recovered within the crop lumen of d melanogaster fig 27 there is no reason not to think fungal spores can also be taken up into the crop the growing concern over the impact of fungi on human health revankar and sutton 2010 especially those termed melanized fungi suggests researchers working on flies as vectors of pathogens should carefully examine flies for these fungi kassiri et al 2015 examined whole flies collected from within or surrounding the hospital but did not make a distinction as to where in or on the flies the fungi were located they reported adult house flies showed the presence of 28 fungal species from the surroundings while of the flies caught within the hospital 80 carried medically important pathogenic fungi this study would have been more useful if they had located onor within the fly where the fungi were locatedthere is little doubt the lumen of the crop lobes serve as a chamber for storage of imbibed nutrients and usually numerous microbes the crop can be removed as an isolated chamber and placed on a glass slide for extended periods of time without losing water abbott 1945 which makes it an ideal biological vessel for events other than just nutrient storage its impermeable cuticle prevents its contents from leaking into the hemolymph and at the same time also prevents gaining substances from the hemolymph thus the crop serves the adult fly as a non-leakable natural storage vessel for nutrients often in scarce supply only in a few cases do we know how long pathogens can remain within the crop lumen since this organ can remain isolated and removed from the fly for extended periods of time one wonders how long pathogens can remain within the crop one study has shown that serratia marcescens bizio remains viable within adult house flies killed by electrocuting traps for up to 5 weeks cooke et al 2003 the authors never checked to see where the pathogens were located but the crop is a good suspect because the other parts of the digestive tract will certainly dry out but the crop fluids should remain because they are protected by the foregut lining and the crop duct should shrink thus trapping fluids within the crop lumen other than the nutrients imbibed while feeding what other substances are stored within the crop and where do they come from the general consensus is depending on the diet and mode of feeding that secretions from both the labellar and salivary glands end up in the crop stoffolano and haselton 2013 at present only two reports address the topic of the crop serving as a chamber other than for food storage and the presence of various microbes the first report involves the importance of the crop as a site where various components of the male lekking pheromone are stored and where various chemical reactions occur leading to the final pheromone deposited by regurgitation of crop contents onto leaves where they serve as a lekking pheromone lu and teal 2001 this case however probably isnt involved with pathogens directlythe second case however does buchon personal correspondence and buchon et al 2013 suggests as did schlein et al 1986 that the crop serves as a detoxification chamber where various toxic elements contained within the food are neutralized prior to entering the midgut this functional aspect of the crop needs closer examination based on the review of what is called detoxifying symbiosis van den bosch and welte 2017it is not surprising being the second most naturally abundant organic polymer that chitin plays an important role not only as a major component of the insect cuticle but as a carbon and nitrogen source for many microorganisms killiny et al 2010 meibom et al 2004 many of these microorganisms use their own chitinases to break down chitin for their own use hamid et al 2013 what importance these chitinase producing bacteria have within the crop in degrading the cuticular lining remains unknown an interesting question is whether the biophysical properties of the foregut cuticular lining of older flies is more susceptible to microbial adhesion otto 2008 and biofilm formation current materials research uses the insect cuticle as a biomimetic or bioinspired model to develop various nanoparticle structures such as shirlk which is a chitosan-fibroin laminate lacking chitin and gets its name because chitosan can be obtained from shrimp cells and fibroin from silk fernandez and ingber 2012 such a laminate material could play an import antimicrobial role where pathogens use chitin as a carbon and nitrogen source in both food and medical uses chitosan is also recognized as an important antibacterial and antifungal biopolymer and it is suggested it could be used in place of chlorine in the seafood industry to decontaminate food products goy et al 2009 zhao et al 2010 chitin is a major component of the insects external cuticle but is also present in the cuticular lining of the fore- and hindgut and is also a component of the peritrophic matrix zhao et al 2010 it has recently been shown in paenibacillus larvae the causative agent for american foulbrood in bees that the pathogen expresses a chitin-binding protein that degrades the peritrophic matrix of the bee larvae making it possible for the pathogen to enter into the hemolymph thus being an important virulence factor for this disease garcia-gonzalez et al 2014 this example supports the fact that important research into hostmicrobe interactions must examine other factors than just focusing on amps nutrients for the microbes andor where the microbes are located the majority of research on chitin as it is related to microbial interactions has made considerable progress in the area of the importance of chitin in the marine environment to microbial pathogens unfortunately research on the importance of chitin in the insectmicrobial arena lags behindthe lining of the crop foregut the rectum and the peritrophic matrix all contain chitin to date no one has mentioned the presence of chitin in the lining of the oesophageal bulb but based on conventional information and the tems of this structural area in apple maggot adults figs 9 and 10 if the foregut is lined with a cuticular lining and this contains chitin the oesophageal bulb also should all of these foregut sites are exposed to various pathogens and chitin may not only serve as the stimulus for pathogen adhesion and biofilm formation but it might also assist in destroying various microbes the only known research i could find specifically focusing on the foregut of an insectpathogen relationship is that of x fastidiosa an insect-borne bacterium which forms a biofilm in the leafhoppers foregut and utilizes the foreguts chitinous cuticular lining as a carbon source the pathogen is transferred to the xylem vessels of numerous host plants when the insect feeds killiny et al 2010 an important paper for fly researchers is that of rapicavoli et al 2015 also on xylella where they investigated the role of the predominant macromolecule ie lipopolysaccharide on the surface of the gram-negative bacterium and by using a mutant to this molecule were able to affect biofilm formationthe paper by pais et al 2018 reports that a thailandicus remained within the crop lumen of adult d melanogaster for 5 days it appears to be species specific and that the stability of this bacterium resided in the foregut a stain for live or dead bacteria showed that they remained alive within the lumen and tem showed that the bacteria were multiplying they also noted the bacteria were found aggregated in groups or clusters that were in close proximity to the chitinous lining of the lumen whether they were attached via a biofilm remains to be demonstrated they noted that some cells in the proventriculus appeared to be attached by fimbriae this is highly possible and a look at the paper by krogfelt 1991 on bacterial fimbrial adhesins should be helpful as far as a symbiotic relationship with a thailandicus the authors demonstrated that this stable association had an effect on both the development and fertility of its hosts progeny and that these benefits were more pronounced on natural versus laboratory foodthe insect external cuticle evolved to avoid contamination by dust other small environmental particles and microbial attachment and adhesion watson et al 2017 review this important aspect of insect biology and briefly discuss how the wings and bodies of some insects avoid microbial contamination and adhesion a topic that needs more research is to elucidate the microbial control mechanisms ie virulence factors that various microbes use to attach to insect chitin one of the best examples unfortunately not of an insect of this is the human pathogen vibrio vulnificus which can attack the human digestive tract or enter wounds gaining entrance via a wound can cause deadly infections where it is reported that 25 of wound-infected patients die williams et al 2015 as far as this review goes i havent found any reference to the specific virulence factors in the dipteran system when it comes to cuticular adhesion in nature various vibrio species are found attached to marine aggregates which then can enter the marine food system and our food system williams et al 2015 investigated the various c- and e-genotype strains of v vulnificus and determined which of these strains was more effective at attaching to chitin in their study the authors used chitin magnetic beads as their test substrate in addition to determining which genotype strain was more effective they also showed that quorum sensing had a negative effect on chitin attachment by negatively regulating expression of type iv pili and tested the effect of various abiotic and biotic factors on biofilm formationchitin and chitosan are negatively charged and this electrostatic property is considered as one of their main attributes as antibacterial and antifungal compounds both chemicals act as outer membrane disruptors of various pathogens where the chitin attracts the pathogen that adheres to its outer surface ultimately leading to disruption and loss of its outer integrity goy et al 2009 studies on insect foregut cuticle examining the effect of various physical properties and various microbes with respect to electrostatic interactions relating to biofilm formation need to be conducted similar to those with staphylococcus aureus kalasin et al 2010chitin chitosan and its oligomers from shrimp cuticle have been shown to exhibit good antimicrobial activity against a number of important human pathogens benhabiles et al 2012 hafsa et al 2016 one of the major sources of chitin and its derivatives comes from the exoskeletons derived from the seafood industry these products have made their way into various aspects of the health industry but recent thinking and research suggests they could also be used in agriculture sharp 2013 besides these reported positive effects on both plant nutrition and growth studies show that chitin-based treatments to the soil can augment and increase the beneficial action of chitinolytic microbes there is now a substantial body of evidence that the addition of chitin alters the environmental conditions in the rhizosphere and phyllosphere to shift the microbial balance in favour of beneficial organisms and to the detriment of plant pathogens sharp 2013 excluding the chitinase inhibitors which sharp 2013 did not address he notes the lack of information on using chitin-based chemicals against the diptera if chitin-based treatments do affect microbial balance of the phyllosphere and flies forage on these microbes it could have a major impact on the microbial balance within the flys crop and possibly the rest of the digestive tract martinez et al 1994 found pseudomonas spp within the crop of a ludens but their influence on the total gut microbiome was not determined the increased exploitation and use of chitinases in agriculture and the environment has been useful hamid et al 2013 however the effect of ingesting chitinase droplets by adult flies when applied to either an in vitro or in vivo system remains unknown numerous studies have examined the effect of chitinases on the peritrophic matrix as potential biopesticides and have shown degradation of this matrix ultimately having a detrimental effect on the test insect kabir et al 2006 since a number of bacteria can produce chitinases hamid et al 2013 one needs to examine the effect chitinases have on the chitinous lining of the foregut which includes the crop to my knowledge such studies have not been reported for the diptera does any of the degradation of the lumen of the crop lining have anything to do with microbial biofilm formation within this organthe physical property of a biopolymer or nanofilms ability to distortbend may aid in disrupting or dislodging biofilm formation or pathogen adhesion ramanathan et al 2013 within the contracting crop does crop contraction which produces bending hinder microbial adhesion as reported by nam and santore 2011 for other bioadhesion factors and membranes at the same time the microbe uses various strategies to remain with the host various approaches used to study the dynamic processes involved in bacterial adhesion have been reviewed krogfelt 1991 otto 2008 in addition to the presence of chitin in the foregut cuticle proteins such as resilin can give it flexibility and less stiffness andersen 1979 the presence of resilin in the dipteran crop and oesophageal bulb cuticle needs to be confirmed especially since they both have distensibility especially the crop and possibly the eb in addition there is considerable room for new research on the physical aspects of the crops cuticular lining as it relates to pathogen adhesion repulsion multiplication or development of resistance this is especially true in light of two reports the first by ukuku and fett 2006 who reported cell surface charge and hydrophobicity influenced attachment of salmonella serovars to cantaloupe and were important in bacterial resistance to removal by various chemicals and washing the other report showed considerable bacteria being held within the oesophageal bulb lumen of rhagoletis pomonella figs 9 and 10 ratner and stoffolano 1984 where there was no microscopic evidence of any attachment by the bacteria to the fibrous mass in addition to just being physically retained within the fibrous mass another option is there could be an electrostatic charge holding the bacteria to the fibres this was never testedit was assumed that in adult d melanogaster commensal bacteria are transiently associated with their host and that adults have to constantly reinfect the gut by feeding blum et al 2013 broderick et al 2014 using histological techniques it was shown that the med fly housed pseudomonas spp in the eb but did not determine if this species influenced host longevity marchini et al 2002 it wasnt until behar et al 2008 demonstrated that pseudomonas spp played a minor role in extending host longevity and that gut enterobacteriaceae were the most important this was the belief until the work of pais et al 2018 reviewed by ma and leulier 2018 where they showed there was a symbiotic relationship with a thailandicus can we say that the drosophila microbe association is mutualistic it has been established that the commensal bacteria do confer an increased metabolic fitness to the adults huang and douglas 2015 and even though gut bacteria numbers drop during pupation the larval stage rescues microbial numbers storelli et al 2018 also demonstrated that the association between lactobacillus plantarum and fly larvae is what they called facultative nutritional mutualism because the larvae produce maintenance factors permitting the bacteria to overcome nutrient shortages in most of these papers researchers have found the microbes in the foregut especially the crop lumen pais et al 2018 showed their presence within the lumen and the proventriculus and oesophagus not the cardia the distinction between the proventriculus and cardia in flies is confusing in the literature yet it is important to know exactly where microbes are found snodgrass 1935 says these two structures are often confused and that the proventriculus is a specialized part of the stomodaeum immediately anterior to the ventriculus he defines the cardia as the anterior part of the ventriculus in many diptera taking the form of a small spherical sac often mistaken for a proventriculus even in this description by one of the best insect morphologists snodgrass 1935 fails to give a name to the donut circular structure that forms the junction of the foregut and midgut king 1988 and singh et al 2011 define the structure as cardia proventriculus while kuraishi et al 2013 report that the first half of the cardia belongs to the foregut is it the proventriculus or is it the cardia if both are present within the structure the structure needs to have its own name thus the foregut structures of the adult drosophila model and other dipterans are extremely important in any microbefly study again one must be careful in designating the area at the junction of the proventriculus and cardia as the site where the microbes are found were they in the foregut or midgut it seems unlikely that they would be found in the cardia area because this is where the peritrophic matrix is being formed and this matrix may preclude any microbial attachmentthe review by sharp 2013 explores the use of chitin and its derivatives to improve plant crop yield but the use of these compounds may also have an important role in confined animal facilities studies have been done using chitinase inhibitors as animal feed-through fly larvicidal chemicals cetin et al 2006 but i know of no studies targeting the microbes within the lumen of the crop the antimicrobial effect of chitin and its derivatives is well established benhabiles et al 2012 hafsa et al 2016 but no literature has been found where the antimicrobial-chitin compounds have been used to reduce the number of human pathogenic bacteria within the crop of the fly by using an acceptable bait containing a powder or a solution containing chitin-based compounds within various animal contained rearing facilities ie piggeries poultry or dairy barns as part of an atsb pathogenic microbes within the crop such as e coli may be destroyed thus preventing house fly adults from vectoring e coli or any other human food pathogen found within the animal housinghaving read many papers concerning the association between numerous plant and animal microbes within the foregut of adult flies it is possible to make certain generalizations about these associations as they relate to the flymicrobe associations food health and pathogen transfer in general1because of their ability to fly adult dipterans inhabit most environments containing animal and plant hosts where they encounter and connect with resident microbes either mechanically or biologically2adult flies have various front-end structures eg legs proboscis oesophageal bulb crop and proventriculus that are involved either in retaining the microbes andor transferring them to another site or host3the crop of adult flies is not only a storage organ for nutrients but can provide a safe haven for microbes by protecting them from the insults of either environmental effects andor destructive chemicals which include amps of the midgut4the crop is also the site where genes are exchanged between microbes resulting in antibiotic resistance5the relationship between the fly and the microbes can be symbiotic pathogenic to the fly or pathogenic to humans domestic animals or contaminating food sources6one way for the microbe to assure retention with the fly is to employ various adhesion strategies within the foregut eg adhesins biofilm formation or electrostatic charge to the chitinous crop lining7the presence of antimicrobials from both the labellar and salivary glands must have some effect on microbial survival within the crop prior to entrance into the midgut or transferred to a female as a nuptial gift what effect if any they have on resident microbes needs to be investigated8the physical aspects of the foregut lining which includes the crop as related to microbial adhesion should be just as important as the role of antimicrobials from the salivary and labellar glands9recent research is showing that microbes are often housed within the crop lumen where they can then be spread to the environment by regurgitation and microbially farmed on plant tissues only later to be gleaned or later harvested by the same host species in most cases these microbes are species specific10laboratory studies on dipteran and microbe studies will reveal a different foregut microbiome than that found in field collected flies field collected flies should show a greater diverse microbiome compared to laboratory reared flies11it goes without saying that since various chitin products eg chitosan have been shown to be beneficial in plant defence against microbes these compounds ingested into the crop of an adult fly should also have a beneficial role in destroying pathogenic bacteria destined to our foods or food stuffs12researchers should be cognizant that the microbial community of laboratory flies may not be as stable and diverse as those in wild flies thus researchers on laboratory flies should be cautious in making sweeping generalizations about mechanism etc the microbe uses to remain with the host
future genetic and molecular studies designed to identify various genes or pathways involving pathogens and other microbials by compartmentalizing the fly digestive tract should take into consideration that when they are including the crop in these studies it doesnt automatically mean these studies involve what is going on inside the crop lumen these types of studies probably represent information about the crop epithelial cells the muscles of the crop duct and lobe plus any associated neuronsendocrine glands all of which are outside the lumen and are separated from it by a reportedly impermeable cuticular lining no one has ever reported cells or connections with cells on the hemolymph side of the crops cuticular lining going into the lumen thus what is found within the lumen enters with imbibed food which may include secretions from either the labellar or salivary glands or both plus the numerous microbes in the food and possibly occasional pathogens one must consider all lines of defence an adult fly might have against invading and potentially harmful microbes one line of defence might be to prevent biofilm formation by the physical cuticular makeup and also distortion of the cuticular lining by crop contractions the diverticulated crop of dipterans can no longer be considered just a storage organ for nutrients but is an important chamber isolated from midgut fluids and the hemolymph where pathogens and beneficial microbes plus amps or other secretions from the labellar and salivary glands interact finally even though the ultimate fly model has become d melanogaster studies involving genetics and molecular techniques similar to those reported by chtarbanova et al 2014 where a virus affects crop function should be applied to the hytrosavirus systems found in tsetse fly kariithi et al 2017b the house fly kariithi et al 2017a and other insect systems involving microbial associations both tsetse mosquitoes and house flies are significantly more important than drosophila when it comes to human welfare the tsetse for vectoring the trypanosome causing african sleeping sickness the house fly for vectoring human and domestic animal food borne pathogens ie role in food safety and the mosquito for vectoring the pathogens causing dengue malaria zika and chikungunya thus these fly systems need to be developed to the same extent that the d melanogaster system has been developed granting agencies should recognize the limitations of the drosophila model and support research on other model dipteran systemsacute respiratory tract infections artis are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality and a common reason for both outpatient visits and hospitalisations among humans worldwide rna viruses the agents that cause arti most frequentlyusually a self-limiting upper respiratory tract syndrome coronaviruses covs are recombining enveloped viruses with long positive-sense rna genomes they are ancestrally zoonotic in origin having adapted to bind a diverse range of cellular receptors 1 four human coronaviruses hcovs have evolved initially from bats camelids and rodents to become distinct global endemic seasonal pathogens causing mild to moderate arti among humans 23the hcovs occupy two of four genera in the subfamily coronavirinae 4 human coronavirus 229e and betacoronavirus-1 subspecies hcov-oc43 have been known for more than 50 years while human coronavirus nl63 and human coronavirus hku1 were first characterised in 2004 and 2005 respectivelya severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus sars-cov briefly emerged into the human population during 20022004 but was controlled and is not known to circulate today its brief but severe emergence sparked renewed study of covs in 2012 another novel severely pathogenic cov was identified in the kingdom of saudi arabia ksa 80 of over 2000 human cases have been recorded over five years 5 both sars-cov and the new middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov belonging to the species middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus evolved from ancestral but different bat covs travel history and laboratory analysis would be required to differentiate mers from sars if it still occurred 6 to date most mers cases have been limited to countries in the arabian peninsula with rare travel-related spillovers one case precipitated a large healthcare multi-facility outbreak in the republic of korea in 2015a confirmed case of mers occurs when a person irrespective of signs or symptoms has a laboratory-reported mers-cov infection a probable case requires a minimum of a clinically diagnosed acute febrile disease an epidemiologic link and a partial laboratory diagnostic profile 7we briefly review recent literature and the current understanding of mers and mers-cov highlighting some knowledge gapsthe viral receptor for mers-cov is a transmembrane glycoprotein called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp-4 which has a wide tissue distribution in humans including on alveolar cells of the lower respiratory tract and in the small intestine 89 dpp-4 interacts with the mers-cov at its receptor-binding domain rbd within the spike fusion protein figure 1 dpp-4 expression is upregulated in the lower respiratory tract of those with poor lung function in the lower respiratory tract of those with untreated asthma and in soluble form in the plasma of obese patients 8101112 whether blood borne dpp-4 interferes with mers-cov or through reversible binding contributes to its systemic distribution of mers-cov during serious disease are questions worthy of further investigation studies of the upper respiratory tract have found little to no sign of dpp-4 expression levels or tissue distribution although one study identified dpp-4 enzymatic activity suggesting it is present 101314 it may be useful to expand the search for dpp-4 expression to tissues indicated by cases with different disease states co-infections especially with viruses known to inflame the lower respiratory tract and trigger asthma exacerbations such as rhinoviruses are also of interest mers-cov may also use sialic acids as a low-affinity but selective cellular receptor to aid attachment and entry into dpp-4 positive cells 15mers is most well characterised as a respiratory disease of humans extensive inflammation and immune evasion are hallmarks of severe disease ascribed to covs 1617 among confirmed mers cases fever cough and dyspnoea are the most common clinical manifestations 1819 the mean incubation period for mers is between 2 and 13 days longer periods are associated with a reduced risk of death 202122 mers-cov infection also results in mild and subclinical outcomesthe typical mers case is a saudi male aged between 21 and 60 years often presenting to a hospital with pneumonia or worse 182324 severe mers occurs most frequently among those with comorbidities including diabetes mellitus cirrhosis and others affecting respiratory renal and cardiac systems 232526 downregulation of innate immune response mediators associated with some of these disorders may be related to the severity of mers 27 it may be that the high frequency of severe mers reflects elevated prevalence of certain comorbidities in the middle east region 27 comorbidities did not feature among sars cases as they have among cases of mers mers-cov is a highly opportunistic pathogenin june 2015 an outbreak in the republic of korea found confirmed cases presented with fever cough and upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms progressing within a week to lower respiratory tract distress with lymphopenia and elevated liver enzymes 23242728 mers can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan system failure requiring intensive supportive care 232429 extra pulmonary infection does occur likely resulting from haematogenous transport of virus which is an area in need of further study 930 similarly little is known about sequelae following mers-cov infection in one study those who survived acute respiratory distress syndrome were well one year later 19 another study identified delayed neurological manifestations during treatment of mers cases but lacked long-term follow-up 31death occurs among 3040 of mers cases approximately 40 of cases in the ksa and 20 of cases in the republic of korea where mortality ranged from 7 among younger age groups to 40 among those aged 60 years and above among studies of fatal cases death occurred between 515 days after symptom onset 18213233 because the extent of subclinical or mild infections in the community remains unquantified mortality figures may be overestimates 34mers-cov variants exist as a single antigenic group in lineage c of the genus betacoronavirus 3536 when mers-cov infection is subclinical or less severe humoral immune responses may be weak delayed short-lived or undetectable 3738394041 humans can still be reinfected if they have pre-existing neutralising antibodies similarly to what is seen in camels 41 however survivors of symptomatic mers do develop antibodies including neutralising antibodies which decline but persist for 13 years 3742 whether these antibodies prevent future infection remains to be examined those with mild or subclinical mers still develop cd8 t-cell responses and survivors of more severe mers including those who do not mount an antibody response develop both cd8 and cd4 t-cell responses 43robust laboratory-based real-time rt-pcr diagnostic tools were described immediately after mers-cov was discovered and remain reliable 44 several different research-based antibody detection protocols have also been reported for human and animal studies 45 molecular and serological kits are commercially available 46 while current molecular methods are rapid there are many steps that combine to delay publication of a final test result from the initial decision to request a mers-cov test to sample collection nucleic acid extraction pcr additional sampling repeat testing and reporting processes molecular rapid and sensitive point-of-care tests pocts are not available but would help support infection control in healthcare settingsthe world health organisation recommends testing of appropriate samples for mers-cov rna using real-time rt-pcr methods with subgenomic sequencing to confirm screening results as necessary 47 repeat testing is often required 1748 virus isolation by culture is not a recommended tool detecting antibodies against mers-cov may be useful to identify a seroconversion that can define a probable case when confirmation by rt-pcr has been unsuccessful or impossible 47mild and subclinical mers cases are reported among younger people including healthcare workers and children 174950 it remains unclear what proportion of mers-cov infections are truly subclinical after one study found many were initially incorrectly classified 51 difficulty identifying a useful diagnostic antibody response in mild and subclinical disease means seroprevalence studies likely under-report the history of mers-cov 40 mers-cov specific cd8 testing may be helpful 43 the usefulness of serology needs clarificationhumans are incidental hosts of mers-cov the principal natural reservoir host of mers-cov is the dromedary camel 16 among camels mers-cov infection manifests in a manner similar to that in which the common cold manifests in humans the camel upper respiratory tract expresses high levels of the dpp-4 receptor 13 the study of mers-cov highlights the need for collaboration between politics and diverse basic and applied fields of research at the humananimal interfacea one health approach camel trade plays a central role in the movement of infected hosts around the arabian peninsula pakistan and north west and east africa all harbour mers-cov-infected camels 52535455 alpacas llamas and pigs are potential hosts according to experimental evidence 565758 in addition alpacas have been found to be naturally infected 59the virus genetically detected or biologically cultured from humans is nearly identical to that isolated from camels and in some instances has been used to identify transmission routes signs of virus change have appeared with continued surveillance over time recombination has been identified and variation in the region of the tropism-defining spike protein in a divergent egyptian camel mers-cov variant 60 has been associated with reduced infectivity in vitro compared to human and less divergent camel mers-cov variants 61 nearly 300 human and animal mers-cov genome sequences have been produced from mers-cov infections since 2012 but few studies of the functional impact of identified mutations have been conducted among mers-related coronaviruses 62 there may now exist three conspecific viruses the camel mers-cov and the bat covs btvs-betacovsc2013 63 and predictpdf-2180 64 each with related but distinct genomes and divergent spike genes ongoing viral surveillance and characterisation is essential to ensure variants with increased efficiency in attachment fusion or replication do not emerge unnoticed surveillance of human respiratory illness in mers-cov-positive camel countries outside of the arabian peninsula is currently lacking 52according to the ksa ministry of health 65 nearly half of all mers cases are classified as primary cases zoonoses originating from direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels or from an unidentified source which had no link to any other known human case the precise mechanism by which mers-cov spreads from camels to humans is unknown but is not essential for enacting precautions to reduce exposure to infected animals secondary cases make up slightly more than half of all mers cases mostly resulting from exposure associated with a healthcare facilityinfectious mers-cov is presumed to be found in droplets 59 but modelling has also suggested the possibility of airborne spread 45 virus remains viable for at least 48 h on plastic and steel surfaces presumably underpinning the extensive contamination of air and surfaces in hospitals housing patients with mers 666768697071 the virus appears sensitive to standard heat and chemical inactivation measures 7273antibodies to mers-cov have been found in camel sera as far back as 1983 in each animal antibodies to mers-cov are short-lived and do not prevent reinfection 527475human contact with camels is often associated with the collection preparation and ingestion of camel milk or meat female camels especially those bred for milking have the highest rates of mers-cov seropositivity mers-cov rna has been detected in milk from one study and virus was found to be stable after being spiked into milk samples from another study 537677 camels in larger herds have higher rates of seropositivity compared with smaller herds 5253 female and young camels also have higher rates of mers-cov rna than older and male camels 53 while no evidence for human infection resulting from ingestion has been presented it has been found that experimentally inoculated human intestinal cells and organoids can host productive mers-cov infection and that mers-cov can remain infectious after transit through gastric acids 9 further intestinal respiratory and neurological infection follows intragastric inoculation of dpp-4 transgenic mice 9 whether camel milk and meat actually contain a suitable infectious dose to cause intestinal infection of humans is yet to be determined 78 it seems likely that the processes of milking and butchery may contaminate surfaces and generate infectious droplets that include sufficient inoculum from which a human infection could result via inhalation or self-inoculation it is not known whether the eyes act as a portal for mers-cov entrysince the majority of human-to-human mers-cov infections are associated with healthcare improved infection control and prevention is considered key for preventing outbreaks among humans not at occupational risk of exposure to infected animals 79 in the outbreak in the republic of korea 5 of 186 cases were responsible for 83 of transmission events most new cases did not result in any identified onward transmission the reproduction r0 number was calculated as 39 and 1969 from selected ksa outbreaks 80 three of these five cases were coughing prolonged exposures crowding and large numbers of contacts were important factors for disproportionate virus transmission 818283the role if any for mild or subclinical mers-cov infections in maintaining the virus in the human population has not been convincingly addressed a healthcare worker found to shed viral rna for more than five weeks in the absence of disease adds urgency to the need for such studies 84 none among 82 contacts of a mildly symptomatic mers-cov-infected healthcare worker seroconverted but there was no mention of whether the index case seroconverted 85 in a ksa hospital outbreak investigation contacts of subclinical mers-cov-infected healthcare workers became rt-pcr positive suggesting transmission was a possibility 17 some studies report very rare camel contact among human cases and no history of contact with other mers-cov-infected humans and this raises the question of how these primary cases acquire infection 18 community spread and subclinical transmission need more attentionthe hajj pilgrimage an annual mass gathering in the ksa provides many opportunities for mers-cov to transmit and then spread globally however it is rhinoviruses influenza viruses and other seasonal respiratory viruses that have to date driven the bulk of respiratory disease associated with the hajj this indirectly reinforces that mers-cov does not transmit efficiently among humans outdoors 86 in hospital environments healthcare workers and other patients and carers who experience prolonged exposure to infectious cases in the absence of suitable personal protective equipment ppe are those who usually become infected there have been examples of the 2080 rule whereby relatively few infected individuals are responsible for a disproportionate number of new cases 83 insufficient cleaning of room surfaces inadequate room ventilation and overcrowding have also been suggested to drive indoor mers-cov transmissionno specific antiviral or licensed vaccine is available for a cov that infects humans but a range of candidates exist even if mers-cov infection is rare transmits poorly and does not evolve to become a pandemic threat it serves in a useful role to drive vaccine research of other covs both current and yet to emerge for cases in healthcare facilities improving hand hygiene the use of ppe gloves gown respiratory and eye protection 87 and surface cleaning can help disrupt transmission as can rapid triage of febrile patients with respiratory signs and symptoms to prevent mers-cov infection from dromedary camels precautions include avoiding contact with camel nasal secretions cooking camel meat and pasteurising camel milk until further studies better quantify the risk attached to each of these potential pathwaysvaccines to prevent cov disease require both humoral and cellular immunity 88 because airway immune responses may be key to preventing the establishment of human mers-cov infection localised deposition of an aerosolised vaccine could prove useful 88 a number of vaccine platforms and payloads have proceeded although progress has been challenged by the need for animal models that suitably reconstitute human lower respiratory tract disease to show evidence of any preventative effect 8990 some candidates have progressed to clinical trials 9192 the spike protein and rbd elicit neutralising antibody responses and have been employed as the payload for a number of platforms 889394 including dna vaccines 95 modified vaccinia virus ankara 9697 measles virus 979899100 and human- 26101 and chimpanzee-adenovirus-based vectors 99 there are also venezuelan equine encephalitis replicons expressing nucleocapsid 101 nanoparticles 102 and structural and non-structural deletion mutants of mers-cov 103vaccination of camels is likely to be the most rapid least expensive and best intervention for preventing rare spillovers that then become amplified by humans in healthcare settings successes have been reported but the approach is challenged by the problem that camels are naturally reinfectable with mers-cov even in the presence of a high titre of neutralising antibodies 5274104 to date camel vaccines reduce viral load but do not prevent virus shedding 104105 human vaccines could target the occupational at-risk groups which include healthcare farm barn market and slaughterhouse workers 5688106 more widespread application of a mers vaccine at this time does not seem warrantedthe rarity of seropositive donors sometimes low antibody titres and a lack of clinical evidence have made the use of convalescent sera from recovering mers patients a possibility for treatment but one with significant limitations 39 instead human monoclonal antibodies targeting the rbd and polyclonal antibodies may provide treatment options for those at risk of severe outcomes 107108109110 clinical trials are awaitedearly control of viral replication is important and administration of interferon ifn 1b or a ribavirin and ifn 2b combination within hours initially showed promise their practical use in humans is challenging because if not infected while in a healthcare setting humans usually present for care with well advanced disease 111112 combined treatments which reduce viral replication and the host immune response to it are likely to be valuable developments 16a wide range of repurposed or novel potential antivirals including polymerase nucleotide synthesis and protease inhibitors and fusion-inhibiting peptides 6691113114115116117 have been investigated 91115 corticosteroid use is not recommended for acute respiratory distress syndrome 113 comparative studies and randomised controlled trials are mostly lacking 91though much is already known it remains important to clarify the routes of human infection including the role of the eyes in contracting infection among primary human cases the development of rapid molecular poct tests and alternatives to serology such as cd8 detection can help us understand mers-cov transmission which can lead to reductions in outbreaks the scale of mild and subclinical cases among non-hospitalised arabian peninsula communities is unknown as is their role in transmission most knowledge of mers comes from studies of hospital-based populations or linked community contacts future prospective long-term cohort studies of mild community respiratory illnesses using molecular methods would be useful children have so far been largely absent from the mers case tally but they may represent an important population for prospective study recent lessons from the zika and ebola viruses should also inform new studies seeking possible long-term sequelae and viral persistence and highlight the need to follow-up severe mers patientsin september 2017 mers-cov passed its fifth year since discovery it remains a rare cause of disease in a geographically defined region of the world known for the concurrent presence of infected camel hosts much of what we know about mers relates to severe disease travel-related cases continue to challenge the rest of the worlds surveillance and response capabilities and we need more data to understand unexplained primary transmission signs of genetic change in mers-cov have been recorded but it remains unclear whether they change clinical disease how camels came to carry the virus they live with today remains unknown but it is academic for the control of mers to date human-to-human transmission has been inefficient but virus surveillance and characterisation will ensure any change to the status quo is identified mers-cov is not currently a pandemic threat it is spread with the aid of human habit and error nevertheless a much needed therapeutic toolbox is being developed and in this process we are learning more about how covs cause disease how they confound our immune responses where they come from and how to prevent and treat their respiratory infections 90 focused research is needed to minimise the impact of mers basing control strategies on evidence gleaned from specifically addressing relevant unknownsthe basic mechanism of autophagy is the sequestration of the structure that has to be degraded by large cytoplasmic double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes the current model is that autophagosomes are formed by expansion and sealing of a small cistern known as the phagophore or isolation membrane figure 1 15 once complete they fuse with the mammalian lysosomes or plant and yeast vacuoles to expose their cargo to the hydrolytic interior of these compartments for degradation in mammalian cells this event is preceded by the fusion with vesicles of the endocytic pathway andor endosomes to form amphisomes figure 1 6 the metabolites generated in the lysosomesvacuoles are subsequently transported in the cytoplasm and used as either an energy source or building blocks for the synthesis of new macromolecules the phagophore is generated at a specialized site known as the phagophore assembly site or preautophagosomal structure pas 15 at this location the key actors of this pathway the autophagy-related genes atgs mediate the formation of the phagophore and its expansion into an autophagosome sixteen atg proteins compose the conserved core atg machinery that catalyses the formation of autophagosomes in all eukaryotes the rest of the atg proteins are organism-specific and most of them are involved in either the regulation of autophagy or dictating the specificity during selective types of autophagy autophagy has been considered for long time a nonselective process for bulk degradation of either long-lived proteins or cytoplasmic components during nutrient deprivation recent evidences however have revealed the existence of numerous types of selective autophagy used by the cell to specifically eliminate unwanted structures including organelles and invading microorganisms 7 under specific conditions autophagosomes can thus exclusively sequester and degrade mitochondria ie mitophagy peroxisomes ie pexophagy endoplasmic reticulum er ie er-phagy or reticulophagy endosomeslysosomes lipid droplets ie lipophagy secretory granules ie zymophagy cytoplasmic aggregates and complexes ie aggrephagy ribosomes ie ribophagy invading pathogens ie xenophagy and so forthbecause of its ability to rapidly eliminate unwanted structures autophagy participates in a multitude of physiological processes essential to maintain cellular and organismal homeostasis such as the adaptation to starvation cell differentiation and development degradation of aberrant structures turnover of superfluous or damaged organelles tumorsuppression innate and adaptive immunity lifespan extension and type ii programmed cell death 1013 as a result a defect or an impairment in this pathway leads to severe illnesses including neurodegenerative cardiovascular chronic inflammatory muscular and autoimmune diseases and some malignancies crucially it has also been shown that autophagy could be a potential therapy to prevent or cure particular diseases including specific types of tumors muscular dystrophies neurodegenerative disorders and selected infections 1419atg1 is a serinethreonine protein kinase that has a key role in autophagy induction 25 different proteins associate to form a complex with atg1 in yeast this kinase is associated with atg13 atg17 and two nonconserved subunits atg29 and atg31 while ulk1 and ulk2 two mammalian redundant atg1 homologues associate with matg13 and fip200 the counterparts of atg13 and atg17 respectively and the nonconserved component atg101 figure 2 2631 the signaling cascade centered on the serinethreonine kinase mammalian target of rapamycin mtor promotes cell growth and anabolism in presence of nutrients 32 this pathway inhibits autophagy through direct modulation of the atg1ulk complex in nutrient rich conditions mtor is associated with the atg1ulk complex via ulk1 or ulk2 and it maintains matg13 phosphorylated 31 3336 under nutrient deprivation mtor dissociates from this complex provoking a dephosphorylation of ulk1 and ulk2 necessary for the activation of their kinase activity and subsequent phosphorylation of fip200 matg13 and ulk12 itself 35 all these modifications are necessary to initiate autophagythis complex is formed by vps34hvps34 vps15p115 atg6beclin1 and atg14atg14l figure 2 and it is essential for the generation of ptdins3p on autophagosomal membranes and for the progression of autophagy 3739 the role in autophagy of this lipid which is found on the surface and interior of autophagosomes 40 41 remains unclear nevertheless one function is to recruit factors such as atg18 to the pas and possibly also to the phagophore the formation of ptdins3p depends on the activity of ptdins3 kinase class iii hvps34 which is present on the surface of various organelles 42 atg14 is a subunit of the autophagy-specific ptdins3k complex both in yeast and in mammals there are at least two different vps34-containing complexes in yeast 43 which in addition to vps34 vps15 and atg6vps30 also possess specific subunits atg14 and vps38 these two last components direct the ptdins3k complexes to specific locations where they generate the ptsins3p pools essential for autophagy and endosomal trafficking respectively a similar situation also appears to be present in mammalian cells with uvrag being the homologue of vps38 38in mammalian cells the ptdins3k complex i also controls autophagy induction when beclin1 self-associates or binds to bcl-xlbcl-2 the lipid kinase activity of hvps34 is inhibited as beclin1 is not part of the complex 37 44 45 upon nutrient deprivation the jnk1 signaling pathway phosphorylates bcl-2 leading to its dissociation from beclin1 which permits this protein to interact with the ptdins3k complex i stimulating ptdins3p synthesis and autophagy induction 45 46 in parallel autophagy positive regulators such as ambra1 and bif-1 promote beclin1 association to hvps34 4749atg9 is another protein that is found at an early stage of the pas formation and it is the only integral membrane protein among the core atg machinery 50 it possesses six conserved transmembrane domains with the two cytoplasm-oriented termini and it is essential for autophagy 51 52 mammalian atg9 matg9 localizes to the trans-golgi network tgn in fed cells and partially to the late endosomes 52 upon autophagy induction by starvation matg9 relocates to the site where autophagosomes are generated possibly the pas andor phagophores 52 53 it has recently been shown however that matg9 positive membranes do interact dynamically with the autophagosomal intermediate rather than becoming integral part of them 53 similarly yeast atg9 is located at the pas and in several cytoplasmic structures which are likely to be directly derived from the golgi 5456 the high mobile cytoplasmic structures are probably 3060 nm vesicles while the less mobile appear to be constituted by clusters of vesicles and tubules 56 which have been named atg9 reservoirs 54 and have also been observed in mammalian cells 53 as in mammalian cells yeast atg9 also cycles between the cytoplasmic pools and the pas but it seems to arrive at the early stage of the formation of this structure and to be retrieved when an autophagosome is formed 54 56several factors regulate atg9 trafficking including the atg1ulk and ptdins3k complexes 52 57 two other core atg proteins atg2 and atg18 are involved in atg9 cycling in particular they appear to mediate atg9 retrieval from the pas 57 58 in yeast atg2 and atg18 form a cytoplasmic complex 59 while the formation of this complex does not require ptdins3p the presence of this lipid at the pas is necessary for its recruitment to this site 59 this is achieved through the capacity of atg18 to directly bind ptsins3p 59 mammals possess 4 atg18 homologues wd-repeat protein interacting with phosphoinositides 1 wipi1 wipi2 wipi3 and wipi4 20 three of them wipi1 wipi2 and wipi4 have been implicated in autophagy 2022 recently two mammalian atg2 homologs atg2a and atg2b have been identified and both are required for autophagy 58 interestingly human wipi4 interacts with atg2a and atg2b as well as caenorhabditis elegans epg-6wipi4 with atg2 21 60 these observations suggest that wipi4epg-6 and yeast atg18 overlap in their role in autophagy by carrying out the functional interconnections with atg2 58the elongation of the phagophores and the completionsealing of autophagosomes appear to rely on the function of these two ubiquitin-like systems figure 2 atg12 an ubiquitin-like molecule is covalently conjugated to atg5 through the activity of atg7 and atg10 an e1- and an e2-like enzyme respectively 23 6163 the atg12-atg5 complex subsequently associates with atg16 forming a large oligomer that localizes to both the pas and the phagophore via atg16 64 the function of the atg12-atg5atg16 oligomer in autophagy is unclear but it seems that it acts as an e3 ligase for the generation of the lipidated form of atg8lc3 65 atg8 is a second ubiquitin-like protein participating in autophagy while yeast has only one copy of atg8 mammalian cells have 6 homologues and all are involved in autophagy 23 24 62 atg8 is posttranslationally processed by the specific cysteine protease atg4 which cleaves its c-terminal amino acids exposing a glycine residue through another ubiquitylation-like reaction mediated by atg7 and the e2-like enzyme atg3 atg8 is covalently conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine pe this lipidation promotes atg8 recruitment and association with autophagosomal membranes 23 6163 in contrast to the rest of the atg proteins which are mainly present on the surface of autophagosomes atg8 is found inside and outside these vesicles when an autophagosome is completed atg4 cleaves the atg8-pe pool on the surface releasing atg8 back in the cytoplasm for reuse atg8 has been shown to be essential for autophagosome formation possibly by mediating tethering and fusion of membranes 66 67 these data however are controversial 68 what is clear is that the atg8 population associated with autophagosome inner membrane is essential for the selective sequestration of specific cargoes and together with them it is degraded in the lysosomevacuole lumen see abovein addition to the atg proteins additional factors play a crucial role in the autophagosome biogenesis especially in high eukaryotes important ones include ambra1 47 48 dfcp1 69 70 and vmp1 70 71 the detailed discussion of the role of these proteins as well as their functional relationship with the different atg functional groups is not the subject of this review and they have been extensively presented elsewhere 15almost all the atg proteins are cytosolic and associate to form the pas by interacting with other atg components andor lipids upon autophagy induction 3 50 72 most of the studies about the pas have been done in yeast and they have revealed that the core atg proteins assemble following a hierarchical order and form this autophagosomal precursor 3 50 72 recent evidences have shown that the pas and the principles of this ordered recruitment are conserved in mammals 70 while these works have proposed a model where one atg protein is at the top of the hierarchical recruitment cascade studies on the selective elimination of either mitochondria or salmonella indicate that the atg proteins can be grouped into clusters which independently assemble to form the pas 7375 interestingly these clusters mirror almost entirely the organization in functional groups of the atg proteinsone of the enigmas in the field of autophagy is the origin of the lipid bilayers composing autophagosomes several cellular compartments including the er golgi endosomes and the plasma membrane have been implicated as the possible source of the autophagosomal membranes by a series of recent studies 7678 this apparent discrepancy between the different reports could be due to the ability of cells to derive the membranes from the most suitable reservoirs depending on the tissues and conditions triggering autophagy thus in a tissue under a specific stress autophagy would be supplied with membranes from an organelle that could guarantee the delivery of a large amounts of lipids 7678 an alternative option would be that the diverse atg functional clusters that come together to generate the pas and the phagophore are associated to membranes derived from different compartments explaining why endosomes the plasma membrane and the golgi have all been shown to contribute to the formation of the early autophagosomal intermediates 76 this model would also explain the involvement of proteins mediating membranes fusion such as the snares in the early stages of autophagosome biogenesis 68 79 thus in addition to unveiling the molecular function of each atg protein the challenge for the future will be to understand the mechanism underlying the integrated interaction between the different atg functional groups which will probably also be key in uncovering the events leading to the assembly of the autophagosomal membranes and possibly identify new mechanisms for the regulation of autophagythe major amount of lipids however is required for the expansion of the phagophore into an autophagosome the current idea is that the er plays a central role in this event because growing phagophores have been observed in close proximity of this organelle 69 80 81 contact sites between these two compartments have been detected 80 81 and therefore it has been postulated that transfers could occur by direct lipid translocation from the er to the nascent autophagosome it remains to be proven whether this unidirectional passage of lipids between these two organelles indeed exists and how this is achievedautophagosomes are ready to fuse with the lysosomevacuole once the vesicle membranes are sealed and the atg machinery is disassembled and released back in the cytoplasm for reuse 72 82 evidence for this latter event has been provided by the observation that atg8lc3 an ubiquitin-like protein that is covalently conjugated to autophagosomal membranes through a reversible linkage to phosphatidylethanolamine pe is not found on the surface of complete vesicles while it is abundantly detected on phagophores and nascent autophagosomes 83 accordingly failure to release atg8 form the autophagosome surface by atg8-pe delipidation leads to an impairment of autophagy 84 85 recently it has been revealed that the turnover of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate ptdins3p a lipid generated at the pas and involved in the recruitment of atg proteins to this location is key in the disassembly of the atg machinery from the surface of yeast autophagosomes 86 this event is a requisite for the fusion of these carriers with the vacuole 86 indicating that the cell possesses a regulatory factor to avoid premature and potentially harmful fusion of incomplete double-membrane vesicles with the vacuolelysosome it remains to be identified this factor or factors that is able to sense the autophagosome completion and thus trigger ptdins3p turnover the atg4-mediated processing of atg8-pe and the release of the rest of the atg machineryautophagy can be induced by numerous environmental and cellular stresses as a result several signaling molecules and cascades have been shown to be involved in the modulation of this pathway 4 8 87 biochemical and pharmacological experiments have highlighted the upstream effector role of atg1ulk1 and ptdins3k complexes in the transduction of these signals into the initiation of autophagosome biogenesis atg9 also appears to participate in the regulation of autophagy 88 89the best-characterized regulator of autophagy is mtor and as already introduced above it represses this pathway by principally blocking the activity of the atg1ulk1 complex through direct phosphorylation 4 8 87 the activity of mtor is stimulated by a variety of anabolic inputs that include the energy and nutrient status of the cell as well as the presence of amino acids and growth factors conversely mtor is inhibited when amino acids are scarce growth factor signaling is reduced andor atp concentrations fall and this results in a derepression of autophagosome biogenesis the energy-sensing amp-activated protein kinase ampk and glucose-sensing protein kinase a pka also regulate the atg1ulk1 complex by direct phosphorylation 9092 the molecular details of these regulations and the cross-talk between them remain to be elucidatednumerous molecules including interferon  ifn tumor necrosis factor  tnf and vitamin d but also receptors such the toll-like receptors tlrs or the pattern recognition receptors pprs have been shown to regulate autophagy as well 13 9395 it is largely unknown how this is achieved but understanding these signaling mechanisms could have the added value of providing the knowledge essential for the development of either treatments or drugs for autophagy-based therapies to cure of specific diseases 14some of the open questions regarding autophagy regulation have accurately been discussed in a recent compendium 96in addition to the core atg machinery the selective types of autophagy rely on specific cargo-recognizing autophagy receptors that assure the cargo sequestration into autophagosomes autophagy receptors are defined as proteins being able to interact directly with both the structure that has to be specifically eliminated by autophagy and the pool of the atg8lc3 protein family members present in the internal surface of growing autophagosomes 7 97 this latter interaction is in most of the cases mediated through a specific sequence present in the autophagy receptors and commonly referred to as the lc3-interacting region lir motif 98 it has recently been shown that particular proteins possessing this motif including atg1ulk1 are also directly turned over by autophagy without the necessity of having an autophagy receptor 30the autophagy receptors for the selective degradation of several complexes and organelles have been identified but others such as those for the specific turnover of the er and ribosomes are still elusive 7 97 one emerging theme is that structures targeted for destruction are ubiquitinylated and a series of autophagy receptors such as p62sqstm1 and nbr1 with an ubiquitin-banding domain and a lir motif promote their sequestration into autophagosomes 7 97 98 while these molecules preferentially recognize short ubiquitin chains 99 it is still unclear why they do not bind other cellular components carrying the same types of posttranslational modification central in understanding these specific elimination processes will be the identification of the e3 ligases and their eventual adaptors involved in marking the autophagy cargoes with ubiquitin smurf1 and sting appear to belong to these two classes of proteins 100 101 the investigation of proteins like these will provide information about how the cell senses and regulates the degradation of unwanted structures by autophagyatg30 and atg32 are two yeast autophagy receptors involved in pexophagy and mitophagy respectively which do not use the ubiquitin system to bind the targeted cargo but nevertheless their study has provided insights into possible mechanisms that could also be used by the e3 ligases 102104 these proteins are present on the surface of peroxisomes and mitochondria respectively and under mitophagy and peroxisome-inducing conditions they get phosphorylated by signaling cascades activated under these conditions 102 105 106 the phosphorylation of atg30 and atg32 promotes the association and recruitment of atg11 which in turn triggers the assembly of the atg machinery mediating the formation of a double-membrane vesicle around the organelle 102104 atg30 is present in pichia pastoris but not in saccharomyces cerevisiae which uses a different molecule for perxophagy that is atg36 107 atg30 is a soluble protein that becomes phosphorylated when pexophagy is stimulated this modification leads to its recruitment onto the peroxisome surface and its subsequent biding to atg11 results in a selective engulfment of peroxisome by autophagosomes 107for a long time autophagy has been considered a degradative transport route but recent discoveries have begun to change this view the yeast cytosol-to-vacuole transport cvt pathway is a biosynthetic selective type of autophagy that delivers a subset of hydrolases into the vacuole 108 shortly after synthesis the proform of these hydrolases assembles into a large cytoplasmic oligomer which is subsequently sequestered into a double-membrane vesicle that fuses with the vacuole in the vacuole the resident proteases cleave the profragment of the hydrolases composing the oligomer leading to both their activation and the disassembly of this structure 108for long the transport function of the cvt pathway has been considered an exception in the field of autophagy recently it has been shown that the extracellular delivery of the cytosolic acyl coenzyme-a-coa- binding protein in the yeast pichia pastoris and saccharomyces cerevisiae acbp and the social amoebae dictyostelium discoideum acba which occurs under starvation conditions is not mediated by the secretory pathway 109 110 the used unconventional transport route depends on the atg and the golgi reassembly and stacking protein graspgrh1 109 110 suggesting that autophagosomes could be the hallmark of this type of unconventional secretion this notion is supported by work in yeast s cerevisiae that has revealed that when this new transport route is triggered by starvation grh1 is recruited to membranous structures that are positive for atg8 and atg9 111 and morphologically and molecularly resemble to precursor structures involved in autophagy 54 interestingly the unconventional secretion of cytosolic il-1 and hmgb1 by macrophages upon their stimulation with either starvation or lipopolysaccharides- lps- treatment also requires the atg and grasp55 one of the paralogues of graspgrh1 indicating that this process could be conserved among eukaryotes 112 additionally autophagosomes expel engulfed material mostly of plasma membrane origin by fusing with the plasma membrane during the last stages of reticulocytes maturation into erythrocytes intracellular turnover is not possible because lysosomes are absent in these cells 113 finally it has been hypothesized that picornaviruses exploit autophagosomes to secrete their newly synthesized virions 114 and while it was assumed that these viruses were somehow hijacking and diverting these carriers one emerging possibility could be that they take advantage of an existing type of autophagy mediating the extracellular delivery of specific cytosolic componentsunder er stress conditions that activate the unfolded protein response upr yeast cells expand their er volume to probably accommodate newly synthesized chaperones and to buffer the accumulation of unfolded proteins under upr-inducing conditions this phenomenon is accompanied by the formation and accumulation of autophagosomes that are densely and selectively packed with er membranes 115 very surprisingly the er sequestration into autophagosomes and not its degradation is the crucial step allowing the cell to survive under these stress conditions 115 while it remains totally unknown the fate of these autophagosomes these data highlight the possibility that in specific situations autophagosomes could be persistent organelles rather than transport carriers a notion somehow reminiscent with those infections where pathogens subvert autophagy to use autophagosomes as a platform for their intracellular replication 116a completely new research area is the study of those forms of autophagy that do not require all the components of the core atg machinery which until recently were believed to be the absolute requirement for the generation of autophagosomes 117 118 one of the first reports describing one of these alternative processes of autophagy showed that when cells are subjected to particular stresses such as the treatment with the cytotoxic compound etoposide they can form autophagosomes out of the golgi and perform autophagy-mediated protein degradation in an atg5- atg7- atg9- and atg16-independent way 119 nonetheless this pathway still requires ulk1atg1 fip200atg17 beclin1atg6 and hvps34vps34 119 beclin1 however has been shown to be dispensable for autophagy in several situations most of which involved treatment of cells with proapoptotic compounds such as the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium staurosporine mk801 resveratrol and z18 120124 the autophagy-specific ptdins3k complex i controls autophagy induction and beclin1 can be part of it when beclin1 self-associates or binds to bcl-xlbcl-2 the lipid kinase activity of hvps34 is inhibited as beclin1 is not part of this complex 37 44 45 upon nutrient deprivation the jnk1 signaling pathway phosphorylates bcl-2 leading to its dissociation from beclin1 which permits this protein to interact with the ptdins3k complex i stimulating ptdins3p synthesis and autophagy induction 45 46 because the beclin1-independent types of autophagy still entirely or partially require the generation of ptdins3p 121 125 126 one possibility is that ptdins3k complex i is stimulated in a different way under conditions that trigger this alternative pathway a lot still need to be understood about the mechanism of these unconventional types of autophagy and future studies will also tell us why the cell utilizes themone of the principal assumptions of the field of autophagy has been that the atg proteins are involved in autophagosome biogenesis exclusively studies on the role of autophagy in immunity especially in the context of specific viral and bacterial infections have revealed a different picture there are now several experimental findings showing that individual atg proteins or atg functional groups can also be part of other processesthe erad tuning is a transport pathway out of the er that mediates the rapid turnover of specific erad factors in the endosomal system 127129 in the er sel1l a single transmembrane protein cargo receptor binds and sorts these erad factors into vesicles called edemosomes 130 the cytoplasmic tail of sel1l binds to the nonlipidated form of lc3 that is lc3-i and as a result the edemosomes are lc3-i-positive 128 130 this notion of an unconventional use of lc3 by the erad tuning which does not depend on an intact atg machinery has been reinforced by the observation that atg5 and atg7 are not involved in this pathway 128 131 and the end product of the two autophagy conjugation systems to which these two proteins belong to that is lipidated atg8lc3 also known as lc3-ii 62 is not present on the edemosomes 128 the molecular function of lc3-i in the erad tuning is unclear and one hypothesis is that it acts as an adaptor to a not yet identified vesicle protein coat alternatively the capacity of lc3 to associate with microtubules 132 could permit the edemosome to traffic following routes traced by the cytoskeleton coronavirus cov cell infection is characterized by the formation of reticulovesicular networks of double-membrane vesicles dmvs and convoluted membranes onto which replication-transcription complexes are associated studies with the mouse hepatitis virus mhv a cov have revealed that the atg5 and atg7 gene products are not required for the formation of the virus-induced dmvs and accordingly lc3-ii is not present on these structures 131 133 in contrast lc3-i decorates the mhv-induced dmvs and the depletion of this protein blocks virus replication 131 what has been shown is that cov hijack the erad tuning by probably coopting sel1l because this receptor also localizes to the mhv-induced dmvs and the virus replication is severely impaired when it is depleted 130 interestingly the equine arteritis virus eav a member of the arterivirus virus family that belongs to the nidoviralesorder like the cov is also hijacking the lc3-i-positive membranes of the erad tuning to replicate in host cells 134 finally and similarly to cov lc3-i but not lc3-ii is associated to and essential for the formation of the intracellular inclusions of the chlamydia trachomatis 135 the generation of the c trachomatis inclusions also does not require an intact atg machinery 135 136 but it remains unknown whether this bacterium is subverting the erad tuning as well
brucella abortus ensures its intracellular survival by forming the brucella-containing vacuoles bcvs which traffic from the endocytic compartment to the er where this bacterium proliferates 137 the replication of brucella in the er is followed by conversion of the bcvs into compartments with autophagic features that have been named autophagic bcvs abcvs 138 the abcvs formation is essential for both the intracellular life cycle and cell-to-cell spreading of brucella and requires proteins involved in the induction of autophagosome biogenesis such as ulk1 beclin1 and atg14l and the ptdins3k activity 138 the generation of the abcvs however does not require proteins of the two conjugation systems like atg5 atg16l1 atg4b atg7 and lc3b 138 it remains to be understood whether this microbe is either subverting part of the atg machinery or exploiting a pathway that uses a subset of the atg proteinsa somehow opposite situation is observed in osteoclasts these cells resorb bone tissue by removing its mineralized matrix and breaking up the organic bone principally composed by collagen 139 for this resorption the osteoclasts form specialized plasma membrane protrusions the ruffled borders which are opposed to the surface of the bone tissue 139 the acidification of this bone-osteoclast resorptive microenvironment and the deposit of proteases such as cathepsin k is achieved through the fusion of tissue-specific secretory lysosomes with the plasma membrane it has been revealed that atg proteins which are part of the two conjugation systems including atg5 atg7 atg4b and lc3 play an important role in the fusion of these secretory lysosomes with the plasma membrane and subsequent formation of the ruffled border 140 this process very likely does not represent a situation like the ones described above where autophagosomes fuse with the plasma membrane because secretory lysosomes are single membrane vesicles and their cargo is not cytoplasmic it will be interesting in the future to determine whether atg belonging to other atg functional groups are also involved in this type of secretiona similar process involving the two atg conjugation systems in organelle fusion has also recently been characterized in phagocytic cells and termed lc3-associated phagocytosis lap in macrophages and other cell types uptaking apoptotic and necrotic cells but also yeast or latex beads-conjugated lps lc3 is rapidly recruited to phagosomes in a manner that depends on atg5 atg7 beclin1 and hvps34 141143 work in c elegans on the same process has also implicate atg18wipi 144 while it is unclear whether beclin1 and hvps34 are recruited as part of the autophagy-specific ptdins3k complex i what has been shown is that lap does not require ulk1 and fib200 revealing that the atg1ulk complex does not participate in this pathway 141 142 the translocation of lc3 onto phagosomes during lap is not due to the fusion of autophagosomes with phagosomes as it has been observed for example during the killing of mycobacterium 145 indicating a probable direct conjugation of lc3 to the limiting membrane of this latter organelle 142 143 interestingly lc3 association to phagosomes promotes their fusion with lysosomes leading to a rapid acidification and enhanced killing of the ingested organism 141143another documented case where it has been shown that cells have the capacity to use a portion of the atg machinery as part or not of another pathway is the ifn-mediated antiviral response in macrophages 146 in particular it has been shown that the direct antiviral activity of ifn against murine norovirus which involves an inhibition of the formation of the membranous cytoplasmic replication complexes of this virus depends on the atg5-atg12 conjugate atg7 and atg16l1 but not on the induction of autophagy fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes and the degradative activity of lysosomes 146 in addition this response does not require the atg8lc3-processing protein atg4b indicating that it uses just one of the two conjugation systems it remains unclear how atg5-atg12 and atg16l1 are carrying out their antiviral action but interestingly atg16l1 is detected on the norovirus replication complexes indicating that these proteins could affect the organization of the membranes harboring them andor the replication machinery few questions still have to be answered in our way to understand the contribution of these atg proteins in the direct ifn-mediated antiviral response first it must be determined whether atg4b is substituted by one or more of its homologues eg atg4a atg4c and atg4d before excluding the participation of the second conjugation system second it will be interesting to analyze whether components of the other atg functional groups are involved in this responsethe study of autophagy has attracted a lot of interest in the past years because of its multiple physiological and pathological implications while major advances have been achieved in understanding the regulation the mechanism and the cellular roles of this versatile transport pathway the new discoveries have unveiled new interesting aspects and their in-depth exploration will keep researchers busy for the next few decades with the increasing number of laboratories starting to investigate autophagy in tissues organisms and diseases so far unexplored it is easy to predict that the future will be full of surprises and autophagy will continue to astonish us for some time
mammalian viruses represent a diverse group of infectious agents the viruses that cause the common diseases of man and domestic animals comprise approximately 25 known families which fall into groups according to their genome and replication strategies some important examples of these viruses are summarized in table 131
over recent years knowledge of the complete nucleotide sequences has enhanced our understanding of the interrelationships between virus nucleic acids and relevant host genes such molecular studies see chapter 3 indicate that there are homologies between viral and host proteins of particular interest to the antiviral field are those involved with genome replication and other virus enzymes although no host enzymes exist in eukaryotes to replicate rna a prerequisite for all rna viruses and reverse transcriptase rt has no corresponding host function many viral and host genes appear to have common origins these findings support the view that during the coevolution of virus and host cell there have been exchanges of functional modules mediated by several forms of genetic recombination further evolution of modern viruses is continuing with mutations substitutions additions deletions recombinations or reassortments holland and domingo 1998modern viruses have developed through their evolutionary history an extraordinary diversity of strategies for their efficient replication and survival counteracting both innate and adaptive immune responses for example herpes simplex virus hsv and varicella-zoster virus vzv have a latent state enabling the virus to survive lifelong in the host reactivation at intervals allows the herpesvirus to spread to new individuals enabling transmission through space and time in contrast influenza virus is usually cleared from the host within days or weeks but has the ability to spread rapidly from person to person potentially worldwide only in the relatively recent past since jenners first use of cowpox as a vaccine for human smallpox have viruses faced a new threat to their replicationhuman intervention faced with vaccines and specific antiviral compounds some viruses appear to be poorly adapted to survive a well-known example is smallpox which was eliminated from the human population by vaccination similarly poliovirus has been eradicated from most countries of the world the use of vaccines has greatly reduced the burden of human disease caused by several other human viruses eg rubella mumps measles hepatitis a hav and hepatitis b hbv nevertheless there seems to be no prospect of eradicating these viruses in the near future and patients with chronic hbv cannot be cured by vaccination in complete contrast several human viruses have through their evolutionary history developed survival strategies which happen to enable them to resist vaccines eg human immunodeficiency virus hiv and hepatitis c hcv specific antiviral compounds have been developed for several of those viral infections that have not been adequately controlled by vaccines examples of widely licensed compounds are given in table 132
this review aims to explore general mechanisms of virus resistance we start by summarizing those evolutionary outcomes that have enabled human viruses to resist mankinds best efforts at control the review then focuses on how viruses acquire resistance to compounds that specifically target a virus protein eg polymerase
protease integrase sialidase for the therapy of chronic viral infections such as hiv the concept of the genetic barrier has emerged as key factor for delaying antiviral resistance in some cases the price to the virus of gaining resistance may be reduced fitness there may however be other less obvious effectsconceptually one way to avoid virus resistance is to use a compound to target a host protein rather than a viral protein such an approach seems to risk causing unacceptable toxicity although recently it has been shown that there can be specificity for the virus-infected cell we end by asking the question how will viruses respond to such an indirect challengeherpesviruses establish a latent state that enables the virus to remain in the host for a lifetime despite normal adaptive immune responses the latent virus can reactivate at intervals with or without clinical signs antivirals are effective at reducing virus replication during an acute episode but currently there are no therapies that remove latent herpesvirus infections hsv vzv and human cytomegalovirus hcmv have been major and successful antiviral targets for three decades acyclovir acv being the first antiviral drug to be both potent and selective acv was followed by famciclovir fcv prodrug of penciclovir pcv and valaciclovir vacv prodrug of acv which are used to treat or suppress hsv-1 hsv-2 and vzv and ganciclovir gcv for hcmv although these have been used clinically worldwide and have helped patients manage their herpes infections the latent virus remains as a potential source of reactivationanother way in which a virus can establish a form of latency is by means of integration of a dna copy of the genome soon after infecting a cell hiv rna is the template for the viral rt to synthesize hiv dna which is then integrated into cellular dna those current therapies which inhibit the viral rt rtis or which target the viral protease pis have no direct effect on integrated viral dna the integrase inhibitors prevent the integration process but have no effect on viral dna already integrated into host dna because some cells contain integrated hiv dna which remains quiescent latent it has been impossible to cure hiv-infected patients by clearing the hiv completely notwithstanding the fact that combination therapy has given good clinical control of the symptomatic diseasethere are two well-studied examples rhinovirus common cold and papillomavirus wart viruseven at the research stage with rhinoviruses no compound showed activity against all serotypes eg pleconaril is active against about 70 of serotypes although this compound was selected for development one of the potential problems was that it could not be clinically effective against all rhinovirus serotypes let alone against all viruses causing similar symptoms the development of pleconaril was terminated due to toxicological considerationsfor the second example papillomavirus vaccines designed to prevent carcinoma of the cervix seem very effective against the targeted virus strains papilloma types 16 and 18 but give little or no protection against those remaining strains which are associated with a minority of carcinomas types 16 and 18 are associated with 7075 of cervical cancers 70 of vaginal cancers and 50 of vulvar cancers to protect against essentially all these cancers it would be necessary to have vaccines for about 13 types of papilloma with types 45 31 33 52 58 and 35 being the most important after 16 and 18 the current vaccines cervarix gsk and gardasil msd contain antigenic proteins from types 16 and 18 in addition gardisil includes types 6 and 11 which cause 90 of genital warts not associated with cancers will other strains not countered by the vaccines now become more prominentthe mutation rate of a virus has been described as the probability that during a single replication of the virus genome a particular nucleotide position is altered smith and inglis 1987 while mutation frequencies are directly measurable in practice it is extremely difficult to convert this to a rate drake and holland 1999 the rate may however be reduced if many potential mutations lead to nonviable virions for example hbv has overlapping reading frames for the surface antigen and the polymerase as a consequence some mutations in the surface antigen may cause the polymerase to be nonfunctionalthere is a consensus that rna viruses have relatively high mutation rates compared with dna viruses by two orders of magnitude or more average misincorporations per nucleotide base in rna viruses have been reported to be of the order 104 to 105 holland and domingo 1998 this is thought at least in part to be a consequence of the lack of proofreading and mismatch repairconventionally dna viruses are considered to have low mutation rates relative to rna viruses even so this may be perhaps a 100-fold higher than that of host dna as a consequence there will be low proportions of mutant viruses sometimes referred to as polymorphisms within an infected individual it is becoming recognized that pre-existing polymorphisms may include resistant mutants that greatly increase the rate in tissue culture at which dna viruses develop antiviral resistance compared with the appearance of resistance due to spontaneous mutations however with rapidly mutating rna viruses eg hiv or hcv there may be no practical distinction between pre-existing and de novo resistance mutationsmutation rate alone does not determine how soon resistant virus will appear in clinical practice there are other important factors including the number of virions formed per day in the patient and the proportion of progeny that are fit furthermore in some cases fitness may require compensating mutations section 135 this combination of factors we shall call resistance ratehiv and hcv are two viruses that produce huge numbers of virions each day ca 109 and 1012 virionsday respectively in untreated patients field and vere hodge 2008 the large population of new virions coupled with high rates of mutation ca 104 can quickly lead to enormous genetic diversity within a single infected host for example hiv has a single-strand rna genome of approximately 9000 nucleotides the replication rate in an infected individual has been estimated to be approximately 109 daily thus 10490001099108 mutants occur each day this means that in theory every point mutation occurs 105 times per day in an hiv-infected individual and every double mutant 10 times per day as a result hiv actually exists as a quasi-species or swarm around a particular consensus sequence similarly hcv exists as quasi-species it has the fastest known daily replication rate of 1012 virions dailyamong different viruses there is a huge range of resistance rates and this has clinical consequences table 133
with the production rate of new virions being a key factor in resistance rate this emphasizes the importance of reducing viral replication eg hiv and hcv as quickly as possible after commencing therapy since a large eg 8 log10 reduction in replication will give a corresponding reduction in the formation and selection of resistant mutants it is crucially important to keep viral replication at the lowest possible level both throughout a single day and during a long course of therapy missed doses and drug holidays can give the virus a better chance to mutate and so become resistant
in spite of the many strategies for viral replication and transmission as summarized briefly above all viruses have one main mechanism for development of resistance to antiviral compounds and vaccinesthe selection of random mutations darwins theory of evolutionrandom changes followed by survival of the fittestis well illustrated in the virus field at least for some viruses the evolution of resistance can be followed in days or weeks as the genome replication and mutation rates leading to random changes are so high sequence analysis of the dna or rna shows that a particular resistant variant may have one or more base changes that account for resistance usually confirmed by the introduction of the same mutations by means of site-directed mutagenesis into a wild type wt background other mutations may be random changes with no particular consequences for the viability of the virus for example there may be base changes that neither alter the encoded amino acid nor cause significant change to the rna secondary structure in dna viruses such variants are commonly referred to as polymorphisms in those rna viruses which mutate rapidly the huge number of variants are called quasi-species in a natural infection under pressure from antiviral therapy the proportion of wt virus decreases markedly whereas the resistant variant either as a pre-existing minor variant or a newly formed mutant becomes dominantseveral families of rna virus have segmented genomes table 131 the clinically most important is influenza which has eight segments these viruses have an additional mechanism of acquiring resistance when two strains co-infect a cell in theory the gene segments may re-assort in every possible combination this gives the possibility for a drug-resistant virus which has a poor ability to transmit to re-assort with a highly infectious but drug-sensitive virus so that some of the progeny viruses will be highly infectious and drug-resistantin the 2009 pandemic h1n1 influenza the eight rna segments or genes were recently derived from avian two segments swine from two continents five segments and human one segment viruses presumably in a series of re-assortments in this case the resulting virus was not a drug-resistant strain but one to which the general human population at least those under about 60 years old did not have effective immunity it was fortunate that the initial widespread transmission of this virus did not cause devastating burden of illness and deaths there were only a few reports of oseltamivir-resistant influenza section 1364 during the first year of the pandemicin some instances a single mutation leads to high-level resistance to the antiviral compound and the virus appears to remain fully fit an example is the m2 channel-blocking inhibitors amantadine and rimantadine which had activity against influenza viruses resistant variants are selected so quickly that a treated person can pass on resistant virus to contacts being fully fit the resistant virus is easily spread during the 20052006 season in the united states 109120 91 of h3n2 clinical isolates were resistant to amantadine and rimantadine this has severely limited the clinical usefulness of these drugsin contrast to amantadine and rimantadine there is often a slower evolution of resistance to antiviral compounds that act as substrate mimics for a viral enzyme and so bind to the catalytic site most potential mutations will give a nonfunctional enzyme and a nonviable or less fit virus there may be very few even a single specific mutations that interfere with the binding of the antiviral compound to the enzyme yet does not reduce by too much the catalytic activity such mutations which usually appear first are therefore termed primary mutations initially the degree of resistance may be modest and so there is pressure to create additional secondary mutations which enhance the level of resistance to the drug these structural changes often result in reduced catalytic activity and probably will affect the fitness of the virus the term fitness embraces not only the viability or replication rate of the virus but may also include effectiveness of immune evasion genes transmission etc so yet further mutations may appear which are apparently unrelated to the protein sites that interact with the drug such tertiary mutations may have no direct effect on biochemical drugprotein binding but may increase enzyme efficiency so as to compensate for the deleterious effects of the primary and secondary mutations many compensating mutations are suspected but often their precise role has yet to be elucidated of course virus mutations do not always fit tidily into these human concepts there may be a step mutation which then allows further mutations in the case of hiv protease both the protease and the corresponding cleavage sites can co-mutate to give cross-resistance to pis section 1363cidofovir hpmpc is used clinically to treat aids-associated cytomegalovirus retinitis but has also been shown in cell culture and animal tests to be an effective therapy against poxviruses it has been suggested that cidofovir or a less toxic prodrug with improved bioavailability could be stockpiled for use in the event of malicious introduction of smallpox a study by andrei et al 2006 investigated the mutations giving resistance to hpmpc and if the drug resistance was inextricably linked to reduced virulence if this were the case then there would be no reason for malicious introduction of mutations conferring resistancedrug-resistant vaccinia virus vv was obtained by serial passage of the virus in cell cultures with increasing concentrations of hpmpc in parallel wt virus was passaged in drug-free cultures from the final passage seven plaque-purified hpmpc-resistant hpmpcr isolates and five plaque-purified wt isolates were obtained as it was thought that resistance to hpmpc would be due to mutations in the viral dna polymerase gene e9l this gene was sequenced for each of these isolates the results are summarized in table 134
it was known that the original stock of vv contained polymorphisms in particular at amino acid residue 420 a second polymorphic locus was found at positions 936 to 938 two clones suffered a small in-frame deletion however all wt clones were equally sensitive to hpmpc and so these polymorphisms were unlikely to be related to drug resistance therefore it seemed likely that only two point mutations a314t and a684v were potentially associated with resistance these are within the 35exonuclease proofreading domain and the polymerase catalytic domain respectively marker rescue methods were used to investigate the role of each of these in drug resistance the cloned dna encoded a314t a684v or both a314t and a684v mutants as a control wt dna was included to test for any of the polymorphisms having an effect on drug resistance the results showed that a314t and a684v contributed to resistance but both together gave the greater resistance about 10-fold to hpmpc during the serial passaging it seems that the a314t mutation appeared first followed by the a684v mutation an example of primary and secondary mutationsall three hpmpcr recombinant viruses exhibited reduced virulence in mice ie the mutants were less fit with both mutations together the reduction in virulence was about 100-fold to test for efficacy of hpmpc against this resistant virus mice were challenged with 4000 pfu which caused considerable loss in body weight but nearly all mice survived mice treated with hpmpc at 10 mgkg daily had a small transient weight loss whereas those treated with 50 mgkg daily were similar to uninfected controls although one must be cautious that this result has been shown only for one animal species it is encouraging that hpmpc would be expected to give useful cover against malicious vaccinia release even if the resistant mutations were introducedthe nucleoside analogs vacv fcv and gcv owe their high selectivity to the fact that their activity requires phosphorylation by a viral enzyme for acv and pcv it is the viral thymidine kinase tk enzyme for gcv the ul97 kinase the corresponding monophosphate is then further phosphorylated to the triphosphate by cellular enzymes it is the triphosphate that interacts with the viral dna polymerase and terminates viral dna replication the pyrophosphate analog foscarnet and the cyclic phosphonates eg adefovir do not require the initial phosphorylation step by a viral enzyme and so their selectivity depends solely on their preferential inhibition of the viral dna polymerase the recently described vzv inhibitor fv100 requires phosphorylation by the vzv tk but too little of the triphosphate is formed to account for its activity its mechanism remains a puzzlemutant viruses with acquired resistance to all these compounds can be selected in tissue culture resistance-conferring mutations can be detected in the target proteins involved in the mechanism of action of each of the drugs mutations in the tk gene may lead to an ablation of this enzyme thus conferring cross-resistance between acv pcv and other compounds that require this phosphorylation step a wide variety of different mutations can give rise to a truncated or nonfunctional tk polypeptide and loss of enzyme activity clinical and laboratory isolates of hsv typically contain of 104 tk-defective variants since a single plaque produced in a tissue culture contains 105 infectious virions it may be seen that tk-mediated resistance develops rapidly in tissue culture early work on acv demonstrated that clinical isolates also contain tk-defective variants at high frequency paris and harrington 1982another mechanism for the development of resistance are mutations leading to single amino acid residue substitutions in tk or dna polymerase which reduces the affinity of the drug to the enzyme but maintains at least in part the enzymic activity such changes occur at about two orders of magnitude less frequently ca 106 in tissue culture-grown virus but have been shown to account for clinical drug resistance in hsv vzv and hcmv andrei et al 2007the helicase-primase inhibitors hpis represent a new generation of antiviral compounds active against hsv and vzv it was shown that resistance mutations to bay 57-1293 occur in the helicase gene most being located to a group of residues just downstream from the fourth functional motif for example the substitution k356n accounts for 5000-fold resistance such mutations are apparent at a frequency of 106 in tissue culture for many virus isolates surprisingly it was observed that both laboratory isolates and some recent clinical isolates contain hpi resistance mutations at 100-fold higher frequency sukla et al 2010 pcr amplification experiments and other evidence shows beyond doubt that such mutations exist at high frequency as polymorphisms in the virus population prior to drug exposure biswas et al 2007while herpesvirus drug-resistance occurs at relatively high frequency in tissue culture the widespread clinical use of herpesvirus antivirals is rarely limited by the emergence of resistance in immunocompetent patients indeed large-scale screening of isolates of both hsv-1 and hsv-2 obtained from typical lesions of labial or genital herpes show no obvious trends to resistance 1 after extensive use over the period from the early 1980s to date bacon et al 2003 however resistance to nucleoside analogs does appear to be more common in patients with neonatal hsv and herpes keratitis in the former resistance may be observed in 5 of patients and for ocular isolates from herpes keratitis
duan et al 2008 reported that 11173 64 patients yielded resistant isolates and 1011 of these isolates mapped to tk with these authors arguing that the cornea represents an immunologically privileged site in immunocompromised patients resistance to acv and similar drugs has commonly been reported in about 5 of patients and in some cases up to 20 often such viruses comprise mixtures of wild-type together with one or more different resistant mutants there may be two reasons underlying the apparent divergence between results in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients most important many resistance mutations clearly result in loss of virus fitness this is most easily demonstrated for tk-defective strains in a variety of animal models such strains are much less neuropathogenic field and wildy 1978 and while they can establish a latent infection these seem unable to reactivate efficiently to produce infectious virus see 1383 also other resistance mutations undoubtedly result in subtle defects that may diminish the ability of the virus to reactivate efficiently from latency andor replicate successfully secondly the establishment of neuronal latency with wt virions during primary infection means that subsequent reactivations originate from the pool of sensitive virusthe discovery of high frequency of resistance mutations or polymorphisms in clinical isolates of hsv challenges the dogma that large dna viruses display high genetic stability while the genome is generally highly conserved it is still not clear why frequency of particular resistance mutations leading to single amino acid substitution at defined loci may be as high as 104 in some strains perhaps herpesviruses are able to generate some constrained genetic flexibility during dna replication to overcome host heterogeneity provide tropism for biological sites andor enable immune avoidance however the mechanism for this intriguing ability has yet to be determinedfinally where herpesvirus resistance has become a recognized problem such as in herpes keratitis neonatal herpes and herpes in the immunocompromised patient the lessons learned from hiv and hepatitis viruses will be applied in the form of drug combinations these will most likely involve nucleoside analogs in combination with the ether-lipid analog of cidofovir cmx001 hpis and other novel compoundsresistance to hiv protease inhibitors provides good examples of stepwise mutations molla et al 1996 primary secondary and tertiary as defined above section 133 at the time of a review by schafer 2002 there were six protease inhibitors pis approved in the united statesamprenavir indinavir lopinavir nelfinavir ritonavir and saquinavir for all these the primary mutation occurs in the substrate cleft of the protease thereby reducing the affinity of the inhibitor these primary mutations generally reduce the activity of the compounds by only 2- to 5-fold not enough to be clinically resistant but sufficient to confer a selective advantage to the virus these variants will overtake the wt hiv and allow other mutations to develop for indinavir and ritonavir the first mutation is v82atfs for nelfinavir d30n for other pis especially saquinavir the first mutation is often l90m clavel and hance 2004 the second mutation for indinavir ritonavir saquinavir and amprenavir is i84v and for nelfinavir n88ds further mutations can occur in the protease flap generally i54v but also i54tlm by the time there are about six mutations the new strain is likely to be highly resistant and have cross-resistance against several pisthere are many other reported mutations which may be considered to be tertiary mutations helping to restore viral fitness but their role has not been defined remarkably viral fitness can also be increased by mutations in hiv gag the main viral substrate of the protease such gag mutations a431v and l449f can improve the ability of the protease of resistant strains to interact with the substraterational design programs led to development of the neuraminidase na or sialidase inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir both compounds block the action of the essential virus function na which is required by influenza for efficient release of infectious progeny these compounds are generally held to be efficacious dutowski 2010oseltamivir has been prescribed far more often in japan than elsewhere thus oseltamivir-resistance has been investigated in this population there have been several reports of na-inhibitor resistance among clinical isolates for example a study in japan found that 9 of 50 children with influenza a h3n2 virus infection who had been treated with oseltamivir had a virus with drug resistance although it was suggested that these mutations were less fit than the wt viruses from which they were derived kiso et al 2004 one study followed resistance from 1996 through 2007 tashiro et al 2009 during the period 19962002 influenza a n2 viruses were circulating but no resistant viruses were detected 0175 during the season 20032004 03 31180 of n2 samples were resistant during the following three seasons no n2 resistant viruses were detected but n1 virus started circulating in 20042005 and 20062007 no resistant viruses were detected but in 20052006 3 4132 were found this survey confirms that resistance to oseltamivir occurs in the normal population far less readily than does resistance to amantadine unfortunately the situation changed dramatically and globally within 3 years okomo-adhiambo et al 2010 among seasonal h1n1 influenza the proportions of oseltamivir-resistant viruses were low ca 1 in 20062007 but then resistance emerged rapidly worldwide in the united states high-level resistance 100- to 3000-fold was found in about 20 of samples tested in 20072008 and about 90 in 20082009 sequencing confirmed the h275y mutation in resistant strains it appears that a natural spontaneously arising variant had spread globally without drug selection pressure during 20072008 early work in cell culture and animals suggested that the h275y mutant virus was somewhat disabled but there seems to have been co-selection of other compensating mutations perhaps to the hemagglutin gene ha to give a fit virus enabling this variant to spread globally
among the circulating human influenza viruses there are three subtypes of neuraminidase na influenza a types n1 and n2 and influenza b na these nas differ in the structure of a pocket adjacent to the active site of the enzyme oseltamivir makes use of this pocket in binding to the na and so resistance can occur with mutations with n1 just a single mutation h275y gives high-level resistance but the corresponding mutation in n2 h274y does not give resistance instead two mutations e119v and r292k give high-level resistance with n2 with influenza b na r152k and d198n give resistance generally these mutations affecting the pocket do not give cross-resistance to zanamivir but there are some na mutations which do so for example r371k with influenza b r152k and d198n give cross-resistance however it seems that such strains may be disabled as zanamivir resistance has been isolated only rarely in the clinicin clinical studies on oseltamivir resistance it has been noted that resistance occurs at a higher rate in influenza with n1 than n2 presumably because it takes just a single mutation h275y to give high-level resistance with n1 for example in a study of oseltamivir-treated children during 20052007 stephenson et al 2009 resistance was detected in 311 27 with influenza a h1n1 134 3 h3n2 and 019 with influenza bduring the h1n1 pandemic of 20092010 resistance to oseltamivir has been reported in case studies of seriously ill patients fortunately human-to-human spread has occurred sporadically in geographically dispersed regions virtually all the resistant viruses have had the h275y mutation other than these few cases oseltamivir has been used widely during the pandemic and seems to have not been associated with resistance in the general population this situation could easily change with such high proportion of resistance among the seasonal n1 influenza and with influenza viruses having the ability to re-assort it seems likely that the threat of resistant pandemic h1n1 is ever-presentwhen a virus is being inhibited by an antiviral compound resistance mutations are selected but the ease with which this is done depends upon how many potential mutations can give resistance without compromising virus fitness this has become known as the genetic barrierthe anti-influenza m2 channel blockers amantadine and rimantadine and anti-picornarvirus capsid-binding compounds such as pleconaril are examples of agents which present too low a genetic barrier to become useful clinical monotherapies such compounds may give added benefit if always used in drug combinations without ever being used alonethe importance of the genetic barrier concept has been emphasized by experience from testing combinations of drugs active against hiv there are three major classes of anti-hiv compounds nucleosidenucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors nrtis non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors nnrtis and pis more recently a fusion inhibitor hiv integrase inhibitors and a receptor-binding blocker have also become available with monotherapies resistance appears quickly with nnrtis but more slowly with nrtis which also target rt but at its catalytic site it appears that mutations at an allosteric site are more readily accommodated than mutations at the catalytic sitesimilarly for pis which target the protease catalytic site the rate of appearance of resistance is about comparable to that for nrtis it was thought that combining one nrti and one pi would delay the appearance of resistance greatly but clinical practice showed that the delay was modest the gain from such combinations of drugs is probably due to the faster reduction in the rate of virus replication virionsday thus reducing the opportunities for creating resistant mutants however aside from this factor it is as easy to form resistant mutants one in the rt and one in the protease as for the monotherapies it is more effective to combine two or three compounds that target the same hiv enzyme an ideal situation is when the resistance mutations to one drug confer enhanced sensitivity to the other even with drugs which have differing mutation patterns the aim is to have no possible mutations without causing a large reduction in enzyme efficiency in summary one high genetic barrier is more effective in delaying resistance than two low genetic barriersan example of a commonly used combination therapy for hiv is atripla gilead and bms jointly this single pill contains three compounds emtricitabine tenofovir efavirenz or two nrtis and a nnrti respectively another example is trizivir gsk combining the three nrtis zidovudine lamivudine and abacavir these combination pills targeting the hiv rt are often used with an hiv protease inhibitor when used correctly these multi-drug therapies provide good control of hiv replication and symptoms and have prevented resistance development for at least several yearsthe experience with hiv should guide rational choice of compounds for combination therapies for influenza of the two neuraminidase inhibitors nis oseltamivir has been much the more widely prescribed than zanamivir inhaled but fortunately zanamivir retains activity against the h274y h275y in n1 numbering mutant resistant to oseltamivir zanamivir is now being developed as an iv drug for use in seriously ill patients peramivir another ni is also being developed as an iv drug there is cross-resistance between oseltamivir and peramivir so this combination would not increase the genetic barrier however zanamivir and peramivir have differing resistance mutations although q136k alone gives reduced sensitivity to both zanamivir 36-fold and to peramivir 80-fold as these two compounds are being developed as iv therapies it may be beneficial to combine these into one iv productfavipiravir t-705 is the first influenza rna polymerase inhibitor to reach phase iii clinical trials in combination with oseltamivir and zanamivir t-705 has given additive to synergistic activity in a mouse model the combination of oseltamivir and t-705 has been evaluated in a phase i study clearly it is hoped that this combination would give highly effective control of influenza in seriously ill patients but experience from hiv indicates that this would not be an optimum combination to delay resistance especially in immunocompromised patients the greater reduction in virus replication with the combination therapy will help to delay resistance but the genetic barrier is the same as for the two individual therapies for an optimum combination we need a second viral rna polymerase inhibitor with resistance mutations differing from those for t-705 however in otherwise healthy individuals one may hope that the immune system would clear a small population of resistant influenza virus combination therapy is a strategy that was proposed by hayden 1986 however while there is a paucity of candidate compounds obtaining combinations with an appropriate virological and pharmacological match remains a major challenge to this daygenerally vaccines could be considered as drug combinations as they may induce many antibodies each specific for a different part epitope of the viral protein surface to become resistant the virus would have to change many parts of the protein surface ie it presents a high genetic barrier in contrast therapy with a monoclonal antibody eg palivizumab for respiratory syncytial virus rsv which targets a single epitope would be more susceptible to virus resistance in a study in immunosuppressed cotton rats zhao and sullender 2005 palivizumab resistance was detected in 35 animals within the f gene one mutation a816t was sufficient to give resistance this is similar to the situation following drug monotherapysome viruses make very efficient use of their small genome size by using not just one of the three possible reading frames but two or all three reading frames an example is hbv in which the polymerase and capsid protein reading frames overlap for treating hbv infections the commonly used antiviral compounds are lamivudine lmv or 3tc adefovir dipivoxil adv and telbuvidine all these three inhibit the viral polymerase and so resistant mutations arise in the gene coding for the polymerase the same mutation can however also change the viral surface protein due to the overlap of the reading frames conversely the immune system would exert pressure on the virus to generate mutations in the surface protein but such mutations may give rise to nonfunctional viral polymerasealthough many viral infections are short-lived and the host is able to clear the virus hiv infections continue despite a vigorous antibody response could the antibody response be made more effective in clearing the virus and perhaps limit the progression of hiv infection a novel approach to therapy uses compounds that bind to carbohydrate moiety of the hiv gp120 the concept is that this would lead to a high genetic barrier to resistance whilst making resistant mutants more susceptible to neutralizing antibody balzarini 2005
hiv gp120 is highly glycosylated 50 many of the carbohydrate chains being high-mannose type which are rare on human cells the virus envelope glycosylation is required for the proper folding of the gp120 for efficient entry of the virus into target cells and for hiding the potentially highly immunogenic protein surface of gp 120 dendritic cells have a receptor dc-sign which captures hiv via the high-mannose glycans and then directs transmission of hiv to t-lymphocytes the expression of gp120 in the cell membrane of virus-infected cells allows fusion with uninfected cells resulting in giant multinucleated cells carbohydrate-binding agent cba have the potential to inhibit all these steps as proof of concept several plant lectins with binding preference to mannose-containing glycans have been shown to inhibit all the above steps more encouraging for drug potential pradimicin a prma is a non-peptidic small molecular weight cba although less active on a m basis than the plant lectins it has similar broad-spectrum activity against a variety of hiv-1 hiv-2 and siv strainsselection of cba-resistant hiv can be achieved in cell culture but only after many passages the mutations are predominantly in gp120 notably not in gp41 and result in loss of glycosylation sites mainly the high-mannose glycan sites there is a high genetic barrier due to the possibility that many prma molecules can bind to each single gp120 molecule and there has to be multiple glycan deletions for significant phenotypic resistance when in the presence of an immune system it is hoped that these cba-resistant strains of hiv will be rendered susceptible to neutralizing antibody due to the exposure of the gp120 protein surface which is normally hidden under a protective glycan cover there is now some evidence for this hu et al 2007 used cyanovirin-n cv-n a cba to generate strains of hiv resistant to cv-n and other cbas so that they could investigate the impact of the immune system on these cba-resistant strains one of the isolated resistant clones gcv4 had five mutations resulting in the loss of glycosylation at amino acid residues 289 332 339 392 and 448 all these being in the constant regions c2 c3 and c4 of gp 120 when used to infect cells with control serum wt and gcv4 infectivities were not changed by the concentration of the serum in contrast when serum from hivve patient was used the serum had a greater potency against gcv4 than wt hiv furthermore gcv4 was more sensitive to monoclonal antibodies mabs directed to the v3 loop of gp120 a major determinant of viral entry there was about an 8-fold higher sensitivity to mab 1101 and over 200-fold for mab 447-52d as controls there were no changes in sensitivities to mabs directed at other parts of gp120 furthermore when wt and mutant siv lacking several gp120 glycans were compared in monkeys the wt gave long-lasting viremia about 7 log10 whereas the mutant virus gave a short period of high virus levels which dropped as antibody levels rosecba may be effective therapy not just for hiv but also several other families of enveloped viruses for example cba have shown marked activity against hcv influenza and coronaviruses but not hsv vzv rsv or parainfluenza the lack of activity against the latter viruses may be due to less mannose-rich glycans being present the challenge now is to discover a low-molecular-weight cba with the right properties for a good and specific antiviral agent
as mentioned in section 1362 a characteristic of herpesviruses is that they establish a latent form which remains viable for the rest of the hosts life the commonly used antiherpesvirus compounds acv vacv and fcv are activated only in herpesvirus-infected cells the crucial first step in that activation requires the viral tk the tk function is not required for efficient hsv replication in cell culture wt and tkve strains replicate with similar rates to similar titers field and wildy 1978 this allows the virus in vitro an easy option to become resistant to all the tk-mediated compounds furthermore clinical resistant strains in immunocompromised patients and herpes keratitis patients are most commonly tkve strainshowever tkve strains exhibit a marked reduction in viral fitness in mice this is manifested by a large 1000-fold reduction in lethality and altered latency it appears that tkve strains are able to establish latent infection but their ability to reactivate greatly impaired it seems that in humans reactivation is similarly impaired tkve viruses do not readily spread among the population in contrast wt virus often transmits while the subject is unaware of a sub-clinical reactivation for an individual immunocompetent subject if treatment of an episode leads to resistant tkve herpesvirus appearing then the next episode of recurrent herpes will not be from the new tkve strain but from the original wt virus this seems to account for the continuing low rate 1 of resistant herpesvirus in the general population even after several decades of antiviral therapy as may be expected resistant herpesviruses are a concern in immunocompromised patientsa common consequence of resistant mutations in various viruses such as influenza virus hbv or hiv is that the resistant virus has reduced ability to replicate in the patient for example when only lamivudine was available for the treatment of hbv infections highly resistant virus was sometimes present within a year of starting therapy but it was better to continue therapy as the resistant virus was partially disabled now that other drugs are available switching to another drug such as adefovir is usually the best option were it available however a combination would be preferable since in principle sequential switching from drug to drug is undesirable as it may more readily lead to multiple resistancefor some years there have been attempts to target a host function essential for virus replication this seemed to provide an attractive way of circumventing virus resistance mutations although this approach risks unacceptable toxicity recently this problem seems to have been addressed for influenza and other viruses by targeting only virus-infected cellsfor example tsg101 is a host protein which is part of the system regulating transport within the cell importantly tsg101 is normally found only in the cytoplasm of uninfected cells but an influenza viral protein binds to tsg101 and this results in tsg101 being localized to the cell membrane using tsg101-specific antibodies it was shown that at time of infection with influenza virus there was no tsg101 on the surface of the cell but by 24 hours after infection tsg101 was on the surface this was confirmed with different cells and various strains of influenza furthermore tsg101 monoclonal antibodies reduced the release of influenza virus from infected cells indicating that tsg101 plays a vital role in the replication cycle of influenza virus in cell culture it has been possible to add tsg101 antibody and natural killer cells to target specifically influenza infected cellsthis approach could provide a broad-spectrum therapy against many different strains of influenza as tsg101 is normally resident within the cytoplasm of the cell it is envisaged that tsg101 antibody would be safe to use the same approach could be useful with other enveloped viruses hiv rsv hsv-1 and 2 ebola and parainfluenza which like influenza hijack tsg101 to help transport the virus from the cell interior to the outer membrane it seems remarkable that viruses from different families have evolved to use this single mechanismin a search for potential compounds kinch et al 2009 used computer modeling to select a panel of low-molecular-weight compounds that may disrupt the binding of tsg101 to viral proteins these compounds were screened for activity in a range of viruses one compound fgi-104 was active against all the tested viruses including hbv hcv hiv ebola and cowpox in cell culture assays fgi-104 was then evaluated in a mouse model of ebola virus dosing at 10 mgkg daily gave 100 survival of the treated mice whereas there were 90 deaths in the control group although it remains to be demonstrated that fgi-104 is acting via tsg101 it seems that this is an encouraging resultthe budding of hiv has been shown to be dependent on the binding of hiv gag to tsg101 the binding site on tsg101 is highly conserved pro-thr-ala-pro chen et al 2010 using similar strategy as for research leading to pis compounds which mimic the protein structure at the gag-tsg101 binding site are being evaluated for inhibition of hiv budding a disadvantage of this approach is that the selectivity for the infected cell is lost when the anti-hiv compound binds to tsg101 inside the cell rather than on the cell surfacehow would viruses counter such an attack on their replication to think that the blocking of tsg101 would permanently inhibit virus replication is both overly optimistic and unwise the virus may mutate to increase its binding to the host protein so that it outcompetes the inhibitor alternatively it is possible that there is a secondary mechanism for the release of virions from the cell the efficiency of such a secondary mechanism could be enhanced by mutations the new virus variant then becoming dominantthe origins and evolution of viruses may be shrouded in mystery but one current aspect is certain only in the relatively recent past since jenners first use of cowpox as a vaccine for human smallpox have viruses faced a new threat to their replicationmankinds intervention through the course of evolution viruses have developed many hugely varying strategies for their highly successful survival now faced with this new threat posed by vaccines and specific antiviral compounds some viruses are poorly adapted to survive the human smallpox virus has been eliminated from the human population the global polio eradication initiative has been highly successful its aim to eradicate polio worldwide seems achievable but remains elusive the use of vaccines has been successful in preventing many viral infections including rubella mumps measles hav and hbv however there seems to be no prospect of eliminating these viruses in the near future more recently specific antiviral compounds have been developed to control those human viruses for which generally no effective vaccines are available acv active against herpesviruses hsv-1 and -2 vzv was the first truly active and selective antiviral agent some three decades later it is still being used but has been joined by just two other drugs the prodrug of acv vacv and fcv although these drugs can limit the symptoms of acute infection the incidence of latent infection has not been reduced the mainstay for therapy and prevention of hcmv is just one drug valganciclovir vgcv the spread of hiv has prompted a huge search for effective drugs and combinations of three or four drugs are providing at least several years of clinical control from this research drugs against hbv were developed as for hiv a similar combination approach is being developed for hcv the very high mutation rates for hiv and hcv combined with their high replication rates 109 and 1012 virionsday respectively in an infected patient without therapy means that the threat of breakthrough remains ever-present especially if drug doses are missed the concept of genetic barrier has been helpful in guiding combination therapies to give effective control of patient symptoms for at least several years although hiv has spread across the world and caused so much human disease in just a few decades perhaps the virus with most potential to cause a rapid pandemic is influenza virus the 20092010 pandemic caused by h1n1 strain of influenza is the first influenza pandemic that may have been constrained by the use of antiviral drugs and the rapid development of a vaccinethe last three decades have seen many advances but also highlighted the limitations of mankinds attempts to control viruses truly active and safe antiviral compounds seemed rather a remote possibility until acv was discovered even then when hiv was identified as the cause of aids a vaccine approach was seen as the preferable way forward with an effective vaccine expected in 2 years instead it has been remarkable how combination pills have given hiv patients an easy-to-use once-daily dosing regimen which is well tolerated in too many publications the introductions state that virus resistance is limiting the use current antiviral compounds and therefore new compounds with a different virus target and new mode of action are required even better to delay resistance look for compounds which raise the genetic barrier so far the best combinations have been with compounds that target the virus polymerase similar combinations with protease inhibitors have not been so successful because the protease and the virus polypeptide cleavage sites can co-mutate an option not available to the virus polymerase although the genetic barrier needs to be increased for long-term delay in resistance in chronic infections with any drug combination used in naturally self-limiting infections the extra effect in reducing viral load quickly may well be a useful benefitour current antiviral therapies have been successful in reducing the burden of human diseases but many viruses have evolved strategies for countering new threats to their replication these strategies pose an ever-present threat to our modern human therapies we need to use our antivirals wisely

ron am fouchier department of virology erasmus medical center rotterdam the netherlandsincreased spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 causing coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 infections worldwide has brought increased attention and fears surrounding the prevention and control of sar-cov-2 from both the scientific community and the general public while many of the precautions typical for halting the spread of respiratory viruses are being implemented other less understood transmission pathways should also be considered and addressed to reduce further spread environmentally mediated pathways for infection by other pathogens have been a concern in buildings for decades most notably in hospitals substantial research into the presence abundance diversity function and transmission of microorganisms in the built environment be has taken place in recent years this work has revealed common pathogen exchange pathways and mechanisms that could lend insights into potential methods to mediate the spread of sars-cov-2 through be-mediated pathwayscoronaviruses covs most commonly cause mild illness but they have occasionally in recent years led to major outbreaks of human disease typically mutations that cause structural changes in the coronavirus spike s glycoprotein enable binding to new receptor types and permit the jump from an animal host to a human host 1 zoonotic transmission and can increase the risk of large-scale outbreaks or epidemics 2 in 2002 a novel cov severe acute respiratory virus sars was discovered in the guangdong province of china 3 sars is a zoonotic cov that originated in bats and resulted in symptoms of persistent fever chillsrigor myalgia malaise dry cough headache and dyspnea in humans 4 sars had a mortality rate of 10 and was transmitted to 8000 people during an 8-month outbreak in 2002 to 2003 5 approximately 10 years after sars another novel highly pathogenic cov known as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov emerged and is also believed to have originated from bats with camels as the reservoir host 6 mers-cov was first characterized in the arabian peninsula and spread to 27 countries having a 356 mortality rate in 2220 cases 7in december 2019 sars-cov-2 a novel cov was identified in the city of wuhan hubei province a major transport hub of central china the earliest covid-19 cases were linked to a large seafood market in wuhan initially suggesting a direct food source transmission pathway 8 since that time we have learned that person-to-person transmission is one of the main mechanisms of covid-19 spread 9 in the months since the identification of the initial cases covid-19 has spread to 171 countries and territories and there are approximately 215546 confirmed cases as of 18 march 2020 the modes of transmission have been identified as host-to-human and human-to-human there is preliminary evidence that environmentally mediated transmission may be possible specifically that covid-19 patients could be acquiring the virus through contact with abiotic be surfaces 10 11the betacoronavirus sars-cov-2 is a single-stranded positive-sense enveloped rna virus  with a genome that is approximately 30 kb in length 12 13 spike glycoproteins the club-like extensions projecting from the cell surface facilitate the transfer of viral genetic material into a host cell by adhesion 14 15 fig 1 the viral genetic material is then replicated by the host cell the infection history of sars-cov-2 is believed to have begun in bats with a possible intermediate host of pangolin 16 there are several other betacoronaviruses that occur in bats as a primary reservoir such as sars-cov and mers-cov 17 the manifestation of sars-cov-2 in a human population occurred late in december 2019 among persons known to frequent a seafood market 18 the first symptoms observed clinically were fever fatigue and dry cough with symptoms ranging from mild to severe 19 currently the protocol developed by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc for diagnosis 20 is a combination of clinical observation of symptoms and a positive result for the presence of the virus using real-time pcr rt-pcr 21the built environment be is the collection of environments that humans have constructed including buildings cars roads public transport and other human-built spaces 22 since most humans spend 90 of their daily lives inside the be it is essential to understand the potential transmission dynamics of covid-19 within the be ecosystem and the human behavior spatial dynamics and building operational factors that potentially promote and mitigate the spread and transmission of covid-19 bes serve as potential transmission vectors for the spread of covid-19 by inducing close interactions between individuals by containing fomites objects or materials that are likely to carry infectious diseases and through viral exchange and transfer through the air 23 24 the occupant density in buildings influenced by building type and program occupancy schedule and indoor activity facilitates the accrual of human-associated microorganisms 22 higher occupant density and increased indoor activity level typically increase social interaction and connectivity through direct contact between individuals 25 as well as environmentally mediated contact with abiotic surfaces ie fomites the original cluster of patients were hospitalized in wuhan china with respiratory distress december 2019 and approximately 10 days later the same hospital facility was diagnosing patients outside the original cohort with covid-19 it is presumed that the number of infected patients increased because of transmissions that potentially occurred within the hospital be 10 the increased exposure risk associated with high occupant density and consistent contact was demonstrated with the covid-19 outbreak that occurred on the diamond princess cruise ship in january 2020 26 current estimates of the contagiousness known as the r0 of sars-cov-2 have been estimated from 15 to 3 27 28 r0 is defined as the average number of people who will contract a disease from one contagious person 29 for reference measles has a famously high r0 of approximately 12 to 18 30 and influenza flu has an r0 of 2 31 however within the confined spaces of the be the r0 of sars-cov-2 has been estimated to be significantly higher estimates ranging from 5 to 14 with 700 of the 3711 passengers on board the diamond princess 19 contracting covid-19 during their 2-week quarantine on the ship 26 32 these incidents demonstrate the high transmissibility of covid-19 as a result of confined spaces found within the be 33 with consideration to the spatial layout of the cruise ship the proximity of infected passengers to others likely had a major role in the spread of covid-19 33as individuals move through the be there is direct and indirect contact with the surfaces around them viral particles can be directly deposited and resuspended due to natural airflow patterns mechanical airflow patterns or other sources of turbulence in the indoor environment such as foot fall walking and thermal plumes from warm human bodies 22 34 these resuspended viral particles can then resettle back onto fomites when an individual makes contact with a surface there is an exchange of microbial life 35 including a transfer of viruses from the individual to the surface and vice versa 36 once infected individuals with covid-19 shed viral particles before during and after developing symptoms 37 38 these viral particles can then settle onto abiotic objects in the be and potentially serve as reservoirs for viral transmission 18 34 39 evidence suggests that fomites can potentially be contaminated with sars-cov-2 particles from infected individuals through bodily secretions such as saliva and nasal fluid contact with soiled hands and the settling of aerosolized viral particles and large droplets spread via talking sneezing coughing and vomiting 34 40 a study on environmental contamination from mers-cov demonstrated that nearly every touchable surface in a hospital housing mers-cov patients had been contaminated with the virus 41 and a survey of a hospital room with a quarantined covid-19 patient demonstrated extensive environmental contamination 18 34 knowledge of the transmission dynamics of covid-19 is currently developing but based upon studies of sars and mers-cov preliminary data on sars-cov-2 and cdc recommendations it seems likely that sars-cov-2 can potentially persist on fomites ranging from a couple of hours to 5 days 39 42 43 depending on the material 43 based upon preliminary studies of sars-cov-2 survival the virus survives longest at a relative humidity of 40 on plastic surfaces half-life median  159 h and shortest in aerosol form half-life median  274 h 43 however survival in aerosol was determined at a relative humidity of 65 based on data related to sars and mers we predict that the viability of sars-cov-2 in aerosol is likely longer at lower relative humidity levels survival of sars-cov-2 at 40 relative humidity on copper half-life median  34 h cardboard half-life median  845 h and steel half-life median  131 h collectively fall between survival in the air and on plastic 43 however it should be noted that there are no documented cases thus far of a covid-19 infection originating from a fomite there is preliminary data demonstrating the presence of sars-cov-2 in stool indicating that transmission can potentially occur through the fecal-oral pathway 18 29 34 44 while transmission of covid-19 has been documented only through respiratory droplet spread and not through deposition on fomites steps should still be taken to clean and disinfect all potential sources of sars-cov-2 under the assumption that active virus may be transmitted by contact with these abiotic surfaces 34 39 with an abundance of caution it is important to consider the possibility that the virus is transmitted through aerosols and surfaces 45 for a conceptualization of sars-cov-2 deposition see fig 2previously it has been confirmed that sars can be and is most often transmitted through droplets 46 considering that sars-cov-2 is from a sister clade to the 2002 sars virus 47 that is known to transmit from person-to-person the high incidence of observed person-to-person transmission and the rapid spread of covid-19 throughout the world and communities it is accepted at this time that sars-cov-2 can also be spread through droplets 13 48 based upon previous investigation into sars 49 spread through aerosolization remains a potential secondary transmission method especially within the be mitigation of viral transmission through be air delivery systems is most often reliant on inline filtration media residential and commercial systems typically require a minimum efficiency reporting value merv of 8 which is rated to capture 70 to 85 of particles ranging from 30 to 100 m a strategy employed to minimize debris and loss of efficiency impacts to cooling coils and other heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac components higher merv ratings are required to filter incoming outside air based on local outdoor particulate levels protective environment pe rooms in hospitals require the most stringent minimum filtration efficiency 50 a merv of 7 merv-7 or greater is required as a first filter before heating and cooling equipment and a second high-efficiency particulate air hepa filter is placed downstream of cooling coils and fans hepa filters are rated to remove at least 9997 of particles down to 03 m 51 most residential and commercial buildings utilize merv-5 to merv-11 and in critical health care settings merv-12 or higher and hepa filters are used merv-13 filters have the potential to remove microbes and other particles ranging from 03 to 100 m most viruses including covs range from 0004 to 10 m limiting the effectiveness of these filtration techniques against pathogens such as sars-cov-2 52 furthermore no filter system is perfect recently it has been found that gaps in the edges of filters in hospitals has been a contributing factor of the failure of filtering systems to eliminate pathogens from the shared air environment 53in recent years the sharing economy has created environments and added new components to how multiple people share the same spaces it is possible that infectious disease transmission may be impacted by this shift to the sharing economy shared workspaces such as cowork environments rooms in homes cars bikes and other elements of the be may increase the potential for environmentally mediated pathways of exposure and add complexity to enacting social-distancing measures for example in cases where alternate modes of transportation were previously single occupancy vehicles these trips are now often replaced with rideshare programs or transportation network companies the potential for exposure may increasethe spread of covid-19 is a rapidly developing situation but there are steps that can be taken inside and outside the be to help prevent the spread of disease on an individual level proper handwashing is a critical component of controlling the spread of sars-cov-2 other coronaviruses and many respiratory infections 5456 individuals should avoid contact and spatial proximity with infected persons and wash hands frequently for at least 20 s with soap and hot water 39 furthermore since it is difficult to know who is infected and who is not the best way to avoid spread in some situations is by avoiding large gatherings of individuals also known as social distancing at this time the food and drug administration fda does not recommend that asymptomatic individuals wear masks during their everyday lives to preserve masks and materials for individuals who have been infected with covid-19 and for health care workers and family that will be in consistent contact with individuals infected with covid-19 57 additionally wearing a mask can give a false sense of security when moving throughout potentially contaminated areas and the incorrect handling and use of masks can increase transmission 58 however as masks become available and while prioritizing access to masks for health care workers that are in a higher risk environment daily wearing a mask would be prudent there is sufficient evidence to suggest that airborne transmission is possible 49 through aerosolized particles beyond six feet and that a mask would aid in preventing infection through this routesince the end of january 2020 many countries have issued travel bans to prevent person-to-person contact and particle-based transmission these mobility restrictions have been confirmed to help contain the spread of covid-19 59 within local communities a variety of measures can also be taken to prevent further spread 60 as a whole these measures are known as non-health-care-setting social-distancing measures these measures include closing high-occupancy areas such as schools and workplaces these community-level measures act to prevent disease transmission through the same mechanisms as the worldwide travel restrictions by reducing typical person-to-person contact decreasing the possibility of fomite contamination by those that are shedding viral particles and decreasing the possibility of airborne particle transmission between individuals in the same room or close proximity these decisions are made by individuals with administrative authority over large jurisdictions communities or building stock and are weighed in balance with numerous factors including health risks and social and economic impacts furthermore despite substantial social-distancing and quarantine practices in place specific building types and space uses are considered critical infrastructure and essential to maintaining communities such as health care facilities housing and groceries better understanding of be mediating variables can be helpful in decision-making about whether to implement social-distancing measures and for what duration and to individuals responsible for building operations and environmental services related to essential and critical infrastructure during periods of social distancing and all building types before and after social-distancing measures are enactedwithin the be environmental precautions that can be taken to potentially prevent the spread of sars-cov-2 include chemical deactivation of viral particles on surfaces 39 it has been demonstrated that 62 to 71 ethanol is effective at eliminating mers sars 42 and sars-cov-2 34 this ethanol concentration is typical of most alcohol-based hand sanitizers making properly applied hand sanitizer a valuable tool against the spread of sars-cov-2 in the be items should be removed from sink areas to ensure aerosolized water droplets do not carry viral particles onto commonly used items and countertops around sinks should be cleaned using a 10 bleach solution or an alcohol-based cleaner on a regular basis again it is important to remember that the main and much more common spread mechanism of previous covs has been identified as droplets from talking sneezing coughing and vomiting than by the fecal-oral pathway 34 38 39 administrators and building operators should post signage about the effectiveness of handwashing for at least 20 s with soap and hot water ensure soap dispensers are full provide access to alcohol-based hand sanitizer and implement routine surface cleaning protocols to high-touch surfaces where contamination risks are high such as around sinks and toilets 39 most importantly to prevent the transmission of microbes and thus undesirable pathogens it is important to exercise proper handwashing hygiene 39 61enacting enhanced building hvac operational practices can also reduce the potential for spread of sars-cov-2 even though viral particles are too small to be contained by even the best hepa and merv filters ventilation precautions can be taken to ensure the minimization of sars-cov-2 spread proper filter installation and maintenance can help reduce the risk of airborne transmission but it is important to understand that filters should not be assumed to eliminate airborne transmission risk higher outside air fractions and higher air exchange rates in buildings may help to dilute the indoor contaminants including viral particles from air that is breathed within the be higher outside air fractions may be achieved by further opening outside air damper positions on air-handling units thus exhausting a higher ratio of indoor air and any airborne viral particles present 62 there are some cautions to consider relative to these building operations parameters first increasing outside air fractions may come with increased energy consumption in the short term this is a worthwhile mitigation technique to support human health but building operators are urged to revert to normal ratios after the period of risk has passed second not all air-handling systems have the capacity to substantially increase outside air ratios and those that do may require a more frequent filter maintenance protocol third increasing airflow rates that simply increase the delivery of recirculated indoor air without increased outside air fraction could potentially increase the transmission potential higher airflow rates could increase resuspension from fomites and increase the potential for contamination throughout the building by distributing indoor air more quickly at higher velocities and volumes potentially resuspending more ultrafine particles 62 additionally increasing the indoor air circulation rate could increase the human exposure to viable airborne viral particles shed from other building occupants administrators and building operators should collaborate to determine whether increased outside air fractions are possible what limitations or secondary implications must be considered and determine a plan around managing the outside air fraction and air change ratesincreasing evidence indicates that humidity can play a role in the survival of membrane-bound viruses such as sars-cov-2 6365 previous research has found that at typical indoor temperatures relative humidity rh above 40 is detrimental to the survival of many viruses including covs in general 63 66 67 and higher indoor rh has been shown to reduce infectious influenza virus in simulated coughs 67 based upon studies of other viruses including covs higher rh also decreases airborne dispersal by maintaining larger droplets that contain viral particles thus causing them to deposit onto room surfaces more quickly 63 68 69 higher humidity likely negatively impacts lipid-enveloped viruses like covs through interactions with the polar membrane heads that lead to conformational changes of the membrane causing disruption and inactivation of the virus 70 71 furthermore changes in humidity can impact how susceptible an individual is to infection by viral particles 72 and how far into the respiratory tract viral particles are likely to deposit 68 decreased rh has been demonstrated to decrease mucociliary clearance of invading pathogens and weakened innate immune response 7274 however rh above 80 may begin to promote mold growth inducing potentially detrimental health effects 75 although the current ventilation standard adopted by health care and residential care facilities ashrae 170-2017 permits a wider range of rh from 20 to 60 maintaining a rh between 40 and 60 indoors may help to limit the spread and survival of sars-cov-2 within the be while minimizing the risk of mold growth and maintaining hydrated and intact mucosal barriers of human occupants 50 67 indoor humidification is not common in most hvac system designs largely due to equipment cost and maintenance concerns related to the risk of overhumidification increasing the potential of mold growth while administrators and building operators should consider the costs merits and risks of implementing central humidification especially during new construction or as a retrofit it may be too time intensive to implement in response to a specific viral outbreak or episode in addition increased rh may lead to increased buildup on filters decreasing airflow however in pandemic situations this practice likely increases the effectiveness of capturing viral particles and this benefit outweighs the increased filter maintenance required therefore targeted in-room humidification is another option to consider and this may reduce the likelihood of a maintenance oversight causing overhumidificationbuilding ventilation source and distribution path length can affect the composition of indoor microbial communities ventilating a building by introducing air directly through the perimeter of buildings into adjacent spaces is a strategy that does not rely on the efficacy of whole-building filtration to prevent network distribution of microorganisms delivering outside air directly through the envelope into an adjacent spatial volume has been shown to increase the phylogenetic diversity of indoor bacterial and fungal communities and create communities that are more similar to outdoor-associated microbes than air delivered through a centralized hvac system 76 in some buildings a similar approach can be accomplished through distributed hvac units such as packaged terminal air-conditioners ptac frequently found in hotels motels senior housing facilities condominium units and apartments or through perimeter passive ventilation strategies such as perimeter dampered vents 77 78 however for most buildings the easiest way to deliver outside air directly across the building envelope is to open a window window ventilation not only bypasses ductwork but increases outside air fraction and increases total air change rate as well 79 administrators and building operators should discuss a plan for increasing perimeter and specifically window ventilation when outdoor temperatures are adequate for this practice care should be taken to avoid exposing occupants to extreme temperature profiles and caution should be taken where close proximity would promote potential viral transfer from one residence to another 94 95light is another mitigation strategy for controlling the viability of some infectious agents indoors daylight a ubiquitous and defining element in architecture has been shown in microcosm studies to shape indoor bacterial communities in household dust to be less human associated than in dark spaces 80 moreover daylight in both the uv and visible spectral ranges reduced the viability of bacteria compared to dark controls in these microcosm spaces 80 in a study simulating sunlight on influenza virus aerosols virus half-life was significantly reduced from 316 min in the dark control group to approximately 24 min in simulated sunlight 81 in buildings much of the sunlight spectrum is filtered through architectural window glass and the resulting transmitted uv is largely absorbed by finishes and not reflected deeper into the space therefore further research is needed to understand the impact of natural light on sars-cov-2 indoors however in the interim daylight exists as a free widely available resource to building occupants with little downside to its use and many documented positive human health benefits 8083 administrators and building operators should encourage blinds and shades to be opened when they are not needed to actively manage glare privacy or other occupant comfort factors to admit abundant daylight and sunlightwhile daylights effect on indoor viruses and sars-cov-2 is still unexplored spectrally tuned electric lighting is already implemented as engineering controls for disinfection indoors uv light in the region of shorter wavelengths 254-nm uv c uvc is particularly germicidal and fixtures tuned to this part of the light spectrum are effectively employed in clinical settings to inactivate infectious aerosols and can reduce the ability of some viruses to survive 84 it is important to note that most uvc light is eliminated in the atmosphere while much of the uva and uvb spectrum is eliminated through building glass layers airborne viruses that contain single-stranded rna ssrna are reduced by 90 with a low dose of uv light and the uv dose requirement increases for ssrna viruses found on surfaces 85 86 a previous study demonstrated that 10 min of uvc light inactivated 99999 of covs tested sars-cov and mers-cov 87 however uv germicidal irradiation uvgi has potential safety concerns if the room occupants are exposed to high-energy light for this reason uvgi is safely installed in mechanical ventilation paths or in upper-room applications to indirectly treat air through convective air movement 88 89 more recently far-uvc light in the 207- to 222-nm range has been demonstrated to effectively inactivate airborne aerosolized viruses while preliminary findings from in vivo rodent models and in vitro three-dimensional 3-d human skin models appear favorable to not cause damage to human skin and eyes 90 91 further research must be conducted to verify the margin of safety before implementation if implemented safely uvc and uvgi light offers a range of potential disinfectant strategies for buildings and is a common strategy for deep clean practices in health care settings implementing targeted uvc and uvgi treatment may be prudent in other space types where individuals that tested positive for covid-19 were known occupants but routine treatment may have unintended consequences and should be implemented with appropriate precautionspatial configuration of buildings can encourage or discourage social interactions in recent years western society has valued design that emphasizes visual transparency and a feeling of spaciousness indoors whether at home through the use of open plan concepts or at workplaces that harness open office concepts with spatial layouts that intentionally direct occupants to nodes of chance encounters thought to enhance collaboration and innovation among employees while these spatial configurations are culturally important they may inadvertently enhance opportunities for transmission of viruses through designed human interaction for example large densely populated open office spaces may increase connectivity while private offices may decrease connectivity space syntax analysis demonstrates a relationship between spatial disposition and degrees of connectivity fig 3 and has been shown to correlate with the abundance and diversity of microbes within a given space 92 understanding these spatial concepts could be part of the decision-making process of whether to implement social-distancing measures to what extent to limit occupant density and for how long to implement the measureshospitals present unique challenges during the process of mitigating and protecting all inhabitants from an infectious disease outbreak not only do health care and hospital facilities have limited options for social-distancing measures to prevent infectious spread but health care facilities also often cohouse patients with vastly different requirements from the be around them for example high-risk immunocompromised patients are often kept within protective environment pe rooms designed to limit outside airborne infectious agents from entering into the room to do this these rooms are positively pressurized relative to the corridor space with a minimum of hepa supply air ashrae 170-2017 50 however this pressurization differential also increases the likelihood that aerosols in the patient room will migrate outside of the pe room and into the higher traffic corridor space when the door is open while pe rooms typically function as intended for the occupant if an immunocompromised patient is also under treatment for an airborne infectious disease the process of limiting pathogen ingress into the room could potentially create involuntary exposure to health care workers other patients and visitors via the corridor space in comparison airborne infection isolation aii rooms utilize a negative pressure differential relative to the corridor space and adjacent rooms directly exhausting room air to the exterior of the building to contain aerosolized pathogens from spreading into circulation and shared spaces the same negative pressure that aids in preventing spread of aerosolized pathogens from inside the room can involuntarily expose the room occupants to airborne pathogens that are sourced from occupants of the corridor space both pe and aii rooms may be designed with an anteroom that is used as an additional buffer between common areas and protected spaces to prevent pathogen spread and provide a location for hospital staff to apply and remove personal protection equipment ppe however anterooms are not required for pe or aii rooms and have drawbacks during routine operation therefore they exist in only some facilities they use significant additional floor area create more travel distance and increase the visual barrier between patient and rounding care team therefore increase costs these trade-offs might be reconsidered in future design and operational protocols given the high costs of pandemics and the critical role of health care environments during these timesa discussion of pe and aii rooms does not adequately address the majority of patient rooms within a hospital or health care facility that are not inherently designed with airborne respiratory viruses in mind renewed consideration should be given to general facility design to fulfill various requirements for different patient conditions and operational requirements during both routine conditions and disease outbreaks one such consideration includes separating the means of thermal space conditioning from ventilation provisions decoupling these functions permits decentralized mechanical or passive ventilation systems integrated into multifunctional facades with heat recovery and 100 outside air delivery mechanically delivering air through the facade would permit all patient rooms to be operated in isolation and individually adjusted to be positively or negatively pressurized depending on patient requirements with a higher degree of operational resilience furthermore future designs should reconsider the best way to triage and complete initial assessment of patients that present symptoms related to airborne viruses to minimize exposure to areas with other patient types if possible in planning for the future architects designers building operators and health care administrators should aspire for hospital designs that can accommodate periods of enhanced social distancing and minimize connectance and flow between common areas while also affording flexibility for efficient use of space during normal operating conditionsthe number of individuals who have contracted covid-19 or have been exposed to sars-cov-2 has been increasing dramatically over a decade of microbiology of the be research has been reviewed to provide the most up-to-date knowledge into the control and mediation of common pathogen exchange pathways and mechanisms in the be with as much specificity to sars-cov-2 as possible we hope this information can help to inform the decisions and infection control mechanisms that are implemented by corporate entities federal state county and city governments universities school districts places of worship prisons health care facilities assisted living organizations daycares homeowners and other building owners and occupants to reduce the potential for transmission through be mediated pathways this information is useful to corporate and public administrators and individuals responsible for building design and operation in their decision-making process about the degree and duration of social-distancing measures during viral epidemics and pandemicspreviously we provided evidence that the behavior of viruses can be predicted from the analysis of their predicted intrinsic disorder in their protein shells more specifically by looking at the peculiarities of disorder distribution in their matrix and capsid proteins 13 for example the predicted disorder in the matrix of retroviruses was shown to vary with the mode of the viral transmission the hiv and eiav viruses that are related but have distinctly different modes of transmission were used to illustrate this point since hiv is largely transmitted sexually whereas eiav is transmitted by a blood-sucking horsefly it has been observed that the abundance of predicted intrinsic disorder pid in the hiv and eiav matrix proteins was very different with the hiv proteins being highly disordered especially hiv-1 an explanation for this has to do with the need for a more rigid encasement in viruses that are not sexually transmitted so as to protect the virion from harsher environmental factors 1further development of a model that could predict how a virus will behave in terms of transmission would be extremely useful for both clinical and fundamental research such a model will also provide a tool to assist the implementation of public health policies for handling old and newly emerging pathogenic viruses this paper extends the line of research on protein intrinsic disorder in viral proteins to coronaviruses cov which have caught the attention of the scientific community because of the sudden appearance of the lethal virus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome the sars-cov 4 5 clinical structural and epidemiological data are available for sars-cov and its animal cousins which remain to be a serious threat to farming communities 4 610one goal of this research is to use of the concept of protein intrinsic disorder to shed light on behaviors of coronaviruses by creating a predictive model which could provide insight into the differences between the transmission behavior of animal and human coronaviruses and also classify the various animal coronaviruses by their spread behavior in this way greater understanding of the viral evolution based on its hosts and its environment can be achieved along with the better understanding of the structural mechanisms involved in such adaptive evolutionfor a long time coronaviruses have been known to cause respiratory diseases and gastroenteritis 4 greater attention was given to this family of viruses when the sars-cov moved into human hosts beginning in 2002 and inflicted 1091 deaths 11 12 during the outbreak of sars-cov questions regarding its modes of transmission were raised 7 13 greater understanding of the peculiarities of the transmission modes would have enabled better decisions to control the spread of this ominous virus however as of today complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms determining the transmission behavior of the virus remains elusive 6 for example there is no satisfactory explanation for the observation that many of those infected with sars-cov did not have any contact with the infected individuals 14while sars-cov had been observed to spread among human most easily by respiratory means the sars-cov was also observed to be not as infectious as influenza httpwwwwhointcsrsarssarsfaqen 5 it is likely that sars-cov like most animal coronaviruses spreads most efficiently by contact or by oral-fecal routes among animalsseveral human coronaviruses hcov such as 229e oc43 hku1 and nl63 have been known for some time 15 16 with hcov-229e being the most studied hcov comparison between the spread mechanisms of hcov and animal coronaviruses such as sars-cov has been made using hcov-229e as a representative virus it has been shown that hcov tends to spread more efficiently by a respiratory route whereas the animal covs tend to spread most efficiently by direct contact 15 furthermore gastroenteritis is a common disease provoked by coronaviruses and oral-fecal route is also common mode of transmission especially among animal hosts therefore in contrast to human contact and oral-fecal routes are generally the most efficient mode of cov spread in animals 15 17 18in order to introduce the two structural proteins investigated in this paper a quick overview of virus structure needs to be put forth proteins near or at the surface of the coronavirus include the spike protein s 150 kd the hemagglutinin-esterase protein he 65 kd membranematrix glycoprotein m 25 kda and the small envelope glycoprotein e 912 kd a protein that is closer to the rna is the nucleocapsid protein n 60 kd they are all likely to play roles in protecting the virions 1 2 19 20 since the m glycoproteins are the most abundant structural proteins in the coronavirus they are likely to play a greater role in protecting the virion from damagethe m-protein is a triple-spanning transmembrane protein and has a short aminoterminal ectodomain other than its protective function m-protein also plays a role in the capsid self-assembly and serves as a major determinant of the virion morphogenesis via selecting the s protein for incorporation into virions during viral assembly another protein of interest to this paper is the n-protein 5 12 the n-protein is an rna binding protein while many of its functions remain unknown it is likely that the n-protein is involved in packaging and protecting the viral rna and also plays a role in viral replication participating in transcription 7 8although human coronaviruses with the exception of sars-cov are generally mild their animal cousins eg the avian porcine and bovine coronaviruses are often devastating to the farming industry in fact an outbreak could be costly in terms of the livestock loss 10 21 coronaviruses are generally classified into three groups based on their genetic and antigenic makeup 12 16 a summary of this classification is shown in table 1 the sar-cov did not fit into any of the current three groups but did have some resemblance to group 2 for this reason sars-cov fell into a new category group 2bpreviously we showed that the similarity in protein intrinsic disorder prediction does not necessarily reflect the genetic proximity of proteins studied but rather could be related to the evolution the modes of transmission and the environment that the virus lives in 1 2 therefore the categorization of coronaviruses based on the intrinsic disorder propensities of their proteins might provide important clues for useful hypotheses especially when intrinsic disorder of the similar proteins is considered across coronaviruses serotypes or subtypesthe main tools used here are the predictors of protein intrinsic disorder intrinsically disordered proteins have also been described by various other names such as intrinsically unstructured 22 and natively unfolded 23 24 the generality of the intrinsic disorder concept emerged from the occasional observations of exceptions to the structure-to-function paradigm according to which unique protein structures are necessary for specific protein functions 25 comparison of ordered and disordered proteins revealed that there is a noticeable difference between the amino acid sequences of ordered and intrinsically disordered proteins and that disordered proteinsregions share at least some common sequence features over many proteins 24 2628 in fact the disordered proteinsregions were shown to be significantly depleted in bulky hydrophobic ile leu and val and aromatic amino acid residues trp tyr and phe which would normally form the hydrophobic core of a folded globular protein and also possess low content of cys and asn residues the depletion of disordered protein in cys is also crucial as this amino acid residue is known to have a significant contribution to the protein conformation stability via the disulfide bond formation or being involved in coordination of different prosthetic groups these depleted residues trp tyr phe ile leu val cys and asn were proposed to be called order-promoting amino acids on the other hand id proteins were shown to be substantially enriched in ala polar disorder-promoting amino acids arg gly gln ser glu and lys and also in the hydrophobic but structure-breaking pro 2731 development of such predictors provided a direct support for the hypothesis that intrinsic disorder is encoded in protein amino acid sequences these features made intrinsically disordered proteinsregions recognizable and were used to develop specific predictors of intrinsic disorder currently design of algorithms for finding regions lacking ordered structure is a very active area of research and more than 50 predictors of disorder have been developed 32 the predictor used in this paper is pondr vlxt predictors of naturally disordered regions which is a set of neural network predictors of disordered regions on the basis of local amino acid composition flexibility hydropathy and other factors 3336 these predictors classify each residue within a sequence as either ordered or disordered since pondr vlxt is sensitive to local sequence peculiarities it is frequently used for identifying functionally important sites within the disordered regions
figure 1 represents a graphical comparison of the percent of intrinsic disorder pid of the m- and n-proteins of coronaviruses with that of the influenza a virus and the matrix and nucleocapsid proteins of rna viruses in general the mean pids of matrix and nucleocapsid proteins of the influenza a virus and coronaviruses provide an interesting contrast since both viruses have similarities and dissimilarities for example the amounts of disorder in the n-proteins of both viruses are rather similar whereas the m-proteins of coronaviruses are predicted to be more ordered since the major function of m-proteins is to protect the virion it is tempting to hypothesize that these differences in the overall disorder of m-proteins can be related to the need to protect viruses from different environments and therefore can reflect differences in the viral transmission mode we know for example that both viruses are often spread via droplet transmission but animal coronaviruses are often more associated with oral-fecal transmission routes the differences in the pids may reflect this trenda more detailed comparison between the pid in m- and n-proteins of the hcovs and those of animal coronaviruses in terms of predicted disorder is shown in figure 2 avian and sars coronaviruses are also included for comparison figure 2 shows that the n-protein of the avian coronavirus ibv is characterized by the highest pid level the high pid variance standard deviation of the hcov m- and n-proteins should be also noted both features likely hint to a higher respiratory spread componentwhile figure 2 allows us to compare human coronaviruses hcov with nonhuman ones in general figure 3 breaks down the data of animal coronaviruses further by animal hosts we are able to see differences in pid of both matrix and nucleocapsid proteins of viruses by the various animal host species
figure 4 provides an overview of the mean pids in the m- and n-proteins of various animal coronaviruses by species of the hosts and by the type of virus the differences in pids between host types should be noted for instance in comparison with its porcine counterparts bovine coronaviruses tend to have higher pids in their n-proteins the important note here is that the pids of the n-proteins for all these animal coronaviruses are below 50 unlike human or avian coronaviruses
table 2 provides numerical pid values for the n- and m-proteins of various porcine strains shown in figure 4 a close examination of these data revealed that the particular strains may be quite different from each other by the amount of intrinsic disorder they possess in their n- and m-proteins an illustrative example is the remarkable differences in the pids of the n-proteins from tegv and pedv here the cv777 strain of the pedv has lower disorder levels in its matrix protein than that of the br187 strain 8 versus 13 using sars-cov as a reference point we could clearly see that each strain of the virus is characterized by a unique pid signature for example tgev is characterized by the relatively low pid score for its n-protein 43 whereas its m-protein has a somewhat higher pid 14 especially when compared to certain strains of pedv 8a breakdown of the hcov pids by strains is shown in figure 5 which shows the unusually high and low pids for the m- and n-proteins of the hcovs 229e and hku1 the noticeable differences in the pid values of hcov 229e and sars-cov should also be noted some hcov strains were studied clinically and the peculiarities of their transmission modes are listed in table 1 the hcov-229e has been studied more extensively than other human coronaviruses and has been shown to spread by respiratory modes more easily this is also believed to be generally the case for all the hcovs the results shown in figure 5 illustrate that in general the n- and m-proteins of human coronaviruses tend to be more disordered than those of the animal coronaviruses cf figures 13
figure 5 also shows that both matrix and nucleocapsid proteins of the hcov-229e are exceptionally disordered figure 5 also illustrates an important point that not all hcov strains have the same characteristics as 299e and there is great variability in the pids of the matrix and nucleocapsid proteins of hcovs for example the predicted disorder in hku1 for some reason resembles the mean pids we would normally find in the animal coronavirusesthe patterns of predicted disorder seen in figures 15 allowed us to regroup the various coronaviruses by their pid levels  table 3 summarizes the new grouping of coronaviruses it could be seen that although the new grouping of covs shown in table 3 is based on the disorder analysis of the viral shells and in particular their n-proteins the grouping seems to reflect how the viruses spread in other words a correlation between common transmission behavior and the disorder characteristics of the viruses in each group can be observed we see for example that based on their pid analysis the canine respiratory coronavirus falls in category b which contains viruses with moderate levels of respiratory and fecal-oral components its less disordered enteric counterpart falls into category c which has greater fecal-oral component and less respiratory component this pattern is also seen for the porcine coronaviruses tgev and pedvtherefore data shown in table 3 can be used for the prediction of the levels of respiratory and oral-fecal transmission modes for each virus in a group based on the pids of their m- and n-proteins for example we can conclude that viruses in group a will have greater respiratory component than those in group b or c manova analysis reveals statistically significant influence of the pids of both n and m proteins on the transmission behaviour of coronaviruses p  005 for each variable f  163 p  005 furthermore because of the statistical significances of the model and its variables the three groups should be easily identifiable via the analysis of the pid levels of the corresponding m and n proteins however any correlation between pids of the two proteins is not statistically significant manova p  015 an interesting note is that not all the viruses in the category c have low pid levels of their m-proteins even if their n-proteins are characterized by low predicted disorderwhile the figures and tables above show the differences in mean pid levels between different cov proteins figure 6 visualizes the differences in the predicted disorder levels by comparing the 3d structures of parts of the n-proteins of sars-cov and ibv large disordered regions shown in red can be seen in the ibv nucleocapsid whereas the sars-cov nucleocapsid possesses much smaller amount of disordered regions a rough disorder analysis revealed that the pid of the sars-cov nucleocapsid is 50 whereas in the case of ibv nucleocapsid the mean pid is of 56 figure 6 suggests that this difference may be reflected on their structural differencesdata shown in figure 1 suggest that the protective functions of the viral surface proteins can be seen from the results of protein disorder predictions in fact there is a correlation between the pid levels and the localization of surface proteins with proteins located closer to the virion surface being generally more rigid than other surface proteins eg in coronaviruses nucleocapsid proteins possess noticeably higher pid than the matrix proteins generally the stepwise decrease in the pids is seen for all viral nucleocapsid capsid and matrix proteins analyzed so far
figure 1 shows that there are similarities and dissimilarities between the pid levels in the influenza and coronavirus shell proteins disorder peculiarities can be potentially mapped to the transmission behavior and the nature of the viruses it can be seen that in comparison with other viruses the coronaviruses possess a tendency to be more ordered at the level of the matrix proteins but their nucleocapsid proteins are generally more disordered than nucleocapsid proteins rna viruses in general the fact that both influenza viruses and coronaviruses have high predicted disorder in their nucleocapsid proteins suggests that higher nucleocapsid disorder may be necessary for viruses with ability to spread via respiratory means further support for this hypothesis will be presented below as we inspect and categorize the various coronaviruses past analysis showed that many viruses that spread by respiratory modes are characterized by disordered shell proteins 3viral shell proteins constitute the protective proteinaceous layer which is needed for virus to survive during its transmission between the hosts figure 1 shows that the mean pid levels of m-proteins in coronaviruses are strikingly lower than those of influenza a on the other hand coronaviruses are often transmitted via the oral-fecal and fecal-contact modes 10 13 15 18 whereas the major transmission mechanism of the influenza viruses is the respiratory mode based on these and similar observations we hypothesize that there is a correlation between the pid levels in the viral shell proteins and the virus transmission modes while higher levels of disorder in shell proteins are likely to be associated with greater probability of respiratory transmission lower pid levels in the nucleocapsid and matrix proteins are conversely often associated with increased levels of fecal-oral transmission mode these correlations can be due to the need of a given virus to adjust to the changes in the environmental conditions associated with the process of transmission between the hostsobviously the environmental conditions associated with the respiratory transmission are less harsh than those seeing in the fecal-oral transmission mode however the viruses that are spread via the respiratory mode might experience greater environmental pressure during transmission and they have to be able to adjust to a greater range of environmental changes to survive and to be successfully transmitted this ability of the respiratory transmitted viruses to adjust and survive in a wide range of conditions can be due to the higher levels of intrinsic disorder in their shell proteins in other words shell proteins of these viruses are assembled into a flexible shield the pliability of which helps viruses to rapidly adjust to the environmental changes  table 3 supports this hypothesis by showing that for several viruses analyzed there is a noticeable correlation between the level of disorder in the shell proteins and the transmission modesome variations in the levels of predicted intrinsic disorder might depend not only on the transmission mode but also on the nature of organ affected by the virus during infection figure 4 shows that the canine respiratory coronavirus that affects the respiratory tract has higher pid levels than the canine enteric coronavirus preferentially affecting intestines similar patterns can also be seen among the porcine coronaviruses see table 3the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus tgev and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv have similar modes of transmission although they are preferentially passed on via the oral mode both viruses can be transmitted through the lungs too 17 18 with the pedv being generally less efficiently transmitted a puzzling aspect of the pedv is that this virus has the ability to reemerge to infect hosts months after the breeding areas have been cleaned 17 this suggests that pedv is perhaps more persistent in the environment outside the host organism as it will be seen from the next paragraphs our analysis suggested that intrinsic disorder can produce useful information for better understanding of the viral behaviortables 2-3 show that the level of predicted disorder in the tgev n-protein is noticeably lower than that of the pedv analogue and that at least one pedv strain has a noticeably lower pid in its m-protein table 2 based on the fact that the m-protein of pedv possesses the greater rigidity we hypothesize that some strains of pedv are likely to be more persistent outside the physiological environments when compared to tgev this hypothesis is also consistent with the observed pedv ability to survive in the harsh nonphysiological environment outside the host to sustain the disinfection of the pig pens and infect new hosts many months after the first infection 17our analysis also suggests that the observed intrinsic disorder propensities of the pedv shell proteins may be related to the way of how the virus spreads between hosts because of the higher levels of intrinsic disorder predicted in the n-protein by pondr vlxt it is expected that there is a relatively large respiratory component in the pedv transmission see table 3 on the other hand tgev spreads more easily since contact and oral-fecal modes are the more advantageous forms of transmission among swine 17 18the comparison of the pid levels in the m- and n-proteins suggests that various coronaviruses can be grouped as shown in table 3 an important result of this analysis is the conclusion that in terms of the intrinsic disorder in m- and n-proteins of various coronaviruses the closest neighbor of the sars-cov is pedv the structural disorder similarity suggests that the behaviors of these two viruses might also be similar insights that were not previously noticedit should be noted however that there are some strains of the animal coronaviruses that could be used as counterexamples of the categorization shown in table 3 one of such case is porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv which is a mild variant of the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus tgev that has been observed to transmit predominantly by respiratory means and can scarcely be detected in feces or small intestines 4 10 the prcv transmission behavior was explained by the specific changes in the viral spike s protein which defined the ability of this protein to interact with specialized cells in the respiratory tract and not with the receptors found in cells from the gastrointestinal region 10 since prcv and tgev have virtually identical levels of predicted disorder in their m- and n-proteins both of them should be assigned to the category c that is to the class of coronaviruses that are spread mostly via the fecal-oral and contact modes therefore prcv that relies on the respiratory transmission mode may be inept by evolution this potential evolutionary misfit may also explain why the symptoms resulting from the prcv infection are generally mild and why prcv is a vaccine strain the observation may also suggest a new vaccine search strategy based on the recognition of viruses or strains that are evolutionary misfitsdata shown in figures 15 and table 3 can be used for the comparison of the human matrix and nucleocapsid proteins with the corresponding proteins from the nonhuman coronaviruses a striking feature is the presence of large pid variability for both the m and n of human coronaviruses especially when compared to those of nonhuman animal coronaviruses this difference is likely due to the greater complexity of the human immune system 37 furthermore many of the hcovs are characterized by the relatively high levels of predicted disorder in their n and m proteins see table 3 and figure 5 since our analysis revealed that higher pid levels in one or both of the capsid proteins typically correspond to the coronaviruses with greater respiratory transmission component the high disorder levels seen for both m- and n-proteins may indicate that many hcovs are more easily spread by respiratory means an important hypothesis which is in agreement with the clinically and experimentally observed transmission behavior of hcovs 15figures 26 and table 3 show that nucleocapsid of the avian coronavirus ibv is characterized by the high predicted disorder levels the only virus that possesses the comparable level of disorder is the human coronavirus 229e figures 35 however hcov-229e and ibv-cov have some differences too in hcov-229e both m- and n-proteins are disordered whereas in ibv-cov the nucleocapsid is more disordered but the pid of the m is only slightly above average this implies that although ibv-cov and some hcov are likely to be highly infectious mostly via the respiratory transmission the ibv virus could also be present in the gastrointestinal region and larger quantity of this virus can be found in stoolsprevious studies revealed that predicted intrinsic disorder in the matrix and surface proteins of other avian viruses is often associated with the peculiarities of their evasion of immune system 1 2 38 here the ability of the viruses to evade the immune systems may allow them to be spread between the different host species another reason for the high disorder in the avian influenza nucleocapsid is related to its predominant transmission via the respiratory modes comparison of the pid values in n- and m-proteins of these two viruses showed that despite the comparable disorder levels at the nucleocapsid the m-protein of ibv-civ is predicted to be relatively more ordered than the corresponding protein of the influenza virus figure 2 this is an indication of the greater likelihood of the presence of the virus in stools despite its predominant respiratory transmission in agreement with this hypothesis ibv-cov has been reported to be present in feces of infected birds and respiratory mode is believed to be the main transmission means 21 39 this may point to the greater possibility of fecal-respiratory transmission in ibv similar interpolations can also be made using the analysis of the various porcine coronaviruses in terms of their shell disorder and their respective transmission behaviorbased on the experimental and clinical studies on the hcov-229e and sars-cov it has been concluded that hcov-229e is easily transmissible by respiratory modes whereas sars-cov is more easily transmitted via contact 15 and these observations were used to generalize the transmission differences between human and other coronaviruses 15 our data on protein intrinsic disorder support this conclusion and also provide some additional points for considerationthe fact that hcovs are generally characterized by high pid levels of their m-proteins suggests that many human coronaviruses may have a higher respiratory component in their transmission mode however as we have seen above the variability of predicted disorder in hcov is very high with hcov-229e possessing the highest pid rates among hcovs and with hcov-hku1 being characterized by lowest levels of predicted disorder in its n- and m-proteins this suggests that it is difficult to expect that all the hcovs would have the same transmission characteristics as hcov-229e in fact some hcovs resemble nonhuman coronaviruses for example hcov-hku1 is quite different from other hcovs even though several of them are found in the same group see table 1 and figure 5  table 3 further emphasizes the presence of a noticeable variability in the pid levels of hcov surface proteins and also shows that different hcovs can have noticeable variability in their transmission modesit has been generally believed that hcov-hku1 is spread by respiratory means like the other hcovs however more recent studies revealed that hcov-hku1 may be quite different from the other hcovs for example there is a noticeable difference between the genetic makeups of hcov-hku1 and hcov-oc43 and genetically hcov-hku1 seems to be close to the mhv furthermore a case was described where hcov-hku1 was detected in a patient suffering from hepatitis 40 given this observation and the close genetic proximity of hcov-hku1 and mhv it is suspected that hcov-hku1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of hepatitis in agreement with these observations and hypotheses table 3 shows that there is a close similarity in the pid levels evaluated for the surface proteins of hcov-hku1 and mhv this finding is rather surprising even if the genetic similarity of these two covs were to be taken into account since data shown in tables 13 clearly illustrate that genetic proximity does not necessarily translate into the disorder pattern similarity this also suggests that hcov-hku1 and mhv may also possess similar transmission behavior this hypothesis is supported by the recent clinical studies which indicated the greater presence of hcov-hku1 in stools of patients and the greater association of gastrointestinal illness with hcov-hku1 infections when compared to cases of other hcov infections 41 viruses such as mhv that infect the liver may need harder shell encasements to protect the virion during their exposure to bile which is known to inflict damage on certain viruses 42based on the results of the disorder analysis we can hypothesize that there is a great likelihood that hcov-229e is most easily spread via the respiratory mode based on the pid data shown in table 3 one can expect that sars-cov should have a larger fecal-oral component than hcov-229e and therefore should likely be spread by contact oral-fecal and respiratory means in fact more moderate pid levels in sars-cov and many animal covs imply that these viruses are likely to have reasonably high levels of both oral-fecal and respiratory components which allow them to persist in the environment for a longer time and yet being able to infect via droplets or aerosols these hypotheses are consistent with the previously described direct observations of the mostly respiratory transmission mode of hcov-229e 15 on the other hand although many animal covs were shown to have a larger fecal-oral component they also can be spread by touch since a larger fecal-oral component will allow them to persist in the environment for a longer time or via the fecal-respiratory modeone of the difficulties that epidemiologists experienced during the sars outbreak of 2003-4 was the way the virus spreads from the way the virus passed between the hosts it was known that the virus has some respiratory components already at the beginning of the outbreak when it was then shown to be a coronavirus a special attention was paid to possible oral-fecal routes given the nature of coronaviruses in fact there were instances where the spread involved fecal routes such as in the case of the outbreak at amoy gardens in hong kong which involved a spread via the sewerage system 11 43 despite of what was known from the outbreak at amoy gardens the exact modes of sars-cov spread remain unclear as of yet 6 for example there were many cases where patients were infected without any known contact with an infected person 14 therefore the precise spread mechanisms remain somewhat a mystery and there are no appropriate animal models for the sars-cov transmission modesthe disorder analysis of sars-cov and other coronaviruses suggests that sars-cov falls in category b see table 3 which includes viruses that are likely to have intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral components these viruses are expected to have less respiratory component than hcov-229e and ibv from the category a table 3 and figures 3 5 and 6 but greater contribution of the respiratory mode than viruses of the category c such as tgev and mhv by the same token the sars-cov has a higher oral-fecal component than the former but lower oral-fecal component than the latter this suggests a greater likelihood of being spread via the fecal-respiratory mode which affirms what has been long suspected clinically the role of fecal-respiratory transmission as suggested by the disorder analysis mentioned above also explains many of features observed for pedv and not observed for its counterpart tgev it also explains similarly in the spreading behaviors of sars-cov and pedv given that both have the closest shell disorder seen in our sampleanother feature that was a puzzle during the sars epidemic and remains unclear now is the question on the sars-cov persistence outside the physiological environment although the ability of sars-cov to survive on the surfaces and feces for extended periods is known 6 43 the level of persistence and the corresponding evolutionary mechanisms have not been fully understood the results shown in tables 2-3 suggest a way to address the problem in the case of pedv and sars-cov the pid levels of both n- and m-proteins are quite moderate in pedv and tgev the differences in the transmission behavior and the levels of shell disorder suggest that special attention should be paid to the pid peculiarities of the m-protein a sign of persistence of sars-cov and some specific strains of pedv see tables 2-3 can be found in the relatively low pid levels of their m-proteins 8 especially when compared to viruses such as tgev 14 and hcov-229e 23another enigma is the ability of sars-cov to infect hosts without any apparent contact with an infected host 6 44 a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms involved in this ability remains elusive the differences between pedv and tgev in terms of shell disorder and observed spread characteristics offer some clues to this conundrum since the ability of pedv to infect pigs remains even after attempted cleaning of pens and isolation of infected pigs 17 both shell proteins of both pedv and sars-cov are predicted to be moderately ordered therefore the same reasoning used to predict the environmental persistence and the greater fecal-respiratory transmission component in pedv can be extended to explain the behavior of sars-covanother similarity between the sars-cov and pedv is their relative transmission inefficiency the sars-cov did not exhibit higher spread efficiency especially when compared to influenza a whereas pedv has been observed to spread less quickly than tgev it would then be tempting to conclude that these inefficiencies are for the same reasons a closer analysis of the corresponding intrinsic disorder data reveals that the reasons for the spread inefficiency are actually very different comparisons of the pids of n-proteins of sars-cov tables 2-3 ibv figure 6 and hcov-229e figure 5 table 2 revealed that the intrinsic disorder in the sars-cov n-protein is relatively moderate conversely when the n-protein of sars-cov is compared to tgev tables 2-3 and many other animal covs the opposite is held true figure 2 the pid level in the sars-cov n-protein is higher than the corresponding levels in many animal coronaviruses especially tgeva model to relate disorder at the m- and n-proteins to the behavior of coronaviruses can be built this model is based on the observation that viruses that are exposed to a less harsh environment such as those that are transmitted via oral-fecal route require a more rigid encasement so as to protect their virions from damage one way to measure the rigidity of the encasement is by looking at the level of predicted intrinsic disorder in the capsid and matrix proteins from the known behavior and shell disorder patterns of influenza a virus and various porcine coronaviruses it can be deduced that higher disorder at m-protein can be linked to greater persistence while higher or lower levels of predicted disorder in the nucleocapsid can be related to the levels of respiratory or fecal-oral transmission components respectively while the disorder levels in these two proteins tend to follow each other this is not necessarily the case for all coronavirusesprevious studies have already provided evidence that sexually transmitted viruses often have highly disordered m- and n-proteins since such viruses do not need a rigid protective shell but instead flexible layers of proteins that could help these viruses evade the hosts immune system in this paper a number of coronaviruses were sampled and further support of the link was found for instance many covs that are known to spread predominantly by the respiratory mode are characterized by higher disorder levels in their shell proteins this is especially the case for the hcov-229e for which our analysis revealed that both the m- and n-proteins are highly disordered the data also suggest that many other human coronaviruses may rely on the respiratory route as the main mode of transmission since hcovs generally have large pid levels in both matrix and nucleocapsid an especially large respiratory component has been observed for hcov-229e when compared with animal coronaviruses including the sars-cov 15 such high level of disorder was not generally detected in the animal covs with the exception of the avian ibv it is likely that ibv possesses higher ability to spread via fecal-respiratory route given the more ordered m-protein and more disordered nucleocapsid proteinthe results of the disorder analysis of the shell proteins of the porcine coronaviruses not only gave more evidence to link predicted disorder to viral behavior but also showed how the model can be used to predict the cov behavior in fact there is a close similarity between the pid levels in the matrix and nucleocapsid proteins of sars-cov and pedv furthermore the transmission behaviors of these two viruses are strikingly similar both pedv and sars-cov spread primarily by contact despite their relatively distant genetic relationship table 1 on the other hand based on the lower nucleocapsid pid found in tgev we could expect to see a larger oral-fecal component in the transmission of this virus this suggests that since tgev has much larger oral-fecal and contact components in transmission it can spread much more efficiently than pedv the hypothesis that can be deduced from the presented pid analysis this suggests that the levels of predicted disorder provide a definite way to evaluate the fitness of the virusthe model also suggests a mechanism by which pedv could reemerge to infect herds even after cleaning of the premises 17 our analysis suggests that this ability to reemerge arises from the existence of both oral-fecal and respiratory components therefore the aerosol transmission arising from the viral particles left behind may have a crucial role in this reemerging in its turn the ability to have two transmission components can be determined by the peculiarities of the predicted intrinsic disorder distribution in the viral shell proteins pid similarity between pedv and sars-cov suggests that these two viruses might have similar transmission mechanisms and suggests that sars-cov might have propensity to reemerge which can explain how people could be infected even though they had not been known to be in contact with the sars-cov-infected persons 14 this model also suggests that reemerging behavior cannot be expected for tegv overall the disorder-based analysis constitutes the categorization algorithm shown in table 3 that can be used to identify the transmission modes of various coronavirusesresults of our analysis show that disorder predictors can be used to predict transmission behavior of newly emerging strains of viruses in the cases of epidemic outbreaks such a technique would be a useful tool for predicting the potential transmission behavior of a new virus furthermore this analysis gives new clues for better understanding the spread behavior of viruses that have been known for yearssearches for the appropriate samples were made using the entrez website  table 4

the americas regarding the belief in supernatural entities who are in charge of the baby teeth retrieval in exchange for cashscandinavian countries where the myth probably originated as well as slavic and germanic-language nations rely on the tooth fairy1
whereas countries with romance languages outsourced the job to a mouse sometimes just referred to as the little mouse france or the mouse prez hispanic countries in all cases the tooth has to be placed under the pillow before going to sleep and will have been traded for money by the next morning asian beliefs focus more on the future of the adult tooth to come in china for instance a baby tooth from the upper jaw has to be thrown under the bed or buried and one from the lower jaw thrown onto the roof for the new tooth to grow quickly and straight into the right direction2
funnily enough mice are an exception among mammals as they are monophyodonts and thus do normally not shed any teeth which has made them an interesting model to investigate the evolution of replacement teeth 1 mammals for their part are the exception among vertebrates which are usually polyphyodonts meaning that they can regrow a practically unlimited supply of replacement teeth all throughout their lifetime 2 hence humans possess a more complex but only diphyodont dentition a trial version of deciduous teeth replaced around age 6 by a permanent set loss of any component of the latter through mechanical injury infection or age entails the need for artificial replacement and usually steep medical billsin these circumstances zeitlin et al present a refreshing account about companies offering the extraction expansion and preservation of dental stem cells highlighting scientific facts clinical evidence and the practicalities of the service 3the authors start with a comprehensive overview of the hierarchy of stem cells from totipotent  capable of generating all embryonic and extraembryonic tissues  to multipotent also known as adult stem cells ascs a heterogeneous group of cells with a limited potential to proliferate and to give rise to several cell types of a given organwithout doubt it is the discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells ipscs in 2006 that mainly triggered massive hopes for autologous tissue repair 4 after all the theory sounds as straightforward as alluring given that terminally differentiated cells can be reprogrammed to an embryonic stem cell-like state and subsequently differentiated into the needed cell type as it turned out however the official availability of this kind of technology might take some time 5somehow ascs inherited the therapeutic hopes and without delay businesses sprang to life offering the storage of precious potential replacement parts given that both the amount and the differentiation potential of ascs seem to decline with age 6 the trend is to harvest the earliest available cell material with the largest differentiation spectrum the prime examples are haematopoietic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells mscs derived from the umbilical cord 78 notably the latter are currently used in countless clinical trials 9 and kicked off the tissue cryobanking business as a consequence in 2018 over 450 companies worldwide offered cord blood banking services3
securing this cell source however is possible only during an extremely short time window and relies on the individuals parents sole decision therefore more and more alternative asc sources have been explored over the recent years a good example was discussed in a recent issue of the biomedial journal where we discovered the promising potential of locally derived mscs derived for the repair of anterior cruciate ligaments 1011here the authors acquaint the reader with the different classes of ascs found in the oral cavity in a nutshell the two main ones are derived from the dental pulp of either baby teeth bound to be shed anyways or adult teeth accessible for example after wisdom tooth removalone very interesting feature of dental pulp stem cells is that they originate from the neural crest itself of ectodermal origin neural crest cells are a fascinating ingredient of embryogenesis in view of their unique ability to migrate during embryogenesis into almost any tissue and to participate in its development 12 and species-specific pattern 13 in the current context they serve as a reminder of the heterogeneous nature of mscs which can derive from two different embryonic germ layers - mesoderm and ectoderm - and explain why dental pulp stem cells can give raise to functional neurons 14importantly zeitlin and colleagues point out the discrepancy between the exuberant promises featured by the internet regarding the therapeutic potential of dental pulp stem cells and the available clinical evidence admittedly the cells flirt with the pluripotent features of ascs as they have given rise to derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers in a chaotic manner in vitro or as teratomas and could be directed into the typical progeny of mscs plus neurons and ondontoblasts 15 nonetheless the authors estimate that their best chances for concrete use will be the direct repair of specific dental lesions or the indirect improvement of tissue regeneration through immunomodulation 16the second part of the review details the practical process of tooth banking a service offered by at least 15 companies fig 1
 after a frankly entertaining section dedicated to various recommended storage options for tooth transport from cow milk to sports drinks the authors speculate on the most likely protocols for stem cell isolation the two main possibilities are mechano-enzymatic dissociation into single cell populations and tissue outgrowth with the latter maybe reminding the reader of one early and original way of reprogramming keratinocytes from plucked hair directly in a dish 17 tests for viability and pluripotency can vary between companies while there is little doubt on the efficiency of common freezing protocols preservation in liquid nitrogen and finally the possibility to recover functional cells after prolonged freezingremains the obvious debate of the cost aspect or rather the financial investment versus the realism degree of the promised benefits from this point of view tooth banking might be the safe certificates of deposit on the human body parts stock market especially when compared to much more eccentric options about six different companies most of them located in the unites states offer the cryogenic preservation of either the entire body or the severed head after the client has been declared clinically dead for a modest fee ranging from 28 000 to 200 000 and absolute faith into some distant future technologies to reanimate them4

neither the fields of science nor economy grant it any support - the first because of the massive damage current cryopreservation does notably to the brain the second based on the fact that companies very rarely survive more than a hundred yearsdetermined to counter at least the first factor the company nectome founded in 2018 and not a black mirror episode opted for the life-incompatible but near-atomic chemical preservation of the brain through cross-linking assuming that the distant future technologies will be able to scan the structure and infer all necessary information to simulate the late individual memories includedclearly fiction has come a long way since the tooth fairy - yet the latter seems still the more reliable ally when it comes to tissue replacementnot only do tumour cells hijack countless intracellular cell signalling pathways but they equally ensnare their surroundings coaxing their microenvironment into a suitable supportive niche 18 and exerting long-range influence on the remaining organism by shedding vesicles into the circulation 19 on these grounds the collection of molecules displayed on the surface of cancer cells is of particular interest evidently in order to recognise and target them 20 but also to understand how they communicate with neighbouring cells and escape the immune system 19 multiple components of the cancer cell surface have already been thoroughly investigated such as the glycocalix 21 integrins 22 and cell surface receptors 23lee et al have set their sights on podoplanin pdpn 24 a transmembrane mucin-like glycoprotein required for the correct development of lung alveoli heart and lymphatic system to cite only a few functions 25 the major particularity of pdpn though is that it does not possess any functional domains or enzymatic activities on its own instead it exerts its activities by interacting with numerous molecules present either on the same cell surface as pdpn or on neighbouring cells examples include the c-type lectin-like receptor-2 clec-2 cd44 or protein kinase a pka 26 in particular activation of clec-2 by pdpn on lymphatic endothelial cells or fibroblastic reticular cells triggers platelet activation and aggregation which is necessary for the accurate separation of blood and lymphatic vessels 27 and cerebrovascular patterning 28once development achieved pdpn probably participates in the maintenance of endothelial integrity 27 but is also frequently upregulated on tumour cells or on immune cells fibroblasts and epithelial cells during inflammation 25 in the cancer setting pdpn is said to promote migration invasion metastasis proliferation and clonal capacity 2526 yet the underlying mechanisms are forcefully dependent on its binding partners notably little is known about pdpns ability to induce platelet aggregation in a tumour contextlee et al concentrate here on oral squamous cell carcinoma oscc a highly lethal cancer type with over 300 000 new cases per year and 50 of patients dying within 5 years 29 the authors confirm the expression of pdpn in five out of nine oscc cell lines before focusing on the commonly used oecm-1 line one interesting observation is that the average pdpn levels are not due to a homogeneous expression but that the cell population can be further separated into p cells with high and p- with low or absent pdpn levels this immediately echoes the frequent detection of cellular heterogeneity within the same tumour with stem cell-like tumour initiating subpopulations as the most intensely researched - and controversial - case 30stable and efficient knock-down by small hairpin rnas shrna of pdpn is subsequently achieved in the p fraction with no impact on cell morphology and surprisingly also no alteration of cell proliferation in contrast to some previous reports 2526 nevertheless as pdpn function depends on its interaction partners substantial differences in phenotypes could be due to different triggered pathwaysunlike the absence of an effect on proliferation however the knock-down of pdpn significantly reduces in vitro invasion and migration abilities in accordance with other studies aggregation of human washed platelets was only observed after substantial overexpression of pdpn in p cells raising again the question if other factors are required for the molecule to deploy its full potential especially as aggregation takes places with platelet and cancer cells and is inhibited by pdpn knock-down in due course the authors turn in vivo using a real-time monitored ectopic xenograft model in immunocompromised mice the previous observation that pdpn expression does not have an effect on proliferation holds true in the mouse model as knock-down of the protein in p cells does not change tumour growth and metastasis compared to the mock shrna nonetheless survival is considerably shortened in the control compared to mice injected with pdpn knock-down cells notably these animals showed platelet infiltration into the primary tumour intravascular platelet aggregation and presented multiple signs of increased intravascular thrombosis activityfinally the authors replicate most of the previous results this time by overexpressing pdpn in the p- population the high-level pdpn cells induce platelet aggregation in vitro shorten the survival of mice in a xenograft model and lead to platelet accumulation inside the tumour and blood vessels however no significant increase in thrombosis markers is noted leading once again to the possibility that an unknown co-factor modulates pdpn function lee et al hypothesise as a matter of fact that the p and p- subpopulations differ in more ways than their pdpn expression levels and that the p- fraction lacks the partner required for pdpn to trigger coagulationthe downstream effects of pdpn-mediated thrombosis are not clear yet one could speculate though that platelet aggregation would facilitate the slowing down of circulating tumour cells ctcs and their subsequent extravasation and invasion of distant tissues lee et al did not observe a correlation of metastasis and pdpn in their specific setting but as the field of ctc biology is only in its beginnings  see the previous issue of the biomedical journal 3132  the hypothesis certainly deserves further investigationcancer stem cells cscs are the controversial and dreaded joker card of any tumour as they are held responsible for augmented growth invasion resistance to treatment and finally relapse after seemingly successful eradication of the primary tumour 33through high-jacking of the organisms normally tightly controlled pluripotency pathways cancer cells acquire properties such as immortality high proliferation rates and increased resistance to damage or harsh environments such as hypoxia moreover stemness gain is also associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition and thus increased cell mobility and invasion properties 34 all components of the pluripotency pathways have been found to be misappropriated by cancer including proteins long noncoding rnas 35 and of course micrornas mirnaskou-juey wu dedicates a detailed review to an extremely polyvalent component of mirna biogenesis and regulation the microprocessor cofactor dead-box helicase 17 ddx17 and its implication in promoting cancer stemness under hypoxic conditions 36 the author elaborates on the csc concept and recapitulates the essentials of mirna biogenesis regulation and the established connection between mirna deregulation and tumorigenesis as well as the many roles of ddx17 in all of these subsequently it is explained how hypoxia shifts the ddx17 activity by k63-linked poly-ubiquitination from cytoplasmic mirna biogenesis to various nuclear functions this decreases the production of anti-stemness mirnas while increasing the expression of pluripotency factors as ddx17 features as a transcription co-factor and promotes activating epigenetic changesaccurate cell division and distribution of genetic information is rather important for any cell type for germ cells however specifically undergoing meiosis it is a matter of life and death 37 therefore it does not come as a surprise that defects of the meiotic apparatus and dna repair systematically lead to infertility these shortcomings can be caused by pathogens autoimmune diseases environmental factors or have a genetic base 38in his review reiner veitia focuses on how mutations affecting genes involved in meiosis and dna repair can lead to premature ovarian insufficiency poi one of the principal causes of female infertility 39 stressing the powerful combination of high throughput sequencing with classical genetics in consanguineous families the author provides and exhaustive description of genetic variants connecting poi and meiotic chromosome pairing as well as dna recombination and repairdeciphering the underlying molecular causes of psychiatric disorders is an ongoing herculean task given the heterogeneity of the disorder spectra just as much as the multifactorial nature of their causes embracing genetics epigenetics and environment high throughput omics from transcriptomics to metabolomics were expected to shed some light onto the matter and have definitively delivered some clues yet high-dimensionality data analytics on huge datasets are required in order to take into account the complexity of the system 40the implication of brain-derived neurotrophic factor bdnf in psychiatric diseases can be considered an educated guess given the importance of the protein in countless developmental and functional processes of the mammalian brain 41here lin and huang have compiled a comprehensive selection of studies relating the possible connection of bdnf with schizophrenia major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder 42 they thoroughly discuss associations with either protein or mrna abundance single nucleotide polymorphisms or epigenetic modifications of the bdnf locus and stress at the occasion the importance of additional patient stratification by gender ethnicity disease stage or phase and physiological componentsliterature on micrornas mirnas levels as highly specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets for all cancer types has recently exploded 4344 and several mirna replacement therapies are currently at clinical trial stages 45 nonetheless just as much as different cancer types display highly divergent properties and strong heterogeneity even among the same tumour class the role of a certain mirna can be contrasting depending on the contextmir-95-3p has already been studied in many cancers and been found to act either as an oncogene 46 or as a tumour suppressor 47 depending on the dominant mechanism hong et al extend the list by investigating here the role of mir-95-3p in colorectal cancer crc 48 the authors show that mir-95-3p expression is lower in crc cell lines and tumour tissue compared to normal intestinal cells or adjacent tissue moreover patients with the lowest mir-95-3p expression levels displayed worse recurrence survival and overall survival rates overexpression of mir-95-3p inhibited cell proliferation and mobility of crc cells in vitro as well as tumour growth and metastasis in a mouse xenograft model and improved the survival of the latter the hepatoma-derived growth factor hdgf was identified in silico as a putative target for mir-95-3p and subsequently validated by several assays according to these results mir-95-3p qualifies as a tumour suppressor in crc and could be a reliable prognostic biomarker from early stages on while hdgf might represent a therapeutic targetthe expression to be mad as a hatter potentially stems from the symptoms of mercury poisoning as mercuric nitrate was routinely used to separate the fur from the pelt in the felt hatting industry 49 the curious liquid metal commonly known as quicksilver was used during centuries for medicinal and industrial applications from magico-religious rituals to metal recovery processes or to treat syphilis 50 it took quite some time to recognise the highly harmful effects of mercury notably on the nervous system 51 - as proven by minamata disease the neurological disorder caused by methylmercury released into the industrial wastewater by the japanese chisso chemical factory until 1968 52 nowadays the main sources of human exposure are dental amalgams occupational exposure or contaminated fish 53 eggplants on the opposite are not only delicious on pizza but fully loaded with health benefits in the form of vitamins phenolics and antioxidants 54 moreover as shown here by adelakun et al feeding rats whole eggplant extract in parallel with mercury chloride reduces significantly the testicular toxicity of the latter by boosting the organisms antioxidant system 55preterm birth ptb designates delivery earlier than 37 weeks of gestation and is the leading cause of neonatal death and a major risk factor for death before age 5 as well as developmental disabilities 56 early detection of preterm labour is key for adequate prevention and management however the underlying causes are complex and multi-factorial known risk factors encompass infections stress multiple gestations or maternal body weight - yet about two-thirds of ptb cases lack an apparent predisposition 57 measurement of cervical length is so far one of the most reliable and cost-effective methods 58 but over the past decade much effort was made to additionally identify biomarkers predictive of spontaneous ptb in maternal blood at earlier stages 5960 until now it has been considered quite unlikely that a single test would be sufficient for predicting ptb 61 however data gathered by huang and colleagues strongly indicate that maternal inhibin a levels from the second trimester are a good candidate 62 inhibin is a glycoprotein and probably named during a peak moment of pragmatism as it inhibits follicle-stimulating hormone fsh secretion in unsurprising contrast to activin 63 so far it has been used as a biomarker for ovarian cancer 64 and down syndrome 65 huang et al show here that inhibin a levels over 225 are statistically significant in their association with preterm labour 62 and might thus be an early clue prompting closer monitoring of the patientsadenoid cystic carcinoma acc is a rare form of cancer with an approximate incidence rate of 04 per 100 000 a preference for salivary glands and female individuals and a tendency to spread alongside nerve tracts moreover its slow but steady growth delays diagnosis and comes along with frequent recurrence and metastasis reducing by half the survival rates between 5 and 15 years6
acc occurring in the external auditory canal eac ranges about four orders of magnitude under acc incidence that is to say that information is sparse misdiagnosis frequent and a treatment consensus absent 6667chen et al decided to improve the limited amount of available information with a retrospective review on twelve eac aac patients over 30 years from a single institution in taiwan describing patient characteristics symptoms treatments and outcomes in conclusion they advise to include eac aac as a possible diagnostic for middle-aged women with lasting ear pain and an eac mass as well as to closely monitor the appearance of lung metastases 68the craniofacial development of the human embryo is a highly complex process that takes place mainly during the first trimester and requires the correct formation and fusion of five primitive tissue lobes 69 numerous genetic defects and environmental factors can lead to defaults in the final fusion steps leading among others to a cleft lip andor palate besides problems with feeding dental occlusion speech and infections the condition entails a heavy psychosocial burden exemplified by the severely biased depiction of individuals with an orofacial cleft as villains in works of fiction8
early surgery usually achieves the re-establishment of functional features and satisfying facial aesthetics nevertheless both goals can sometimes be conflicting multiple articles in the recent issues of the biomedical journal have illustrated that the patients pre- and post-operative opinion and satisfaction are more and more considered for orthognathic surgery 7071 hence denadai et al explain in this issues editorial note how three-dimensional imaging and computer-aided modelling of the surgery outcome in combination with the taking into consideration of the patients or patients familys preferences has improved the outcome of orthognathic orofacial cleft surgery both in terms of functional and aesthetic outcome 72the author declares no conflict of interestsan enormous body of knowledge about the mhc and mhc molecules has been amassed over the past 50 years mostly due to work on humans and important biomedical model species like mice 1 this information is extremely detailed complex but well integrated and crucially important both for basic scientific understanding of immune and autoimmune responses and for practical medical applications including transplantation 2 3 what is the point of trying to understand the mhc in non-mammalian vertebrates when there is such rich and relevant knowledge for placental mammalsbesides the obvious importance to disease resistance and vaccination in poultry 4 5 research into the chicken mhc has led to novel insights about the evolution of the adaptive immune system 6 7 8 9 this short review highlights a third advantage how the simplicity at least in some senses of the chicken mhc has permitted the discovery andor study of phenomena that have been more difficult to discern in the complex mhc biology of humans and other typical mammalsit is generally accepted that the high level of allelic polymorphism of mhc classical class i and class ii genes is driven by a molecular arms race with pathogens 10 11 an expectation from this relationship is that particular mhc alleles would confer resistance or susceptibility to particular infectious pathogens the human mhc does have many strong genetic associations with autoimmune disease but the reported associations with infectious disease are much weaker 2 12 in essence it has taken the best immunologists epidemiologists and geneticists decades to provide convincing evidence for such genetic associations the best-studied example is the slow progression of hiv infection to aids conferred by the presence of certain hla-b alleles as well as the cell-surface expression levels of hla-c alleles 13 14by contrast decades ago poultry immunologists were already stumbling over extremely strong associations between the b blood group and resistance to a variety of economically important infectious diseases 15 the mhc encoding classical class i and class ii molecules is one region the so-called bf-bl region in this b locus 16 nearby are regions with cd1 genes trim genes and the mysterious bg genes that have some similarities to butyrophilins 4 5 initially these associations were with responses to oncogenic viral diseases such as mareks disease and rous sarcoma with the b locus determining life or death for individual chickens now there is a long list of viruses bacteria and even parasites that have significant associations with the bf-bl region 4 5 17 18compared with the mhc of typical mammals the bf-bl region of chickens also sometimes called the classical mhc or the core mhc is compact simple and arranged differently figure 1 with two class ii b so-called blb genes flanking the tapasin gene located near the dm genes followed by a pair of class i so-called bf genes that flank the tap genes and finally the class iii region genes 16 moreover no recombination within the bf-bl region has been observed in experiments 19 20 21 22 although comparison of haplotypes shows that there has been some recombination over unknown spans of time 23 24 25 also the genes involved in peptide loading tapasin tap and dm are all highly polymorphic with each bf-bl haplotype generally having a unique set of alleles 24 26 27 28 the monomorphic dr-like class ii a gene bla is located some 5 cm away 29 the monomorphic 2-microglobulin 2m gene is on a different chromosome 30 31 and inducible proteasome lmppsmb genes have not been found in the genome 32 thus the polymorphic classical class i and class ii b genes are in strong linkage disequilibrium with polymorphic peptide-loading genes leading to relatively stable mhc haplotypes of polymorphic coevolving genes 33 34this coevolution is clearly seen in the chicken class i system in which the specificity of peptide translocation by the tap alleles correlates with the peptide motif of the class i molecule encoded by the bf2 but not the bf1 gene 27 34 35 thus the bf2 class i molecule receives lots of peptides whereas the bf1 molecule gets far fewer peptides and might be expected to have become much less important for antigen presentation the bf1 gene has suffered deletions and insertions leading to far less expression at the rna and protein levels than the bf2 gene 36 37 most importantly the peptides presented by the dominantly expressed bf2 molecule can explain the immune response to certain economically important viruses and vaccines 37 38 39such a system of coevolving alleles is not found in most placental mammals in humans and other typical mammals the antigen-processing and peptide-loading genes are located in the class ii and extended class ii regions far from the class i genes that they serve 40 thus alleles of antigen-processing and peptide-loading genes that were advantageous for any particular class i allele would relatively rapidly be switched by recombination 41 and any advantage lost there are few sequence alleles of tap tapasin and inducible proteasome components and these appear to be functionally monomorphic 42 43 44 working as average best fits to provide peptides for all class i molecules regardless of locus or allele this situation allows a multigene family of class i genes all of which are or can be for hla-c relatively well expressed to be clear there are mammals like rats for which the classical class i genes have moved close to the antigen-processing and peptide-loading genes with the result that one of the tap genes is oligomorphic and coevolves with the class i molecules 45the difference in the number of class i loci that encode well-expressed class i molecules provides at least part of the explanation for the difference between the human and the chicken mhc in genetic association with infectious disease 4 33 in humans if one class i molecule does not bind a protective peptide it is likely that another one will so that overall most mhc haplotypes confer more or less resistance to most pathogens which reads out as low genetic association in chickens the single dominantly expressed class i molecule either finds a protective peptide from a particular pathogen or does not and this life-and-death difference between haplotypes reads out as strong genetic association figure 2 thus the simplicity of the chicken mhc has allowed greater appreciation of this phenomenon of resistance to infectious diseasewhy do chickens and typical mammals differ in the genomic organization of their mhcs if the end result can be so dire for an individual chicken the salient features of the chicken mhc class i system can be found in many if not most non-mammalian vertebrates 6 9 46 for example ducks have polymorphic tap genes next to five class i genes only one of which is expressed at a high level 47 48 xenopus frogs have a single classical class i gene along with the tap apparently at least oligomorphic and tapasin genes located together with this class i region between the class ii region and the class iii region 49 atlantic salmon have a single classical class i gene close to the tap2 gene this region having a strong genetic association with resistance to at least one economically important virus 50 51the organization originally discovered for chickens is likely to be the ancestral one the genes for antigen processing peptide loading and antigen presentation are not closely related so they did not evolve by gene duplication and acquisition of new functions instead unrelated genes coevolved to work together as a pathway and such coevolution is favored by close linkage in other words the genes of the class i system and by extension the class ii system t cell receptors and natural killer nk cell receptors are likely to have emerged in one region a primordial mhc that has been falling apart ever since 6 9 in support of this notion genes found in various locations around the genome of mammals are found in or near the mhc of non-mammalian vertebrates for example the genes for an nk cell receptor and putative ligand bnk and blec like nkr-p1 and llt1clr are found in the chicken mhc rather than in the region syntenic to the nk complex nkc as in mammals 16 52thus it is the mammalian mhc that is novel and the mhc of at least one marsupial is organized like that of chickens 53 so the change occurred in the lineage leading to placental mammals 6 9 27 a potential mechanistic explanation for this change would be an inversion figure 3 that brought the class iii region into the center of the mhc and swung the class i genes to the outside with the breakpoint such that the antigen-processing and peptide-loading genes were left behind and eventually became part of the class ii region as discussed above sufficient levels of recombination meant that advantageous combinations of genes could not stay together and the tap tapasin and inducible proteasome genes became average best fits for whatever class i allele appeared by recombination once many alleles could be serviced a multigene family became possiblesome associations with the chicken mhc could be easily explained by the bf2 class i allele from a resistant but not a susceptible chicken finding a protective peptide 37 39 but the strong associations with mareks disease were more challenging to explain mareks disease virus mdv an oncogenic herpes virus with a complex life cycle and significant evolution of virulence in historic times has been an enormous economic problem 54 it was unclear how the mhc might confer susceptibility since any class i molecule would be expected to bind a protective peptide from at least one of the 100 mdv genes however mhc haplotypes like b19 were strongly associated with susceptibility while b2 and b21 were strongly associated with resistance 55it has become clear that the bf2 molecules from susceptible haplotypes have peptide motifs much like those of typical mammalian class i molecules with several pockets in the binding groove each one of which binds only one or a few similar amino acids 37 56 such class i molecules might be called fastidious with stringent peptide motifs and narrow peptide repertoires by contrast the bf2 molecules from resistant haplotypes can bind an exceedingly large variety of peptides and might be called promiscuous with relaxed peptide motifs and wide peptide repertoires 38 57 for instance the molecule bf22101 remodels the binding site to accommodate three anchor residues at peptide positions p2 pc-2 and pc with nearly every amino acid found at p2 and pc-2
38 57 other chicken class i molecules like bf20201 and bf21401 use broad binding pockets capable of accommodating many amino acids with hydrophobic side chains which are particularly common in most proteins 57the correlation of peptide repertoire with resistance to mareks disease was unexpected one hypothesis to explain this correlation 57 is that the few mdv peptides presented by fastidious molecules activate too few t cell clones to be effective as seems to be the case based on one study 58 while the promiscuous class i molecules provide a wide-ranging response involving many t cell clones alternatively the truly protective peptides might be so few in number that the promiscuous bf2 molecules have a greater chance of presenting such peptidesintriguingly the fastidious class i molecules are found on the cell surface at high levels whereas the promiscuous molecules are expressed on the cell surface at lower levels this cell-surface expression level is not dependent on the level of transcription or translation or on the kinetics of translocation to the cell surface or degradation overall the population of highly expressed fastidious molecules shows greater thermal stability than do the poorly expressed promiscuous molecules although stable complexes with particular peptides are found for both kinds of molecule 35 38 57this inverse correlation of peptide repertoire with cell-surface expression was also unexpected it seems most likely that the number of molecules arriving on the cell surface is determined by the interaction of the particular tap tapasin and bf2 alleles in the peptide-loading complex the underlying reason for this mechanism might simply be the biochemistry of peptide loading but alternatively there could be evolutionary selection for the inverse correlation one hypothesis is that promiscuous bf2 molecules present so many self-peptides that negative selection would deplete too many t cell clones in the thymus and that reducing cell-surface expression would reduce the extent of negative selection with a balance of peptide repertoire and cell-surface expression resulting in an optimal t cell repertoire 57 several other hypotheses can be imagined including a balance between the responses to pathogens for protection versus the recognition of self that could lead to autoimmunity or the balance between antigen presentation for t cell recognition versus a role as a ligand for nk cellsto what extent do these observations about class i molecules extend beyond chickens obviously the potential contributions of polymorphism in tap and tapasin cannot extend to mammals that have monomorphic antigen-processing and peptide-loading genes however the linkages of peptide repertoire cell-surface expression translocation to the cell surface stability and resistance to a viral disease are found for human class i molecules striking differences were reported in the predicted peptide repertoire of four hla-b alleles that correlated with the speed of progression from hiv infection to aids with the fastidious hla-b5701 and hla-b2705 alleles associated with long-term non-progression compared with the promiscuous hla-b0702 and hla-b3501 associated with rapid progression 59 subsequently the cell-surface expression levels of these four hla-b alleles were shown to vary inversely with peptide repertoire mirroring the findings in chickens 57 measurements of direct peptide binding for 27 hla-a and hla-b alleles showed a wide range of peptide repertoires 60 an early immunoprecipitation study reported that one hla-a and six hla-b alleles were mostly in a peptide-bound conformation while seven hla-a and three hla-b alleles were mostly bound to tap molecules suggesting a range of peptide-loading efficiencies 61 assays with transfected cdna clones for 27 hla-b alleles show that some alleles have strong tapasin dependence on cell-surface expression tapasin-independent alleles generally being correlated with faster hiv progression 62 implicating dependence on translocation to the cell surface as in chickens 35 although the data are not strictly comparable between all of these reports wider peptide repertoire lower cell-surface expression level longer tap binding tapasin independence of translocation and faster hiv progression for hla-a and hla-b alleles seem to be broadly but not perfectly correlated 63 with many but not all hla-a molecules being more promiscuous and many but not all hla-b molecules being more fastidious overall the similarities between chickens and humans suggest that these are fundamental properties of classical class i moleculeshowever there are clearly differences between the human and chicken class i systems the range of peptide binding for human class i alleles appears to be less than that of chickens for instance hla-a02 molecules are the most promiscuous human class i molecules accommodating hydrophobic amino acids that are common in proteins but only two or three different amino acids in each pocket as opposed to the six different amino acids accommodated by the highly promiscuous chicken bf20201 57 64 65 similarly the fastidious hla-b5701 specifies amino acids for only two pockets one of which requires the rare amino acid tryptophan whereas the other allows the common amino acids alanine serine and threonine by contrast the highly fastidious chicken class i molecule bf20401 requires the binding of relatively rare acidic amino acids in each of three pockets 37 56 66 perhaps the presence of a multigene family of human class i molecules means that the selective pressure for extremely promiscuous and fastidious molecules is lower than in chickensa second difference might be that cell-surface expression has been correlated with tapasin dependence in humans but thus far only with tap specificity in chickens the effect of chicken tapasin has not been examined 35 62 in any case human tapasin and tap genes are functionally monomorphic so any effect in the peptide-loading complex would depend on the polymorphic positions in the class i allele 42 43 44 by contrast chicken tapasin and tap genes are all polymorphic and appear to coevolve with the dominantly expressed class i bf2 gene 26 27 so the interactions could be more complexhla-c presents a special challenge perhaps because the relative importance of various sequence features remains controversial hla-c molecules are found expressed on the surface of most cells at a much lower level than hla-a and hla-b perhaps commensurate with a greater role for hla-c as a ligand for nk cells rather than as an antigen presentation molecule for t cells 67 in addition hla-c alleles vary in their cell-surface expression with higher expression correlated with slower hiv progression perhaps due to t cell recognition 14 68 69 various features of hla-c have been reported to contribute to these two kinds of differences including promoter sequence and transcription mirna sites in the 3 utr sequences and rna stability 2m association peptide motif and peptide repertoire and tap residency and translocation to the surface 67 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 in early studies 61 70 certain hla-c alleles were found to be present inside the cell at the same level as hla-a and hla-b molecules but remained bound to tap and were not translocated to the cell surface similar to promiscuous chicken class i alleles the available data from predicted or actual peptide motifs is often interpreted to show a limited number of peptides that can bind hla-c molecules compared with typical hla-a and hla-b molecules 67 74 75 76 a more recent report 76 compares two hla-c alleles confirming that several features of the hla-c gene contribute in a complex way to cell-surface expression the peptide-binding domains of one hla-c allele that binds a greater diversity of peptides are better expressed at the cell surface at least when fused to another class i molecule the opposite of that found for chicken class i molecules how all of these observations fit together is currently unknownfinally perhaps the most striking difference is that poorly expressed promiscuous alleles confer protection against mareks disease in chickens while well-expressed fastidious alleles are responsible for slow progression to aids in humans any pretense to an overarching model must explain this differencewhat could be the evolutionary basis for having well-expressed fastidious and poorly expressed promiscuous class i alleles looking through the literature it appears that the promiscuous bf2 alleles protect chickens against a range of common infectious diseases in addition to mareks disease 77 78 79 80 among several examples figure 4 typing chickens in rural thailand after an outbreak of avian influenza found that all b21 homozygotes survived that all chickens homozygous for the b12 b13 and b15 haplotypes with fastidious bf2 molecules died and that in all but one combination heterozygotes with one promiscuous class i allele survived 79 it appears that promiscuous bf2 molecules combining the specificities of several fastidious molecules in one molecule generally confer protection against most pathogens figure 2 much like a mammalian mhc haplotype with multiple mammalian class i molecules by contrast the fastidious human class i alleles hla-b5701 and hla-b2705 confer protection against the dangerous zoonotic pathogen hiv which they achieve by binding a particular protective peptide that the virus cannot change without a drastic loss of fitness 13 59 81 82 another dangerous and possibly new pathogen hepatitis c virus hcv is also controlled by hla-b2705 83 84putting these two ideas together one evolutionary hypothesis would be that low-expression promiscuous class i alleles function as generalists while the high-expression fastidious alleles act as specialists 57 63 most of the time the generalists deal well with common pathogens but they may not always be able to cope with the appearance of a new and virulent pathogen in this case a particular fastidious molecule may present a special peptide from the new pathogen conferring protection and leading to an increase in gene frequency for that allele figure 5how does this new view stack up against the current concepts and available data the many class i alleles found in most human populations have long been interpreted to mean that high levels of polymorphism are important for survival however a population with a few generalist alleles may provide enough protection under normal circumstances if this is true the current view that mhc typing can identify the risk of extinction for endangered species 85 may need to be reconsidered to also take into account the peptide repertoire of mhc molecules present in the remaining population it is also easy to imagine that the original class i alleles were promiscuous which seems superficially similar to the class ii molecules from which they may have arisen 6 9 86 the major change in structurefunction relationships caused by rearrangement of the mhc in the lineage leading to placental mammals discussed above 6 9 27 might have been facilitated by a promiscuous class i allele closely linked to promiscuous tap genesfastidious alleles might arise by a few mutations from promiscuous alleles and remain at a low gene frequency unless selected by a pathogen challenge and might diminish in frequency once that challenge is relaxed however it is also possible that a selective sweep ensures the near fixation of fastidious alleles chimpanzees which are thought to have been strongly selected during a retroviral catastrophe have two kinds of class i molecules 87 88 89 those with fastidious peptide motifs similar to hla-b5701 and hla-b2705 and those with promiscuous motifs similar to bf20201 finally it is important to note that the classification of generalist and specialist alleles may be more useful for the explanation of a population response to a given pathogen than for individual predictions a promiscuous molecule may be able to protect against a new and virulent pathogen as does hla-b3501 for hiv clade c but not b 13 while most fastidious molecules will be unlikely to recognize a protective peptide for any one particular pathogen however a potential advantage might arise from bundling together alleles that are promiscuous or fastidious allowing greater statistical power in genetic association studiesthe observations and hypotheses described in this review require much additional work for support and testing see outstanding questions first careful and quantitative measurement of peptide repertoire breadth cell-surface expression levels and translocation to the surface for class i alleles in homozygotes is required if the broad correlations discussed here are confirmed a comprehensive reassessment of the extent to which low-expression promiscuous and high-expression fastidious class i alleles confer protection against various kinds of pathogens as well as correlating with other biological and medical phenomena would be valuablea much deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon is clearly required if a fundamental property leads to these correlations for classical class i molecules it is natural to ask whether the same phenomenon may be true for classical class ii molecules the concept of generalist and specialist has already been used for class ii genes in relation to the nematode burden of striped mice in africa 90 perhaps the same idea of promiscuous and fastidious recognition might be true for other particularly innate immune receptorsfinally much can be learned from evolutionary biology approaches including observation and simulation typically with wild outbred populations for detailed disease associations including autoimmunity and for mechanistic studies humans and mice are obviously much better suited for rapid progress than chickens however at the least the chicken mhc again has provided a simple model to discover phenomena that have been difficult to discern in both the more complicated mhc of typical mammals and the less well-characterized mhc of wild speciesoutstanding questionsto what extent is the inverse correlation between cell-surface expression and peptide repertoire found for all classical class i molecules in chickens and humans is it a true hierarchy or just two groups if this is not the case for human hla-c whywhat is the mechanism for the inverse correlation between cell-surface expression and peptide repertoire found for classical class i molecules is it due to intrinsic differences in the folding of the class i molecule the efficiency of interactions with the peptide-loading complex quality control steps like tapbprugt or other important steps of translocation in addition to these biochemical mechanisms what are the selective pressures for the inverse correlation between cell-surface expression and peptide repertoire found for classical class i molecules eg optimization of t cell repertoire avoidance of autoimmunityto what extent does low expression levelpeptide promiscuity really correlate with resistance to common pathogens how is this correlation influenced by the type of pathogen involved eg viruses with small or large genomes for which the numbers of potential protective peptides differ and what is the underlying mechanism for protection number of t cells activated higher probability of binding a given efficacious peptidesimilarly what are the mechanisms underlying protection against a given zoonosis by high-expression levelfastidious peptide-binding mhcs is the binding of special protective peptides that are critical for viral fitness always involvedto what extent is this new view true for a wide variety of species these studies should be easier in mice and primates where a significant literature is available but are largely relevant across the animal kingdom eg farm and sport animals farmed fishto what extent are these features found for classical class ii moleculesin december 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause began to emerge in wuhan china on december 31 2019 china notified the world health organization who of the outbreak and shortly thereafter on january 7 2020 a novel coronavirus was identified as the causative pathogen just 2 days later chinese investigators shared the genetic sequence of the virus later named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 because of its sequence similarity to the virus that caused a worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 20022003 on january 30 2020 the who declared the outbreak of illness with this novel coronavirus now known as coronavirus disease 2019 or covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern1 on march 11 the who declared a pandemic indicating global spread of this novel coronavirusthis situation is rapidly evolving as of march 17 2020 more than 189000 persons have been diagnosed with covid-19 globally with more than 7500 deaths and spread to more than 150 countries and regions including more than 5000 cases identified in the united states2 community transmission cases without connection to travel is now well documented in the united states however these cases likely represent the tip of the iceberg given the limitations on testing in the united states thus far more than 700 publications have appeared in the medical literature and document the most common symptoms of fever fatigue and dry cough laboratory findings include lymphopenia prolonged prothrombin time and elevated lactate dehydrogenase radiography findings include bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity of the lungs on chest computed tomography scan3 diagnostic testing using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction has moved from the centers for disease control and prevention cdc to include state public health laboratories and most recently commercial laboratory options4 and work to develop a serology test for covid-19 has begun5 fortunately pregnant women have not been forgotten three case series for a total of 31 pregnancies affected by covid-19 have been published68 and a who report from china provides limited information on 147 pregnancies9 reviews examining features during pregnancy of diseases caused by other coronaviruses eg sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers in the context of limited information on covid-19 during pregnancy have been published110 guidelines for pregnant women have quickly been made available through the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists acog11 and responses to frequently asked questions about covid-19 and pregnancy have been posted by the cdc12however many key questions remain about covid-19 in general and specific to pregnant women one critical question about covid-19 relates to the case-fatality rate of the disease early data from wuhan china suggested that 43 of 138 hospitalized patients with covid-19 died3 however it was recognized that early estimates can overestimate the case-fatality rate because mild or asymptomatic cases are often missed early in an outbreak later data from the chinese center for disease control and prevention based on more than 70000 cases suggested a lower case-fatality rate of 2313 recent data reported in the media from iran have suggested a higher case-fatality rate of just less than 914 south korea has reported 75 deaths among 8236 confirmed cases for a lower case-fatality rate of 0915 the case-fatality rate depends not only on the disease and complete ascertainment of cases but on the health care provided to affected patients and the age and health of the population studied given the small number of cases in the united states and the limited testing performed thus far the case-fatality rate for persons cared for in the united states is unknownimportant questions regarding transmission of sars-cov-2 also remain one vital question is whether persons who are asymptomatic can transmit the virus case reports have suggested asymptomatic transmission is possible but how often this occurs is unknown1617 because of the possibility of sars-cov-2 transmission when a person touches a contaminated surface another critical issue is how long the virus can survive on surfaces a recent review article suggests that coronaviruses could survive as long as 9 days depending on the surface and the type of coronavirus18 answers to these questions are essential to guidance on infection control and disinfection and other public health control measures and will require careful study including examination of seroprevalence among patients who never show symptoms and additional studies of virus persistence and inactivationlikewise several questions remain about pregnant women and their newborns preliminary information suggests that pregnant women are not more severely affected than the general population1 however the numbers of pregnant women reported have been small and comparison is needed with nonpregnant women of similar age rather than with all persons with covid-19 a population that is older median age is approximately 50 years and has underlying conditions a small study that compared pregnant women with a matched control group of nonpregnant women of similar age suggests that pregnant women with sars may have an increased risk of severe disease and death19 whether intrauterine or perinatal transmission occurs is also unknown among the small number of pregnancies reported thus far no evidence of transmission to the neonate has been observed however these women were nearly all infected in the third trimester and most underwent cesarean delivery68 the effects of the virus earlier in pregnancy are completely unknown no neonates have been delivered to women infected in the first and second trimesters of pregnancythe paucity of evidence challenges some of the key decisions that need to be addressed for example one question that has arisen is whether pregnant health care workers should receive special consideration during the 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic in which pregnant women were more likely to develop complications than nonpregnant women2021 the cdc recommended that pregnant women should strictly adhere to the same measures that were recommended for all health care personnel although certain work accommodations such as avoidance of aerosol-generating procedures on infected patients could be offered as an option22 in contrast the cdc recommended that pregnant health care workers not care for patients with ebola virus disease given the severity of illness in mothers and their neonates the high risk of transmission and the challenges related to the required personal protective equipment for ebola care23 whether special accommodations should be made for covid-19 require better data on the severity of covid-19 in pregnant womenother areas of controversy relate to temporary separation of infected mothers and their newborns preliminary data suggest that children are mildly affected with covid-1924 but the level of risk to a newborn is largely unknownanother question is related to breastfeeding limited data have suggested that sars-cov-2 is not transmitted through breast milk6 but numbers on which to determine evidence-based recommendations are too smallso where does this leave obstetricians and their pregnant patients as with previous emerging pathogens we need to base recommendations on the best information available now recognizing that data are limited and recommendations will likely change in the future certain recommendations are well supported the best way to prevent the spread of covid-19 is to implement measures that we use every year to limit the spread of seasonal influenza patients should be instructed to avoid contact with ill persons avoid touching their face cover coughs and sneezes wash hands frequently disinfect contaminated surfaces and stay home when sick prenatal clinics should ensure all pregnant women and their visitors are screened for fever and respiratory symptoms and symptomatic women should be isolated from well women and required to wear a maskadditional measures such as limiting visitors in labor and delivery units and postpartum wards might be appropriate depending on levels of community transmission1 in areas of widespread transmission community mitigation strategies such as cancellation of mass gatherings school closures and promotion of teleworking have been implemented25 and ensuring that pregnant women and their families have preparedness plans that address how their families respond to these measures is appropriate26 given that pregnant women are relatively unique in that prenatal care requires frequent routine health care visits which might place them at greater risk of having contact with ill persons adjustments to the health care system might also be necessary during the sars epidemic in 20022003 some health care systems in canada had well pregnant women use separate facilities for labor and delivery27 finally owing to possible disruptions to health care delivery pregnant women might benefit from having copies of their health care records26as the situation with covid-19 rapidly unfolds it is critical that obstetricians keep up to date on transmission in their area and on national guidance obstetricians should know who to contact at their hospital as well as their local or state health department if questions about testing or management arise obstetricians should regularly check the cdc website wwwcdcgov for clinical updates and sign up to receive health alert network messages httpsemergencycdcgovhanupdatesasp the cdcs primary method for sharing urgent public health information by email the cdc website has a wide range of information for health professionals on a number of topics including clinical care eg availability of investigational therapeutics such as remdesivir infection control guidance for evaluating persons suspected of having covid-19 and inpatient obstetric health care guidance among others this information is regularly updated as new information becomes available staying up to date on local disease activity by following state or local health department websites is also necessary obstetricians should also regularly check updated information on acogs website wwwacogorg including practice advisories which are brief focused statements that are rapidly issued in response to urgent clinical issues the websites for both acog and obstetrics  gynecology greenjournalorg provide direct links to the cdc for easy access to these critical resourcescovid-19 is the latest in a series of diseases caused by emerging pathogens in the past two decades from sars to 2009 h1n1 influenza to ebola and zika virus disease as with those previous outbreaks we must work to stay up to date with the latest data and recommendations share what we know

exist infection control is the only available method to limit the spread of the virus lai shih ko tang  hsueh 2020 the infection control and preventive measures depend mainly on our primary understanding of the routes of transmission of this virus a reported familial cluster of pneumonia associated with covid19 in hospital and family settings has confirmed the direct persontoperson transmission route for this virus chan et al 2020 other indirect transmission routes are postulated andor indicated such as faecaloral nosocomial airborne and contact with contaminated surfaces and fomites cai et al 2020 han lin ni  you 2020 the impact of the environmental conditions such as temperature relative and absolute humidity and sunlight on the virus stability and spread is largely unknown this review has collected all available data on the stability of sarscov2 and other coronaviruses from previously published reports we believe that the data provided herein should help establish a solid longterm protocol to interrupt indirect environmental transmission of sarscov2 limit its spread and mitigate its risksthe association of sarscov2 sarscov1 and merscov with acute respiratory diseases and their high loads detected in throat sputum and lower respiratory tract of infected persons indicate that viral particles of sarscov2 are shed in aerosols during coughing and sneezing calvet et al 2016 guery et al 2013 nhcprc 2020 pan et al 2020 the rna of sarscov1 has been detected in air samples collected from hospitals in china xiao et al 2004 the detection of rna of an animal cov such as pedv in air at 161 km distance from an infected farm in the united states indicates possible airborne transmission alonso et al 2014 although the detection of sarscov2 or its rna in aerosols has not yet been reported confirmed aerosol transmission of other coronaviruses suggests possible aerosol transmission of sarscov2 ge yang xia fu  zhang 2020 therefore understanding the persistence of sarscov2 is important to develop effective infection control measures of the virus in aerosolsthe persistence of various covs in aerosols at different environmental conditions has been

log tcid50 persisted for 3 days on stainless steel surface and that it became undetectable after 4 days van doremalen et al 2020 in another study a this virus with a higher initial load 55 log tcid50 retained its infectivity for 4 days and was completely inactivated after 7 days on stainless steel at room temperature and rh of 65 chin et al 2020 the available data demonstrated that the survivability of coronaviruses on metal surfaces differs according to the type of metal in general coronaviruses survive for shorter periods on copper copper nickel and brass than on stainless steel and zinc surfaces for instance sarscov1 persisted on copper for 8 hr while it remained infectious for 2 days on stainless steel with complete decay after 3 days van doremalen et al 2020 similarly hcov229e showed lower persistence on brass ranging from 10 min to 2 hr and copper nickel from 20 min to 1 hr than on stainless steel 5 days at room temperature and 3040 rh the reduction in virus persistence was found proportional to an increase in the copper content in brass and nickel table 2 warnes et al 2015 virucidal activity of copper and copper alloy was reported against various viruses and this might explain the short survival of covs on copper surface compared to other metal surfaces michels wilks noyce  keevil 2005 warns  keevil 2013in addition different survivability of various coronaviruses was observed on the same surface for instance sarscov2 showed lower survival on copper 4 hr than sarscov1 8 hr van doremalen et al 2020 similarly human coronavirus hcovoc43 showed shorter persistence 2 hr on aluminium than hcov229e which retained its infectivity for 6 hr under the same conditions of temperature and rh sizun yu  talbot 2000 some coronaviruses showed similar stability on the same surface such as merscov and sarscov1 both stayed infectious for up to 2 days on stainless steel surface at room temperature van doremalen et al 2013 and 2020 the porcine cov tgev and murine coronavirus mcov or mhv were detectable on stainless steel for 28 d with only 1 log reduction in their titres on day 1 casanova jeon rutala weber  sobsey 2010 the results presented here suggest that using coppermade common touch surfaces in hospitals might be helpful in reducing the persistence of sarscov2 furthermore the same virus might show different survivability on a single surface according to changes in environmental conditions such as temperature and rh as discussed belowrecently sarscov2 survivability on glass was studied at room temperature and rh of 65 the virus stayed infectious for 2 days and became completely undetectable after 4 days chin et al 2020 sarscov1 retained its infectivity for a longer time 4 days on glass at room temperature and completely decayed after 5 days duan et al 2003 the stability of sarscov1 on mosaic at room temperature was similar to its stability on glass survived for 3 days and decayed after 4 days duan et al 2003 similarly hcov229e survived for 5 days on either glass or ceramic surfaces at room temperature the time required for complete inactivation of this virus on both surfaces was not reported warnes et al 2015 on surgical latex gloves hcov229e survived for 3 hr and decayed after 6 hr while hcovoc43 survived for less than an hour and completely decayed after 1 hr sizun et al 2000 another study found that infectivity of hcov229e was detectable on silicon rubber at room temperature and 3040 rh for 3 days and that the virus became undetectable after 5 days warnes et al 2015the survivability of sarscov2 on cardboard was studied in comparison with sarscov1 sarscov2 survived for a longer time 1 day than sarscov1 which survived for only 8 hr under the same conditions van doremalen et al 2020 in a comparative study table 2 sarscov2 showed variable persistence on different porous surfaces in general it survived longer period of days on surfaces with higher porosity than those with lower porosity period of hours for instance it survived on inner and outer layers of surgical facemasks for 4 and 7 days respectively and for 1 day with complete decay after 2 days on cloth and banknotes however the virus survived for only 30 min on paper with complete decay after 3 hr chin et al 2020 sarscov1 demonstrated similar survivability behaviour in terms of the porosity of the surface it survived for 5 days on cloth and filter paper 4 days on press paper and wood boards and between 1 day and 2 days on disposable and cotton gowns respectively duan et al 2003 lai cheng  lim 2005 the survivability on lower porosity surfaces such as cardboard was only 8 hr van doremalen et al 2020 lai et al 2005 reported that survival of sarscov1 on cotton and disposable gowns and paper surfaces was proportional to the initial virus load table 2 compared to 6 hr survivability of hcov229e the hcovoc43 demonstrated lower survivability only 1 hr on cotton gauze sponges sizun et al 2000oral and upper respiratory tract fluids of the covid19 patients are key factors in sarscov2 transmission as the current data indicate that the major routes of transmission are droplet contact and aerosols lu  shi 2020 faecaloral transmission is also postulated since rna of sarscov2 was detected in anal swab samples collected from covid19 patients in china chen et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a in addition infectious sarscov2 particles were isolated from stool specimens of covid19 patients zhang et al 2020 furthermore nucleic acid of sarscov2 was detected in urine samples from covid19 cases wang li et al 2020 therefore it is very important to know how stable sarscov2 is in oral fluids and excrements of humans to help us project the roles that these items can play in transmitting this virus to date no data are available on the survival of sarscov2 in human excrements however this can be extrapolated from the available data on other covs table 3it has been found that coronaviruses can survive in stools for 1 hr to 4 days depending on the type and ph of the stool samples for instance sarscov1 survived in stool specimens from baby ph  67 normal adult ph  78 another normal adult ph  8 and adult with diarrhoea ph  9 for 1 hr 3 hr 6 hr and 4 days respectively the same virus was completely decayed in the same samples after 3 hr 6 hr 1 day and 5 days respectively lai et al 2005 similarly wang et al 2005 demonstrated that sarscov1 survived for 4 days and completely decayed after 5 days at room temperature in faecal samples collected from sarscov1 patients the same study found that the virus could survive for 2 days and decayed completely after 3 days at room temperature in domestic sewage wang et al 2005 both human coronavirus hcov229e and feline coronavirus fcov or feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv survived for 2 days and decayed after 3 days in primary and secondary effluents activated sludge at 23c gundy gerba  pepper 2009 the tgev and the mcov mhv survived for longer periods 21 days for both in pasteurized settled sewage at room temperature the tgev decayed after 35 days while mcov was inactivated within 28 days under the same conditions casanova rutala weber and sobsey 2009two studies reported different persistence patterns of coronaviruses in urine duan et al 2003 detected the infectivity of sarscov1 in urine for up to 5 days however the infectivity of the same virus was detected in urine for up to 17 days at room temperature in another study wang et al 2005 none of the two studies reported the period for complete decay of the virus in human sputum sarscov1 persisted for 5 days while in human blood serum it persisted for 4 days and decayed completely after 5 days duan et al 2003in light of these results possible faecaloral transmission of sarscov2 is suggested furthermore human coronaviruses such as sarscov1 and merscov have been considered as having potential for foodborne transmission greening  cannon 2016 this is because several studies reported the association of gastroenteritis symptoms and infection by sarscov1 and merscov chan et al 2015 cheng et al 2004 some studies revealed that up to 106 of patients with sarscov1 and 30 of patients with merscov had diarrhoea chan et al 2020 likewise diarrhoea and gastroenteritis symptoms have been reported in some cases of sarscov2 infection chan et al 2020 song et al 2020 this indicates that sarscov2 may also have the potential for foodborne and waterborne transmission this risk is probably greater in developing countries which are known to have poor water treatment systems poor hygienic measures in food processing and food service areas and use untreated or partially treated sewage for irrigating fresh produce aboubakr  goyal 2019 goyal  aboubakr 2016 mans armah steele  taylor 2016 it should be noted however that until now there is no evidence implicating food or waterborne transmission of sarscov2 in developed countries it is unlikely that foodborne transmission is occurring widely through food handlers as the level of virus deposited on foods is quite low and most of it would be inactivated in the stomach acid li zhao  hsern 2021 moore goulter  jaykus 2015 however this route of transmission cannot be completely excluded as assessed in a detailed risk assessment study by the ukfood standards agency oakenfull  wilson 2020the stability of coronaviruses has been studied in several types of waters table 4 at room temperature sarscov1 suspended in water stayed detectable for 3 days and was undetectable after 5 days duan et al 2003 another study reported only 2 days persistence and 3 days for complete decay of this virus in both chlorinated and dechlorinated tap water at room temperature wang et al 2005 the human coronavirus hcov229e survived a little longer 6 days with complete decay after 10 days in dechlorinated tap water gundy et al 2009 on the other hand animal coronavirus such as tgev and mcov showed much longer survivability in reagentgrade water at room temperature the infectivity of tgev was detectable for 6 weeks which became undetectable after 7 weeks while mcov stayed detectable for 7 weeks the end of the study period with no complete decay reported casanova et al 2009many studies have reported higher persistence of several covs in water and liquids at lower temperatures as compared to higher temperatures table 4 for instance the infectivity of sarscov1 in dechlorinated tap water was detectable for 14 days at 4c but for only 2 days at 20c wang et al 2005 similarly hcov229e decayed completely after 10 days in dechlorinated water at 23c but was detectable at least for 25 days at 4c in the same type of water gundy et al 2009 another study showed that after 49 days the tgev completely decayed in reagentgrade water at room temperature 25c while stayed infectious in the same type of water when stored at 4c for the same period the mcov mhv showed similar results in the same study casanova et al 2009 after 2 weeks the titres of lake watersuspended tgev and mhv were reduced by 25 log when stored at 25c but only 12 and 1 log of virus titres respectively were reduced at 4c in the same type of water casanova et al 2009sarscov2 persisted for 14 7 and 1 day in dulbeccos modified eagle medium dmem at 4c 22c and 37c respectively when the temperature was increased to 56c and 70c the persistence time was dramatically reduced to 10 min and 1 min respectively chin et al 2020 sarscov1 stayed detectable in dmem for 2 hr at 4c 20c and 37c however when storage temperature was increased to 56c 67c and 75c the virus decayed completely after 15 hr 1 hr and 30 min respectively duan et al 2003 another study on sarscov1 in dmem found that the virus stayed detectable after 1 hr at 56c and 65c but decayed completely after 45 min at 75c darnell subbarao feinstone  taylor 2004 likewise merscov stability in dmem decreased with an increase in temperature leclercq batejat burguire  manuguerra 2014 sarscov1 was detectable in minimal essential medium mem for 30 min at 4c while at 56c and 60c it became completely undetectable after 30 min rabenau et al 2005 the decrease in virus infectivity due to an increase in temperature was also reported for animal coronaviruses such as mouse coronavirus mcov or mhv and canine coronavirus ccov in mem and for tgev in hepes buffer laude 1981 saknimit inatsuki sugiyama  yagami 1988several studies have found that the survivability of coronaviruses in aerosols is affected by environmental conditions particularly temperature and relative humidity for instance the survival of hcov229e in aerosols was studied at two temperatures 6c and 20c and three rh levels low 30 medium 50 high 80 ijaz et al 1985 the high and low rh levels represented the two extremes in indoor atmospheric conditions in the temperate regions in the summer and winter seasons respectively while medium rh reflected the inside atmosphere of climatically controlled buildings the two temperatures were selected to represent the range encountered in late winter and early spring 6c to 20c or in indoor environments 20c the results demonstrated that hcov229e survived longer at 6c than 20c at all rh levels table 1 in addition the aerosolized virus survived for a longer time at medium rh 50 with halflives of 1025 hr and 673 hr at 6 and 20c respectively on the other hand high rh 80 at 20c was found to be the least favourable to the survival of aerosolized virus as it showed only 3 hr halflife at these conditions ijaz et al 1985the stability of merscov in aerosols for 10 min was studied under 20c40 rh and 20c70rh reflecting average indoor and outdoor environment during winter in the middle east region respectively the results showed that the virus was less stable at higher rh than lower rh van doremalen et al 2013 another study on merscov was carried out at two different environmental conditions 25c 79rh and 38c 24rh mimicking the common office and summer season climates in the middle eastern region at the common office condition low temperature and high rh 63 of the virus retained its infectivity however virus survival drastically decreased 47 survival in the hot and dry air common to the summer season pyankov et al 2018many studies have shown that the persistence of coronaviruses on surfaces and fomites is affected by temperature and relative humidity in general the available data show that coronaviruses survive longer at low temperatures and low rh table 2 for instance under 8090rh and 95 rh sarscov1 lost 075log and 1 log of its titre respectively on plastic surface at 33c after 1 day while at 38c 2 and 35 log reduction in virus titre was seen chan et al 2011 similar results were observed for merscov on plastic and stainless steel surfaces at 30c the virus decayed completely after 2 days and 1day when the samples were stored at 30 and 80 rh respectively however at 40 rh lower temperature 20c increased the persistence of the virus and delayed its complete decay to 3 days van doremalen et al 2013 the tgev and mcov showed lower persistence on stainless steel under high temperature and high rh after 28 days at 4c tgev titre was reduced by 025 and 3 logs under 20 and 80 rh respectively however the log reduction in virus titre was higher 2 and 5 log respectively at 20c casanova et al 2010 similarly the titre of mcov mhv was reduced by 025 and 25 logs under 20 and 80 rh respectively when stored at 4c on stainless steel surface at 20c  however 2 and 5 log reduction was seen casanova et al 2010temperature has also been shown to influence the persistence of coronaviruses in sewage the infectivity of sarscov1 was detectable for 14 days in domestic sewage when it was stored at 4c but for only 2 days at 20c wang et al 2005 in pasteurized settled sewage the infectivity of both porcine coronavirus tgev and mouse coronavirus mcov or mhv was detectable for up to 35 days at 4c but for 21 days only at 25c casanova et al 2009conformational changes in the spike proteins of covs are essential to enable the fusion of the virion with the host cell weismiller sturman buchmeier fleming and holmes 1990 found that this process is induced in mcov mhv at a ph of 80 on the contrary neutral ph mediated the spike proteins fusion of sarscov1 with the host cell xiao chakraborti dimitrov gramatikoff  dimitrov 2003 procock and garwes 1975 also demonstrated that adsorption penetration uncoating and rna replication of tgev in the host cell was determined by ph in general it has been found that covs are more stable at nearneutral ph as compared to the extreme acidic or alkaline ph sarscov1 suspended in mem completely lost its infectivity after 1 hr exposure to extreme acidic ph 1 and 3 and extreme alkaline ph 12 and 14 regardless of the temperature 4c 25c and 37c however the virus retained its infectivity when stored at ph 5 7 and 9 for 1 hr darnell et al 2004 similarly hcov 229e mhv tgev and ccov showed more stability at slightly acidic to neutral ph 675 than at highly acidic or highly alkaline ph 8 at both low and high temperatures however low temperature 4c increases the stability of these viruses at extreme ph values than at higher temperatures 25c and 37c daniel  talbot 1987 lamarre  talbot 1989 pocock et al 1975 pratelli 2008 sturman ricard  holmes 1990 in contrast to other covs sarscov2 showed higher stability when incubated at room temperature in the transport medium for 1 hr at a wide range of ph values ph 310 chin et al 2020 this finding may help explain the high spread rate of sarscov2 as compared to other human coronaviruses such as sarscov1 and merscovthe results presented in the previous sections clearly show that the ability of coronaviruses to survive in aerosols on surfaces and fomites and in suspensions and liquids is affected by temperature and relative humidity in general human and animal covs including sarscov2 showed more persistence under low temperature and low rh these results indicate that the spread of sarscov2 might be seasonally associated with winter and that it might be easier to control the virus spread during the summer months because of the high temperature and high humidity during those monthsthis assumption is supported by the fact that annual epidemics of influenza virus and hcov in temperate climates are usually activated by a sudden drop in outdoor temperatures sundell andersson brittainlong lindh  westin 2016 this is attributed to the lower amount of water vapour that a unit of air can hold at low temperature which means that the air is very dry in terms of the absolute humidity ah and this leads to a reduction in the size of aerosol droplets due to evaporation this prolongs the time when the infectious droplets remain airborne thereby increasing the chance of infecting new hosts harper 1961 on the same principle maintaining high humidity along with indoor heating during winter months might reduce the transmission of these viruses this is attributed to the indoor heating during wintertime which causes a sharp decrease in the rh of the indoor environment and subsequently reduces the size of aerosol particles through evaporation yang  marr 2011recent epidemiological studies consistently report a strong relationship between climatic conditions and the spread of sarscov2 wang jiang et al 2020 studied the relationship between daily means of temperatures and cumulative numbers of confirmed covid19 cases in the world from january 20 to february 4 2020 they found that temperature can alter the transmission of sarscov2 and suggested that countries and regions with a lower temperature should adopt the strictest control measures to prevent future reversal another study examined the effect of temperature and humidity on the global patterns of early outbreak dynamics of covid19 between january and march 2020 they found a strong impact of temperature and the humidity on the growth rate of covid19 cases across the world the growth rate of covid19 cases peaked at a temperature of 5c and a humidity of 061 kpa in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere during the outbreak month while it decreased in regions that had warmer or colder temperatures ficetola  rubolini 2020 a similar study found that the high covid19 community transmission areas across the world are located along the 3050 n corridor at similar weather patterns of 5c 11c average temperatures with low specific 36 gkg and absolute humidity 47 gm3 sajadi et al 2020 likewise average pressure average temperature minimum temperature and average water vapour pressure were found to be significantly correlated with the incidence of covid19 li et al 2020another epidemiological modelling study projected recurrent wintertime outbreaks of sarscov2 within the next five years kissler tedijanto goldstein grad  lipsitch 2020 a group of 200 ecological niche models were developed to project monthly variation in climate suitability for spread of sarscov2 throughout a typical climatological year the models showed that temperate warm and cold climates are more suitable to spread of the virus whereas arid and tropical climates are less favourable arajo  naimi 2020 contrary to the aforementioned reports another study reported that there is no evidence for temperaturedependence of the covid19 pandemic jamil alam gojobori  duarte 2020 we think that even if the climate conditions of summer season or warm regions may mitigate the growth rate of covid19 cases no geographical region is immune to this risk since the fast growth rate of covid19 cases has also occurred in some warm climates such as brazil and the philippines therefore strict measures for controlling the spread of the disease remain essential in all areas of the world and the absence of containment actions might lead to severe outbreaks in warm regions too hellewell et al 2020the international commission on illumination cie classified the ultraviolet radiation into three bands uvc 100280 nm uvb 280315 nm and uva 315400 nm visible light is the region between 400 nm and 780 nm the uvc is known as germicidal uv as it is absorbed by rna and dna bases of the virus thereby causing photochemical fusion of two adjacent pyrimidines and forming covalently linked dimers which then become nonpairing bases perdiz et al 2000 the potential of uvb inducing the formation of pyrimidine dimers is 20100fold lower than that of uvc perdiz et al 2000 dna and rna absorb uva weakly and therefore its effect is much lower than uvc and uvb in the formation of pyrimidine dimers however uva may cause other genetic damage such as oxidation of the bases and strand cleavage through the production of reactive oxygen species ravanat douki  cadet 2001a few studies have investigated the effect of artificial ultraviolet radiation uvr on coronaviruses table 5 sarscov1 was completely inactivated 6 log reduction in mem following 1hr exposure to uvc 260nm irradiance of 90 wcm2 at 83 cm exposure distance duan et al 2003 in a comparative study 6 min exposure to uvc 254nm irradiance of 4016 wcm2 completely inactivated 55 log of sarscov1 however 15 min exposure to uva 365nm irradiance of 2133 wcm2 did not show any virucidal efficacy against this virus darnell et al 2004 a third study demonstrated 53 and 63 log reduction of sarscov1 following exposure to 134 wcm2 of uvc 254 for 15 and 60 min respectively without complete inactivation of the virus kariwa fujii  takashima 2006 another study showed a 48 log reduction in ccov after 3 days of exposure to a very weak irradiance 71 wcm2 of uvc at 4 cm exposure distance pratelli 2008it is known that optical radiation from the sun is the only natural source of uvr that reaches the earth through the atmosphere however only twothirds of the energy from the sun that impinges on the atmosphere penetrates to the ground level the uvr comprises 5 of the total radiation received at the surface of the earth this component is extremely important in various biological processes solar iarc 1992 based on the virucidal efficacy of artificial uv radiation presented above and because there is no consensus on the suggested correlation between climate temperature and covid19 spread backer 2020 investigated the correlation between irradiance or sunlight and covid19 spread this observational study revealed that sun irradiance reduces the transmission of sarscov2 for example covid19 epidemic exploded during the darkest january in over 10 years in wuhan bcker 2020 on the other hand the available experimental data do not support this suggestion despite the reported virucidal efficacy of uvc its radiation from sun is completely filtered by the atmosphere and it does not reach the earths surface who 2020f in addition 95 of the suns uv radiation reaching the earths surface is uva who 2020f which has no virucidal efficacy table 4 on the other hand the uvb of the sun partially penetrates and reaches the earths surface and its influence on other viruses has been reported elghorr horsburgh  norval 1998 hart reid  hart 1993 karmer bos  teunissen 1995 sagripanti  lytle 2007 therefore studying the efficacy of sunlight and uvb on sarscov2 and the spread of covid19 might provide some explanation on the observed correlation between sun irradiance and covid19 spreadthe facts that the human coronaviruses hcov229e sarscov1 and sarscov2 can remain infectious in aerosols for 3 to 16 hr and can survive at room temperature and rh of 65 for a few days suggest possible airborne transmission of sarscov2 therefore stringent preventive measures should be taken by people in highrisk regions and in healthcare settings to avoid this possible route of transmission these findings support the cdc and who recommendations of covering faces by respirators or surgical masks or even by cloth covers in public during the covid19 epidemic the persistence of sarscov1 and sarscov2 was significantly low on copper latex and less porous fabrics as compared to other surfaces such as metals stainless steel and zinc glass and more porous fabrics this information might be helpful in designing methods to significantly decrease viral transmission in healthcare buildings and other areas at riskthe reported survival of sarscov1 and animal coronaviruses tgev and mcov in water and sewage along with diarrhoea and gastroenteritis symptoms linked to sarscov2 infection indicates the possibility of foodborne and waterborne transmission of sarscov2 this poses additional risk in developing countries because of their use of sewagepolluted waters for irrigation in addition to having poor water treatment systems although there are no confirmed foodborne or waterborne cases of sarscov2 so far it is very important to devise methods that can concentrate small amounts of this virus from large amounts of water wastewater and foods so adequate surveillance and epidemiological studies can be undertakenthe longer survival of covs at low temperatures and low relative humidity explains the observed peaks of covid19 cases during the cold and dry climates in temperate regions of the world and explains the predicted seasonality of the virus spread by epidemiological models additionally a sun irradiancedependent spread of sarscov2 has been suggested in an observational study although the efficacy of the artificial uvc against sarscov1 has been reported it does not support the suggested influence of suns irradiance on sarscov2 spread because all natural uvc radiated by the sun is blocked by the atmosphere and does not reach the earth since artificial uva showed no effect on sarscov1 it does not support the suggested sun irradiancedependent sarscov2 spread because the major type of natural solar uv radiation that reaches the earth is uva a few studies have shown virucidal efficacy of uvb on viruses other than covs however experimental studies on the efficacy of artificial uvb on sarscov2 are required to provide an explanation of the observed sun irradiancedepended covid19 spreadthe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any

of infection-control strategies for influenza parainfluenza enteric viruses hepatitis b virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-associated coronavirusinfluenza virus is generally spread through large respiratory droplets and possibly through airborne droplet nuclei classic studies have shown that influenza virus can contaminate the environment persist after drying and become re-aerosolized during floor sweeping influenza virus can survive for 2448 h on nonporous surfaces and viable virus can be spread to the skin suggesting that environmental contamination can lead to cross-infection of patients via the hands of health care workers 3 similarly parainfluenza virus is resistant to drying and can survive for 10 h on nonporous surfaces and for 6 h on clothing 5human enteric viruses contaminate the inanimate environment and can cause institutional outbreaks 3840 rotavirus is a well-known cause of outbreaks in day care centers and health care settings extensively contaminates and survives on surfaces and may spread after contamination of toys shared among children 38 norovirus has been the cause of outbreaks on cruise ships in hospitals and in hotels 7 8 39 40 in 2002 a total of 9 outbreaks of norovirus on cruise ships were reported 40 and outbreaks occurred on consecutive cruises despite attempts to disinfect the ships for 3 of 5 ships on which the outbreaks occurred discontinuation of service and aggressive cleaning and sanitation of the ship were required to stop the outbreaks although no conclusive proof exists of environment-to-person transmission of norovirus the virus has been cultured extensively from samples obtained from the inanimate environment during outbreaks 8 39 and indirect evidence supports the idea that aerosolization of the virus can occur following emesis 8individuals without immunity to hepatitis b virus hbv should be considered to be at risk for infection from contaminated environmental sources blood from infected individuals with active viral replication ie hepatitis b surface antigenpositive and hepatitis b e antigenpositive individuals may have high levels of virus and small visually undetectable inocula may be highly infective hbv may survive for up to 7 days in relative humidity of 42 9 outbreaks of hepatitis b that have involved fomites have been traced to contaminated electroencephalographic electrodes 10 and to lancets used in the monitoring of glucose levels 11sars-associated coronavirus is believed to be spread mainly via respiratory droplets although fecal-oral transmission and transmission via surface contamination may also occur current infection-control recommendations for hospitals include the use of precautions against contact droplet and airborne transmission 14 the virus has been found to survive for 2472 h on plastered walls plastic laminate surfaces eg formica formica corporation and plastic surfaces and is viable in excreted feces and urine for at least 12 days at room temperature 13 an outbreak in an apartment complex in hong kong may have been the result of fecal-oral transmission combined with environmental contamination 15 although the results of a modeling approach suggested an airborne mode of transmission 41 cleaning likely reduces surface contamination an outbreak of cases in an emergency department in taiwan was reported in which positive results of cultures of environmental samples obtained during the outbreak became negative after the emergency department was cleaned and the patients were isolated 12although the majority of candida infections are likely due to endogenous sources ie arising from patient colonization molecular typing studies of yeast recovered from patients from the hands of health care workers and from the environment suggest that fomites may play a role in the spread of candida albicans candida glabrata and candida parapsilosis among patients who undergo bone marrow transplantation although the direction in which transmission occurs ie from patient to environment vs from environment to patient has not been demonstrated conclusively 16 surfaces may be durably contaminated because experimental inoculation of dry surfaces shows that c albicans and c parapsilosis can survive for 3 days and 14 days respectively 17 epidemic spread of candida infection has occurred in which environmental sources eg a blood pressure transducer or irrigating solution were suspected 16 42 evidence of an environmental reservoir of endemic c albicans and c glabrata has been suggested through the use of molecular typing of candida isolates recovered from the environment and from patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation 16 the strain types of candida isolates acquired by patients were identical to those found on the hospital surfaces of rooms where the patients were housed prior to patient acquisition of infection 16
aspergillus and zygomycetes species are causes of nosocomial skin infection that result from contaminated fomites infections have been associated with the use of arm boards or bandages by patients who have intravascular catheters as well as with elasticized surgical bandages hospital construction activity and postoperative wounds 43
clostridium difficile spores of c difficile are durable and are resistant to usual cleaning methods contamination of the inanimate environment by c difficile has been reported to occur in areas in close proximity to infected or colonized patients contamination rates have been as high as 58 commonly affected surfaces and equipment include commodes bedpans blood pressure cuffs walls floors washbasins and furniture 1820 the organism has been found in low numbers on shoes and on stethoscopes 20 and hospital floors have remained contaminated with c difficile for up to 5 months 19 the density of contamination is increased by the presence of colonized patients and patients with diarrhea 18 20molecular techniques provide the most concrete evidence of transmission of c difficile from environmental surfaces to patients the findings of a study of endemic c difficile 18 were as follows 1 c difficile was present on the hands of health care workers 2 there was a correlation between the degree of colonization of health care workers hands and environmental contamination with c difficile and 3 there was differential contamination of the environment by individual strain types among colonized patients a single predominant isolate was found and was more likely to contaminate the environment than were isolates that sporadically colonized patients this finding was reproduced in a study in which 1 despite endemicity of c difficile a single genotype predominated in the inanimate environment and 2 the incidence of c difficile infection correlated well with environmental contamination 44 these data suggest that environmental surfaces serve as a reservoir that permits the cross-colonization of patients after they have had contact with a health care worker and that in environments in which c difficile is endemic specific isolates likely predominate 18 44
gram-negative bacilli enteric gram-negative bacilli are not commonly spread to patients from the dry inanimate environment they are generally not viable after drying lasting 7 h or less after desiccation 22 infection with these organisms is thought to occur because of endogenous spread or cross-infection between patients via the hands of health care workers however pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii are strongly associated with environmental contaminationmany studies have documented the contamination of sinks and sink drains by p aeruginosa 21 whether the use of sinks leads to the nosocomial spread of p aeruginosa is unclear p aeruginosa strain types that are isolated from the inanimate environment do not always match the strains that are present in incident cases 23 in a study that examined cultures of samples of endogenous flora obtained from patients and samples obtained from the inanimate environment results suggested that most infections with p aeruginosa were the result of endogenous flora in patients rather than exogenous acquisition 21 therefore environmental surfaces may be of variable significance in the spread of p aeruginosa
a baumannii is a nonfermentative gram-negative coccobacillus that is a commensal but also causes infections eg ventilator-associated pneumonia and bloodstream infections in the past decade a baumannii isolates have been marked by increased resistance to antibiotics and have been the cause of recalcitrant nosocomial outbreaks the organism has been isolated throughout the inanimate environmenton the beds of colonized patients and on nearby surfaces eg on mattresses and bedside equipment in hospital rooms eg on floors sinks countertops and door handles and in room humidifiers 24 25 spread of a baumannii via droplets has been suggested by the results of air sampling with culture plates 24 acinetobacter species are found in soil and water and may have adapted to survive for long periods with reports of survival of up to 3 years in hospitals 26strain types of a baumannii isolated from the inanimate environment have included strains that affect patients as well as types that have not been found to affect patients 27 some studies have found no strains of a baumannii in the inanimate environment despite outbreaks of infection with a baumannii among patients 45 46 making the role of the environment in patient colonization unclear however the levels of hand hygiene and environmental cleaning are not commonly reported in outbreak investigations and it is possible that the importance of environmental contamination is confounded by other interventions
gram-positive cocci the major reservoirs for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa are colonized or infected patients and occasionally personnel in the hospital 47 and the major mechanism of spread is via the unwashed hands of health care workers the role of the inanimate environment is controversial proof of environment-to-patient transmission is not strong the inanimate environment is variably contaminated and the phage types of environmental isolates have not always matched the phage types isolated from colonized patients 31 48the inanimate environment of burn units tends to be more heavily contaminated than that of nonburn units mrsa contamination rates range from 1 to 18 in nonburn wards to up to 64 in burn units 28 hydrotherapy rooms associated with burn units have a particularly high contamination rate 47 rates of environmental contamination also vary on the basis of the site of infection in source patients contamination is more common in the rooms of patients with infected urine or wounds than it is in the rooms of patients with bacteremia only 28 similar to other organisms ie p aeruginosa vancomycin-resistant enterococci vre and acinetobacter species s aureus has been cultured from hospital mattresses during an outbreak moist mattress padding and leaks in mattress covers are common findings during outbreaks 49 other sites that have yielded mrsa include mops 50 and the gowns and gloves worn by health care workers 28 both mrsa and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus have been found to be viable for as long as 9 weeks despite drying and have been found to survive on plastic laminate surfaces for up to 2 days under experimental conditions 29 30little evidence exists that proves that decreasing environmental contamination with mrsa leads to decreases in rates of patient infections the most compelling are data that prove that contamination of the environment leads to contamination of health care workers gowns and gloves both of which could result in patient colonization 28 other studies have shown that cleaning the inanimate environment or isolating patients caused cessation of outbreaks of mrsa but interpretation is limited because of the use of multiple interventions 51 52the fact that vre contaminates the inanimate environment has been well established vre have been found in up to 37 of samples obtained from the environment and are most often found in association with diarrhea environmental sites with vre involvement have included the gowns worn by patients and health care workers medical equipment microsphere beds and environmental surfaces 34 enterococcus species can survive for up to 58 days on experimentally inoculated countertops 35 however vancomycin resistance does not confer an additional advantage for survival and routine disinfectants heat sterilization processes and laundry procedures all eradicate the organism 32 53 54the degree of environmental contamination with vre correlates with the number of body site that have been colonized with vre 55 environmental sites closest to the patienteg bed rails bedside tables and pullover sheets have the greatest likelihood of being contaminated with vre 56 the quantity of vre in the environment is less than that on the skin of patients eg the inguinal area will have a much higher colony count than will the nearby environment 56 transmission from surfaces to patients might occur contact with contaminated surfaces alone is almost as likely to lead to contamination of the hands of health care workers as is contact with a colonized patient 36 other data supporting environment-to-patient transmission demonstrate that noncolonized patients who were admitted to contaminated rooms had highly increased odds of acquisition of vre 37in monoclonal outbreaks of vre the strain isolated from patients during the outbreak hereafter known as the outbreak strain contaminates environmental surfaces which suggests that the environment may be a common source of vre 33 for example outbreaks have been associated with thermometers carrying vre strains that were clonally identical to outbreak strains 33 however studies to clarify the role of the environment in outbreaks need to be performedthe behavior of vre in environments in which vre is endemic shows a more complex epidemiology the diversity of clones of vre emerges through importation by colonized patients or through genetic changesin other words through mutation or genetic transfer of resistance elements to vancomycin-susceptible organisms 57 when multiple strains occur in a hospital strain types that are isolated from patient rooms either may be the same as the strains isolated from colonized patients housed within the rooms 58 59 or may differ substantially 37 60 it has been suggested that the behavior of vre is similar to that of c difficile in that despite endemicity clustering of strains isolated from patients and from the environment occurs 37 61 environmental contamination with vre followed by patient acquisition of an indentical strain type has also been reported 55 more data are needed to clarify the behavior of vre but it is likely that such factors as degree of cleaning compliance with gown use and hand hygiene and presence of common sources of vre interact in the spread of the organismtwo major categories for the intensity of cleaning exist sterilization and disinfection sterilization destroys all microbial life on an object or surface and occurs through the use of heat pressure or chemical methods disinfection eliminates most microbes excluding bacterial spores and typically involves the use of chemical agents the degree of destruction of organisms depends on their sensitivity to chemical disinfection high-level disinfection involves the elimination of all but large quantities of spores intermediate-level disinfection leads to destruction of all life except spores and low-level disinfection will not reliably kill mycobacteria or spores cleaning is the process of removal of foreign material from a surface or object and may involve both mechanical processes and the use of detergents with water cleaning alone can reduce the organism load on a surface and if used in conjunction with disinfection may lead to significant reductions in organism load in shorter spans of time 62 three types of available solutions can be used during cleaning detergents which remove organic material and suspend grease or oil disinfectants which rapidly kill or inactivate infectious particles and detergent-disinfectants which achieve both aims conclusive data do not exist to prove that the routine disinfection of hospital surfaces is preferable to the use of detergent alone 63 and therefore routine use of detergent-disinfectants is based largely on consensus and logistic considerations 4in 2003 the healthcare infection control practice advisory committee of the centers for disease control and prevention cdchicpac atlanta ga issued updated guidelines for environmental infection control in health care facilities 4 as a part of these recommendations strategies for the cleaning of patient care areas were enumerated the objective of cleaning efforts should be to keep surfaces visibly clean to disinfect high-contact surfaces more frequently than nonhigh-contact surfaces and to clean up spills promptly for patient care areas it is suggested that environmental services workers select environmental protection agency epa-registered detergent-disinfectants to clean inanimate environmental surfaces this is a controversial recommendation 63 but the cdchicpac guidelines note that this recommendation accommodates situations in which uncertainty exists regarding the nature of the contaminants on inanimate environmental surfaces eg blood or body fluid contamination vs routinely accumulated dust or dirt or regarding the presence of multidrug-resistant organisms on such surfaces 4 no specific recommendations were given regarding the frequency of cleaning only that it should occur on a regular basis in hospitals patient rooms should be cleaned on a daily basis and undergo terminal cleaning after patient discharge from the hospital during terminal cleaning noncritical surfaces in the inanimate environment may be thoroughly cleaned using a disinfectant typically a quaternary ammonium compound or phenolics the latter is not advised for use in nurseries or infant care areas terminal cleaning may be more efficacious for degerming the environment because of its greater thoroughnesschanges in cleaning products or cleaning practices are generally not required to eliminate specific pathogens areas with high rates of c difficile infection may warrant the use of hypochlorite-based products because of the more reliable sporicidal activity of these agents most commercial disinfectants used for environmental cleaning have activity against viruses enveloped viruses are more susceptible to detergents than are nonenveloped viruses 9 most viruses including sars-associated coronavirus may be eliminated through the use of epa-approved disinfectants or detergent-disinfectants that are prepared according to the manufacturers instructions 14 decontamination performed after outbreaks of norovirus should involve the use of a germicidal product such as 10 sodium hypochlorite solution ie household bleach and closure of an affected institution or facility may be necessary 6effective cleaning of the hospital environment would seem intuitively to be an important factor in the control of resistant organisms one study evaluated a more intense method of environmental cleaning that allowed inanimate environmental surfaces to have prolonged exposure to the cleaning agent and that eliminated environmental vre 64 enhancements in cleaning adherence have also affected environmental hygiene in a study of cleaning behaviors constructive feedback given to housekeeping staff led to improved environmental cleaning and a 3-fold reduction in environmental vre contamination this change occurred through the use of conventional cleaning methods and materials only 65 whether these improvements translate into diminished rates of nosocomial infection is unclearalthough much about the spread of nosocomial infection remains unknown several facts have been established by existing data 1 inanimate environmental surfaces can become durably contaminated after exposure to colonized patients 2 although an organism may be endemic within an institution specific isolates may predominate in the inanimate environment as shown for c difficile and vre and 3 contaminated rooms may be a risk factor for the acquisition of nosocomial pathogens by unaffected patients the use of molecular epidemiology has helped to enhance understanding of the role of the environment in nosocomial infection by confirming that isolates in the environment either are the same as isolates recovered from patients as shown for c difficile candida species or vre or differ as shown in the case of acinetobacter species it is difficult given the existing data to draw conclusions from many existing outbreak reports or studies of the inanimate environment because the levels of hand hygiene or environmental cleaning are rarely measured and may represent important confounders of the environment-transmission association studies conclusively demonstrating an improvement in nosocomial infection rates following improved cleaning need to be performed future studies to elaborate on the role of the inanimate environment must include measures of when where and how in other words when the environment was contaminated and patients acquired organisms where the the patients were located during acquisition with respect to contaminated rooms and how well hand hygiene and environmental cleaning were practicedthe importance of understanding the role of the inanimate environment derives from continued problems in compliance with infection control measures and hand hygiene the advent of alcohol gels may lead to increased hand hygiene compliance and may diminish the effect of contact with colonized walls bed rails or medical equipment however it may be that an additional cost-effective infection-control measure in hospitals will be better more thorough and more frequent environmental cleaning that reduces the risk of cross-colonizationin december 2019 a series of human pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in wuhan hubei china sequencing analysis from lower respiratory tract samples indicated a novel coronavirus which was named 2019 novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 that caused clusters of fatal pneumonia with clinical presentation greatly resembling sars-cov 1 2 3 covid-19 started in china but now is present in many different countries with the highest number of cases in us italy and spain among others to better understand this new global epidemic from the environmental and health perspective i have decided to select the very recent papers published in the scientific literature and to prepare this opinion paper for jece air compartment plays a key role in covid-19 transmissions specially meteorological factors such as weather conditions temperature humidity and air pollution pm10 black carbon and nox but the presence and evolution of covid-19 virus in other environmental compartment such as water soils wastewater and sewage sludge needs attention as well4 sewage can be used to determine the scale of covid-19 the so-called sewage epidemiology or waste based epidemiology wbe approach in untreated waste water the virus causing covid-19 via feces introduced in waste water can survive from hours to days first data on covid-19 in sewage in europe was reported recently in the netherlands by rivm national institute for public health and the environment patients with covid-19 in their gastrointestinal tract will thus excrete it in their feces rivm has previously used this approach to detect the presence of norovirus antibiotic-resistant bacteria the poliovirus and the measles virus in wastewater 5few weeks later covid-19 virus was detected in sewage waters from australia 6 and paris france 7 detection of sars-cov-2 is generally carried out with nucleic acid  based polymerase chain reactionpcr assay used for confirmation of covid-19 patients around the globe pcr has high sensitivity and specificity requirements for complicated sample handling in the laboratory skilled personnel and a long period of data processing and analysis 4  6 hhospitals need as well our attention do we know if our current disinfection technologies are enough to treat the virus medical doctors hospital personnel and the patients are staying in as safe facility examples on general disinfection procedures and new treatment technologies will be reported too to that end a drug therapy options for humans is needed for covid-19 infection before a vaccine is ready few examples based on different drug therapies were reported and are being used in trials in the us france and spainzhou and xie 8 report a comprehensive study on covid-19 infection in 122 chinese cities during january-february 2020 the most relevant finding is that there is no evidence supporting that case counts of covid-19 decline with warmer weather this is one of the few studies that does not find a decrease on covid-19 outbreak when ambient temperature increases most of all other studies reported indicate just the contrary warmer temperature should decrease covid-19 outbreak one reason could be that this study was performed in winter time with lower temperatures than spring or summer period in contrast luo bin et al 9 describe the effects of daily temperature and humidity on daily deaths of covid-19 that took place in wuhan during january-february this year that is the same period as with zhou and xie 8 in this case the findings indicate that increase of temperature and humidity had a positive effect and the number of covid-19 deaths which decreased same effect was also noticed in jakarta indonesia from january-march 2020 10 but in addition to the meteorological factor the very high mobility and high density of the people living in jakarta with around 9 6 millions inhabitants is a key factor for fast transmission of covid-19air quality seems to be as well a key environmental factor on the covid-19 infections two recent studies were performed in this regard in the north of italy this year 1112 results reported in both studies go in the same direction there is a high association of covid-19 infections with air pollution of cities measured during days exceeding the limits set for pm10 or ozone in previous years 11 a relevant conclusion of this work 11 and others also published is that at cities with poor air quality like some in the north of italy increased probability of covid-19 infections are mainly due to air pollution-to-human rather than to human-to-humanthe other selected paper also from north of italy indicates that lombardy and emilia romagna are some of the european regions with the poorest air quality index defined as pm10 pm 25 o3 sos and no2 12 defenses of specially elderly living in this region could have been weakened both by age and chronic exposure to air pollution prolonged exposure to atmospheric pollution could induce persistent modifications of the immune system and this will boost covid-19 infections and eventually to death particularly in case of severe respiratory and cardiovascular problemsthe improvement of air quality in barcelona spain under lockdown measures was recently reported 13 after two weeks of lockdown urban air pollution markedly decreased but with substantial differences among pollutants the most significant reduction was estimated for black carbon and no2 -45 to -51 pollutants mainly related to traffic emissions a lower reduction was observed for pm10 -28 to -310 by contrast o3 levels increased 33 to 57 of the 8 h daily maxima probably due to lower titration of o3 by no and the decrease of nox in a voc-limited environment in the same direction correlation between no2 levels with covid-19 outbreak analysis has been conducted on a regional scale and combined with the number of death cases taken from 66 administrative regions in italy spain france and germany 14 results show that out of the 4443 fatality cases 3487 78 were in five regions located in north italy and central spain additionally the same five regions show thehighest no2 concentrations combined with downwards airflow which preventan efficient dispersion of air pollution recently this work 14 did receive negative comments since no2 were only collected by satellite and no ground measurements were included such correlation may not be applicable to other countries such as taiwan that although exhibits high no2 levels does not follow the same pattern with low covid-19 infectionsanother factor that may influence covid-19 infections is the pollen that starts in spring a recent paper from the netherlands is not on covid-19 but flu and collects data from the last four years 15 summarizing the results indicates that more pollen in the air might make more difficult for flu-like virus to survive outside the host acting the pollen as firewall pollen in the atmosphere increases general immune-responses and are a casual factor reducing the spread of flu-like viruses to that end the authors indicate that there is a possibility that covid-19 will be seasonal going away in maychristian daugthon 16 former epa scientist and pioneer on the wbe concept reported about the urgency among researchers for the need to develop waste based epidemiology methods not just for covid-19 but also for future epidemics basic principle is that sewage can be used as indicator of the scale of infection and it will boost worldwide attention and interest in wbe daughton and many others we do believe that collective efforts of the wbe community need to be granted as recognition that they deserve in addressing ongoing urgent needs of public health the first data detecting covid-19 in sewage from the netherlands 5 australia 6 and paris france 7 supports this idea of using wbe to reveal the scale of covid-19 outbreak several other papers 16 17 18 19 20 21 reported the importance to detect viruses in untreated wastewater samples and to develop paper sensor devices to measure directly in wastewaters these measurements were carried out using pcr the most widely used method for covid-19 detection paper-based devices are powerful and cheap tools for the rapid diagnosis of pathogens and determination infection of transmission 17 it contains different functional areas printed with a wax printer into a cheap paper material the whole testing process using this paper-based device is very fast and sensitive which overcomes the limitation of pcr and it was used for a variety of infections such as malaria and several pathogens 17other papers published in the literature already reported the presence and fate of enveloped viruses 18 or the inactivation of an enveloped surrogate virus in human sewage 19 the results of this last paper were performed as a way to model ebola presence in sewage the inactivation kinetics of enveloped viruses in sewage used certain bacteriophage as rna member of the cystoviridae as a potential surrogate for enveloped human viruses in sewage results reported that it can undergo 6  7 log inactivation in sewage in 3  7 days depending on temperatureanother relevant paper reported how much reduction of virus is needed for recycled waste water recommending an additional 2- to 3-log reduction of viruses above current recommendations to ensure safe recycled water 20 the last paper selected concerning the presence of viruses in wastewaters is also about the survival of two surrogate coronaviruses transmissible gastroenteritis tgev and mouse hepatitis in water21 the authors did find out that these viruses remained infectious in water and sewage for days to weeks at 25 c time required for 99 reduction in reagent-grade water was 22 days for tgev at present we do not know if the same is applicable to covid-19 and for how long it can remain in water what we know from recent studies is that fecal transmission routes should be considered as the covid-19 virus has been positively detected in stool samples of infected patients studies have shown that sars-cov can survival in stool samples for 4 days 22 or even up 22 days much longer than in respiratory 18 days and serum samples 16 days collected from patients of zheijiang province hospital 23 in short infected stools in wastewater can generate further transmission routes through aerosols formation during wastewater treatmenthospitals are key element to treat and recover patients infected with covid-19 disinfection techniques most appropriate for the rooms personnel and medical equipment are required an interesting study performed on indoor air quality at the largest hospital in iran 24 the air of patient rooms with confirmed covid-19 was investigated last march 2020 viral rna was extracted and analyzed by pcr rt-pcr fortunately in this study all air samples which were collected 2 to 5 m from the patients beds with confirmed covid-19 were negative the indoor air was not contaminated with the virus causing covid-19 the authors suggested as well to perform in vivo experiments using actual patient cough sneeze and breath aerosols in order to show the possibility of generation of the airborne size carrier aerosols and the viability fraction of the embedded virus in those carrier aerosols disinfection technologies at hospitals are certainly a key issue to avoid the large number of medical doctors and front-line healthcare workers hcwthat is being continuously infected by covid-19 neil rowan 25 presents a comprehensive insight into this pressing need with preference towards environmental-friendly sustainable disinfection technologies this is needed too because of the shortage in supply chain of critical one-time-use personal and protective equipment ppe ppe are heat sensitive and are not by their manufacturers design intended for reprocessing most conventional sterilization technologies used in hospitals or in terminal medical device sterilization providers cannot effectively reprocess ppe due to the nature and severity of sterilization modalities eco-friendly technologies are being recommend and used in ireland namely vaporized hydrogen peroxide vhp such as for filtering face piece respirators and uv irradiation to be added that uv irradiation was already recommend for other disinfection applications including toilet flushing 26 ultraviolet waveband c uv-c for disinfection was effective for the three types of bacteria studied staphylococcus epidermidis escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium an excellent review and recommended reading on photocatalytic disinfection technologies for waterborne viruses was recently published last year 27disinfection procedures applied to hospitals indoor facilities developed in china used mainly chlorine 28 for the contaminated areas disinfection four times daily the environment air floor and the surface of tables are sprayed with a 2000 mgl chlorine-containing disinfectant for no less than 30 minutes less contaminated areas will require less chlorine and daily frequency for the air disinfection window opening uv irradiation for 30 minutes and spraying with 500 mgl chlorine-containing disinfectant for more than 30 min are common methods these disinfection procedures are being sued in europe toorecently published papers on treatment options and a list of drugs available have been reported recently in the literature to help with covid-19 like antiviral drugs anti-malaria and anti-inflammatory 329 30 31 there are also publications mainly from china and india 3 who recommended traditional medicinal plants to treat covid-19 several agents are being used under clinical trial and compassionate use protocols based on in vitro activity against covid-19 or related viruses and on limited clinical experience efficacy has not been established for any drug therapy this list includes antimicrobials with potential activity against covid-19 chloroquineand hydroxychloroquine both used  in vitro and limited clinical data suggest potential benefit 29 other therapeutic drugs are lopinavir remdesivir 31 and favipiravir  their potential use is being studied azithromycin and immunomodulating agents are used in some protocols based on theoretical mechanisms and limited preliminary data as adjunct therapy covid-19 convalescent plasma is also under investigation nsaids such as paracetamol and bronchodilators are as well in this listout the list of therapeutic drugs reported the antibiotic azithromicyn added to the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine is used in clinical trials in marseille france and some parts of us important information needs to be added to the use of these therapies during the submission of the revised version of this opinion paper the us national institute of allergy and infectious disease niaid did question the use of hydroxychloroquine as drug therapy also recently ivermectin an fda-approved anti-parasitic previously shown to have broad spectrum anti-viral activity in vitro was shown to be an inhibitor of covid-19 30 certainly ivermectin therefore warrants further investigation for possible benefits in humans in the meantime these pharmaceuticals are beneficials for humans waiting for the vaccine to comeit is obvious that covid-19 was not in our radar a couple of months ago everybody thought this was a chinese problem but now is already a global threat to make things easier for everybody the commonly used environmental source-pathway-receptor spr concept can be used to explain covid-19 the source are infected humans and a risk-based approachmeasure was applied isolate the sources andor cure the sources the pathway it clear too covid-19 spreads via aerosols sneezed our coughed out by infected humans the virus thus gets direct to the receptor or sticks to all kinds of surfaces plastics stainless steel etc but stays only active for few hours-days finally the receptors are other humans and the risk-based approach is to isolate the receptors or make them immune by a vaccine or move receptors away to an area with no source-pathwayin untreated wastewater we already know that sars-cov-2 is present maybe even for several weeks gastrointestinal symptoms caused bysars-cov-2 infections as well as its presence in feces of covid-19 patients and in wastewater was already shown still one of the major challenges in sarscov-2 detectionquantification in wastewater samples is the lack of an optimized and standardized protocol wbe can help solving the pressing problem of insufficient diagnostic testing and it will provide a cheap and early warning method for covid-19 outbreak to make things crystal clear wbe will be complementary and not an alternative to the compulsory pcr detection of covid-19 in humans papers reported up till now on other types of viruses indicate that different viruses remained infectious in water and sewage for 3-7 days to 2-3 weeks special attention needs to be paid to the aerosol formation during wastewater treatment the key question would be to know for how long covid-19 will survive in sewage remains openthat being said covid-19 will stay with us for quite some time now we know much more than few months ago but still we need to do more to solve this global threat future measures should include more comprehensive surveillance of the environment through air and water in addition to the availability of rapid elisabiosensorspaper-based tests for screening the general population and the sewage against covid-19 paper-based devices would be certainly one of the best measurement solutions for the rapid and on-site detection of covid-19 in sewage waters and humans as well i am aware that different research groups are already working on this direction being a perfect example the recent paper on the development of optomechanical spectrometry detection showed a promising solution towards the fast detection of label-free diagnosis of infectious diseases32 in addition to the development of new detection methods theoretical computational analysis has been recently reported as a way to identify active coronavirus infections locally and globally using wbe it was applied to the covid-19 virus monitoring in tempe az us as case study assumptions made for modeling did consider daily excretion rates in human stool samples between 100-400 g of fecesperson 33as regards to protective measures for the employees working in wastewater treatment plants most of them are already in place since wastewaters contain different microorganisms and it is part of their common practice the list of measures includes  to avoid direct contact with wastewater to avoid ingesting swallowing andor breathing in wastewater spray or mist and to wear personal protective equipment protective measures for workers at places at high risk like hospitals and other medical care facilities is certainly more important and need to be in place in spain up till now 15 of the people infected by covid-19 virus were medical doctors and hospital personnel safeguarding supply chain of ppe will sustain vital healthcare provision and will help to reduce mortality we need to plan strategically to ensure global manufacture access protection and monitoring of supply chains in the face of unescapable shortages cost increases and national hoarding all our fates are bound together and any helpful products must be recognized as global assetsin short still a lot of work needs to be done and hopefully this opinion paper will help not also scientists but general public that wants to know a bit more about this new and terrific coronavirus that will keep all of us busy for quite some time in the years to comethe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paperthe two major thrusts of infectious disease biosecurity are 1 reducing the likelihood of introduction of an infectious agent into a group external biosecurity and 2 reducing the likelihood of its transmission when present internal or within-herd biosecurity or biocontainment when approaching the control and prevention of neonatal enteric infections knowledge of several general infectious disease epidemiology principles is useful essential information for designing a herd-specific control program for any infectious disease includes 1 the reservoir 2 the modes of transmission and the agent characteristics related to each 3 the incubation period and 4 the period of communicability the minimum incubation period along with the infectious dose and the age of the calf is critical because for example it establishes the maximum length of time a susceptible calf can be present in a critical calving facility before it could begin to contaminate the area if it were infected at birth the most important reservoir for these enteric agents is previously or currently infected cattle which is critical for producers to recognize when they are considering purchasing animals and when they are managing contact between different age groups within a herdmost of these agents transmit predominately by the fecal-oral route from the feces of infected animals to the mouths of susceptible animals and do so efficiently immediate transmission occurs when infected animals are housed with susceptible animals in conditions that allow nose-to-nose contact or inhalation of aerosols produced by coughing urinating or defecating indirect contact transmission requires that the infectious agent survive in the environment most agents of neonatal calf diarrhea survive well in nearly all environmental conditions remaining in the environment where they can be transmitted indirectly by contact with contaminated feces fomites such as equipment or mechanical vectors such as flies for enteric agents transmitted by indirect contact key factors include the number of organisms shed in the feces and their survival characteristics in the environment compared with the infectious dose required to initiate infection in susceptible hosts information on the environmental survival characteristics of an indirectly transmitted agent is needed to determine how long that agent is likely to remain at an infectious dose once the area is contaminated with it all of this is critical information for determining how to manage livestock flow through an existing set of facilities and to otherwise minimize disease transmission through management practices the relationship between infecting agents and the environment is complex involving factors such as the physical characteristics of the substrate material eg feces water milk manure slurry dust temperature ph water activity and competing microorganisms as a consequence these relationships are not well defined for many combinations encountered in the farm environmentwith the rare exception it is likely that most infectious enteric agents of cattle co-evolved with their bovine hosts long before their domestication thousands of years ago 51 52 if an agent was able to survive under the free-range conditions of the wild bovine it is likely that transmission occurs relatively easily in the environment of the intensively managed domesticated bovine of today indeed these agents are shed by infected animals in numbers several logarithms higher per gram of feces than the total number required to infect the typical susceptible calf additionally these agents have been shown to be extraordinarily flexible with regard to their genetic make-up and through survival of the fittest can rapidly take advantage of new environments and management systems consequently intervention strategies devoted to a single control point may be successful in the short run but are likely to prove unsuccessful over the long runan important concept that is often overlooked particularly in the midst of clinical disease outbreaks is the iceberg principle this concept is in effect both within and between herds between herds clinical disease is normally seen in only a minority of herds in which its occurrence implies significant suboptimal management conditions within herds generally only a small proportion of affected animals are clinically affected with most being subclinically infected for most diseases both infectious and noninfectious the ratio between clinical cases and subclinical cases is typically 15 to 120 in some circumstances a herd can be widely infected with an agent yet few if any clinical cases occur consideration of the iceberg principle helps prioritize efforts because in most outbreaks attention is typically but erroneously focused only on individual animals displaying clinical signs to wit if isolation and sanitation practices are to be an important component of a disease control strategy the iceberg principle suggests that to be effective such measures must be applied to all exposed animals and not just those that exhibit clinical signsappropriate cleaning and disinfection procedures are critical to breaking fecal-oral transmission cycles of enteric agents that contaminate housing feeding or treatment equipment or other vectors and fomites because personal hygiene is crucial to stopping the transmission of these agents in the human hospital environment it is also a critical component in the intense livestock production environment as well this personal hygiene includes frequent effective hand washing of sufficient duration with soap followed by an alcohol-based hand disinfectant 50 cleaning and disinfecting boots and washing work clothes with bleach followed by hot air drying cleaning and disinfection procedures are not without pitfalls however and adherence to a sound protocol covering all of the infectious agents of concern is critical for long-term success procedures that do not affect a resistant agent such as cryptosporidia oocysts or rotavirus may spread it from areas of high concentration across previously uncontaminated surfaces where it can then contaminate materials such as water and feed at sufficient levels to provide an infectious dose the most important first step is thorough cleaning to remove organic material eg feces milk film before applying disinfectant 46 vigorous cleaning scraping scrubbing flushing cannot be replaced by applying disinfectants in larger quantities or with higher pressure for any protocol or in nature destruction of microorganisms initially follows a first-order logarithmic decay process and then slows 74 in relation to the amount of time required to destroy one half of the initial population approximately three time periods are required for a one-logarithmic 90 reduction six for a two-logarithmic 99 reduction nine for a three-logarithmic 999 reduction and so on in addition to contact time the concentration temperature ph water content water hardness and amount of organic material present are critical variables determining the success of chemical disinfection importantly the relationships between these factors are not straightforward 54 for example halving the concentration of formaldehyde requires a 2-fold increase in contact time to obtain similar microbial destruction whereas halving the concentration of phenolics requires a 64-fold increase in contact time a 10c rise in temperature increases the activity of alcohols 30-fold yet increases the activity of formaldehyde only 15-fold iodophors are highly active at low ph but are inactive at an alkaline ph in general effectively applied live steam inactivates the broadest range of microorganismssodium hypochlorite bleach naocl at a sufficient concentration contact time and temperature combination is effective against the bacterial and viral agents of neonatal enteric disease 87 but at practical levels is not effective against cryptosporidium oocysts it is readily available as 525 household bleach and 1275 solutions and it is cost effective and environmentally safe because it begins dissipating on dilution however the centers for disease control recommends that diluted solutions should be used within 24 hours and that they should be stored in opaque containers sodium hypochlorite is rapidly inactivated by the presence of any appreciable organic material for example 1 albumin reduces its effectiveness by six logs and increasing concentration or contact time does not recover this loss bacteria in biofilms are 150 to 3000 times more resistant in solution hypochlorus acid is the active form of the free chlorine it is most available at a ph level of 6 dropping to 80 of the free chlorine at ph 7 and to 25 at ph 8 suggesting that the ph of disinfectant solutions should be monitored regularly as part of disinfection protocols below ph 6 it is more corrosive to metals and more chlorine gas is released testing kits can be used to monitor free chlorine as part of disinfection protocols however because these kits measure both hypochlorus acid and hypochlorite ion nonactive form ph must also be considered recommended concentrations for use in human environments range from 500 ppm 1100 dilution of 525 household bleach and 10-minute contact time at room temperature to 5000 ppm 110 dilution of 525 bleach and 1-minute contact time at room temperature the higher concentrations being used in more critical areas for viruses in veterinary hospitals and kennels a recommended dilution of household bleach is 132 which results in a 0175 sodium hypochlorite solution and a 10-minute contact time at room temperature 93 at ph 6 to 7the characteristics of environmental surfaces targeted for disinfection in the farm environment also influence the success or failure of various procedures 62 for example unfinished plywood retains 15-fold more microorganisms than varnished plywood which supports 15-fold more microorganisms than plastic surfaces on smooth ideal surfaces physical removal of visible contamination by thorough washing with soap and water removes 99 of the microbial load two logs on typical housing surfaces however washing only removes 90 one log proper disinfection removes an additional 6 to 7 and terminal fumigation removes 1 to 2 disinfection after washing is an important step particularly if the surface remains damp because remaining bacteria can proliferate in the minimal nutrients leaching from wet wood and because washing can disperse an infectious agent from limited areas of high concentration broadly across other surfaces the application of high-pressure sprays can aerosolize organisms allowing dissemination to distant sites and posing a risk to operators if zoonotic organisms are presentsubsets of salmonella enterica serovars such as s typhimurium and s dublin are important causes of diarrhea in dairy and veal calves whereas infections in single-suckle beef calves are infrequent the pathophysiology of enteric salmonella infections is complex involving inflammation and necrosis increased fluid secretion and decreased absorption and digestion in addition to enteric manifestations of disease infected calves are frequently septicemic which results in more severe clinical signs bacteremia is common in calves less than 1 month of age and is often manifested systemically as polyarthritis meningitis or uveitis in addition to shedding the agent in their feces calves developing septicemia often shed the agent in their urine and oronasal secretions even before the onset of clinical signs the lack of awareness about the potential for shedding from the oronasal area is particularly dangerous because this source leads to spread through contamination of feeding and treatment utensils and hands severely compromising internal biosecurity programs hardman and coworkers 38 found that in natural outbreaks of individually penned calves approximately 60 of transmission was by direct contact whereas 40 was by indirect routes including aerosols fomites and vectors this finding suggests that emphasis should be placed more broadly on controlling all means of transmission including aerosols 105
salmonella spp are hardy organisms that are well adapted to surviving in the environment 31 they are able to proliferate rapidly at high ambient temperatures in waste milk colostrum and moist feeds in the absence of direct sunlight or predation by other microorganisms salmonella spp can survive in wet or dry substrates or on surfaces for years particularly if they are protected by biological films such as dried saliva milk or fat biological films also protect organisms from the action of chemical disinfectants in an experiment that simulated a barn floor under defecating cows salmonella spp were shown to survive for 55 years 72 these researchers also found s typhimurium in an empty slurry pit that had not been used for 4 years because salmonella spp that infect cattle can infect and proliferate in the intestinal tracts of most other animals in a farm environment including other livestock humans domestic pets rodents and birds these other species may also be involved in disease transmission for example allowing cats access to stored feeds has been identified as a risk factor for salmonella outbreaks 26 serotypes that frequently infect cattle are typically introduced into a herd by subclinical or incubating carrier animals and only occasionally in feedstuffs many of the other serotypes imported onto farms in purchased feedstuffs appear unable to establish viable transmission cycles between cattle instead causing only sporadic infectionsof special note is that salmonella spp and c parvum infections in livestock present significant zoonotic disease risks to in-contact people and in turn to their contacts particularly young children the elderly and the immunocompromised because of these significant health risks indirect and direct contact between susceptible individuals and livestock potentially infected with these agents should be minimized hands should be washed well using soap and warm water and scrubbing for 15 seconds followed by an alcohol-based antiseptic hand rub 50 before eating or returning to the household inhalation of potentially contaminated dusts or aerosols particularly those generated by cleaning procedures such as high-pressure washing should be minimized to reduce the likelihood of introducing these agents into the household and their transmission to susceptible humans or domestic pets equipment outer garments and footwear exposed to potentially infected animals and their discharges should not be brought into the householdas a major bacterial component of feces from warm-blooded animals e coli are ubiquitous in the environment of neonatal beef and dairy calves all e coli types can cause colisepticemia but relatively few can cause enteric disease enteric e coli infections are classified into several forms including enterotoxigenic enteropathogenic enteroinvasive enterohemorrhagic and enteroadherent 53 enterotoxigenic e coli are the most common form associated with disease in calves the ability of enterotoxigenic e coli to cause severe herd outbreaks of diarrhea in calves results from the expression of virulence factors including adhesins pili fimbria and enterotoxins adhesins eg k99 f41 k88 are surface molecules that enable the bacteria to attach to specific receptors located on the intestinal epithelium of calves less than 3 days old once attached to intestinal cells via adhesins bacterial expression of enterotoxins triggers intestinal fluid secretion in excess of absorptive capacity in addition to enteric diseases caused by e coli systemic invasion by certain strains can result in septic shock and low-grade diarrhea diarrhea observed in these calves is generally thought to be due to endotoxemia secondary to bacteremia rather than production of enterotoxinsalthough not as hardy as salmonella spp e coli survive well on typical farm environmental surfaces and in feces and dust protected from moisture and direct sunlight 8 58 in experimentally inoculated cow manure or fresh slurry under common farm environmental conditions both organisms decrease by one log in 1 to 3 weeks 42 depending on the surface characteristics the numbers of organisms decline at about 025 log per day generally the rate of decline is slower at lower humidity but proliferation can occur on surfaces under saturated conditions with minimal organic nutrients 05 mgl exposure to ultraviolet components in direct sunlight rapidly kills the organism 24rotavirus is a double-stranded nonenveloped rna virus rotaviruses are the most common cause of bovine neonatal diarrhea the incidence of infection often approaching 100 in herds and up to one half of infections resulting in clinical disease infection usually occurs between 4 and 14 days of age although younger and older calves can be affected 66 because the median infectious dose for rotaviral infections in other species is 10 infectious particles or less 36 103 the infectious dose for neonatal calves is likely similar viral invasion of small intestinal villus epithelium occurs through the luminal surface resulting in cell destruction and shedding of damaged cells into the intestinal lumen as a consequence of this infection route the incubation period is short and large numbers of virus particles are produced rapidly within 48 hours of initial infection the virus can reach 11010 ten billion virus particles per gram of feces villous atrophy and cellular damage result in maldigestion and malabsorption maldigestion results from the loss of hydrolytic enzymes produced by mature villous cells failure to hydrolyze milk lactose results in lactose transit into the large intestine where it acts osmotically pulling water into the intestinal lumen in addition to decreased enzyme activity sodium and water transport processes are impaired resulting in malabsorption some rotavirus strains are pneumotropic replicating in the respiratory tract and transmitting via inhalation and by the fecal-oral route rotavirus is carried in adult cattle through nonclinical infection with intermittent fecal shedding 47 shedding increases coincident with later stages of gestation and for up to 4 weeks postpartum in some management situations this maternal shedding may account for most virus exposures to neonatal calves 28being a nonenveloped rna virus rotavirus is relatively stable in the environment being infectious in feces for up to 6 months at 25c in smears of human feces human rotavirus was more stable at lower temperatures and at humidity extremes 59 infectious particles declined by 1 log in 29 days at 4c and 93 relative humidity in 16 days at 4c and 13 relative humidity in 22 days at 20c and 55 relative humidity and in 15 days at 37c and 13 relative humidity some research suggests that bovine rotavirus may be more resistant than human rotavirus virus stability in water varies with water quality and temperature ranging from being very stable in clean water at 4c to falling 2 logs in 10 days in typical river water at 20c 84 as temperatures above 60c are lethal to the virus 68 standard milk pasteurization procedures are effective against it rotavirus is susceptible to sufficient concentrations of sodium hypochlorite 1750 ppm but is relatively resistant to many common disinfectants such as chlorhexidine under the same exposure conditions because as a nonenveloped virus it is not affected by soaps washing with soap alone may actually spread the virus around on the washed surface 23coronavirus is an enveloped single-stranded rna virus and is not as stable in the environment as rotavirus 27 serologic studies have demonstrated that the prevalence of serum antibodies to coronavirus approaches 100 in adult beef and dairy cattle calves are typically infected by coronavirus between 4 and 30 days of life 66 although they may not be the same virus strains evidence is mounting that a respiratory form as well as the enteric form occurs 97 similar to rotavirus infection results in damage to intestinal villous epithelium however infection by coronavirus often results in more severe disease manifestations because the degree of villous atrophy is greater and both the large and small intestines are affected as described for rotavirus coronavirus is carried in adult cattle through nonclinical infection and is shed in fecal matter because of their envelope these viruses retain infectiousness better at lower rather than higher relative humidity 24 and are considerably more sensitive to soaps and common disinfectants than are nonenveloped viruses this virus is more active in the colder climates and has been reported to cause winter dysentery in adult cattle 16 27 control of coronavirus and rotavirus infections in calves relies on continual presence of a protective antibody within the gut lumen which can be achieved by allowing neonates to ingest colostrum or milk containing these specific antibodies from their dams lactogenic immunity 19
cryptosporidium parvum is a common cause of neonatal calf diarrhea between 7 and 21 days of age rarely causing diarrhea at less than 7 or more than 28 days of age 22 similar to rotavirus and coronavirus infection the incidence of infection with cryptosporidia often approaches 100 in the first month of life infection often occurs concurrently with rotavirus and coronavirus infections and a respiratory form may occur unlike most other enteric protozoa cryptosporidium are immediately infectious when passed and can infect other susceptible hosts through direct contact because cryptosporidium can autoinfect the original host the infectious dose can be exceedingly small for example the median infectious dose for humans is only 87 oocysts 29 and some researchers suggest it is even lower for neonatal calves cryptosporidia infect and invade enterocytes in the distal small intestine causing villous atrophy and fusion that result in malabsorption and maldigestion infected calves may shed 105 to 107 oocysts per gram of feces beginning with the onset of clinical signs importantly fecal shedding can continue days after clinical signs subside in california beef cowcalf herds atwill et al 7 found that higher stocking densities longer calving periods and wetter seasons were associated with higher fecal shedding prevalences in calves research findings on the adult carrier state are conflicting because some have found that adult carrier animals are common 92 whereas others have found that few if any asymptomatic adult cattle apparently shed cryptosporidium parvum in appreciable numbers 6 55 undoubtedly infected calves are likely the most important reservoir for continuing the fecal-oral cycle on most farms because of the large numbers of oocysts that they excrete in close proximity to susceptible calves 22in the environment cryptosporidia are extremely resistant to most veterinary disinfectants except 5 ammonia 6 hydrogen peroxide or 10 formalin 14 86 107 they survive well in water requiring 4 to 11 weeks to decline by 1 log 15 because the oocysts adhere in large numbers to the plastic and rubber surfaces of common calf-feeding and treatment equipment such as nipples bottles and buckets er atwill dvm phd 2001 personal communication common sanitation procedures are not likely to prevent fomite transmission by these items a portion of the oocysts still retain their infectivity after mild freezing 30 on the other hand complete drying in thin naturally infected fecal smears on wood kills the oocysts within 1 to 4 days 2 finally because moist heating at 45c for 20 minutes kills the oocysts 3 standard pasteurization procedures eg 63c for 30 minutes 72c for 15 seconds are effective
eimeria bovis and e zurnii are the species of coccidia most commonly associated with calf diarrhea with a prepatent period of approximately 17 days calves exposed to an infectious dose shortly after birth can present with bloody diarrhea and anemia by the third week of life diagnosis is easiest in calves with acute infections because many shed large numbers of oocysts in the feces chronically infected calves may only shed small to moderate numbers of oocysts in the stool however making diagnosis more difficultthe presence of developmental congenital or heritable abnormalities in a calf can be a risk factor depending on the character location and degree of the defect certainly any abnormality that prevents a calf from functioning normally eg ambulating or obtaining adequate nutrition can increase the chance of a severe enteric infectionfailure of passive transfer of maternal immunity through colostrum ingestion is a major risk factor for development of neonatal diarrhea 21 56 in the 1992 us department of agriculture national dairy heifer evaluation project wells et al 108 found that feeding a sufficient amount of colostrum soon enough after birth prevented 31 of the dairy heifer mortality that occurred in the first 21 days of life colostrum provides the necessary components of immunity during the time when a calf is immunonaive yet exposed to pathogens in its environment consumption of colostral immunoglobulin from resident cows in a herd is likely to provide immunologic protection specific to the strains of pathogens found within that herd importantly even if colostral immunoglobulin specificity is appropriate for specific pathogens maximum protection is ultimately dependent on the ingestion and absorption of an adequate mass of immunoglobulin by the calf immunoglobulin concentration varies from breed to breed however as well as from cow to cow within a breed such differences are well illustrated by the fact that the average concentration of immunoglobulin in beef cow colostrum is 2 to 3 times greater than that of dairy cow colostrum 73 106 as expected the most important factor involved in failure of passive transfer in dairy calves is low immunoglobulinconcentration colostrum whereas in beef calves delayed suckling is a leading cause 12 for dairy cows colostrum that is not from first milking from cows that leaked milk or from cows that weighed more than 20 lb should not be used for passive transfer 73 in certain situations beef calves may be provided alternate sources of colostrum including colostrum obtained from nearby dairies again it is imperative to appreciate that because the average immunoglobulin concentration of dairy cow colostrum is low compared with beef cow colostrum an adequate volume 4 l of appropriately selected dairy cow colostrum must be fed in addition one must also consider the risk of introducing novel pathogens when supplementing calves with an off-farm source of nonpasteurized colostrum unless properly pasteurized dairy colostrum purchased for administration to beef calves in place of their dams colostrum may be contaminated with infectious doses of undesirable infectious agents such as mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis as well as the enteric agents of concern described in this articlethe nutritional status of the dam particularly during late gestation when the fetus is active metabolically and growing exponentially is often of concern in relation to the immune status and health of the calf after birth 21 the effect of nutrition and other factors such as dystocia on passive transfer in dairy cattle was recently reviewed by quigley and drewry 75 there is little evidence of a direct link between gestational cow nutrition and immunoglobulin concentration of the calves 71 the weak calf syndrome however has been reported in beef cattle when prepartum cows consuming diets deficient in protein or energy protein-energy malnutrition either because of improper feeding practices or other factors such as severe weather events in late gestation subsequently calve in environments in which the temperature is below the thermoneutral zone of the calf 67 69 therefore it is only logical to recommend that producers provide feeds adequate in quantity and quality to meet national research council requirements for beef cattle and dairy cattle during gestation and lactationin comparison with beef calves dairy calves are often fed milk replacer diets because the cost is lower than that of cows milk the composition and quality of milk replacers varies considerably however much to the detriment of very young calves with limited digestive capabilities some milk replacers contain heat-denatured milk-origin proteins poorly digestible vegetable-origin proteins or nonlactose carbohydrate sources that the intestinal enzymes of neonatal calves cannot digest consumption of such products frequently results in inadequate nutrition poor growth rates and high morbidity and mortality due to enteric diseases 83 often the feeding recommendations for even high-quality milk replacers are designed for 60-lb calves rather than the average 90-lb holstein calf placing the larger calves into a negative energy and protein balance until their starter consumption increases sufficiently nutrition of the neonatal calf is an active area of research much of which has been summarized by davis and drackley 21 and changes in nutritional guidelines often reduce the risk of neonatal disease in addition excellent reviews on the relationship between neonatal digestive physiology and the different ingredients contained in milk replacers are available 37 82if nonsaleable milk is fed it should be pasteurized before feeding to reduce the likelihood of transmitting these and other infectious enteric agents a recent study found that raw milk and mixed milk replacer often contain high numbers of bacteria ranging from 103 colony-forming units cfusml for mixed milk replacer to more than 106 cfusml for hospital milk 94 another study found that calves fed pasteurized waste milk perform better in terms of weight gain mortality morbidity and health costs than those fed the same milk raw even in the absence of the specific enteric agents of concern discussed in this article 45 pasteurization controls their milk-borne transmission as wellfinally the source of calves is a risk factor for enteric diseases when calves have been commingled from several sources or origins certainly calves purchased from sale yards are more likely to have been exposed to higher concentrations and to a wider variety of pathogens compared with single-source calves or calves on pasture frequently calves are purchased from market sources to graft onto cows that have lost their own offspring such purchased calves often introduce new strains of infectious agents that then spread through the herd in an outbreak fashion making the situation considerably worse in addition to increased exposure to pathogens calves transiting through sale yards are likely to be under more severe physiologic stress and more likely to have had failure of passive transfer 106 a study of beef cowcalf herds found that purchasing such calves at less than 4 weeks of age increased the likelihood of a high-mortality diarrhea outbreak over four-fold 91the primary risk factors associated with infectious agents that cause enteric infections include specific virulence factors the size of the inoculum or pathogen load and whether single or multiple infections existas mentioned previously virulence factors associated with bacteria include structural elements such as pili that allow bacteria to attach to the host as well as bacterial products that augment bacterial cell growth enhance host cell damage or negate the immune response of the host both exotoxins and endotoxins can have adverse effects other virulence factors of enteric bacteria include those that enhance bacterial ability to resist antimicrobial agents through expression of drug resistance plasmids or integronsvirulence factors associated with enteric viruses or protozoa are less well described different strains or serotypes of viruses have been identified however most strains of a particular virus appear to act similarly the challenge load of enteric bacteria protozoa and viruses from periparturient cattle is high because of the aforementioned physiologic immunosuppression 28when considering biosecurity or biocontainment it is critical to realize that the size of the inoculum or the pathogen concentration exposure dose is a major factor in determining the degree of clinical disease and the rapidity of its onset rather than whether exposure occurs this is especially true when considering the ubiquitous agents involved in bovine neonatal diarrhea because none are extraordinarily virulent in their own right it is logical to conclude that a large enough exposure dose such as that likely to occur during outbreaks will undoubtedly overwhelm even the best passive transfer of immunity and lead to an expanding outbreak in previously unaffected calvesrisk factors for neonatal diarrhea associated with the environment of the calf are likely to be the most amenable to the implementation of specific biosecurity measures specific risk factors include the atmospheric conditions temperature humidity wind chill ventilation air quality and so forth housing individual calf hutches enclosed group pens dispersal on pasture the physical environment calving area bedding other animals cleaning protocols and so forth stocking density general hygiene and hygiene related to feeding practices and miscellaneous stresses due to handling surgery transportation and the likemany of these potential risk factors are under management control because of the difficulty of executing rigorously designed large-scale studies with sufficient herd numbers to evaluate all potential risk factors reasoning from biological plausibility is often the only basis for developing interventions when sufficient evidence is not available although some findings are conflicting a limited number of field studies of different size and rigor do provide guidance for some of these risk factors for example bendali et al 11 found that cleaning of the calving area immediately before calving was associated with an increased risk of neonatal diarrhea in beef calves compared with not cleaning it whereas cleaning it after calving was associated with a decreased risk they also found that greater cow cleanliness was associated with decreased risk based on data from the 1997 us department of agriculture national beef cow-calf study sanderson and dargatz 88 reported that although 41 of birth-to-weaning mortality was attributable to dystocia 11 was due to confined calving in the 1992 us department of agriculture national dairy heifer evaluation project wells et al 108 found that separating heifers from their dams within the first 24 hours after birth prevented 16 of the dairy heifer mortality that occurred during the first 21 days of life quigely et al 76 found that calves administered sufficient amounts of colostrum and housed in individual calf hutches shed fewer enteric pathogens in their feces than calves left to nurse their dam and housed in an enclosed space with mechanical ventilation schumann et al 91 found that increased risk of neonatal diarrhea in beef calves was associated with wintering cows and primigravida heifers together providing limited shelter to nursing pairs and an increased percentage of poorly drained ground in the nursing area although the occurrence of diarrhea was not affected sivula et al 95 found that increased gain was associated with all-in all-out group management of weaned dairy calvessufficient ventilation is important to the health of housed calves 5 104 besides being critical for removal of transpired water vapor and reducing humidity sufficient ventilation in enclosed housing also removes infectious aerosols reducing humidity can also reduce the survival time of aerosolized and surface-borne infectious agents although more important for respiratory disease these factors in turn have an effect on the risk of enteric disease because salmonellosis cryptosporidiosis rotavirus and coronavirus agents can be transmitted by aerosols procedures that produce aerosols pressure washing housing flush systems considerably increase the risk of transmission 9 for example mohammed et al 60 found that dairy calves raised outside or in mechanically ventilated buildings were five-fold less likely to shed cryptosporidia parvum oocysts than those raised in nonventilated barnswithin the calfs environment other animal species may function as mechanical or biological vectors of enteric infectious agents particularly if they are present in large numbers and no control efforts are in effect these species include domestic pets humans and vermin such as insects rodents and birdsone of the most overlooked vectors that presents a significant disease transmission risk is the nuisance fly particularly the house fly musca domestica
35 during summer months before severe frosts fly populations typically increase to high numbers around concentrated livestock operations such as dairies and calf-raising operations liquids such as diarrhea and milk or materials containing soluble components such as dried molasses and solid feces are attractive to nuisance flies because the larvae require greater than 90 humidity to develop dampened organic calf bedding materials such as straw and sawdust provide an ideal substrate 89 90 the ability of these insects to transmit enteric pathogens from feces is well documented 18 49 specific physical characteristics of flies including mouth parts body hairs and spines and sticky foot pads can carry infectious agents in large numbers some pathogens pass through the fly digestive tract and remain viable in its feces when feeding the fly frequently moistens surfaces by regurgitating a vomit drop from its crop that contains residue including infectious agents from its previous meal fly spots are either such vomit drops or feces both of which contain high numbers of infectious agents studies have determined that flies are attracted to diarrheic feces that they can transmit cryptosporidia in numbers higher than the minimal infectious dose for healthy humans and that they can harbor this agent for 3 weeks after exposure 34 methods for controlling fly populations at different points in their life cycle have been reviewed 99 however it is important to point out that control methods based on chemical means alone are usually inadequate because flies readily develop resistance to such chemicalsrodents are also a frequently overlooked source of enteric pathogens in the farm environment they have been implicated in the transmission of salmonellosis in dairy 98 and beef herds 44 and even in poultry flocks 20 41 because the feces from infected mice typically contain up to 1104 salmonella per pellet 20 a single pellet may exceed the infectious dose for a susceptible calf current work suggests that rodents are a significant nonlivestock reservoir of cryptosporidium because approximately one third of rodents of any age even in nonlivestock ecosystems shed c parvum at an average of 1103 oocysts per fecal pellet 77 101 importantly significant rodent populations can be present long before their signs eg rodent droppings and runways are obvious or noticeable raccoons have also been reported to harbor s typhimurium 64those calves that are known to be particularly susceptible either because of age or other reasons should be isolated from each other and the rest of the herd as much as possible once infected particularly if infected clinically such calves essentially act as biological amplifiers amplifying a small but sufficient infectious dose into a much higher level of environmental contamination in their immediate surroundings and providing a high risk for transmission through direct contact because this increased environmental load likely exceeds the infectious dose threshold of individuals that were resistant to the prior environmental level more individuals become infected the infections are more severe because of the markedly higher dose the environmental level increases even more and an outbreak is underway evidence of such a cascade is provided in one study of herds in which calves that were born after the median calving date were twice as likely to develop diarrhea than those born before it 17 once started such a cascade is much more difficult to stop as compared with preventing its initiation in the first place evidence that members of larger groups are at increased risk of diarrhea is contained in a study of michigan dairies which found that the incidence of calf diarrhea was approximately proportional to herd size 32 this finding suggests that group sizes should be minimized as much as feasible some researchers suggesting that the ideal group size is 50 70all the common agents causing neonatal calf diarrhea are often present to some degree in the calves environment all of the agents are primarily transmitted by fecal-oral contact so the collective strategy for minimizing exposure of calves to pathogens should be focused on decreasing exposure to fecal contamination realizing that every ranch or farm has its own peculiarities regarding facilities and equipment the following comments and suggestions should be read as general statements specific modifications should be individually designed to fit each production systemregarding dairy or beef herds calving in confined areas such as barns the following biosecurity measures should be practiced to minimize pathogen exposure1remove late-gestation cows from areas heavily contaminated with feces such as winter feed grounds 1 month before calving to reduce hair coat carriage of enteric infectious agents shed by carrier cattle2separate cows requiring more intensive monitoring and thus closer confinement such as first-calf heifers or particularly valuable stock from those that do not3avoid moving cows into calving areas until immediately before delivery or as late as practical4ensure that calving pens are sanitized and well bedded before and between successive calvings5clean the perineum and particularly the udder of cows before delivery6harvest colostrum from clean sanitized udders into clean containers refrigerate it immediately or freeze in volumes no larger than a gallon if not administered to a calf promptly do not pool between dams7remove dairy calves immediately after birth and raise them in separate individual pens isolated from other calves and stock until they are older than 4 weeks8remove beef cowcalf pairs to a separate nursery area after bonding has occurred approximately 24 hours after birth
during the liquid-feeding phase from birth until weaning dairy calves should be housed in individual pens or hutches to avoid contact with one another and they should be isolated from other livestock their airspace and their effluent ideally individual housing should be designed to prevent suckling and licking behaviors as well as fecal cross-contamination so that transmission of enteric pathogens is minimized the specifics regarding the construction and area requirements for dairy calves have been reviewed 57 calves should continue to be housed individually until 7 to 10 days after weaning this separation allows calves to lose their suckling urge avoids the stress at weaning of changing social structure and interactions facilitates monitoring of feed intake during the weaning transition and allows more accurate observations of fecal characteristics and general health 63biosecurity of dairy or beef herds calving at pasture is approached with the following strategy1group primigravid heifers separately from cows during at least the last trimester of gestation2use designated calving grounds and calve heifers separately from cows such areas should not have been used by animals since the prior years calving season and should have been groomed shortly after the close of the calving season it should be well drained and situated away from bottomlands which tend to collect contaminants particularly in any standing water3minimize the population density of cows as much as practical and reduce group size 50 animals suggested areas per cow range from 1000 to 2000 square feet 794remove beef cowcalf pairs to a separate nursery area after bonding but within 24 hours of calving exercise one-way flow regarding animal movement5rotate feeding areas during the calving season to avoid fecal contamination and pathogen build-up
calves demonstrating signs of lethargy or diarrhea should be removed from the group as soon as possible and placed into an isolation area recall the iceberg principle and consider its group of cows and calves and their area contaminated placing subsequently calving cows and new calves into a separate clean area treatments should be instituted based on physical signs and if possible laboratory data diagnostic procedures such as fecal cultures fecal flotation and viral identification strategies can be performed these tests are especially important when infection with salmonella spp is a major rule out for diarrhea identification of rotavirus and coronavirus infection and cryptosporidiosis are arguably less essential for diagnostic purposes because in most outbreaks of acute undifferentiated diarrhea calves frequently shed one two or all three of the agents simultaneously detection of an infectious agent in a herd known through laboratory testing to be previously free of it however indicates that there has been a breach of herd biosecurity recovering calves should be quarantined away from other animals until after the shedding of pathogens has decreased to minimal levels or for at least 3 weeks aside from salmonella spp the neonatal enteric pathogens with the longest shedding time are rotavirus and coronavirus which some individuals may shed intermittently for lifepurchased animals should be placed in separate quarantine areas before mixing with existing herd animals especially if animals are purchased from public auctions because the likelihood that these animals have been exposed to high doses of multiple pathogens is great explosive outbreaks of calf scours in beef herds are often associated with the prior purchase of a dairy calf from a sale yard to replace a calf lost because of dystocia or some other reason a quarantine period of 21 days should be adequate to allow clinical identification of animals that are incubating any infection due to these enteric agents at the time of purchase quarantine of older animals for a similar period is justified because of the likelihood of increased shedding of enteric pathogens during periods of stress diagnostic procedures such as bacterial culture viral detection by electron microscopy and fecal flotation for parasite eggs can also be considered although it is unlikely that these tests will give a significant advantage compared with clinical observation and isolation they can determine the etiologic agents involved use of such tests in older animals is less beneficial because with the exception of salmonella spp many infected older animals shed low levels of enteric viruses because of the potential for false-negative results testing may lead to a false sense of security and management practices that are more important for establishing biosecurity may not be established and maintainedthe flow of personnel and livestock flow are important components of within-herd biosecurity 39 40 70 100 the critical first step is to establish infection control protocols preferably with input from those who will be responsible for executing them routine training and monitoring of personnel to ensure that they understand infection control protocols and that they are properly executing them are critical to biosecurity success because some aspects of these protocols involve significant additional effort an understanding of why the additional effort is necessary will likely result in better adherence personnel and equipment flow as well as livestock flow and its effluent flow should be one-way away from the youngest most susceptible calves toward older more resistant animals on farms with sufficient personnel and equipment tasks should be divided up between those personnel who remain clean for such tasks as mixing and delivering liquid feed and those who are potentially contaminated by performing tasks such as picking up empty milk bottles treating sick calves and so on personnel who are potentially contaminated through working with older or sick calves and their equipment should not return to areas with susceptible calves until they have changed their outer clothes and used appropriate procedures to thoroughly disinfect their hands boots and equipment some have recommended that calves that leave young susceptible groups such as for hospitalization should not return to that group for at least 3 weeks 100strict control of farm visitors must be maintained because many pathogens can be carried by humans or inanimate objects such as automobiles tractors livestock handling equipment or livestock feeding equipment for both their own and the animals health visitors should be discouraged from coming into contact with them or their effluent if animal contact is necessary visiting individuals should be provided with the means to wash their hands and footwear before and after contact barrier clothing should also be worn to prevent cross-contamination of separate facilitiesneonatal diarrhea is a multifactorial disease process infection alone is not sufficient to cause disease because although almost all calves are infected shortly after birth most do not develop clinical disease as mentioned previously the single strongest factor influencing the risk of death caused by neonatal calf diarrhea is the passive immune status of the calfthe concept of failure of passive transfer has largely been used to describe situations in which the neonate does not absorb adequate levels of colostral immunoglobulins this concept is undoubtedly attributable to the fact that immunoglobulins are such a large constituent of colostrum and they have been thoroughly studied it is clear however that colostrum is a complex fluid that in addition to immunoglobulins contains various immune cells immunoactive substances such as cytokines and nutritional elements consequently the risk of a calf contracting an enteric pathogen is a complex equation in which serum immunoglobulin concentrations are an important factor albeit a single onelow immunoglobulinconcentration colostrum with the resultant ingestion of an inadequate mass of immunoglobulin is the primary cause of failure of passive transfer in dairy calves in a study of 900 first-milking colostrums from holstein cows only 29 contained sufficient igg1 concentration to provide an appropriate mass of igg in a 2-l volume 73 it is currently recommended that dairy calves be fed 4 liters of dairy colostrum in the first 12 hours of life to obviate the risk of failure of passive transfer caused by a lack of adequate immunoglobulin mass to ensure intake soon enough esophageal feeders are often used to administer these volumesin contrast with dairy calves failure of passive transfer in beef calves is less likely to be due to low colostral igg1 concentration but rather to a failure to physically ingest and subsequently absorb the colostral immunoglobulins beef calves should be provided with adequate shelter during and after calving to avoid environmental stresses that lessen the calves drive to rise and nurse ideally calving should be monitored to ensure adequate mothering which is especially important with first-calf heifers calves that do not rise and successfully nurse their dam within 1 to 2 hours should be assisted with nursing or alternatively force-fed either their dams colostrum or frozen dairy cow colostrum if dairy cow colostrum is used its low average immunoglobulin concentration must be mitigated by feeding 4 liters within the first 12 hours of life the producer must be aware that such colostrum may also be contaminated with enteric and other infectious agents eg mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis
stress is defined as any adverse stimulus event or condition either internal or external that disturbs an animals physical or neurogenic homeostasis although there are likely numerous biological consequences of stress a well-documented response involves the rapid and immediate increase in corticotropin secretion by the anterior pituitary gland followed by greatly increased secretion of cortisol by the adrenal gland some of the beneficial effects of increased cortisol secretion include mobilization of labile proteins and fats from cellular stores for cellular energy needs as well as numerous anti-inflammatory effects that aid in the resolution of inflammation one of the more notable consequences of increased cortisol secretion however involves its extensive effects leading to immune suppression in general cortisol-induced atrophy of lymphoid tissues throughout the body leads to a significant decrease in both cellular and humoral immunity it is this broad-ranging immune suppression that can lead to an increased incidence and severity of diseasecommon stresses incurred by neonatal calves include dystocia crowding exposure to environmental extremes such as heat cold or wet conditions excessive or inappropriate handling and exposure to pathogens 48 even the process of a normal parturition is a stressful condition as the fetal animal undergoes transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life fetal plasma cortisol levels double within minutes after uncomplicated parturition but typically decrease within the first days of life the natural increase in plasma cortisol is necessary for normal pulmonary intestinal and brain development pulmonary surfactant production and preparation of liver glycogen stores for energy needs calves with dystocia are likely to have temporarily increased plasma cortisol levels and other significant laboratory abnormalities including metabolic and respiratory acidosis and hypoglycemia 13 current studies indicate that the increased incidence of failure of passive transfer in calves with dystocia is not caused by a failure to absorb colostral immunoglobulins but rather is due to the severe metabolic derangements that make these calves less likely to nurse in a timely fashion 106 alleviation of the stress of dystocia therefore should be directed toward correcting metabolic derangements and ensuring appropriate colostral intakeexposure to environmental extremes is likely to affect calves adversely by inhibiting normal nursing behavior and producing prolonged elevations in serum cortisol levels both of these factors clearly have an adverse effect on the calves immune status so newborn calves should be placed in sheltered environments that are free from wind and moisture and extremes of heat or cold providing calves with dry bedding is a critical factor in preventing problems associated with cold temperatures 69 however these shelters must be managed appropriately to minimize the concentration of enteric pathogens within themcrowding and mishandling of calves should be minimized to lessen the effect of neurogenic stress although limited research in this area has been undertaken in calves it is logical to assume that calves would react similarly to other mammals in such stressful situations with resultant increased plasma cortisol levels and subsequent immune suppression finally it is logical to presume that minimizing crowding will likely not only decrease the neurogenic stress of calves but also will unquestionably decrease exposure to enteric pathogenswith either confined or pasture calving it is important to keep adequate records records are useful for determining the timing of animal movement and for identifying the epidemiologic factors associated with sick animals as well as recording what diagnostic tests were performed when and what treatments were administered and their results particularly on larger operations complete records maintained in a computerized database are crucial for initially determining what risk factors are associated with a neonatal diarrhea problem and then for monitoring the success of interventionsbiosecurity as it relates to neonatal gastrointestinal disease should be approached as a fluid concept adequate records markedly enhance a producers and a veterinarians ability to regularly evaluate and revise neonatal disease control and prevention protocols in response to changing conditions actual risks and new knowledge and tools for dealing with neonatal enteric diseaseinfectious diarrhea is an important cause of neonatal calf morbidity and mortality that results in significant economic losses in the beef and dairy industries although numerous risk factors related to the occurrence of neonatal diarrhea have been identified they can all be categorized into those that are related to the calf the pathogens involved or the environment of the calf the immune status of calves specifically the level of passively acquired immunity through colostrum is the major risk factor related to the calf and the occurrence of diarrhea although numerous pathogens have been implicated in the occurrence of neonatal diarrhea only a relatively limited number are commonly involved most should be viewed as secondary opportunists rather than primary pathogens because none are extraordinarily virulent and with the exception of salmonella spp most are present within the gastrointestinal tract of many healthy mature cattle important risk factors related to pathogens involved in neonatal calf diarrhea involve the size of the inoculum and the occurrence of multiple infections finally when considering the environment and housing conditions in which beef and dairy calves may reside it is clear that tremendous variations exist despite these variations the risk factors associated with the environment of the calf are also those that are the most amenable to the implementation of general environmental control and monitoring strategies as well as specific biosecurity measurescoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is an infectious respiratory disease caused by the virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 belonging to the coronavirus family an infected person may experience symptoms after an incubation period that could vary from about 2 to 14 days there have rarely been cases of incubation periods of 29 days during which time the person could still be contagious to limit transmission precautions should be taken such as adopting careful personal hygiene washing hands frequently and wearing masks coronavirus mainly affects the lower respiratory tract and causes a number of symptoms described as flu-like including fever cough shortness of breath muscle pain tiredness and gastrointestinal complaints such as diarrhea in severe cases pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome sepsis and septic shock could occur up to the death of the patient among the collective preventive measures it should be noted that in 2003 during the sars epidemic the major collective catering companies in china and hong kong adopted the obligation to wear surgical masks for their service personnel to protect both the workers of companies and the public this professional category is particularly exposed to potentially infectious contacts both active and passive in the same way a person in charge of equipment who is not equipped with the appropriate personal protective equipment ppe will find themselves exposed to contact with the dirty dishes and recent food remains of a large number of customers further interventions in the restaurant sector may include a prohibition on the distribution of buffets for both food and dishes 1234in recent weeks there has been about a great deal of discussion about the contamination and decontamination of inanimate surfaces in fact the duration before inactivation of the covid-19 virus on surfaces liquid solid or gaseous is still debated in most cases the spread between people occurs through the respiratory droplets emitted by an infected individual through coughing or sneezing which are subsequently inhaled by a healthy person who is nearby this also caused an initial diffidence on the part of people in purchasing products of any kind coming including by post from the areas affected by the epidemic leading to economic damage it is possible to become infected by touching surfaces or objects where the virus is present and then bringing your hands towards your mouth nose or eyes 5678910 in ideal conditions the virus can in fact persist on different surfaces for hours or days the surfaces most exposed to this type of transmission include for exampledoor handleslift or light buttonsmobile phonespublic transport handholds 11121314the viral titration viral assay or viral count is the count made in the laboratory of the number of viral particles of a given virus under examination present in a biological sample it is used in microbiological research diagnostics and in the production of antiviral vaccinesall situations that require knowledge of the amount of virus being analyzed or used we used tissue-culture infectious dose tcid per milliliter for covid-19 persistence evaluation 1516171819the aim of this article is to evaluate through the analysis of the current literature how long this virus can remain active on different surfaces it is too early to be able to carry out a review with meta-analysis of the literature given the incredible relevance of this topic but it is certainly a step to clarify this pandemicthe following questions were used to develop the study framework according to the pico populationinterventioncomparisonoutcomes guidelineswhat is the persistence of sars-cov-2 on surfaceswhat is the mean persistence of coronaviruses compared to sars-cov-2an investigation methods protocol was used according to the prisma statement the aim of the prisma statement is to help authors improve the reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses it can be used as a basis for reporting reviews of other types of research the use of checklists like prisma is likely to improve the reporting quality of a systematic review and provides substantial transparency in the selection process of papers in a systematic review furthermore pico guidelines have been used to prepare summary questions 202122the full texts of all studies related to the main revision topics were obtained for comparing the inclusion parameterssars-cov-2 features

studies were obtained after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria only the remaining 5 articles were further analyzed then articles were manually selected and finally 4 articles were obtained figure 1 results of individual studies were shown after an accurate analysis in table 1 the aim of this table is to summarize coronaviruses persistence timevan doremalen et al 26 evaluated the stability of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-1 in aerosols and different surfaces they evaluated these viruses decay rates using bayesian linear regression they conducted their experiment using aerosols  5 m containing sars-cov-2 10525 50 tissue-culture infectious dose tcid50 per milliliter or sars-cov-1 10675-700 tcid50 per milliliter generated by a nebulizer ten different experimental conditions involving sars-cov-1 or 2 were evaluated results on infectious titer reduction are shown in table 1 the data were expressed as 50 tissue-culture infectious dose tcid50 it is important to specify that the limit of detection for this experiment was 333  1005 tcid50 per liter of air for aerosols 1005 tcid50 per milliliter of medium for plastic steel and cardboard and 1015 tcid50 per milliliter of medium for copper kampf et al 27 showed how different coronaviruses could persist on different types of inanimate surfaces they also evaluated some environmental characteristics such as temperature or humidity they showed how human coronavirus could be influenced by temperature as 30 or 40 c reduced the duration of persistence of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces however at the temperature of 4 c the persistence could be greater than or equal to 28 days another important result is that the persistence was longer with higher inocula warnes et al 28 evaluated coronaviruses persistence on metal and non-metal samples they inoculated 103 plaque forming units pfu on different materials polyfluorotetraethylene teflon ptfe polyvinyl chloride pvc ceramic tiles glass and stainless steel coronaviruses persistence was at least 5 days and 3 days for silicon rubber at 21 c despite this it could be rapidly inactivated by brass and copper nickel surfaces in less than 60 min copper nickel surfaces were effective but less than brass copper in these cases the inactivation time was up to 5 min in the fingertip contamination model warnes et al demonstrated how a higher percentage of copper could lead to superior antiviral properties another important factor reported in this study was that the release of ions from copper and the formation of reactive oxygen species ros take part in the deactivation of the virus furthermore the authors report that following an analysis carried out with a transmission electron microscope tem the virus was normally present on common surfaces such as stainless steel but on copper surfaces it appeared to be damaged and intact particles were fewit was not possible to conduct a bias risk analysis according to the prisma statement as specified in the previous section unfortunately the limited number of articles obtained does not allow for the realization of a systematic review the individual studies were analyzed and the experiments leading to the results shown in table 1 were rigorously conducted and are repeatable analyses 29the literature concerning the characteristics of these viruses is still scarce especially if one considers only covid-19 the aspects related to the persistence of the virus on surfaces not only represent an environmental and public health problem concerning schools roads offices it is a much bigger problem if hospitals operating theaters and sanitary waiting rooms are considered especially in the new and continuously increasing covid departments knowing how the virus behaves in contact with surfaces and with different disinfectants could be important for the sanitization of medical environments in particular some authors deal with the optimization of infection control in operating rooms some devices are used in hospital operating rooms for single use only but other devices surfaces handles and cords could be transmission vehicles 30 ong et al 2020 31 evaluated the presence of coronavirus in a hospital room of covid-19 patients some surfaces such as the toilet bowl and the sink were positive room air samples and samples collected after cleaning were negative the time span varied according to the characteristics of the type of surface the less-porous ones like plastic and steel were the worst because they absorb droplets less easily preserving the active virus additionally the different environmental conditions could affect the amount of ventilation of the rooms and the humidity 26 according to van doremalen et al 26 aerosol and surface virus transmission is plausible since it can remain viable and infectious for hours or days kampf et al 27 showed how human coronaviruses can remain infectious on surfaces for up to 9 days at room temperature this is an important factor about coronaviruses spread from this it is easy to see that if someone tends to touch the environment oftenespecially if not properly disinfectedthe possibility of becoming infected increases furthermore the droplets present in the form of an aerosol of an infected patient can not only easily spread but also easily settle and last for several hours on a surface kampf et al 27 investigated different biocidal agents on coronaviruses they demonstrated how ethanol 7895 2-propanol 70100 the combination of 45 2-propanol with 30 1-propanol glutardialdehyde 0525 formaldehyde 071 and povidone iodine 02375 readily inactivated coronavirus infectivity by approximately 4 log10 or more sodium hypochlorite required a minimal concentration of at least 021 to be effective hydrogen peroxide was effective with a concentration of 05 and an incubation time of 1 min an important finding is the ineffectiveness of chlorhexidine within 10 min a concentration of 02 revealed no efficacy against coronavirus it is a result that does not support some guidelines for dentistry 32 kampf et al 27 concluded that these viruses can remain on surfaces up to 9 days and that surface disinfection could be performed with 01 sodium hypochlorite or 6271 ethanol for 1 minute according to warnes et al 26 coronavirus persists in an infectious state on surfaces for several days warnes et al 26 demonstrated the survival of coronaviruses on different surfaces for up to 5 days concerning the persistence of the virus on different surfaces and in particular on metals containing copper these findings are interesting and could lead to the development of new surfaces with viricidal or bactericidal properties in confined environments especially if poorly ventilated viral particles of less than 01 m in size may remain in the environment as a secondary aerosol studies on the topic indicate that a sneeze could release up to 2 million droplets into the air less than a million from a cough and about 3000 from speaking out loud the droplets eliminated from the airways if larger than 100 m from a height of 2 m settle on flat surfaces in 36 s and reach horizontally about 15 m away then evaporate rapidly dry and become solid material this material reaches a size of 23 m studies on tuberculosis have shown that this material maintaining its infectious capacity could be inhaled and thanks to its size reach the most peripheral parts of the lungs becoming a secondary biological aerosol 26 there has not been much discussion about the importance of ventilating environments to prevent sars-cov-2 infection and although the viral particles have not been studied sufficiently for their ability to achieve dangerous concentrations from a distance in confined environments increased ventilation in an environment is believed to reduce the cross-infection of airborne diseases therefore existing recommendations could be amended to include ventilating public spaces including means of transport with suitable means it is essential to focus on preventing infection by using ventilation suitable to reduce the infectious capacity of the coronavirus it has been widely demonstrated that natural ventilation causes better air exchange compared to mechanical ventilationup to 69 changes per hour of rooms when the windows are completely open 33 most international guidelines recommend about 12 changes per hour for isolation rooms in case of infections medical and dental staff will have to work safely and this is complicated by the fact that there are still no official guidelines that tell them how to behavemoreover as suggested by spagnuolo et al dentists should avoid the scheduling of any patient only such urgent dental diseases can be considered during the covid-19 outbreak the waiting time of patients in dental offices could highly predispose patients to be infected when dentists treat patients they should intercept potentially infected persons before they reach the operating areas for example identifying those with a fever measuring 375 c and posing a few questions about the patients general health status in the last 7 days and about the risk of having been in contact with other infected persons dentists as well as medical office employees should always be covered by facial masks and they should remind patients to maintain the 1-m distance with each other during their waiting time 3435disinfecting surfaces is one of the aspects to which to give greater attention being done with the detergents already in use today along with the washing of hands and the use of suitable ppe in regards to ppe surgical masks must be used by those who could transmit the virus but those who work in contact with the patients aerosol must use ffp2 and ffp3 filtering facepiece particles masks there should only be one patient in waiting rooms this is also true in clinical areas in the case of minors who need an escort the escort must be at a distance from operators and must wear a surgical mask at the end of each session the surfaces will then have to be cleaned and the air exchanged the same procedures should be adopted in the waiting room and in other areas where the patient might pass or touch objects certainly some tools such as quick tests once validated can become useful in the hands of the doctordentist to understand if the patient or some member of their team is potentially infectedwe are aware of the limitations of this article it is not possible to make a review of the literature due to the lack of data so this is only a summary of the available information further studies are needed in order to verify the persistence times of coronavirus on surfaces more precisely however we have considered proceeding with the creation of this summary while respecting the guidelines of systematic reviews and also not having sufficient numbers the reason for this choice lies in the incredible topicality and reliability of the data obtained with the hope that this work could be widely and immediately used to contain the pandemicthe purpose of this summary is to draw a line and clarify the characteristics of sars-cov-2 with regard to its persistence on surfaces this article is of great interest and could be used to write new guidelines by epidemiologists having a clear summary of the current situation from our analysis it is possible to deduce some aspects the virus can reach surfaces in the form of an aerosol therefore following nebulization through people sneezing or coughing or electromedical machinery infection via surfaces should be considered since the latter could remain viable and infectious for hours or days on average the different coronaviruses persist in an infectious state on surfaces for several days even up to nine surface disinfection could be performed with 01 sodium hypochlorite or 6271 ethanol for 1 minute copper has shown antiviral propertiesso much so that the virus appears damaged or altered on copper surfacesother experiments are certainly needed on different surfaces or even on biological surfaces to better understand the persistence times of this virus and promote adequate standardsprevious chapters examined public health-related transportation issues that have received a great deal of attention in the literature and that have been subject to research on the underlying causal phenomena this chapter examines some topics that have not received as much attention at least not concerning the potential roles for transportation in mitigating or avoiding public health impactsthe reason the chapter is entitled transportation and  is that transportation is viewed in this book as enabling many other outcomes many of which have clear public health impacts and consequences to some extent this chapter represents all other possible linkages between transportation and public health in this chapter we examine two major categories of public health concerns relating to transportationthose that relate to what is carried by transportation systems people goods and pathogens and those that relate to direct and indirect consequences when transportation systems are disrupted in the first category we will examine three major topics transportations role in 1 transmitting infectious diseases eg enabling pandemics 2 the transfer of invasive species in the natural environment and 3 transporting hazardous materials the two topics examined in the second category are climate change and disaster response in each of these cases the transportation system is either a contributor to public health consequences a carrier of infected persons or animals andor a contributor to mitigating the negative public health outcomes eg evacuation or disaster recovery routes
table 81
was prepared by the king county government seattlewashington state to give a sense of what the range of a serous influenza epidemic might mean to the united states and to king county the estimates were based on historical records from past influenza epidemics
one must be cautious in basing future forecasts on these estimates because these historical events did not have available many of the medical treatments we have today eg antiviral therapy ventilators and intensive care units in addition the social economic and environmental conditions today are very different than those of the past modern medicines population monitoring for early onslaught of illness and a medical establishment prepared to handle emergencies might suggest that the epidemicpandemic outcomes of the past where tens of millions died would not likely occur today however at the same time the more extensive and interconnected global air system permitting more rapid and dispersed transmittal of communicable diseases and the ability of small groups of individuals terrorists to manufacture and deliver biological weapons are much greater today these considerations would suggest that such epidemicpandemic outcomes might be even more serious than those of the pastdue to their very nature transportation systems allow the physical movement of and enable contact among many different people in the course of many types of trips there are many surfaces that have been touched by other people medical science has known for some time that sneezing coughing talking and even breathing can carry pathogens that expose others nearby pathogens are also easily transferred from one person to another by the touching of infected surfaces that are used by many different people over the course of a day eg ticket machines turnstiles door handles poles or straps in subway cars that provide support against vehicle acceleration and toilet facilities to the extent that pathogens or toxins are transmitted to others on a journey either through physical contact or airborne it is the transportation system that permits this to happen some research indicates for example that very small droplets from a sneeze can in fact travel around 200 feet kopman 2014 on airplanes a study conducted by the us national academies found that for people seated within a seat or two to the side of someone who is infected or within one row forward or backward the chances of catching a contagious virus were about 80 outside of that immediate radius however the risk was much loweronly about 3in medical terms the route or mode of transmission refers to the mechanism by which a communicable disease is spread for example modes of transmission include direct transmission which includes respiratory droplet and direct contact indirect transmission for example airborne or indirect contact via a fomite contaminated surface and via a vector which is the means of transferring a pathogen for example malariazika via mosquitoes and lyme disease via ticksthe more efficient the mode of transmission and this is what transportation officials constantly strive for in the transportation sector combined with the virulence of a pathogen the faster the potential transmission of disease
in a global economy connected by supply chains in the freight sector and tied together with global air travel to most major regions of the world the potential for rapid and widespread transmission of infectious diseases and other harmful elements can be very high indeed a major concern of national health and security officials is that such transmission could occur before authorities even know that it is happening the incubation time for many communicable diseases is 14 days much longer than it takes for someone to travel around the worldevidence of rapid in relative terms when looking historically transmission of disease comes from the historical records of pandemics and the spread of infectious disease that have occurred throughout the world the eradication of entire native american civilizations from smallpox brought to the western hemisphere by christopher columbus and subsequent european expeditions well illustrate the potential world-spanning threat from the transmittal of infectious diseases via transportationthe bubonic plague black death which swept across africa asia and europe in the 14th century spread along the major shipping and communications lanes of the time primarily sea lanes the conventional rationale for the black death was that rats carrying infected fleas traveled in ships bringing with them the plague starting in harbor cities or in major centers of commerce and then spreading as the rats moved inland such an explanation is now questioned given the examination of plague-caused death patterns and the rapidity with which it spread which does not conform with how fast rats could propagate throughout europe sea transportation is still viewed as a major vehicle in the plagues initial spread but a leading hypothesis is that it was the human land-based contact that spread the disease so quickly after being introduced in port cities tatem et al 2006 historians estimate that worldwide about 50 million people died in the initial plague in europe plague-caused deaths represented between 25 and 60 of the population an estimated 200 million people died over the three major plague outbreaks from the 14th to 17th centuries
rodriquez et al 2017 report that there have been 10 major influenza pandemics over the past 300 years with the 1918 spanish flu causing an estimated 30 of the worlds population to get sick and resulting in the estimated deaths of between 50 and 100 million people an estimated 40 million in one  year alone it resulted in an almost 10-year drop in the calculated average life expectancy of the global population palese 2004 in the united states over one-third of the population was affected and 500000 people died the virus spread around the world due to many reasons such as the widespread dislocation of large populations due to world war i however many explanations focus on the predominant use of crowded intercity and international modes of travel that is rail and ocean liners it is not surprising to note that some of the most severe outbreaks of influenza centered on shipyards and train stations in sweden major outbreaks or cases were reported in large workplaces such as factories telegraph and telephone stations and the tram and railway stations holmberg 2017as ever more modern transportation technology produced faster speeds transportation became an even greater enabler of a pandemic wilson 1995 saunders-hastings and krewski 2016 who examined pandemics since the late 1500s noted that the state of transportation technology was a likely contributor to the time it took for a disease to spreadin the winter of 1889 an influenza pandemic emerged in russia spreading by rail and sea across europe and north america with an estimated case fatality rate in the range of 01028 the outbreak killed about one million people globally this pandemic spread at a faster rate than previous ones and may provide the first indication of the accelerated spread of emergent diseases as a result of progress in transportation technology
with respect to cholera tatem et al 2006 note the importance of transportation in cholera outbreaks in many cases caused by the movement of military transportcholera first started as an epidemic outbreak in 1817 in india but soon started spreading in part due to british ship and troop movements carrying the infection north and east to china japan and indonesia the disease also spread along trade routes to the west as far as southern russia each successive pandemic increased in extent and severity reflecting the expanding reach of the global transport system and increased movements of people particularly on religious pilgrimages the 1830s saw russian troops english ships irish immigrants and canadian exploration carry the cholera bacterium to the baltic england ireland canada usa and mexico
more recently the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in the early 2000s and the swine flu epidemics in 2009 quickly spread because of air travel and in some cases passenger ocean liners browne and beck 2016 noted that air transportation is one of the major means of accelerating and amplifying influenza propagation occurring aboard the planes as well as at airportstransportation systems can play a role in spreading communicable disease within urban areas as well although most likely not as prominent a mode of transmission as other factors such as community spaces schools and areas of employment that allow for direct person-to-person transmission a simulation of a potential influenza outbreak in new york city based on calibration data from the 195758 influenza pandemics and from nyc travel surveys estimated that only 4 of the spread of influenza would occur on the subway cooley et al 2011 however simulations in sweden found that banning journeys of more than 50 kms 31 miles would drastically reduce the speed and geographical spread of influenza outbreaks even when compliance with the ban was not total the 50 kms is a typical range for commuter rail services in most major metropolitan areas camitz and liljjeros 2006for surface transportation modes such as public transit and intercity rail dealing with an outbreak of a communicable disease or a pandemic could create significant challenges to the transportation agency not only is there the potential for the transmission of dangerous microbes in crowded conditions but the agency employees themselves might succumb to illness or otherwise be unable to report for work creating a serious constraint on providing service the same could be true for any major disruption due to earthquake or other regional disastersthe us national academies of sciences engineering and medicine 2014 produced a guide for public transportation pandemic planning and response that identified the differences between local disasters that result in service and system disruptions and more global and national pandemicsthe report identified such differences asworkers could possibly be absent for a short time in local disruptions whereas they might be absent for extended periods in pandemicsdisruptions due to extreme weather or terrorist attacks will likely result in infrastructure damage whereas pandemics do notdealing with the injured from a local disaster could likely be handled by the community medical services whereas pandemics might need massive medical intervention from outside the community
with respect to transit as a means of transmitting communicable diseases one of the few systematic examinations of the how this could occur was a study supported by the european union in 2014 called prevention and management of high threat pathogen incidents in transport hubs pandhub kulmala 2016 enstone and van-tam 2018b enstone and van-tam 2018a the research identified what it called potential transport hot spots for pandemics defined as points or sites within a traffic hub environment where the risk of microbial transmission is at least periodically increased due to favorable conditions or human behavior the possible mechanisms for transmission were 1 direct and indirect contact and 2 airborne or droplet transmission these hot spots would likely vary by type of pathogen or microbe and the environmental conditions within which they thrivea study by ikonen et al 2018 which sampled different locations in an airport showed the potential hot spots for different types of viruses

the center of gravity of the pandemic response will be in communities the distributed nature of a pandemic as well as the sheer burden of disease across the nation over a period of months or longer means that the federal governments support will be limitedthe federal government will bear primary responsibility for certain critical functions including 1 support of containment efforts overseas and limiting arrivals at ports of entry 2 guidance on protective measures 3 modifications to the law and regulations to facilitate the national pandemic response 4 modifications to monetary policy to mitigate the economic impact of a pandemic on communities and the nation 5 procurement and distribution of vaccine and antiviral medications and 6 acceleration of research and development of vaccines and therapies during the outbreakthe secretary of homeland security is responsible for coordinating federal operations and resources establishing reporting requirements and conducting ongoing communications with federal state local and tribal governments the private sector and nongovernmental organizations ngosthe secretary of health and human services will lead federal health and medical response efforts and will be the principal federal spokesperson for public health issuesmeasures at the borders might provide an opportunity to slow the spread of a pandemic to and within the united states but are unlikely to prevent it moreover the sheer volume of traffic and the difficulty of developing screening protocols to detect an influenza-like illness pose significant challengesmeasures to limit domestic travel may delay the spread of disease these restrictions could include a range of options such as reductions in non-essential travel and as a last resort mandatory restrictions  communities states the private sector and the federal government will need to carefully weigh the costs and benefits of transportation measures when developing their response plans including the effectiveness of an action in slowing the spread of a pandemic its social and economic consequences and its operational feasibilityin order to ensure that international arrivals undergo proper screening protocols and are subject to isolation and quarantine if appropriate the number of airports accepting international flights will be limited early in a pandemicmanaging air passengers who might be infected with an influenza virus having pandemic potential includes isolation of ill persons quarantine of all non-ill travelers and crew and targeted treatment and prophylaxis with antiviral medicationsthe risk of influenza transmission by cargo is low inanimate ship-borne cargo poses low risk and routine surfaces are easily decontaminatedstate local tribal and private sector entities should assess the systemic effects on freight delivery such as supply chain impact just-in-time delivery warehousing and logistics they should develop contingency plans in the event of loss of critical services such as the delivery of essential commodities eg chlorine for water purification gasoline food and medical suppliesthe federal government recommends that governmental entities and private sector organizations assume that up to 40 of their staff may be absent for periods of about 2 weeks at the height of a pandemic wave with lower levels of staff absent for a few weeks on either side of the peakdue to stresses placed upon the health-care system and other critical functions civil disturbances and breakdowns in public order may occur likewise emergency call centers may be overwhelmed with calls for assistance including requests to transport influenza victims local law enforcement agencies may be called upon to enforce movement restrictions or quarantines thereby diverting resources from traditional law enforcement duties to add to these challenges law enforcement and emergency response agencies can also expect to have their uniform and support ranks reduced significantly as a result of the pandemic private sector entities responsible for securing critical infrastructure will face similar challenges
for those interested in pandemic strategies for transportation agencies the national influenza pandemic plan included separate plans for maritime dhs 2008a rail dhs 2008b transit dhs 2008c aviation dhs 2008d and highway dhs 2008e transportation
table 83
shows some of the strategies that a transit agency could use to prevent the spread of disease
much has changed since the worldwide pandemics and plagues of past centuries historical accounts of the spread of these infectious diseases show the importance of factors such as households and families schools military training camps city density and transportation flows the relative importance of these factors has changed profoundly over time as have public health interventions medical care technologies and nutrition holmberg 2017 however given continued innovations in transportation and logistics technologies it seems likely that global transportation systems will continue to become more efficient and reliable thus transportation systems will continue to be an important potential vector for the transmission of communicable diseases note this statement does not even consider the use of biological agents in a terrorist attack against transportation systems of which smallpox and anthrax are considered to be the greatest threatit seems clear in the literature and in governmental contingency plans that the burden in handling epidemicspandemics will rest with local public healthmedical providers the transportation component at this level of response could well be making sure the personnel and supplies necessary to be transported into containment zones are available and not hindered due to illness among drivers or pilotsas noted by haggett 2000 the transportation contribution to the control of epidemics and pandemics will likely be characterized by the following1pandemic control will rely less and less on conventional spatial barriers as the global transport network continues to expand
2the speed of modern transportation means prompt surveillance and rapid reporting now play a critical role in preventing the spatial spread of a disease3mathematical models will become central in identifying aberrant behavior in disease trends and4the high cost of surveillance makes sampling design and the development of cost-effective monitoring and testing approaches vital to effective epidemic early warning systems
it seems however that controlling the dispersion of communicable diseases could still require the isolation of those contaminated which in turn will likely mean curtailing in some fashion the transportation systems that serve as a vector in disease transmission this is especially true for the aviation system note the federal pandemic strategy of allowing international flights to land at only a few well-prepared airports if such a strategy is necessary it will not only cause a massive dislocation of segments of the population who now find themselves stranded in different parts of the country but could well result in large-scale economic costs to global national state and local economies meyer and brown 2019over the long term climate change could very well be one of the most influential enablers of newly introduced diseases and vectors that are transported to new environments cdc and apha undated according to the fourth us national climate change assessment climate change is expected to alter the geographic range seasonal distribution and abundance of disease vectors exposing more people in north america to ticks that carry lyme disease or other bacterial and viral agents and to mosquitoes that transmit west nile chikungunya dengue and zika viruses changing weather patterns interact with other factors including how pathogens adapt and change changing ecosystems and land use demographics human behavior and the status of public health infrastructure and management us global change research program 2018a us global change research program 2018b more will be said about this latersome examples of invasive species that were brought to the united states via some form of transportation include1zebra mussel brought in ballast water or attached to the outsides of ships because they grow so fast large populations of zebra mussels filtering water can severely impact native plankton which reduces food for fish earthrangers 20142earthworms the first earthworms in minnesota probably arrived with soils and plants brought from europe when ships using rocks and soil as ballast dumped the soil on shore as they adjusted the ballast weight of the ship they also were most likely included with imported european plants the earthworms are causing major damage to hardwood forests in minnesota minnesota department of natural resources 20193asian long-horned beetle often encased in wooden packaging materials and trees the larvae of asian longhorn beetles eat soft sappy bark which makes it hard for nutrients to reach other parts of a tree as they grow the larvae burrow into the middle of the tree leaving large tunnels as they move making the tree physically weaker many trees do not survive once they are infested with asian longhorn beetles earthrangers 20144asian tiger mosquito the asian tiger mosquito entered the united states in shipments of used tires from northern asia in the mid-1980s it is a potential vector of encephalitis dengue all four serotypes yellow fever and dog heartworm west nile virus has been detected in this species in the eastern united states center for invasive species research 20165northern pacific seastars also brought in ballast water northern pacific seastars have a voracious appetite eating almost anything they can find they are believed to be the major reason for the decline of several species of fish earthrangers 2014
one of the major forms of the species invasion into the united states is via ocean-going ships for example the national wildlife federation nwf estimates that more than 185 aquatic invasive species have entered the great lakes and that ocean-going shipping is the no 1 source of nonnative aquatic species a new non-native species is discovered on average once every 28 weeks national wildlife federation undated b since the st lawrence seaway connecting the great lakes to the atlantic ocean was opened in 1959 85 invasive species have been discovered with 54 linked to ballast water discharge water carried by ships to help them stay balanced while at sea the us maritime administration marad notesinvasive species are considered to be one of the greatest threats to marine and coastal biodiversity world-wide aquatic invasions can destroy native ecosystems overwhelm native species reduce recreational opportunities and adversely impact sport and commercial fisheries although there are many pathways through which these invasions can occur transportation in ships ballast water and in underwater hull biofouling are known contributorsmarad 2018
since 1993 ocean-going ships have been required to replace their ballast water with ocean water before entering the great lakes known as ballast water exchange however some species are still able to survive in this new salty ballast waterthe international maritime organization imo 2011 has issued guidelines for the control and management of ships biofouling the existence of invasive species to minimize the transfer of invasive aquatic species the international convention for the control and management of ships ballast water and sediments 2004 and the convention on biological diversity 1992 served as the basis for the guidelines the convention requires participating nations to have a ballast water management plan to help avoid disrupting native ecosystems with invasive aquatic species wiant 2017 two methods can be used to implement such a plan 1 using a ballast water exchange standard which requires ships to exchange a minimum of 95 ballast water volume at least 50 nautical miles from the nearest shore and in waters of 200 m depth or more helping prevent invasive species spreading in coastal and shallow waters that are one of the most vulnerable to invasive species and 2 using a ballast water performance standard which establishes thresholds for the presence of aquatic organisms in the ballast water the water quality limits may be achieved through physical andor chemical treatment methodsthe ballast water strategy is illustrative of one of the strategies adopted by government agencies to minimize the risk of maritime invasive species that is to stop their arriving in the first place the us forest service prohibits the importation of species via environmental and public health regulations it considers to be potentially injurious once an invasive species is established in the united states the next strategy is to control and eradicate it with a variety of actions these include physical removal introducing natural predators which as noted earlier can become themselves a problem affecting the reproduction environment or ultimately adopting public health strategies for dealing with the diseases or illnesses borne by the species eg protecting vulnerable populations against mosquito-borne disease outbreaksthe transport of animals insects moldsfungi or plants that constitute an attack on a native ecology is a serious issue and one that has become even more important as global connectivity has increased the physical transportation of uninvited species along trade routes has resulted in dramatic and significant impacts on native species from a public health perspective the invasive species concern is perhaps not as significant as that represented by infectious diseases being carried by passengers but with changing climatic conditions newly introduced diseases following transportation vectors could well represent an increasingly important public health issue although steps have been taken by government agencies to try and control the risks associated with invasive species it seems that the trend toward more and perhaps more deadly species being introduced into native ecologies will continuedepending on the materials being used or transported government agencies define hazardous materials in different ways although they often cross-reference one another for example the occupational safety and health administration osha which is focused primarily on the release of hazardous materials at worksites and at hazardous waste sites defines a hazardous material asany biological agent and other disease-causing agent which after release into the environment and upon exposure ingestion inhalation or assimilation into any person either directly from the environment or indirectly by ingestion through food chains will or may reasonably be anticipated to cause death disease behavioral abnormalities cancer genetic mutation physiological malfunctions including malfunctions in reproduction or physical deformations in such persons or their offspring
health hazard means a chemical or a pathogen where acute or chronic health effects may occur in exposed employees it also includes stress due to temperature extremes the term health hazard includes chemicals that are classified in accordance with the hazard communication standard as posing one of the following hazardous effects acute toxicity any route of exposure skin corrosion or irritation serious eye damage or eye irritation respiratory or skin sensitization germ cell mutagenicity carcinogenicity reproductive toxicity specific target organ toxicity single or repeated exposure aspiration toxicity or simple asphyxiantdepartment of labor undated
the usdot defines a hazardous material asany item or chemical which when being transported or moved in commerce is a risk to public safety or the environment and is regulated as such under its pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration regulations 49 cfr 100199 which includes the hazardous materials regulations 49 cfr 171180 in addition hazardous materials in transport are regulated by the international maritime dangerous goods code dangerous goods regulations of the international air transport association technical instructions of the international civil aviation organization and us air force joint manual preparing hazardous materials for military air shipmentsinstitute of hazardous materials and management 2018
the us environmental protection agency epa expands the public health concern to beyond simply human healthimpacts of hazardous materials on the environment can be just as devastating killing organisms in a lake or river destroying animals and plants in a contaminated area causing major reproductive complications in animals or otherwise limit the ability of an ecosystem to survive certain hazardous substances also have the potential to explode or cause a fire threatening both animals and human populationsusepa 2017
other us agencies that have definitions of hazardous materials include the us department of energy doe us department of homeland security dhs and the nuclear regulatory commission nrc for purposes of this chapter we will use a general definition offered by the institute of hazardous materials and management ihmm 2018a hazardous material is any item or agent biological chemical radiological andor physical which has the potential to cause harm to humans animals or the environment either by itself or through interaction with other factors
also for purposes of this chapter we will focus on the guidance contexts and recommended actions as offered by the usdot and other transportation agencies for labeling purposes and for identification on vehicles and in the paperwork that accompanies shipments the usdot uses the following classes of hazardous materialsclass 1 explosivesclass 2 gasesclass 3 flammable liquidclass 4 flammable solid spontaneously combustible and dangerous when wetclass 5 oxidizer organic peroxideclass 6 poison toxic position inhalation hazard infectious substanceclass 7 radioactiveclass 8 corrosiveclass 9 miscellaneous hazardous material chisolm 2018
the us government has passed many laws and promulgated many more regulations pertaining to the handling of hazardous materials and how the response to hazardous materials spills should occur the hazardous materials transportation act of 1975 hmta and its subsequent amendments is the most important foundational law for transporting hazardous materials it empowers the secretary of transportation to designate as hazardous material any particular quantity or form of a material that may pose an unreasonable risk to health and safety or property subsequent regulations from the respective modal administrations focused on procedures andor policies designation of hazardous materials requirements for packaging and handling such materials and operational rules when transporting them over the transportation network in implementing the act the usdot named over 3000 materials that fit the definition of a hazardous material and thus subject to regulation thousands of other materials were included in the regulations because they were explosive flammable corrosive infectious or hazardous in other ways
even with the hmta of 1975 the institutional structure for dealing with hazardous materials was complex complicated and confusing accordingly the hazardous materials transportation uniform safety act hmtusa was passed in 1990 to rectify conflicting federal state and local regulations the hmtusa reinforced the secretary of transportations authority to promulgate regulations for the safe transport of hazardous material in intrastate interstate and us-oriented foreign commerce the law also required uniformity among different state and local highway hazardous materials routing regulations and in the authorization and criteria for the issuance of federal permits to motor carriers of hazardous materials and the transport of radioactive materialswithin the usdot the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa is the lead agency dealing with hazardous materials transportation according the phmsa website its mission isto protect people and the environment by advancing the safe transportation of energy and other hazardous materials that are essential to our daily lives to do this the agency establishes national policy sets and enforces standards educates and conducts research to prevent incidents we also prepare the public and first responders to reduce consequences if an incident does occurphmsa 2018
importantly phmsa is the repository of data on hazardous materials incidents for all modes of transportationmost state governments have their own legislation and regulations focused on similar topics as in other policy areas federal law preempts state and local governmental requirements that are inconsistent with the lawit is important to place the national statistics on hazardous materials incidentsspills in context much of the data reported to phmsa and other federal agencies relate to spills or other incidents at particular sites eg at an oil distribution center and that do not require evacuation of nearby communities phmsa 2017 the public health concern is primarily for those affected by a spillage and for those responding to the incident the following data should thus not be viewed as indicating a rash of hazardous materials spills throughout the united states but rather as an indication of any type of spill that meets the criteria for reporting to the federal governmentto place the hazardous spills data in context the latest bureau of transportation statistics bts annual report on the us transportation system notes the following note some dates are for 2016 2017 or 2018 depending on the original source of datathe us freight system carried 177 billion tons of goods in 2018 valued at over 181 trillion by 2045 this is expected to reach 255 billion tons
about one-half of the weight and one-third of the value of this freight is moved less than 100 miles much of this in metropolitan areasthe number of ton-miles one ton moved one mile in some sense an exposure measure for the possibility of spills of freight moved in 2016 was just under 5 trillion ton-miles the following statistics were for the major transporters of heavy freight bts 2017trucks 202 trillion ton-milesrailroads 159 trillion ton-milespipelines 8963 billion ton-mileswater barges 4779 billion ton-miles
cruderefined oil and hazardous liquid pipelines carried 31 billion barrels in 2017 natural gas production in the same year was 273 trillion cubic yards of which 34 was carried in pipelinesthere has been a dramatic increase in the total crude oil moved by rail from 237 million barrels in 2010 to 1398 million in 2017
by any measure the amount of freightcommodityproduct moved annually in the united states is impressive although there is not an exact measure of how much of this freight is carrying hazardous materials a 2012 study by the usdot the latest that is reported showed the data indicated in table 84
as shown in table 84 by far the largest tonnage of hazardous materials carried by value tonnage and ton-miles was for flammable liquids using ton-miles as a measure of potential exposure of the general population to toxic materials the next two commodities were corrosive materials and gasesthe number of incidents occurring in 2018 over the entire process of handling hazardous materials which includes more than just transportation is shown in table 85
for non-pipeline transportation and table 86 for pipelines for pipelines the number of serious incidents declined from 37 in 2005 to 26 in 2017 a serious incident is one resulting in a fatality or requiring an overnight in-patient hospitalization the top 10 types of incidents included are shown in table 87
those killed or injured from these incidents includedemergency responder fire police emergency medical technicians emts  0 hospitalized 10 nonhospitalized and 0 deathstransportation employee 15 hospitalized 88 nonhospitalized and 3 deathsgeneral public 0 hospitalized three nonhospitalized and 0 deaths
as noted earlier the usdot identified over 3000 materials that could be considered hazardous when being transported clearly the public health consequences of these materials will be very different depending on the composition of the particular toxic materials the method of transmission the environmental conditions needed for this transmission and the level of exposure to sensitive populations to name a few it is beyond the scope of this book to provide coverage for every possible release of toxic materials table 87
provides a good overview produced by the centers for disease control cdc of the different systems in the body that could be affected by in this case chemical toxins also see cdc 2001a for an extensive listing of potential health effects associated with different toxic exposuresfor larger scale disasters and certainly for regional disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes community- or neighborhood-level evacuations can cause serious emotional and mental stress the public health community has recognized the immediate and longer term medical needs of those coping with the disruption loss and dislocation that accompany such events referred to as behavioral disaster health it consists of the provision of mental health substance abuse and stress management services to disaster survivors and respondersaccording to the dhhs typical symptoms after a disaster includeemotional symptoms such as irritability or excessive sadnesscognitive dysfunction such as difficulty making decisions or following directionsphysical symptoms such as headache stomach pain or difficulty breathingbehavioral reactions such as consuming more alcohol or interpersonal conflictfailure to adhere to needed physical or psychiatric medication needs department of health and human services dhhs 2012a department of health and human services dhhs 2012b
special attention might be needed for at-risk individuals found in an affected zone the 2013 pandemic and all-hazards preparedness reauthorization act defined at-risk individuals as children older adults pregnant women and individuals who may need additional response assistance the dhhs further defined these populations as including but not limited to individuals with disabilities individuals who live in institutional settings individuals from diverse cultures individuals who have limited english proficiency or are non-english speaking individuals who are transportation- disadvantaged individuals experiencing homelessness individuals who have chronic medical disorders and individuals who have pharmacological dependency department of homeland security 2016 department of health and human services dhhs 2016bfor those who respond to incidents or disasters their exposure to possible widespread destruction injury death of others or hazardous materials could result in distress and a need for mental health support as wellas with any kind of communitypublic healthtransportation system disruption one of the most effective strategies for minimizing the impacts of a disruption is to be prepared beforehand this could include establishing the protocols on who will respond having what responsibilities using training programs and field exercises to practice the response given different scenarios and continually incorporating new technologies and medical practices into the emergency response procedures a collaborative and coordinated approach to such incidents is particularly needed when hazardous materials are present such materials could affect not only the health of nearby residents but so too of those who respond a good understanding of what the hazardous material is along with the possible human health consequences requires close collaboration among the transportation emergency response and the public healthmedical communities
the transportation of hazardous materials is accompanied by several safeguards that help those who are responding to an incident these include distinctive vehiclecarvessel labeling cargo information input into a national database for certain types of movements and travel permits that identify what was being carried as noted by the cdcthe aim of emergency personnel should be to make a chemical-specific identification while exercising caution to prevent exposure to any chemicals identifying the hazardous material and obtaining information on its physical characteristics and toxicity are vital steps to the responders safety and effective management of the hazardous materials incident since each compound has its own unique set of physical and toxicological properties early and accurate identification of the hazardous materials involved allows emergency personnel to initiate appropriate management steps at the scenecdc 2001a
the cdcs agency for toxic substances and disease registry developed a three-volume guide for responding to hazardous materials incidents volume 1 was emergency medical services a planning guide for the management of contaminated patients volume 2 was hospital emergency departments a planning guide for the management of contaminated patients and volume 3 was medical management guidelines mmgs for acute chemical exposures cdc 2001b although dated these references still offer very useful suggestions on how to handle hazardous materials incidents other useful references include those from doe undated hazardous materials hazmat incidents  links and resources undated and the hazardous materials cooperative research program of the transportation research board trb 2019most federal agencies states cities and many local communities have developed emergency operations plans that lay out the steps in responding to a hazardous material incident although the exact steps to develop such a plan will vary by community the general steps can be described as follows the description is generally adopted from the federal emergency management agency fema 20131identify participantsparticipants should include members with diverse experience in the execution of the plan the groups collective expertise should include experience in planning knowledge of the community experience with the local response forces and knowledge of hazardous materials their effects and appropriate medical treatments2analyze risksthe process should identify the communitys potential hazardous materials risks primarily through the use of reports submitted by local industries required by federal law but supplemented by analysis of hazardous materials transport and other potential local hazards identified by community members3identify special populations and areas of concernareas that are particularly vulnerable to incidents and populations that would require special planning to protect or evacuate in an emergency such as nursing home residents should be identified and contingency plans developed4identify available resourcespolice agencies and fire officials should assess their capabilities to respond to different types of incidents this should include understanding what resources and help can be anticipated from surrounding communities and state and federal agencies in addition the assessment should also include response capabilities of local industry and transporters specifically those that have the potential to be involved in a hazardous materials incident protocols then need to be developed to designate specific responsibilities of all those who will be involved in an incident5develop the operations plana plan is prepared reviewed adopted and periodically updated by relevant agencies6test the plan and practice proceduresrelevant agencies and involved organizations such as hospitals and large private firms in the area should conduct exercises simulations of emergency situations to determine whether responders are prepared to handle their assigned roles and whether the planned procedures are effective ranging in complexity from tabletop discussions to the actual deployment of significant resources and personnel as if in response to an incident exercises are the best way to find out if the community is ready for a specific type of emergency
two major roles for public transportation agencies in the planning for incident response especially for large-scale disruptions having widespread impacts across multiple economic sectors and markets is to 1 get the transportation system operating again as soon as possible after an event as well as supporting other agencies in dealing with public safety and public health issues associated with the aftermaththe role of local medical and public health providers in a response to a hazardous materials spill will be different from one community to another and will vary by type of hazard surprisingly an example from washington dc suggests that at least for some types of hazards and in at least one region well-defined roles were not clear schulman 2015 the dhhs in collaboration with the national association of county and city health officials naccho sought to determine how local health departments lhds could best contribute to a large-scale chemical event response a focus group of 33 local state federal and nonprofit agency representatives in the national capital region met to discuss possible roles the result of the focus group was that the participants had very different perspectives on the role of lhds in a chemical response though lhds have responsibility for protecting human health in all hazards the role of lhds was perceived to be limited to disease prevention and control and not really in responding to a hazardous material incident as noted by schulman 2015 the perception of chemical incidents as hazardous material hazmat events and not public health events may result in lhds being left out of the loop even after the incident transitions to a mass casualty or mass fatality event she also identified the following roles for lhdspublic health surveillance activities are crucial to determining that an event has happened as well as the nature of the event routine passive surveillance results can be monitored for unusual symptoms associated with chemical exposureslhds preexisting community relationships position them to be a trusted source of risk communications while other responders handle the hazardous materials lhds have the ability to calm and inform the populacelhds provide subject matter expertise to healthcare partners on matters such as the toxicity of chemical agents and sampling and screening approaches if the agent is unknown lhds could use epidemiologic investigation methods to help identify itother potential roles based on lhd expertise include a coordinating the provision of mental and behavioral health services to affected communities and b providing guidance to ensure the safety and health of on-the-ground responderspublic health expertise on the impacts of chemical agents also provides extensive opportunities to support and collaborate with healthcare and environmental health partnerslhds may play a role assessing and monitoring the environmental impact of the agent and the pathways by which it travels with their knowledge of environmental health impacts lhds define exclusionary zones and evacuation areas to ensure public safety as well as to issue advisories related to drinking water and food safetyonce a response reaches the recovery phase lhds may be responsible for long-term monitoring of exposed individuals and environmental health impacts as well as continued risk communication should environmental contamination linger
an effective and safe response to a hazardous material spill also involves the carriers of the material meyer and brown 2019 many businesses have developed plans for what to do in response to an incident that define the responsibilities for each unit in the firm depending on the type of disruption many large shippers and carriers also have specially-trained emergency response teams that can assist in the response to a hazardous materials incident the business plans generally fall under the concept of business continuity plans the importance of such plans was highlighted by the great east japan earthquake of 2011 where global supply chains were disrupted for months due to the disruption of the critical supply of motor vehicle products centered in the affected area in japan one of the outcomes from this experience was that most japanese firms now have business continuity plans outlining the steps that will be taken for responding to immediate threats associated with such a magnitude of disruption however the major focus of business continuity plans is on the business itself and steps that need to be taken to recover service maintain customer relations and avoid negative impacts on the market value of the firm very few plans devote much attention to the broader picture of how interaction with public agencies especially for planning ahead of such incidents should occurmuch attention has been given to the challenges and public health risks associated with hazardous materials transport in part because of the potentially calamitous impacts of a hazardous release especially in a dense urban area a wide and diverse range of public agencies nongovernmental organizations private companies public health providers and emergency responders have been engaged for many years in preparing for such incidents over the past several decades many incidents have provided lessons on what should be done in preparing for and responding to different scenarios the key message from all of these experiences is that preparing and practicing for any exigency is the best possible way of minimizing the human and environmental impacts of hazardous material spills the role of public health and medical providers is critical to this response as is the role of all the other agencies involved with responding to and recovering from the challenges of hazardous material spillsin transportation infrastructure planning engineers and planners use models to predict the future vehicle and person flows that will likely be using the transportation systems of the future in order to determine where and how much new transportation capacity will be needed these models are deemed behavioral in that they include variables that reflect how human behavior in making travel decisions will be influenced by changes in such things as trip price availability of different modes of transport perceptions of safety and the like even though they are considered behavioral most of the models are calibrated on historic travel data in other words the relationships among the key variables are assumed to be similar in the future as they have been in the past
with respect to infrastructure design engineers use approved manuals and environmental input data that are often based on historic trends and years of practical use although there is now movement to modify some of these technical references many still are based on historic trends eg the intensity-duration-frequency i-d-f curves used by many to estimate precipitation and drainage flows are based on historic rainfall data fig 81
shows modeled future average global temperatures in centigrade assuming four different scenarios for global greenhouse gas ghg emissions denoted in the figure as representative concentration pathways rcps identified by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc rcp 85 is the worst-case scenario where ghg emissions continue to go up which many scientists believe to be the most likely scenario and rcp 26 is the best-case scenario where ghg emissions stabilize the most important observation of this figure is that sometime in the 2030s the curves diverge only one of the four scenarios could be considered as an extension of past trends and even here the curve shows a faster growth rate than previous years the future is not going to be like the pastthe same is generally true for other climatic conditions as well precipitation patterns are expected to change predictions of extreme storms eg hurricanes are not clear although most seem to agree that whatever the number of storms their intensity is likely to be much greater than in the past and with more intense coastal storms comes higher storm surge especially when this surge occurs on top of sea level rise all of these future weather conditions have serious implications to public health transportation and to those concerns where they intersecta great deal of attention has been given to the potential effects of climate change on public health see for example anderson et al 2017 patz et al 2000 stone et al 2014 world health organization who 2016 ziska et al 2016 the centers for disease control cdc 2014 and the fourth us national climate assessment 2018 are two useful sources of information the material found in this section largely draws upon these two sourcesthe public health chapter of the fourth us national climate assessment made the following key observationsthe health and well-being of americans are already affected by climate change with the adverse health consequences projected to worsen with additional changes in climateclimate change affects human health by altering exposures to heat waves floods droughts and other extreme events vector- food- and waterborne infectious diseases changes in the quality and safety of air food and water and stresses to mental health and well-beingpeople and communities are differentially exposed to hazards and disproportionately affected by climate-related health risks populations experiencing greater health risks include children older adults low-income communities and communities of colorproactive adaptation policies and programs reduce the risks and impacts from climate-sensitive health outcomes and from disruptions in healthcare servicesadditional benefits to health arise from explicitly accounting for climate change risks in infrastructure planning and urban designreducing greenhouse gas emissions would benefit the health of americans in the near and long term by the end of this century thousands of american lives could be saved and hundreds of billions of dollars in health-related economic benefits would be gained each year under a pathway of lower greenhouse gas emissions us global change research program 2018a us global change research program 2018b
two other ways of conceptualizing the public health consequences of climate change are shown in figure 82 figure 83 fig 82
shows the different public health risks associated with different types of climate change several of these linkages could include a transportation component eg traffic injuries due to severe weather transportation as a vector given new changes in vector ecology transportation access to healthy food or alternatively disruptions to current food supply chains due to system failures and the like

illustrates the point made elsewhere in this book that there are many different drivers and contexts that contribute ultimately to health outcomesin one of the more important papers on the role of public health officials in a climate change future frumkin et al 2008 suggested that there are many such roles in all of the essential services associated with the public health profession these are shown in table 88
 they make the point that one of the key principles in public healthdisease or illness preventioncan be applied to climate change-related public health threats as noted primary prevention corresponds to mitigationefforts to slow stabilize or reverse climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions secondary and tertiary prevention corresponds to adaptationefforts to anticipate and prepare for the effects of climate change and thereby to reduce the associated health burden frumkin et al 2008 the concepts of mitigation and adaptation are found in other fields as well including transportation as will be seen later transportation adaptation includes giving transportation facilities and assets the ability to withstand weather-related risksan excellent example of how public health agencies can examine potential climate change risks to public health is found in the california department of public health cdph county-level climate change studies the study of imperial county in the southeastern part of the state which includes the hottest location in the united states death valley provides an illustration of what such a study entails cdph 2017 the outline of the report includes the following sectionswhat are the climate projections for the desert regionwhat are the climate projections for imperial countyprojected temperature changescurrent fire hazard severity zonesprojected wildfire acreageoverview of climate change and health impactsextreme weather-related injury displacement and mental healthhealth impacts of heathealth impacts of droughtvector-borne illness and food insecuritysea level rise mold and indoor air qualitysocioeconomic disruptionwhich population subgroups are most vulnerablewhat are the health status health inequities and population vulnerabilities in imperial county
selected public health strategies and action steps for climate changeof special note in this list is the emphasis on vulnerable populations some observations on such groups included note data come from 2010 unless otherwise indicatedthere were 13526 children under the age of 5 years and 18152 adults aged 65 years and older considered among climate-vulnerable groupsthere were 10517 people living in nursing homes dormitories and other group quarters where institutional authorities would need to provide transportation in the event of emergenciesimperial county had approximately 6366 outdoor workers whose occupation increased their risk of heat illnessroughly 10 percent of households did not own a vehicle that could be used for evacuation statewide average was 8in 2009 approximately 32 of households were estimated to lack air conditioning a strategy to counter adverse effects of heat statewide average was 36in 200510 there was an annual average of 135 heat-related emergency room visits and an age-adjusted rate of 78 emergency room visits per 100000 persons the statewide age-adjusted rate was 10 emergency room visits per 100000 persons cdph 2017
the study also identified some typical strategies that the county could adopt to be better prepared for future climate change public health risks table 89
shows a sample of these strategiesin sum public health officials are aware of the public health risks associated with a changing climate in part because new climatic conditions largely exacerbate the morbidity and mortality of currently known diseases in some cases new diseases show up in regions that had not seen them before because the environment is now more conducive to organisms that heretofore had been unable to survive as seen in the imperial county case much of the attention of the public health community with regard to climate changerelated health risks is focused on vulnerable populations those who will be particularly affected by the new extremes of temperature precipitation winds etc that will become much more common
instability of materials exposed to high temperatures over longer periods of time can result in increased failures such as pavement heave or track buckling pavement designs in particular are very sensitive to temperatureground conditions and less water saturation due to drought conditions can alter the design factors for foundations and retaining walls such as is occurring with the melting of permafrost in alaskaencased equipment such as traffic control devices and signal control systems for rail service might fail due to higher temperatures inside the enclosure

increased electricity usage and power outages during heat waves might affect the electrical power supply to rail operations and supporting ancillary assets such as electronic signing for highway operationslow water levels could significantly curtail barge operations along major river arteries as well as lock and dam operationsextended periods of high temperatures will affect the health of employees who work long hours outdoors such as those working on infrastructure reconstruction and maintenance activitiesright-of-way landscaping and vegetation will have to be more drought resistant and able to survive longer periods of high temperaturesother water-use activities in a transportation agency might have to be curtailed at least on a temporary basis eg washing of transit vehiclesextreme temperatures will create dangerous conditions for many users of the transportation system placing greater emphasis on the use of air conditioning for transit vehicles and stations and on increased use of green design approachesextreme temperatures could result in increased maintenance activities such as replacing tracks that have buckled and pavement sections that have experienced heave as well as removing landslides and erosion that occur with extreme precipitation events after drought or extreme temperatures have dried out the soil
drought-induced wildfires andor dust storms can create dangerous blackout conditions for road usersairplane operations in high-temperature environments might have to be reconsidered due to less lift available in higher elevations to allow a plane to take off in phoenix arizona flights have been canceled due to extreme temperatures and officials concern that the runway was not long enough for the planes to take offextended periods of high temperatures will likely result in changes in rail operations at a minimum requiring mandatory reduced speeds in areas where the track has been exposed to high temperatures over many dayssimilarly extended periods of high temperatures will negatively affect bicycle use and the desire and propensity of individuals to walk outdoors
transportation officials are increasingly becoming interested in the implications of future climate change on their agencys operations as this interest increases it is likely that additional guidance will become available on how to plan design operate and maintain transportation systems such that they are more resilient in the face of increasing climate change and extreme weather risks see for example federal highway administration fhwa 2016 federal highway administration fhwa 2017b federal highway administration fhwa 2017a meyer and weigel 2011 and meyer et al 2014the interface among climate change public health and transportation occurs in three major areas which have been largely covered in other sections of the book1weather-related conditions eg high winds dust storms sudden floods blinding rain or snow are factors contributing to fatalities and injuries that were discussed in chapter 7 as being of concern to both transportation and public health officials in many cases the weather-related event itself can result in fatalities for example the national weather service nws reported 116 people killed in floods 106 from extreme heat 43 from hurricanes and 20 from high winds in 2018 note this report did not include updated estimated deaths from hurricane maria in puerto rico fifty percent of the 418 flood deaths from 2015 to 2017 occurred in vehicles nws 20182transportation provides accessibility to all sorts of land uses including medical and health care facilities widespread disruptions due to extreme weather can cut access to such facilities seriously affecting the ability of health caregivers to provide medical help this also impacts the supply chain of medical supplies and personnel trying to access the affected areas during the recovery period transportation facilities and service provide the channel for water and food to reach disaster zones as well as supporting the social determinants of health that are stressed during times of disruption3roads and in some cases transit services helicopters and airplanes can provide a means of evacuating either areas that are likely to face a disaster eg hurricane or those that have experienced one eg earthquake having a means of evacuation is especially important when there is only one way to leave a wildfire in california in 2018 for example surrounded the only road serving isolated campgrounds and other recreational sites that were later burned as well resulting in fatalities for those not heeding the advice to evacuate before the fire reached those sites hurricane katrina is partially remembered for large groups of the population stranded in new orleans with no means to evacuate the city has since identified bus stops designated for pickups of those without vehicles prior to a hurricane hitting the regionanother nonclimate change example is the effort of the oregon dot to establish routes into the state that would survive a major earthquake given that the major interstate serving the state i-5 is expected to be destroyed in many locations odot 2014 alternate routes are being hardened redundant command and control centers have been established and prepositioning of emergency supplies has occurred to provide access to water food and medical supplies assuming that the road network is disrupted4in some cases transportation facilities and services can provide refuge for those seeking shelter in the aftermath of hurricane katrina many people sought higher elevations that is bridges to avoid rising flood waters in many cities during heat waves those without air conditioning ride air-conditioned buses to avoid the heat some transit agencies offer free trips for this purpose during extreme cold many likewise ride the transit system seeking heat5transportation agencies are often one of the few agencies with monitoring and public information capabilities in forewarning the population about an impending disaster and to communicate after a disaster occurs these include communications about emergency routing roadway closures wide-area alerts early warnings evacuation re-entry into disaster zones and disaster travel information variable message signs that are common on major highways throughout the world can be used to convey messages concerning the locations of shelters and the most efficient paths through a road network6in the aftermath of a major disaster transportation agencies provide the physical barriers to isolate areas that are targeted for recovery to keep out those who do not belong in addition one of the key challenges facing many communities after a disaster is removing levels of debris that far exceed the capacity of a community to remove state dots have the capability to transfer resources from one location to another and thus have become an important source of debris removal if authorized to do so by the legislature as an example of one states efforts in debris removal the georgia dot has formed strike teams for every segment of the states freeway system that will respond quickly to system disruptions staff from the states forestry service are part of these strike teams in order to bring power saws to remove downed trees often a major obstacle in reopening a road
the public health consequences of climate change represent potentially some of the greatest challenges society might face in future years this is especially the case for 1 the transmission of diseases and environmental infections that will follow the changing environmental conditions associated with a changing climate and 2 the aftermath of major weather disasters that on average will likely be more powerful than storms of the past the public health community has many policy program and prevention options for dealing with climate change impacts watts et al 2015 for example frumkin et al 2008 suggest public health professionals can explain the health rationale for climate change mitigation in terms of reduced morbidity and mortality  can provide evidence on the health impacts of various approaches to climate change mitigation including co-benefits and disbenefits  and should play a major role in developing plans that address health threats related to climate change in many of these actions transportation service and infrastructure can play a critical role in minimizing the public health consequences of a changing climatethe underlying concept of an all-hazards approach to disasters is that preparation serves as the foundation for effective response to any type of incident fig 84
shows a typical representation of the different phases of disaster preparation and response for both response and recovery phases of a disaster preparation is necessary which is indicated on the left side of the figure in fact this preparation is continuousindicating periodic updates and practicing of response and recover procedures also of note in the figure is the immediate response to a disaster which evolves into a recovery operationin fact as indicated these phases tend to overlap the long-term recovery includes rebuilding and making changes during the rebuilding that will provide more protection if another similar disaster strikes the other important observation from figure 84 is the time frameimmediate response measured in days and perhaps weeks intermediate responserecovery measured in weeksmonths and long-term recovery measured in monthsyears the all-hazards approach to disaster preparation considers each phase of such a disaster cycleat the us federal level the stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act stafford act of 1988 established the legal and institutional system for presidential disaster declarations and for the response from federal agencies fema was given the responsibility for coordinating government-wide relief efforts dhs has lead responsibilities for incidents involving national security meyer 2009 beginning in the 1990s the us government under the leadership of fema implemented the all-hazards approach for developing risk-based all-hazard emergency operations plans femas guide for all-hazard emergency operations planning lays out the steps that served as a basis for effective response to any hazard that threatens any jurisdiction facilitated the integration of mitigation into response and recovery activities and facilitated the coordination with the federal government during catastrophic disaster situations fema 1996 this guide recommended specific actions in such areas as emergency public information communications command and control mass care health and medical response and resource managementthe guide also defined a concept of operations that would ensure that the necessary planning and coordination be accomplished prior to the occurrence of a disaster to facilitate the management of health and medical services during disasters the concept of operations was to include such things as establishing a medical command post at a disaster site thatcoordinated health and medical response team effortstriaged the injured if appropriateprovided medical care and transport for the injuredidentified transported and handled the deceasedestablished holding and treatment areas for the injuredisolated decontaminated and treated victims of hazardous chemical or infectious diseases as neededidentified hazardous chemicals or infectious diseases controlling their spread and reporting their presence to appropriate state and federal health or environmental authoritiesissued health and medical advisories to the public on such matters as emergency water supplies waste disposal mass feeding services disease vectors immunizations disinfection and others fema 1996
the guide recognized the need to coordinate the many different agencies and groups that might be involved with a disaster response table 810
shows the types of agencies that were identified for two areas mass care and health and medicalfederal preparations since the 1990s have been in response to presidential policy directives especially relating to national preparedness related fema policies and dhs initiatives several key concepts in the dhs directives include
national incident management system nims a nationwide approach for all governments private companies and nongovernmental organizations ngos to prepare for respond to and recover from domestic incidents the focus is on providing interoperability and compatibility among those involved with a domestic incident including the creation of an incident command structure ics federal highway administration fhwa 2017a federal highway administration fhwa 2017b
national response plan nrp an all-discipline all-hazards plan that provides for the coordination of a federal response to a domestic incident the plan includes annexes for specialized circumstances specific government and private sector participants are assigned responsibility for functional roles in what are called emergency support functions esfs dhs 2008

emergency support functions the primary operational-level mechanisms for federal agencies to provide assistance to other governments for example evacuation efforts would be supported under several esfs including transportation communication mass care and emergency management federal highway administration fhwa 2017a federal highway administration fhwa 2017bif as was noted earlier that preparation serves as the foundation for effective response to disasters then coordination and collaboration serve as the basis for effective preparation as noted by the fhwaleaders at all levels must communicate and actively support engaged partnerships by developing shared goals and aligning capabilities so that no one is overwhelmed in times of crisis  incidents must be managed at the lowest possible jurisdictional level and supported by additional capabilities when neededfederal highway administration fhwa 2017a federal highway administration fhwa 2017b
a recent review of all-hazards approaches to nonnuclear incidents by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd 2018 emphasized this point in a review of incidents in member oecd countries the following selected lessons learned in this review provide an excellent overview of the characteristics of an all-hazards approach to incidentdisaster response that should be considered by those developing such a strategylegislation and regulations while necessary are not sufficient to ensure the prevention of accidents or adequate preparedness it is therefore important for stakeholders to undertake additional initiatives and learn from the experience of others in different fields of worka common issue shared by both the nuclear and nonnuclear industries is that of identifying a wide range of accident scenarios from design-based to beyond-designbased accidents consideration of such a broad range of accident scenarios ensures that planning efforts are robust and provide for adequate protection of public health and safetypromoting forward-looking risk governance that takes into account complex risks is important in evaluating risk exposure countries may want to not only rely on past disruptive shocks and linear risk modeling but also consider evolving risk patterns including demographic economic technological and environmental drivers as well as their interdependencies and potential cascading impactstraining and emergency drills have also been identified as essential for successful emergency response both on-site and off-siteit is very important to select appropriate personnel protection measures such as equipment for emergency responders as well as the means of improving their awareness of the hazards surrounding the eventgovernments must develop crisis-management capacities to cope with the complexity novelty ambiguity and uncertainty characterizing many modern crises emergency response plans are necessary tools for conventional crisis managementusing social media effectively in crisis communication requires that appropriate resources be devoted to the management of social network messaging during the event it is important to ensure that the information circulating in various social media platforms is accurate because accurate information leads to public trust in officials see oecd 2015 for a good discussion of the use of social mediaengaging the private sector in crisis-management efforts is crucial particularly when the scale and complexity of a crisis requires a whole-of-society approachleaders must be identified prior to the crisis and they along with their teams organizations and key partners must be sufficiently prepared to cope with the challenges presented by the crisis
on-site emergency plans for accidents involving hazardous materials should take natural hazard risks into account off-site emergency response plans for hazardous industries in natural hazard-prone areas should consider the impact of hazardous material releases on populations and on rescue operations the vulnerability of emergency response resources to natural events and hazardous material releases should be assessed medical services should be involved in the preparation of the external emergency planhealth effects from disasters are far more than the sum of their physical or psychological health effects including posttraumatic stress disorder medically unexplained symptoms or syndromes may be the most prominent negative health outcome
within the context of this need for collaboration and coordination both public health and transportation officials have important roles to play in both cases the command structure will likely be led by either fema or dhs depending on circumstances but as indicated in guidance from both agencies public health and transportation agencies are important participants in the phases of a disaster shown in fig 84

hospital associated infections hai continue to be a common and significant complication of hospitalization leading to increased morbidity and mortality it was estimated that in 2002 there were approximately 17 million healthcare-associated infections which resulted in approximately 99000 deaths 41 a more recent meta-analysis of the costs and financial impact of hai on the us healthcare system reported that the total annual costs for the five major infections central line-associated bloodstream infections clabsi ventilator-associated pneumonia vap surgical site infections ssi clostridium difficile infection cdi and catheter-associated urinary tract infections cauti were 98 billion 95  confidence interval ci 83 to 115 billion 106 there has been an unprecedented movement for healthcare facilities to improve patient safety and certainly prevention of hai represents a major portion of that effortthe process by which a patient acquires an infection while hospitalized is complex this has been elegantly illustrated and described by dr weinstein fig 41 highlighting the role of the patients endogenous flora exposure to exogenous flora as well as the influence of devices and pressure from antibiotic use 101 recent development and implementation of strategies to prevent hai have included such efforts as antimicrobial stewardship interrupting transmission of epidemiologically important organisms and infection specific prevention bundles however there is renewed interest in defining the role of environmental contamination in transmission of nosocomial pathogens and development of hai
the purpose of this chapter is to review the role of the environment of care as it pertains to microbial contamination and risk of hai to patients as well as describe the novel use and efficacy of antimicrobial copper surfaces in mitigating this risk we will discuss problematic pathogens in healthcare their ability to contaminate and persist in the environment their ability to contaminate the healthcare provider and ultimately their ability to directly or indirectly result in colonization and infection in the patient we will briefly review the traditional measures utilized to reduce the microbial burden associated with the healthcare environment but focus our discussion on the use of continuously active antimicrobial solid copper for this purpose given that we describe the proposed mechanism of action for coppers antimicrobial property its activity against pathogens commonly found in healthcare as well as the clinical efficacy of placing solid copper surfaces into the patient care environmentmicrobes have an innate ability to contaminate and potentially establish residence on any surface surfaces with frequent hand contact and in close proximity to the patient are often colonized with nosocomial pathogens and most of these pathogens can remain viable on these inanimate surfaces for weeks to months chap 101007978-3-319-08057-42 and ref 42 further the distribution and dispersal of the microbes from healthcare workers visitors and patients can contribute to the resident microbial flora of the built environment humans shed a minimum of ten million of their 100 million skin cells per day routine activities such as walking can result in the loss of approximately 104 skin particles per minute with a complete layer of skin cells being lost and replaced from healthy individuals on average approximately every 4 days 51 the displaced skin cells are covered with the endogenous flora of the individual not all individuals shed skin equally in one study of microbial dispersal by skin in a hospital ward noble defined a staph aureus disperser as a patient who contributed greater than six s aureus per cubic meter of air 52 given that the mean concentration of bacteria within the ward was the equivalent of 800 viable bacteria per cubic meter the concentration of s aureus observed was thought to represent 1  of the total flora 52 over the years the number has been revised to suggest that an individual is a staph aureus disperser when they are able to disseminate more than four viable particles per microbe per cubic meter of air 9 causality or the linkage of an environmental isolate to that organism responsible for disease in individuals has been demonstrated as early as 1945 when deforest and kerr reported cases of eczema which occurred amongst nurses that were caused by streptococci that were shed 26 with the advent of molecular techniques such as pulsed field gel electrophoresis pfge and whole genome sequencing the ability to demonstrate casualty has now become much more straightforward but is still nevertheless time intensive and cost prohibitiveonce established within the built environment the microbe must then be able to resist the perturbations introduced as a consequence of cleaning and other infection control measures to that end some pathogens have become resistant to disinfectants used on environmental surfaces thus leading to their persistence and continued distribution within the built environment and presenting a continued risk of being transferred to a patient healthcare worker or object within the built hospital environment 100certain factors must be met for a microbe to transition from its role as an inhabitant of the surfaces associated with the built clinical environment to pathogen that can be transmitted to a patient or healthcare worker first the pathogen must be able to survive on the objects and surfaces within the environment for a sufficiently long period of time while retaining its ability to be virulent or its ability to colonize a susceptible host after its subsequent liberation from the surface and resulting transmissionestablishment second contamination of the environment by a particular pathogen must be sufficiently frequent to account for its loss from the object or surfaces as a consequence of routine cleaning desiccation or starvation third the agent must be present at a concentration sufficient to establish itself upon encountering the new host or location certain nosocomial pathogens such as norovirus have incredibly small infectious doses with a median dose of 18 viruses 86 while the environmental dose of the causative agent of the majority of cauti escherichia coli is not as evident the infectious disease society of america idsa has classified that in the absence of symptoms a concentration of 105 colony forming units cfu per ml coupled where 1 bacterial species is present in the urine of a catheterized patient that the individual has an asymptomatic catheter associated bacteriuria ca-asb 35 a cauti is defined as the presence of symptoms or signs compatible with urinary tract infections uti with no other identified source of infection along with 103 cfuml of 1 bacterial species from a catheterized or previously catheterized 48 h urine sample 35 however the guidelines are silent as to the origin andor concentration of the microbes required to establish the ca-asb or cauti the concept of infectious dose from the environment as it pertains to nosocomial infection has not been rigorously studied for the majority of the hai further study is warrantedhospitals have put into place measures in an attempt to decrease the contamination or likelihood of colonization of healthcare workers with infectious pathogens focus has been placed on increased hand hygiene contact precautions and enhanced environmental cleaning in 2006 pittet and colleagues presented an evidence-based model arguing for improved hand hygiene practices during patient care as being the most important method for preventing hai and spread of antimicrobial resistant pathogens 61 in their model five steps are required for the transmission of pathogens within the clinical care setting collectively the model considers the microbes and their transmission from objects healthcare workers and patients to the next individual or object the first step requires that the microbe be present or resident on the patientshealthcare workers skin or immediate environment the concentration of the nosocomial pathogen can vary from as few as 1 to over 106 cfu per cm2 subsequently the microbe must be transferred to the healthcare worker simple acts such as lifting a patient obtaining a blood pressure pulse or assessing a temperature can easily result in the transfer of between 100 and 1000 cfu of a common gram-negative pathogen klebsiella spp 19 in fact these authors learned that 17  of the staff of an intensive care unit were found to have klebsiella contaminating their hands when screened and that the serotypes were related to those isolated from infected or colonized patients within the icu on the same day 19 further advancing the importance of hand hygiene was a study that found healthcare workers were as likely to contaminate their hands or gloves from commonly-touched environmental surfaces as from direct contact with colonized patients 85the third aspect of the model is dependent upon the biology of the microbe some microbes can survive for longer periods of time on hands than others epidemic and non-epidemic strains of e coli and klebsiella spp were found to have significantly different survival times 30 supporting the argument that bacterial properties other than the survival of a typed strain under defined conditions may contribute to the ability of a microbe to be easily transmitted and retained within healthcare setting in other studies workers found that bacterial colonization of the hands of healthcare workers progressively increased with time 60 62 in these two studies they found that the concentration of commensal and pathogenic flora increased as a consequence of patient care additionally the authors reported that the dynamics of hand contamination were independent of whether or not the healthcare worker was working while gloved or ungloved 60 62such an establishment of causality in the development of hai and an intrinsic ability to survive on the hands of the healthcare workers provides strong support for a role for hand hygiene for limiting the incidence and controlling the spread of hai the fourth and fifth aspects of the model advanced by pittet and colleagues addresses the issue of defective andor absent hand cleansing and how it can lead to the cross transmission of the microbes 61 here they have raised the issue of the need to microbiologically validate proper hand cleansing in order to control the spread of microbes regardless of their source in citing a study by sala and colleagues they describe how an outbreak of norovirus was traced to an infected food handler within a hospital cafeteria here the implicated foodstuffs consumed during the outbreak were handmade by the infected worker 69 independently it has been shown that norovirus contaminated fingers can sequentially transfer this virus to up to seven surfaces 7 sequential transfer is not only confined to human to surface transfer in the same study the virus was found to move from contaminated cleaning cloths to clean hands and surfaces 7 recently snitkin and colleagues used whole genome sequencing to track an outbreak of carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumonia that occurred at the us national institutes of health clinical center where they learned that despite early implementation of infection control procedures including aggressive hand hygiene controls the microbe persisted in the environment 83 consequently the built environment can serve as a reservoir from which clean hands can serve as a source of haiwhen a patient is known to be colonized or infected with a transmittable pathogen dedicated equipment ie stethoscopes should be used when possible along with other personal protective equipment such as gowns gloves and masks frequently touched hospital surfaces and medical equipment such as doorknobs bed rails faucet handles and intravenous iv poles have been identified as reservoirs of pathogenic microbes 10 56 in addition to medical equipment and healthy or intact skin there have been reports of the transfer of bacteria to the gloves and gowns of healthcare workers after patient contact 6 18 33 49 specifically morgan and colleagues reported that the transfer of multi-drug resistant bacteria mdr to the gowns and gloves of healthcare workers occurred after routine contact and that this was found to increase as environmental contamination increased 49 the intent of the study was to evaluate the differential rate of contamination by a mdr variant of acinetobacter baumannii compared with other mdr bacteria while attempting to understand the importance of environmental contamination in the transfer of mdr bacteria to personal protective equipment ppe gowns and gloves of healthcare workers here the microbe most frequently recovered was the extremely recalcitrant multidrug resistant variant of a baumannii most striking however were the conclusions that resulted from the modeling of their data here a positive environmental culture was found to be the strongest risk factor associated with the contamination of the clothing of the healthcare worker by mdr bacteria odds ratio or 42 95  ci 2765 49 other independent variables such as presence in the patients room for greater than 5 min or 20 p  0014 performing a physical examination or 17 p  0019 or contact with a ventilator or 18 p  0014 were similarly significant in raising the likelihood or risk of transfer of mdr bacteria but at rates lower than the rate observed for a positive environmental culture 49 intuition would suggest transfer was greater when interacting with a patient however the higher risk associated with a positive environmental culture serves to reinforce the importance that the microbial burden of the built clinical environment represents to the set of circumstances required for colonization and infection of patients while hospitalizedeven with environmental cleaning studies have suggested that certain organisms can be transmitted to the subsequent occupants in the setting of patient care specifically methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa vancomycin resistant enterococci vre c difficile and gram negative pathogens have been implicated in a study by martinez and others in 2003 an epidemiologic link was made between contaminated surfaces by vre and subsequent vre infection 46 in another study where the environments of patients colonized or infected with vre were evaluated upwards of 37  of the environmental samples collected were found to harbor vre 31 the samples included patient gowns medical equipment used for care as well as environmental surfaces 31 controlling the spread of vre to subsequent room occupants is challenging in that this microbe can be resistant to the disinfectants used for routine and terminal cleaning even the use of bleach-based products have been reported to fail in their ability to eradicate the microbe from surfaces 22 24 see also chap 101007978-3-319-08057-49independent of cleaning the issue of transference of pathogens from the environment to subsequent occupants can be inferred from studies demonstrating the long-term survival of the microbes on surfaces within the built environment mrsa and other nosocomial pathogens including vre and c difficile can survive for months on dry surfaces chap 101007978-3-319-08057-42 and ref 42 mrsa has been documented for its ability to survive within hospital dust for up to a year 89 further frequently touched hospital surfaces such as doorknobs have been implicated as reservoirs from which pathogens can be routinely recovered and thus transferred 56 mrsa like vre is ubiquitous in the hospital environment especially in the vicinity of patients known to be colonized or infected 22 24 the chief method of spread is poor compliance with infection control measures such as hand hygiene by healthcare workers several studies have described endemic and epidemic contamination of the environment with mrsa a recent review by dancer and colleagues found that the site contamination mean for common objects in the patients room with mrsa was 37  with high percentages found for such surfaces as overbed tables 40  bed rails 27  and other furniture 27  23the risk of acquiring mrsa or vre by a patient being admitted into a room that was previously occupied by a patient known to harbor mrsa or vre was described by huang and colleagues 37 the added risk of acquisition of mrsa to the 10151 eligible patients examined by their study was found to increase by an adjusted odds ratio of 14 p  004 specifically amongst the patients whose prior room occupant was mrsa positive n  1454 39  of this cohort acquired mrsa while only 29  of the patients who occupied a room previously housing a mrsa negative patient n  8697 acquired mrsa a similar risk profile of acquisition of the drug resistant microbe was similarly observed with vre here 45  of patients who occupied a room that previously housed a vre positive patient n  1291 developed vre while the infection rate in patients housed in rooms previously occupied by a vre negative patient n  9058 had an attack rate of 28  adjusted odds ratio of 14 p  002 the authors concluded that acquisition from previous occupants accounted for 40  increased odds of transmission of mrsa and vre strongly suggesting a role for environmental contamination despite room cleaning methods that exceeded the national standard 37 a review of the topic of the risk of nosocomial pathogen acquisition from prior room occupants was recently published 58 here otter and colleagues reviewed the increased risk associated with other mdr microbes again the trend was the same patients who occupied rooms where the former patient was infected or colonized with pseudomonas aeruginosa or a baumannii 55 or c difficile 81 resulted in a similar increase risk of acquiring the previous occupants pathogena study in 2011 showed that a prior room occupant with a cdi was a significant risk factor for cdi acquisition by the subsequent occupant 81 this spore-forming anaerobic bacterium can survive for many months on hospital surfaces and is recalcitrant to usual cleaning methods 36 studies have shown very high environmental surface contamination rates particularly in areas within close proximity to the patient in a trial conducted in france approximately 25  of healthcare workers who were caring for patients with a cdi were found to have c difficile spores associated with their hands 43 the authors concluded that contamination of the hands was positively associated with exposure to fecal soiling and lack of glove useseveral gram-negative nosocomial pathogens such as p aeruginosa and a baumannii increasingly associated with multi-drug resistance have similarly been recovered from high touch surfaces such as beds tables and infusion pumps 5 outbreaks thought to have occurred because of patient to patient spread of mdr gram negatives can be devastating to patients and hospitals resulting in high numbers of cases and high morbidity and mortality responses have included robust and aggressive approaches towards infection control often including enhanced environmental cleaning and in extreme cases closure of the affected unit or substantial areas of the hospital 25 27 45 fortunately the majority of the clinically relevant gram-negative microbes associated with the built clinical environment are not viable after drying half-lives routinely encountered are 7 h or less 36an emerging nosocomial fungal pathogen which has become a common cause of central line associated bacteremia in healthcare is candida albicans there are fewer studies documenting the extent of environmental contamination with fungi however c albicans has been shown to be able to survive anywhere from 3 days to up to 4 months on inanimate surfaces 42 the majority of candida infections are likely from endogenous sources however through molecular typing evidence of transmission via environmental sources has been suggested identical strain types were recovered from patients infected with candida and from hospital surfaces from the rooms of the affected patients 88there are several classes of pathogenic viruses that can be found on hospital surfaces respiratory viruses such as influenza coronavirus and rhinovirus can persist on surfaces for a few days 42 viable influenza virus can be transferred from surface to skin leading to the potential transfer to patients 36 gastrointestinal tract viruses such as rotavirus and astrovirus can persist for around 2 months 42 rotavirus is a well-known cause of gastrointestinal illness outbreaks especially in day care centers where it is spread through contamination of toys 36 norovirus has been shown in several studies to be consistently transferred to frequently touched sites in a hospital such as door handles and telephones 24 closure of units and deep environmental cleaning similar in scope time and expense seen with mdr-gram negative outbreaks are often needed to control norovirus outbreaks in hospitalsin summary since the seminal paper by weinstein in 1991 substantial evidence implicating the environment as a continuous source of risk for the acquisition of hai has accumulated to such an extent that there now exists significant interest in learning how to manage and provide best-practice applications for infection control for hospitals 8 12 13 15 evident from the previous discussion microbes have an intrinsic ability to survive and ultimately colonize common touch surfaces where acquisition and transport from surfaces to humans is common healthcare workers have the potential to transfer these microbiological contaminants not only from patient to patient but amongst themselves and back to surfaces refreshing or adding to the complexity of the microbial reservoir involved in transmission there have been many studies looking at the control of contamination of common hospital touch surfaces both from hand to surface contact and vice versa investigators have shown that the gloves of nurses frequently collected viable mrsa after touching inanimate objects near colonized patients 16 in concert with aggressive hand hygiene campaigns recent hygiene guidelines specifically recommend that particular attention be paid to the disinfection of patient-care surfaces especially surfaces designated high touch objects htos as a target of infection prevention and control 78 the guidelines note that such objects could potentially contribute to secondary transmission by contaminating hands of healthcare workers hcws or by contacting medical equipment that subsequently contacts patients 8 29 64 67 72 73 90 routine or daily cleaning coupled with cleaning immediately after patient discharge terminal cleaning of the surfaces and objects within the room with subsequent application of a hospital grade disinfectant has been an accepted method for controlling and limiting the spread of infectious agents 68 a concentration of between 25 and 5 aerobic cfu per square centimeter has been proposed as the benchmark where bacterial levels below this value are considered to represent a minimum of risk while concentrations greater are suggestive of an increased risk of hai acquisition 22 44no touch solutions for the disinfection of at-risk environments within healthcare settings are quickly gaining acceptance as technologies that have been found to be an effective and comprehensive addition to systems-based solutions for infection control the technologies have been studied in concert with aggressive hand hygiene campaigns appropriate routine and terminal cleaning of patient care environments and an active surveillance and isolation protocol for patients entering care who are already colonized with vre mrsa c difficile or other multi-drug resistant microbes such as klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase kpc as a consequence of this one is left to wonder whether or not the antimicrobial effectiveness is providing an additive effect or whether the antimicrobial effectiveness of these no-touch technologies are acting synergisticallyas the name suggests no-touch technologies do not come in direct contact with colonized contaminated or soiled surfaces rather they distribute their microbiocidal activity through the atmosphere by either delivering a lethal concentration of electromagnetic energy in the ultraviolet spectrum or by the real-time distribution of reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide singlet oxygen hydroxyl radical or oxyanions in general both systems have been found to effectively reduce the concentration of microbes by at least 4 logs10 34 both systems have their limitations see chap 101007978-3-319-08057-49 each requires skilled labor to place the equipment and commence the disinfection cycle in the location subjected to disinfectionthe disinfection reach of ultraviolet light is subject to the effects of shadowing and cornering this typically requires that the equipment be placed in the center of the room to insure uninform distribution of the lethal ultraviolet energy additionally the room must be vacant and any associated ultraviolet energy need be prevented from leaking into areas occupied by people as the ultraviolet uv light energy can damage eyesight and result in skin burns the energy can also shorten the life of equipment in the room as routine exposure to uv light can accelerate decay by increasing the brittleness of many of the plastics used in the fabrication of healthcare associated equipmentthe use of an automated uv-c light emitting system for the inactivation of vre c difficile and species of acinetobacter has been found to be effective in debulking the built environment of these pathogens in one study employing an automated emitter in two hospitals the concentrations of bacteria were reduced for all 9 of the environmental sites tested and occurred regardless of whether the sampled location was in direct or indirect line of sight of the uv source 3 further the extent of the reduction to the microbial burden was found to be significant for vre and c difficile but not acinetobacter spp 3 however the data were sufficiently compelling to lead the authors to conclude that the use of an automated uv-c no-touch disinfection device can lead to a decrease in the bioburden of important nosocomial pathogens in real-world active clinical environments 3another multi-hospital intervention used a pulsed xenon based uv delivery mechanism in concert with screening and hand hygiene education together the three were able to significantly reduce 56  p  0001 the incidence of hospital associated mrsa infections in the study population 82 given that this was a bundled intervention the contribution of the individual components of the bundle cannot be discerned however the data do reinforce the common belief that any effective infection control program requires a systematic approach in order to be effectiveas early as 1990 vapor phase hydrogen peroxide hpv has been advocated as an effective surface decontaminant and sterilant 40 in the intervening years a number of devices have been developed to deploy this disinfectantsterilant as a vapor into the built clinical environment in one study conducted by passaretti and others an evaluation of the environmental and clinical impact of this no-touch technology was assessed 59 in a 30 month prospective cohort intervention trial involving 6 high risk units from a 994 bed tertiary care hospital they learned that patients admitted to rooms decontaminated using hpv were 64  less likely p  0001 to acquire any multi-drug resistant microbe and 80  less likely to acquire vre p  0001 after adjusting for other factors 59 again the complexity inherent to the transmission and distribution of microbes within the built environment coupled with the stochastic nature of care well illustrates that the risk of acquiring c difficile mrsa and multidrug-resistant gram-negative rods were reduced but failed to reach significance however in spite of the failure to reach significance the effectiveness of this no-touch infection control solution was able to significantly alter the proportion of rooms environmentally contaminated with mdrs here the concentration of mdrs in the hpv treated units were significantly reduced relative risk 065 p  003 but not on non-hpv treated units leading the authors to conclude that the use of hpv can reduce the risk of acquiring mdrs compared with standard cleaning protocols 59in spite of the success demonstrated here and in other studies 14 21 vapor-phase disinfection of the built environment has limitations in that the ventilation to the room must be controlledand or limited for the duration of the disinfection cycle this time can vary depending upon the concentration of peroxide or disinfecting gas used these two technologies hpv and uv have been found to be effective for the disinfection of inanimate objects and surfaces however neither technology is intended as a substitute for cleaning or for the removal of soil from the resident objects and surfaces within the built patient care environment see also chap 101007978-3-319-08057-49 an appropriately trained environmental service team must accomplish cleaning with subsequent disinfection of the built environmentrecently we have begun to witness the incorporation of another no-touch technology however unlike uv and vapor phase oxygen radicals h2o2 that distribute their antimicrobial activity through the atmosphere this technology requires the microbe come in contact or be in close proximity with the material in order to facilitate its antimicrobial activity in contrast to uv and hvp once placed this no-touch system simply requires that the fugitive microbe come in contact with the surface in order to effect disinfection thus the inactivation or killing of the microbe does not require any user intervention once deployed one such example of this type of no-touch technology is solid antimicrobial copper the resident microbial burden associated with the built environment is continuously reduced through the strategic placement of solid copper surfaces onto critical high touch surfaces within the patient care setting 75copper has been used by humans for millennia first as tools and then as a measure to fight the spread of infectious agents metallic copper intrinsically displays a strong antibacterial activity in aquatic systems 2 38 as well as on dry surfaces 32 54 96 102 104 in 2008 the united states environmental protection agency epa registered five families of copper-containing alloys as antimicrobial establishing that products manufactured from one of these registered alloys can make public health claims wherein the label indication states that the alloys kill greater than 999  of bacteria within 2 h of exposure 87 it is anticipated that the solid antimicrobial copper surfaces will remain microbiocidal for the life of the product 10 years a variety of controlled studies have looked at the antimicrobial activity of copper surfaces against specific human pathogens 54 63 92 98 102 104 105 in fact solid copper surfaces have been found to be microbicidal to well over 30 bacteria fungi and viruses of the microbes listed in table 41 five were evaluated in the studies used to grant the public health registration by the united states epa the public health claims granted illustrate the robust nature of the antimicrobial activity alloys granted registration contain greater than 60  metallic copper and were found to continuously kill greater than 999  of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria within 2 h of exposure even after repeated contamination illustrating how solid copper surfaces will inhibit the buildup of microorganisms between routine cleaning and sanitizing steps
the public health claims attributed to solid copper have been evaluated to limit the bacterial burden found on commonly touched surfaces and objects in active healthcare environments in a recent hospital trial bacterial reductions up to one third were recorded using copper alloys in place of plastic or aluminum surfaces on light switches door knobs and push plates 48 casey and others 20 observed a median microbial reduction of between 90 and 100  log10 19520 on copper surfaced push plates faucet handles and toilet seats while schmidt and colleagues demonstrated significantly lower bacterial burdens on six htos averaging an 83  log10 193 reduction for all of the objects over the course of a 43 month multi-center trial 75current cleaning methods can effectively remove pathogens from surfaces but studies have shown that more than half of the trial surfaces were not adequately terminally cleaned and became re-contaminated within minutes 4 17 the rails of hospital beds as a consequence of coincident interactions with patients hcws and visitors are one of the most frequently touched items found in the built patient care environment schmidt and colleagues found when they quantitatively assessed the bacterial burden present on bed rails that through the surfacing of the rail with metallic copper the concentration of bacteria resident on this frequently touched surface was continuously at or below the threshold representing a risk of transfer regardless of whether or not the surface was measured before or after routine cleaning 77further the environmental monitoring of bed frames has consistently shown that the rails of hospital beds typically exceed a suggested threshold of risk more than any other object in the patients room 4 50 75 77 103 it was evident that bed rails covered with solid copper are able to augment cleaning and thereby continuously support the control of the concentration of associated aerobic bacteria this observation was consistently maintained in spite of the kinetic nature of care present in the environment of the icu lower risk concentrations less than 25 cfucm2 were associated with over 83  of the sampled beds 77 further mrsa and vre were absent from all but 7 of the 3938 copper objects sampled arguing that the risk mitigation provided by copper surfaces might be greater than the average concentrations reported suggest 77weber and rutala 99 in their commentary of the evaluation of no-touch copper conducted by karpanen and colleagues argued that it was impractical or impossible to coat each of the environmental surfaces with copper 39 however the data provided by schmidt and colleagues suggest that the strategic placement of solid copper surfaces in high touch areas is key and offers a novel strategy to limit the bacterial burden on a continuous basis 75 copper-alloyed surfaces offer a continuous way to limit andor control the environmental burden hospital and environmental services need not perform additional steps follow complex treatment algorithms obtain buy-in from other providers or require additional training or oversight the other no touch methods presently in wide scale use for room disinfection rely on discontinuous modalities of application in order to reduce the environmental bacterial burden 34 hydrogen peroxide vapor is introduced as a gas into a sealed room ultraviolet light achieves its effectiveness through the transient transmission of germicidal radiation within an unoccupied room consequently like the epa registered disinfectants regularly used to disinfect patient rooms subsequent to cleaning both uv and hpv will likely suffer from the same limitations of the rapid restoration of the bacterial burden intrinsic to high touch objectsin addressing the question of whether or not the strategic placement of copper might ameliorate the rate with which hai are acquired salgado and colleagues 70 found from the conduct of a multi-center trial that the limited placement of copper as described by schmidt and colleagues 75 resulted in a significant reduction to the hai rate andor mrsa or vre colonization rate in medical intensive care rooms icu the collective rate for hai infection or mrsavre colonization was found to be significantly lower by 42  71  in the copper arm of the study when compared against the 123  rate observed in the control rooms p  002 when the data were considered separately for hai alone the rate of infection was significantly reduced 58  from 81 to 34  p  0013more importantly these investigators were able to demonstrate that burden and infection were directly linked in the analysis of the quartile distribution of hais stratified by microbial burden measured in the icu rooms during the patients stay they learned that there was a significant association between burden and hai risk p  0038 with 89  of hai occurring among patients cared for in a room with a burden of more than 500 cfu fig 43 70
the mechanism of action associated with the antimicrobial properties of solid copper surfaces is multifaceted chap 101007978-3-319-08057-46 upon coming in contact with the metallic copper surfaces of objects the electron potential of the microbe in concert with copper facilitates a cascade of irreversible events leading to the rapid death of the bacterium given the inherent ability of solid metallic copper and its alloys containing greater than 60  copper for the conduction of electricity the electrons resident in the membrane of the bacterium that are sufficiently close to the metallic surface coupled with the high flux required by living cells result in the rapid collapse of the proton motive force of the microbe the subsequent dissipation of the proton motive force pmf has been observed through the use of dyes that measure the membrane potential warnes and others have reported on this observation on numerous occasions for both gram positive and gram negative bacteria 9193 95 subsequent to the collapse of the membrane potential a concomitant production of free radicals immediately develops within the cytoplasm of the bacterium the free radicals facilitate the peroxidation of the membrane bleaching of cellular proteins and the cleavage and subsequent complete destruction of the nucleic acids resident in the cytoplasm of the effected microbes additionally upon peroxidation of the membrane there is a loss of membrane integrity resulting in the subsequent leakage of the cytoplasm from the cell and diffusion mediated transport of copper ions into the cytoplasm the copper ions then act in concert with the free radicals resulting in a fenton reaction that leads to further irreparable damage to the cell 91 the entire process occurs quickly resulting in the collapse of a population within minutes thus the likelihood that the population will develop resistance to this multifaceted mechanism of death is unlikely there have been reports in the literature of bacteria being isolated from copper coins but upon challenging the resistant isolates they were found to be uniformly sensitive to metallic copper 71 a likely explanation for their recovery from the surface is likely a consequence of a failure to sufficiently collapse the pmf of the entire community as either a function of proximity of the surviving microbes to the metallic surface or the absence of sufficient electron flux through the membrane to initiate the cascade required for deathin the study conducted by salgado and colleagues six highly touched objects within the icus were selected based from a limited survey where the contact surfaces being the most highly contaminated were identified the six items were then fabricated from a variety of antimicrobial copper alloys where the criteria for alloy selection were reflective of the ability of the antimicrobial alloys to be readily fabricated into that particular component fig 44 properties of strength and durability were operationally defined such that the resulting component would be able to withstand the rigors placed on the finished goods within the built environment of an active clinical setting and for the ability of the materials to withstand standard hospital cleaners including sodium hypochlorite additionally the surface finish was to provide consistent wear and aesthetics over the lifespan of the product all of the copper alloys used for component fabrication were made from solid alloys registered with the epa 87 subsequent to the published report manufacturers have introduced numerous products fabricated from epa registered solid copper that meet or exceed the criteria used by the referenced authors 70 74 75
from a design standpoint it is important to note that these results were additive to other infection-control implementations already in place single patient rooms hand-washing sinks hand sanitizing alcohol dispensers contact precautions required of mrsa and vre carriersinfected patients and an active hand hygiene staff education program were already in place in the units of the hospitals studied should these conclusions expand to other areas of the hospital then employing inherently antimicrobial surfaces could represent a significant enhancement to mitigating infectious bacteria within hospitals for example by instituting a best practices approach that implemented cleaning and hand hygiene designs and protocols the californias healthcare-associated infection prevention initiative showed a reduction of hai by 32  with many of these best practices already in place the initial findings from the clinical trials are showing an additional double-digit reduction in infectionsalthough the relative infection rate in the medical icus where the clinical effectiveness of antimicrobial copper surfaces were evaluated is generally higher than hospitals at large patients in icus are typically not mobile and their interaction with the built environment is very limited consequently items where antimicrobial copper alloys might have been easily incorporated eg grab bars sinks faucets paper dispensers shelves and towel racks were not present the further evaluation of antimicrobial copper surfaces is warranted beyond the medical icu to include but not be limited to the effect of inherently antimicrobial materials in general wards where patients have greater interaction with other objects in the built environment similarly investigations should also be conducted in emergency and recovery rooms in hospital rehabilitation units pediatric and neonatal units dialysis centers burn units transplant units and cancer centers with immune-compromised patients at issue is the central theme that antimicrobial copper surfaces continuously and passively limit the concentration of bacteria within the built environment salgado and colleagues were able to demonstrate that infections were correlated with burden thus other healthcare environments that may arguably receive less day-to-day hygienic oversight than hospital patient rooms such as visiting area long-term care facilities long-term rehab centers outpatient clinics and elder care facilities should also be investigated as they too may directly benefit from the antimicrobial activity of copperthe study of pathogen transmission in the hospital and the impact of colonization and infection with nosocomial organisms have established the epidemiologic importance of the environmental microbial burden associated with the built clinical environment these studies have outlined the complexity of this concept and have led to robust recommendations for infection prevention that have undoubtedly prevented undo morbidity and mortality however with renewed interest and study the risk contribution provided by the built environment towards patient care warrants a better understanding of the dynamics of colonization and infection through our discussion here we hope that we have been able to identify potential avenues for improvement with adjunctive use of newer technologies these include the use of uv light and hpv disinfection and the potential value of the use of solid antimicrobial copper surfacesthrough a multifaceted and continuously active mechanism of action solid copper surfaces placed in key locations within the patient room can significantly reduce the overall microbial burden have demonstrated their ability to continuously maintain this concentration at a level representing a minimal risk for hai acquisition and most importantly have translated meaningful benefit to patients by their association with significant reduction of hai further study to identify the optimal amount of copper surfaces needed as well as the optimal placement in rooms and areas within healthcare facilities is necessary to fully understand the potential impactin spite of many decades of studies on experimental fipv infection there is very little information on how the virus and host interact over an entire disease course many experimental fipv infection studies have also been limited to the final disease outcome eg the testing of vaccine candidates for efficacy or testing of various types and biotypes of feline coronavirus isolates for disease potential pedersen 2009 pedersen 2014a still other experimental studies have concentrated on specific virus- or host-related inflammatory or immune responses also measured mainly in terminally ill cats pedersen 2014a there are several longitudinal studies which have followed the entire disease course but these studies were concerned mainly with disease signs such as fever antibody responses and cytokine expression and not with viral loads in various tissues pedersen and boyle 1980 weiss and scott 1981 gunn-moore et al 1998a only one other temporal study has been performed on fipv levels in peripheral blood of experimentally infected cats de groot-mijnes et al 2005 although the authors suggested that there was a significant viremia associated with disease viremia was erratic observed mainly at week one post-infection and terminally and the levels of viral genomic rna even when detected were never highthere has been a long standing belief that fipv is not shed from the body at least to the very high levels seen in fecv infection or in an infectious form pedersen et al 2009 fipv does not appear to replicate in enterocytes chang et al 2010 pedersen et al 2012 and was first associated with macrophages by electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry ward 1970 pedersen and boyle 1980 dean et al 2003 studied the distribution of fipv by immunofluorescence at the time of death in experimentally infected cats and also found macrophages to be heavily infected in mediastinal and mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen with much less evidence of infection in peripheral tissues such as popliteal and cervical lymph nodes and bone marrowlymphopenia is a consistent feature of both naturally pedersen 2009 pedersen 2014b and experimentally induced-fip dean et al 2003 de groot-mijnes et al 2005 the role of lymphopenia in fip has not been determined but it has been equated with a decrease in cellular immunity and ultimate disease outcome in experimental infections de groot-mijnes et al 2005 vermeulen et al 2013 although lymphopenia appears to play a role in fip temporal studies on the appearance magnitude and duration of lymphopenia in cats that succumb or survive experimental infection have not been reported most cell counts have been taken prior to infection and terminallythe emphasis of fip diagnostics has long been on developing a simple blood test that would reliably and specifically detect the causative virus pedersen 2014b herrewegh et al 1995 reported on the detection of viral rna in blood serum or plasma of cats experimentally and naturally infected with fipv using a nested rt-pcr that amplified a sequence within the 3-utr that was highly conserved among 10 different fipv and fecv isolates they were able to detect feline coronavirus rna in the serum plasma or ascitic fluid of 1418 cats with naturally occurring fip unfortunately they were also able to detect viral rna in the plasma of 27 healthy cats that were concurrently shedding fecv in their feces an attempt was made to eliminate this problem of specificity by developing an rt-pcr that would only measure forms of coronavirus mrna that were replication competent simons et al 2005 the rationale was that fecv would not replicate in the blood therefore the replicative form of genomic rna would only be found in the blood of cats with fip the authors reported that this test was highly accurate in identifying cats with fip shortly thereafter additional studies using the same assay demonstrated replicating forms of rna in the blood of healthy cats infected with fecv can-sahna et al 2007 kipar et al 2010 casting doubts on the specificity of such tests the ability of fecv to replicate in blood monocytemacrophages was also reported by other groups vogel et al 2010 chang et al 2012 subsequently identified two specific mutations within the fusion peptide of the spike protein of fipvs that were not present in parent fecvs these would seem to be logical mutations to incorporate into a rt-qpcr however a more recent study by porter et al 2014 demonstrated the presence of coronavirus with the fipv-specific fusion peptide mutation in tissues of healthy cats they concluded that the spike fusion region specific mutation was an adaptation of fecv for growth in blood monocytemacrophages and not directly related to disease however all of these various tests and objections are moot if fipv genomic rna is not consistently present in detectable levels by rt-qpcr in blood or blood fractions in cats with fipthe goal of this study was to temporally correlate disease signs in experimental fipv infection with lymphopenia antibody response and viremia with disease outcome death or survival and specific cell and organ localization of virus in terminal tissue samples by rt-qpcr and immunohistochemistry we will show that lymphopenia is the strongest predictor of disease outcome virus is strongly associated with macrophages in lesional tissues and effusions and viremia is not detectable at any stage of the infection even using a highly sensitive rt-qpcrspecific pathogen free cats were bred in the facilities of the feline research laboratory frl center for companion animal health uc davis under iacuc 16989 cats used in this study were part of a larger experiment concerned with natural immunity pedersen et al 2014 and were 69 months of age and equally intact male and female they were housed in the frl and cared for by frl staff under ultimate authority of the campus veterinary servicescats were infected with a cat-passaged type i field isolate of fipv fipv-m3c-2 pedersen et al 2009 which has a functional mutation in the 3c gene and would not be expected to actively replicate in the intestinal epithelium chang et al 2010 pedersen et al 2012 the inoculum was prepared as a cell-free suspension of diseased omentum starting at 25 g100 ml that underwent differential centrifugation to remove particulate matter bacteria and subcellular debris and then stored at 60 c it was diluted 180 in hanks buffered saline prior to use and two ml was injected intraperitoneally to infect each cat the final inoculate contained 432  105 viral genomes as determined by rt-qpcr cats were infected under iacuc protocol 16637 and monitored for disease signs and euthanatized when their disease status was deemed clinically terminal usually within 24 weeks of infectionblood samples were taken at weekly intervals and a gross necropsy performed at the time of death blood and tissue samples were harvested and archived for this and future studieswhole blood was diluted 110

performed as described above with the following modifications primary antibody dilution 1100 and no antigen retrieval step virally infected fcwf-4 cells atcc and uninfected cells were used as positive and negative controlsfipv genomic rna was detected using a rt-qpcr directed to a region of the accessory 7b gene according to a published procedure gut et al 1999 rna integrity and quantity was assessed in parallel with an 18s rrna based real-time pcr test the specificity of the fluorogenic rt-pcr was confirmed by sequencing the plasmid pt7-stfcov by the chain termination method microsynth balgach switzerland the real-time pcr was run with three contamination controls including regular negative controls negative extraction controls and laboratory monitoring for the absence of random positive pcr signals to eliminate pcr product carry over all reactions included the amperase ung system pang et al 1992 absence of pcr inhibition is confirmed by using a spike-in internal positive control this procedure was reportedly 10100 times more sensitive in detecting fipv mrna than that achieved with a nested rt-pcr that was described earlier herrewegh et al 1995 the sensitivity of the assay plotting cycle threshold ct values against fipv genomic rna copy numbers is shown in fig 1
 at 40 cycles considered the upper limit of meaningful amplification for rt-qpcr the assay was capable of detecting 1000 mrna copiesml of fluid or g of tissuethe first clinical sign of disease was observed at around 2 weeks post-infection and consisted of a fever ranging from 303 c to 409 c in 18 of the 20 cats fig 2
 a more undulating fever was observed in one other cat 31 starting at around 2 weeks post-infection but it did not become persistent until week 6 a final cat 26 was febrile 395 c only on day 19 the onset of fever was followed by increasing inappetance jaundice bilirubinuria hyperbilirubinemia and abdominal effusion in 19 of the 20 cats the one surviving cat demonstrated no clinical signs of disease in accordance with the iacuc protocol 18 cats were euthanatized at post-infection days 1428 one cat 31 survived until week 6 and one cat 26 showed no clinical signs of disease through week 6 and has remained healthy up to the time of this submission 7 months table 1
diarrhea of a moderate to severe nature was noticed pre-mortem in the litterboxes of some of the cats usually beginning 23 weeks post-infection diarrheic non-odorous bile-tinged stool with excess gas and mucus was identified in both the small and large intestine in 1119 cats at necropsy feces from the remaining cats were of normal form and consistencyfeline coronavirus-specific antibodies as measured by ifa appeared in the serum between 2 and 3 weeks post-infection and rose to terminal titers of 11001400 or higher fig 3
 the appearance of antibodies in the serum correlated with the onset of disease signs fig 2 fig 3the total white blood cell count decreased somewhat over the 26 week observation period in the 19 cats that developed fip fig 4
 a profound lymphopenia occurred starting at around 24 weeks post-infection and correlated with the disease course fig 4 the earlier lymphopenia occurred post-infection the more rapid the disease course the one cat p31 that survived 6 weeks did not become severely lymphopenic until after week 4 while the one surviving cat p26 never became lymphopenic fig 5
 gross bilirubinuria and jaundice correlated with disease course appearing earlier in cats with more rapid diseasea diffuse peritonitis with effusion of 30300 ml of viscid yellow-tinged cloudy fluid was present at necropsy the omentum and gastro-splenic mesentery manifested severe vascular congestion edema and serous atrophy of fat fig 6
 intestinal mesenteries abdominal serosa and capsular surfaces of abdominal organs were less severely affected surface orientated plaques 1 to several mm in size were a characteristic feature of the inflammation fig 6 fibrin tags were free in the abdomen and common on the spleen and liver margins the spleen caecum and caecal-colicmesenteric lymph nodes were frequently enlarged the liver appeared grossly normal below the capsule in all but two affected cats which demonstrated 051 mm whitish foci throughout the parenchyma the kidneys were not grossly involved below the level of the capsule the lungs heart and other thoracic tissues appeared normal in 1519 cats necropsied the remaining four cats had signs of mediastinitis with enlargement of the sternal lymph nodes the pericardium was thickened with an increased amount of pericardial fluid in two of these cats the popliteal lymph nodes were normal in size and appearancehistologic lesions were common to all of the cats and included pyogranulomatous vasculitis of the omentum fig 7
 mesentery visceral peritoneal surface of the spleen liver mesenteric lymph node caecum and ileum predominantly histocytic neutrophilic and fibrinous peritonitis serous atrophy of omental fat fig 7 subcapsular splenic histiocytosis splenic neutrophilia and ellipsoid hyperplasia abnormalities not uniformly observed in all cats included pyogranulomatous lymphadentitis and necrosis in the mesenteric lymph nodes and caecal and ileal peyers patches pyogranulomatous vasculitis of the caecal and ileal wall with associated local peritonitis lymphoid hyperplasia of mesenteric lymph nodes and pyogranulomatous hepatitis the lungs and heart with the exception of the pericardium and mediastinum in several cats appeared to be unaffected by gross examination no gross or clinical signs of ocular or neurologic disease were observed and tissues from these organs were therefore not studiedimmunohistochemistry for feline coronavirus antigen cd18 and cd3 were performed on these same tissues from two of the 19 cats immunoperoxidase staining demonstrated the presence of cell-associated feline coronavirus antigen within pyogranulomas and on the peritoneal surface fig 8
 pyogranulomas contained a predominance of cells staining strongly positive for cd18 a characteristic of macrophages fig 9
 and lower proportions of cd3 positive t-lymphocytes and typical neutrophils fig 10
 viral antigen was found exclusively in the large foamy macrophage-like cells fig 11
 enterocytes of the caecum and ileum were uniformly negative for feline coronavirus antigen while cells in the inflammatory reaction on the serosal surface stained positive fig 12
in order to confirm that fipv was replicating exclusively in macrophages cells positive for the cd11b cell surface marker were isolated from the ascites fluid of one of the cats both neutrophils and macrophages were isolated in pure form as expected given that cd11b is present on the surface membranes of both cell types positive staining for fipv antigen was limited to the large mononuclear cell population while neutrophils did not stain fig 13
fipv genomic rna expressed as viral copies was detected at high levels only in inflamed organs and effusion while tissues from organs that did not appear to be grossly and histologically involved in the disease process frequently tested negative or were positive at much lower levels fig 14 fig 15
 fipv genomic rna could not be detected from an identical set of tissues from two healthy cats data not shown the highest fipv genomic rna levels were in omentum mesenteric lymph nodes spleen and ascites while low to negative levels were found in the kidney lung heart muscle and popliteal lymph node viral genomic rna was detected at variable levels in the liver and feces fig 14 although diarrheic stool had ct values ranging from 275 to 400 394  106 to 357  102 fipv genomesg and normal appearing stool 3340 887  104 to 357  102 fipv genomesg the respective mean ct values were 348 and 343 indicating a lack of relationship between fecal virus shedding and diarrhea fipv genomic rna was not detected in a 6-week fecal sample taken from the single surviving cat a high level of viral genomic rna was detected in the ascitic fluid and over 9099 10 to 100-fold greater was cell-associated rather than in the supernatant fig 15fipv genomic rna levels in whole blood white cell fraction and plasma collected prior to any feline coronavirus exposure had ct values ranging from 37 to 400 table 1 therefore only ct values 37 were considered to be reliably positive for bloodthe clinical abnormalities complete blood count changes feline coronavirus antibody responses and gross and histologic pathology were typical of experimentally induced and naturally occurring effusive abdominal fip the first sign of disease was fever appearing around 2 weeks post-infection followed by the more specific clinical signs of effusive abdominal fip the occurrence of fever coincided with the appearance of serum antibodies as has been previously shown pedersen and boyle 1980 weiss and scott 1981 there was no relationship between the magnitude of the antibody response and disease outcome with the highest titer being found in one cat that lived 6 weeks before succumbing the relationship between the onset of disease signs and appearance of antibodies was not coincidental previous studies have shown that virus neutralizing antibodies to s gene epitopes play a key role in enhancing disease by facilitating the uptake of fipv by macrophages hohdatsu et al 1998 dewerchin et al 2006 and participating in antigenantibodycomplement mediated vasculitis pedersen and boyle 1980 jacobse-geels et al 1982 antibody-dependent enhancement involving antibodies against s gene proteins has also been shown to play a role in sars coronavirus infection wang et al 2014the absolute lymphocyte count in blood was the most accurate predictor of disease outcome the one surviving cat p26 never manifested lymphopenia while a second cat p31 that survived for 6 weeks maintained near normal lymphocyte numbers until the last week of life in contrast the 18 cats that died within 4 weeks of infection demonstrated a precipitous drop in blood lymphocytes starting at 2 weeks post-infection a similarly profound decrease in blood lymphocytes has been previously associated with disease signs in experimental fipv infection dean et al 2003 and varying degrees of lymphopenia are a common feature of naturally occurring fip pedersen 2009 although t lymphocytes were entering diseased tissues their proportion was low compared to macrophages and their numbers not appear sufficient to be solely responsible for the pronounced lymphopenia previous studies have associated lymphopenia in cats with experimentally induced fip with a major apoptotic event dean et al 2003 apoptosis of lymphocytes has been implicated as a cause of lymphopenia and associated immunodeficiency in other virus infections razvi and welsh 1993our finding that disease outcome in experimental fip infection is associated with the degree of lymphopenia is in agreement with a conclusion made by de groot-mijnes et al 2005 who studied experimental disease caused by the highly virulent type ii fipv-70-1146  our combined observations suggest a model for fip pathogenesis in which virus-induced t-cell depletion and the antiviral t-cell response are opposing forces and in which the efficacy of early t-cell responses critically determines the outcome of the infection this conclusion has been mirrored by fan et al 2014 who postulated that depending on intensity of the apoptosis of healthy cells the apoptosis can either promote or comfort the long-term evolution of hiv infectionwe did not determine the lymphocyte subclasses that were most affected although the severity of the lymphocyte depletion suggested that both t and b subsets were involved however previous studies indicate that t cells nk cells and t regs are most severely reduced in cats with naturally and experimentally induced fip dean et al 2003 vermeulen et al 2013fecal levels of viral genomic rna were low compared to what has been seen during primary infection with a field strain of fecv pedersen et al 2008 fecal virus in these fipv infected cats ranged from around 1000 to 100000 genomic rna copies per gram of feces far below levels detected in a single fecal swab during primary fecv infection pedersen et al 2008 although we did not determine the source of the fecal virus in these fipv infected cats it did not appear to be from enterocytesimmunohistochemistry failed to show infected enterocytes in either the ileum or caecum sites of known virus replication during acute fecv infection pedersen et al 1981 meli et al 2004 moreover enterocyte infection was not expected in these cats because the fipv isolate used in this study had a truncated 3c gene and such mutants appear to have lost their ability to replicate in the intestinal epithelium chang et al 2010 pedersen et al 2012 the viral rna detected in feces was more likely to be a product of the intense inflammation that often involved the serosal surface of the intestines and often extended deeper into the intestinal wall in organs such as the ileum caecum and colon this conclusion was supported by the lack of fecal virus shedding in the one cat that never showed signs of diseasethe most significant findings in this study involved the relative paucity of viral genomic rna detected in blood over the course of the infection and terminally in various tissues which has direct implications on the use of rt-qpcr for diagnosing fip from blood it was not surprising to find high levels of virus terminally in grossly diseased tissues such as omentum spleen and mesenteric lymph node and in abdominal effusions and lower levels in organs such as liver kidney heart and lung that did not show gross parenchymal involvement the levels of viral genomic rna paralleled the intensity of the inflammatory response which in turn paralleled the numbers of infected macrophages in the tissues or effusion the selective targeting of macrophages by fipv which has been previously demonstrated pedersen and boyle 1980 kipar et al 1998 was reconfirmed by immunohistochemistry of heavily involved tissues such as the omentum spleen mesenteric lymph nodes and caecum and ascitic fluid cells present in the ascitic fluid which were predominantly macrophages contained from 90 to 99 of the virus present in the each sample the most parsimonious scenario would be that virus released from infected macrophages is immediately taken up by other macrophages and that this cycle builds in intensity over time as more and more virus is produced and more and more macrophages either arrive from the blood as monocytes or proliferate locally from adventitial progenitors psaltis et al 2014 the strict containment of an infectious agent in a single cell type such as macrophages is reminiscent of fastidious mycobacterial diseases of cats malik et al 2013 and tuberculosis of humans mehrotra et al 2014although we failed to reliably detect coronavirus genomic rna in blood at any stage of experimental infection with a field strain of type i fipv others have reported a viremia using an identical rt-qpcr procedure gut et al 1999 however closer examination of these studies indicates that detection of feline coronavirus genomic rna has not been as clear-cut as assumed mainly because detection is often at or beyond the limits of reliability for the assay procedure three studies reported on the detection of feline coronavirus rna in blood but all were concerned with fecv rather than fipv infection and detection was inconsistent meli et al 2004 kipar et al 2010 vogel et al 2010 kipar et al 2001 kipar et al 2006 compared virus loads in various tissues excluding blood in naturally infected cats and indicated that virus loads were higher in fipv than fecv infected cats gunn-moore et al 1998b used rt-pcr to detect fipv genomic rna in whole blood or plasma of 8090 cats with fip both directly and after co-cultivation with wfe cells plasma was just as likely to test positive as whole blood however they also found that 8389 of healthy cats from fecv enzootic households also tested positive de groot-mijnes et al 2005 described a viremic phase in a subset of cats with fip but virus loads were derived from rt-qpcr and rt-pcr data as well as other data not shown moreover virus levels where elevated usually at week one and terminally and were usually associated with ct values from 36 to 40 we conclude that viremia even in cats with highly fulminant experimentally induced fip is either non-existent or below the reliable detection limits of highly sensitive rt-qpcr at all stages of the infection virus detection should concentrate on tissues and effusions containing fipv infected macrophagesthe history of the genus homo and the dozen human species we know of today through archaeological excavation was determined by the fight against infectious diseases it is likely that the species that are no longer around today are largely extinct due to the spread of infectious diseases 1 we should be happy that we no longer live in the times of great epidemics and pandemics that once decimated our species a huge number of people died during their childhood or youth 1the most severe mediaeval infections killed up to every third person before the discovery of the microscope people could not even know why it was happening to them no one thought that tiny invisible living microbes could cause these diseases people assumed that some heavenly punishment for their sins had come upon them we should therefore be grateful that we are living in the age of this advancement of science and medicine 1since 1940 many bacterial diseases have begun to be controlled by antibiotics and since 1960 many viral and bacterial diseases have had vaccines developed for them 1 unfortunately we do not have a vaccine for all infectious diseases as we see in the example of this pandemic new viruses continue to transfer from other species to us because history has not ended with the advent of our generation instead it just continues but this pandemic certainly does not look like it will decimate usit could have because this is already the seventh coronavirus to try to make itself at home within the human population 2 it is trying to adapt to us and use us as its reservoir specifically we exist together with this virus on a small blue-brown planet in a vast dark universe we share it with tens of millions of other species they all strive to barely survive more than 99of all species that have ever existed on earth have failed to survive to this day 1 that is why viruses constantly transfer themselves to new species and thus expand their reservoirs they must choose the winning species because they cannot reproduce on their own their survival depends on the survival of the species that is their reservoir 3humans are currently an interesting potential viral reservoir we are expanding rapidly in population size  from about a billion-and-a-half individuals we have grown to about seven-and-a-half-billion in the last 130 years alone 1 in doing so we are conquering new territories clearing forests draining wetlands hunting for pleasure and reducing overall biodiversity 1 this is making it increasingly difficult for others to survive while there are more and more of us fortunately for us all the first four human-adapted coronaviruses were merely the cause of common colds 2 no-one considered the four of them a serious threat to public healthsars severe acute respiratory syndrome and mers middle eastern acute respiratory syndrome were a real surprise for scientists and experts these were further respiratory viruses from the coronavirus family the fifth and sixth that managed to infect humans surprisingly instead of colds they were able to cause very severe fatal pneumonia 2 in addition the death rate among those infected with both diseases was truly frightening sars killed one-in-ten infected while mers killed one-in-three both could have caused a horrible amount of human deaths if they spread to the worlds entire population 2the coronavirus that caused sars had its reservoir in bats which hibernate in caves in winter this is the time of the year when hardly anyone hunts or consumes bats however sars managed to infect an animal from the cat family a civet from a civet it was then also contracted by a man a farmer in guangdong province in late 2002 sars then spread to more than twenty countries and infected more than 8000 people with every tenth infected person dying from the disease it was the fifth human coronavirus but it was the first to kill humans 2ten years later in 2012 the mers coronavirus appeared in saudi arabia it was passed on to humans from the camels in the desert it has also spread to more than twenty countries infecting about 2500 people and every third infected person died 2 so both sars and mers had a really scary case-fatality rate the advent of mers showed us that sars was not an isolated incident with a coronavirus that we could just forget about but that coronaviruses have become the most significant potential biological threat to our species if sars or mers had spread around the world and infected billions of people they would have caused a catastrophe unlike any other in the modern history of humansin those two cases we were actually very lucky essentially an entirely new virus that tries to transfer over to the human species can spread among humans in three basic ways each of these three ways informs our strategies for epidemic surveillance and dealing with the epidemic once the virus enters the human body it begins to multiply in the kind of specialised cells that it has the ability to bind to in the case of coronaviruses these are the cells of the respiratory system the virus multiplies in them by hacking their cellular genetic code and using their machinery to build its own proteins 2this multiplication of the virus eventually destroys the infected cells that is the reason for the eventual development of the symptoms that are characteristic of respiratory infections such as a sore throat and cough in the first mode of the spread the virus will jump from the infected person to unaffected people only after the onset of those symptomssuch an epidemic is the easiest to control and contain that is because the sick person is soon confined to bed and no longer leaves home therefore the virus can mainly spread to their household members this also makes it relatively easy to identify everyone who was in contact with the person after the onset of symptoms those people can then be placed in isolation quite easily we were fortunate that both sars and mers spread to other people only after the onset of the symptoms of the disease this is why we were able to suppress the epidemics by isolating those infected and all their contacts after the onset of the symptoms this is quite likely the most important reason why sars and mers did not manage to kill remarkably large number of people 2it is much more difficult to contain an epidemic if the virus spreads from infected to healthy people during the period of the so-called incubation this period lasts from the entry of the virus into the body until the onset of the first symptoms 3 in such case infected persons can transmit the virus by contact to a significantly larger number of people in the days before they get any symptoms that seems to be the situation with this new covid-19 pandemic but even then it is at least possible for every new patient to determine from whom they contracted the infection namely all newly diagnosed cases had to meet an existing and known case in the pastthis allows epidemiologists to follow the entire chain of movement of the virus from person to person due to this favourable circumstance intensive isolation measures of all those who were in contact with those already infected can significantly slow down the spread of the virus this was done in wuhan that is why test-trace-isolate as the first line of defence and quarantines as the ultimate response both represent a justified containment strategy when people are infectious for others during incubation period both approaches will slow down and contain the epidemic if applied properlya nightmare scenario for any epidemiologist however is a third possibility for the virus to spread in such a variant people become infected and transmit the virus but they themselves never show any symptoms scientists are currently looking for such possible spreads of contagion with this new covid-19 pandemic that is the reason why such possible persons are occasionally mentioned in the media in high-profile articlesnamely because of such infected people cases are beginning to emerge among the population that cannot be linked to any of the already infected people when people are circulating in the population without symptoms but passing the virus on to others it is very difficult for epidemiologists to do anything to prevent it from spreading among all humans such an epidemic has the potential to spread over time mainly due to such transmitters or carriers who show no symptomswhen something has happened six times within a system that is as complex as the earths ecosystem then it is no surprise that it would also happen for the seventh time another coronavirus is now trying to make itself at home in the human species in this case the primary reservoirs were probably bats again we know this because the genetic sequence of this new coronavirus coincides with that found in hibernating bats in about 96 percent 4 this time instead of a civet a smaller mammal or bird has probably served as coronavirus so-called transitional reservoirit is possible that it was a pangolin because in one of them a coronavirus that matched to the human form by as much as 99 of the sequence was found although this is not completely definite either 5 sequence matching is not the only important factor when it comes to viral jump from animals to humans what is also important is how many individuals in the species that serve as a transitional reservoir are infected and how often the species comes into contact with humans sometimes these factors are more important so they can bridge the gap of 2-3 of the difference in genome sequence because pangolins are a protected species and cannot be eatenthus in the chinese province of hubei in the city of wuhan which has a population of eleven million at around the end of 2019 the number of patients with an unusual and very dangerous type of pneumonia began to increase many of them had in common that they visited a particular fish market it was soon discovered that this infectious disease was spreading very quickly each infected person managed to further infect as many as two to three people such a degree of infectivity is quite high and leads to rapid growth of the epidemic we had the misfortune that the disease caused by the 7th coronavirus  covid-19  apparently manages to spread even during the incubation period possibly even by touchthis incubation period lasts about five days on average it would be very tricky if it lasted longer because the novel coronavirus would then have more time to spread from an already infected person to others however an incubation period of up to two weeks is not entirely unusual even rare cases who had incubation period of up to four weeks seem to be possible during some of this time the infected person can spread the virus before the onset of their first symptoms if there are infected people who do not develop symptoms it will be really difficult to contain this pandemic until we develop a vaccine in conclusion infectivity ie the ability to move from the infected to the uninfected seems to be significantly higher in covid-19 than it was with sars and mers as a trade-off we now know that the covid-19 case-fatality rate is significantly lower than that of sars and mersin order to answer this rather complicated question it must first be said that nowadays the registered number of infected persons and the number of deaths can be monitored online 6 when the number of deaths was divided by the confirmed and registered number of infected people at the beginning of the pandemic a figure of about 2 would be obtained 6 from this alone one could apparently conclude that  given that this is an entirely new coronavirus and nobody is immune to it  it will necessarily spread throughout the world and infect us all if it kills 2 percent of all people then it follows that out of a total of 75 billion people about 150 million will necessarily die it is difficult for anyone who is not a specialist in this field to understand how such an outcome can now be prevented because a vaccine against this virus does not yet exist nor do medicinesthe question of the case-fatality rate among those infected with covid-19 exposed a general lack of epidemiological knowledge among the general public and in the media from the very beginning of this pandemic there were people who claimed that the new coronavirus was a disease milder than even the flu but also those who believed it was significantly more dangerous in recent days this issue has finally caught the attention of all the worlds media as the world health organisation reported that about 34 of those infected with coronavirus have died 7 that sounded terrifying to the media and the publicbut then the president of the usa mr donald trump also made a public statement saying the number released by the who was wrong he said that hed talked to people who knew something about it and that his impression was that the number was certainly below 1 if not significantly less 8 in my guest appearance on sunday at 2 an influential croatian tv programme on march 1st i made an estimate of the case-fatality rate of 05-1 allowing for the possibility that it could even be smaller 9 namely at this point we do not properly distinguish infection-fatality rate from case-fatality rate so once that insights into seroprevalence become available they may even bring this estimate further downhowever both president trump and who are actually right each in their own way which shows best how difficult it is for many people to keep track of what is really going on because of their lack of knowledge of the epidemiologyin the beginning of every epidemic of a new virus the virus has to jump over from animals to humans and then from humans to humans that can be quite difficult therefore the virus will be more likely to successfully infect those with a weakened immune system who will find it more difficult to reject it because of this the first patients are often people who are either older or already have some underlying illnesses that make them more vulnerable they end up in a hospital where at that point no one suspects that pneumonia that they are experiencing may have an epidemic potentialthen they infect other hospital patients and some health care professionals the latter can then spread the disease to other patients in the hospital  mainly to those most susceptible such as those ailing or immunocompromised treated for serious illnesses or the elderly this is the reason why the case-fatality rate among all covid-19 patients was initially very high in wuhan and later in italy many people died of covid-19 infections in hospitals and they were mostly very old and sick people 10in the meantime the virus has started to spread among the general population  in the community and outside of hospitals it has infected many people who are otherwise healthy and had a much better immune response a large number of these people would have thought that they had a cold or the flu and perhaps even a more severe flu they were just resting at home and letting those respiratory infections run their course considering that it was flu season in wuhan at the time of the outbreak and the media reported that a strange epidemic was causing many deaths in wuhans hospitals it is quite likely that many wuhan residents who were infected with the coronavirus stayed home and treated themselvesfew people would choose to go to the hospital to test whether their flu-like symptoms were caused by the novel coronavirus when a deadly epidemic was spreading there only the few who have struggled with fevers and symptoms for more than eight or nine days sought help from wuhan hospitals in china there is typically no primary health care and family medicine as we know it but there are large hospitals in their huge cities where patients report directly that is the most likely explanation as to why the case-fatality rate among patients at wuhan hospitals at the beginning of the epidemic was so frighteningly highit is not the epidemic seemed even more dangerous at first as it created a great deal of pressure on hospital intensive care units which were unprepared for this infection as a result all severely ill patients could not receive intensive care this further increased the case-fatality rate at the beginning of the epidemic that is why the chinese have started building the two new hospitals they wanted to ensure a sufficient capacity to provide intensive care also they needed to move all those infected with covid-19 away from other seriously ill people who were sick from other diseases and at the highest risk of dying if they became infectedbased on this it should be understood that the total number of those infected with covid-19 in wuhan could have been much higher than what was confirmed by their health statistics specifically only those with coronaviruses who were eventually admitted to the hospital were confirmed to be infected and were tested for the new virus there they are by no means representative of all those infected with the new coronavirus in wuhantherefore the early estimates of case-fatality rates in wuhan cannot be extrapolated even to all those with confirmed coronavirus infection in wuhan let alone would they be representative of the entire population of wuhan for those reasons it is wrong to look at the number of deaths and the number of confirmed infected cases and divide those two numbers and draw any conclusions 11if all the reported deaths are divided by the total number of people with confirmed infection then both the numerator and the denominator are wrong when it comes to calculating the actual case-fatality rate even deaths in the numerator would be wrong this is because we monitor the confirmed infected and those who have died in real time a great many infected people have not even had a chance to either recover or die so the number of deaths in the numerator is an underestimatesome of the people who are presently in intensive care are expected to die in several days weeks maybe even months this is why the number of deaths that corresponds to the number presently infected will inevitably increase over time therefore some future number of deaths as the numerator will increasingly correspond to the current number of registered infected persons as the denominator as a result the case-fatality rate of deaths among those with confirmed infection will then no longer be 2 or 3 percent but it may increase quite considerably over time  perhaps to 6-7 percent or even moretherefore to simply say that about 34 of those confirmed to have been infected so far have died is not really wrong in itself which is what the world health organisation did but it missed explaining that this case-fatality rate among confirmed infected people is quite unrepresentative of the mortality rate among all those who were infected 11 the true rate should be much lower it would not surprise me as an epidemiologist if it is up to ten times smaller perhaps even more 11 depending on the actual true number of infected people which should be used as a denominator this could ultimately make covid-19 a less deadly disease even than the common flugiven that the virus is new and unknown this is a key question unfortunately the possibility that this virus is quite different from other known viruses must also be allowed it may be that the case-fatality rate among confirmed infected people is only 3 to 5 times higher than the infection-fatality rate ie the number of deaths among all infected people so it may not be ten or thirty times higher as many epidemiologists would expect the only thing we can be reasonably sure of is that the number of confirmed infected people was not equal to the number of all infected people in wuhan the current global totals of confirmed infected and fatalities for covid-19 are still largely determined by what happened in wuhan at the beginning of the epidemic this is because about two-thirds of cases worldwide still originate in wuhan to this day 6that is why i have already explained on sunday at 2 tv programme that the case-fatality rate among those who were confirmed to be infected is not so important it is only a subset of the patients with the most severe symptoms we need to find out what is the case-fatality rate among all infected people however no one can know that at this time because a random sample of at least 100 000 wuhan residents would need to be tested for this then the presence of antibodies against coronaviruses should be detected this is how we measure seroprevalence 3this would allow us to estimate the number of people in wuhan who got over the infection with the novel coronavirus without ever seeing a doctor so far no one has conducted these studies because the health system was preoccupied with diagnosing and treating the epidemic of covid-19 in hospitals and struggled with it it is now understood that during some days of the wuhan outbreak there were not enough tests for all those who reported to hospitals with symptomshowever additional lines of evidence are beginning to emerge the first is the report of an international panel of experts who visited china 12 they looked at the cases across china that were reported after february the 1st at this point the identification of those infected was significantly improved also hospitals were better prepared for the epidemic case-fatality rate of all cases that came under health surveillance and were tested dropped to about 07 12for anyone who may remain skeptical of chinas data the first reports have recently been provided by south korean authorities that country has really led by example in proactively testing people seeking out all those infected and their contacts isolating them and treating them in their analyses to date case-fatality rate of all infected people has been slightly above 06 13 both of those estimates could still increase albeit not substantially if they also included those who will likely die over time and are currently counted as infected still at such a low case-fatality rate there should not be many additional deaths in fact it is more likely that many infected people remained undiagnosed and that the case-fatality rate is actually even lower 11another interesting recent new source is the study of more than 1000 hospitalized covid-19 patients who were followed up until the very end of the infection this sample has been collected from more than 500 chinese hospitals and the result was published recently in a leading medical journal 14 this analysis quoted their overall case-fatality rate to be about 14 however it did not include all those infected again but rather those who requested hospital treatment 14 therefore it should still be possible that the infection-fatality rate is at least two to three times smaller among all those who were infected with the novel coronavirusthus it appears that data from very different and increasingly reliable sources are starting to converge to the values which i predicted on sunday at 2 tv show on march 1st ie 05-1 because of all of the above president of the usa donald trump was most likely right to say that this number should be closer to 1 and that he believes that it could even be well below 1 8 everything we know about epidemiology and previous pandemics gives us hope that this should be the casethe virus will not succeed in infecting everyone for a number of reasons our first line of defence consists of anti-epidemic measures all those who are experiencing symptoms and may be infected are being tested all their contacts are also tested for the presence of the virus then covid-19 patients and all their contacts are being isolated 15these measures will significantly slow down the spread of the infectious disease and buy us time it is of utmost importance that the number of patients with covid-19 does not increase too quickly when the new cases emerge more slowly the staff of national health care systems will be able to provide quality care to all patients for the more severe cases they will also offer intensive care in the absence of these measures there would be an exponential increase in the number of infected people this number would soon outgrow the capacity of the health system many people within countries are also protected by their geographical dispersion ie many people live in smaller towns and settlements a large number of them will probably never be exposed to an infected personfurthermore as people become infected develop covid-19 and then get well they should become immune to the virus as a result there will be fewer people the virus can still infect at some point the number of susceptible persons that infected people can spread coronavirus to will decrease substantially at some point each infected person will on average pass the virus to less than one susceptible person in time this will eventually limit and stop the epidemic that is the reason we vaccinate even if the virus infects some unvaccinated people it will have very few options for further spread vaccinated people will already be immune to the virus and their bodies will react vigorously if the virus tries to enter 16 many processes in nature are self-limiting in a similar way  forest fires stock market crashes and epidemicsfurthermore the case-fatality rate should not be directly applicable to the entire population of a country to estimate the possible death toll the first reason is that the virus mainly endangers the elderly whose case-fatality rates are much higher young people and children rarely get unwell and their death rates are much much lower this is why age and sex structure of the population can diminish the potential of the virus to cause a very high number of covid-19 casualties if the population is reasonably young 11the situation should be taken seriously and people should be cautious but there is no reason to be overly afraid there is especially no reason to panic many people are afraid of this pandemic because they probably think that we are in a completely unfamiliar situation so anything could happen but it is unlikely that much could happen for which science could not find explanations and answers and the epidemiological services could not respond in a timely manner it is unwise for a serious scientist to try to predict the spread of a completely new and unknown virus to the entire human population in the world let alone to predict more specific outcomes still we have in recent weeks collected enough information about the new covid-19 virus for at least some predictionsif the new coronavirus spreads across any country over time and manages to circumvent the many prevention measures in place the application of anti-epidemic measures should still limit its casualties to make them at least roughly comparable to the deaths from flu or road accidents in the same period this means that some healthy caution is advisable this caution is reasonable as long as it is on the same level as the fear you may feel when sitting in a car and preparing for a longer trip or when you hear on the news that a more severe form of influenza has arrivedbut many are wondering why the novel coronavirus attracts such a level of media attention this is because flu has been a well-known disease for decades it comes back every year and we have experience with its manifestations among many millions of patients worldwide we know how to develop vaccines against flu in advance of its season 16 we have even started to produce the first somewhat effective drugs and offer them on the market 17 unlike the flu the new coronavirus is unknown to us we should remain cautious so that we do not get unpleasantly surprised at the same time the most vulnerable among us who are already seriously ill or very old are not vaccinated as is the case with the flu this is why the new disease covid-19 can kill more easilythis question has constantly been being raised since the beginning because many are looking at various figures without a deeper understanding of their background and are comparing the incomparablefirst of all the general public underestimates how serious and dangerous and serious the flu actually is  especially for the most vulnerable the elderly and those who are already ill globally influenza causes between 250 000 and 650 000 deaths annually depending on the strain of the circulating virus 18 different strains can cause milder or more severe symptoms and the virus mutates each year however we try to protect those most vulnerable before the flu season begins by vaccinating themtherefore the number of deaths from influenza is reduced by preventive health intervention ie vaccination this cannot be done with the spread of covid-19 this is the first reason why the flu seems less dangerous than covid-19 however it may not be much less dangerous inherently especially during seasons when flu is more severe it is just that we protect the most vulnerable in addition flu vaccinations make it more difficult for it to spread among the population because there are fewer options for it to transfer to the uninfected due to the slower spread new cases emerge more slowly and the health care system has time to deal with them properly especially if they require intensive careanother reason is that the number of deaths directly from the flu is several times lower than the number of deaths that are indirectly caused by the flu influenza is often not cited as a direct cause in statistics on the causes of death if it has merely led to the exacerbation of some of the long-present chronic underlying disease these chronic diseases are then cited as the primary cause of death rather than influenza therefore the actual role of influenza in annual mortality is often significantly underestimated it can be several times higher when the causes of death are reclassified at the end of each year based on the increase in deaths from chronic diseases during the flu seasonthe third reason for caution in comparing covid-19 and flu is that we have a much better idea of the total number of people truly infected with the flu than we do about the novel coronavirus this is because influenza is a disease that is typically managed within primary care after which patients are referred to home care only the most serious cases of flu are referred to hospitalthere is an obligation to report the total number of people infected with influenza in the population to the central registry as well as for sick leave this makes the denominator for case-fatality rate of influenza better known to us than we can estimate it for the novel coronavirus covid-19 has so far been diagnosed and treated exclusively in hospitals where severe cases clustered the early estimates of case-fatality rates for covid-19 included patients suffering from hospital outbreaks which affected the elderly the sick and the immunocompromised this is why those case-fatality rates are hardly comparable to a spread that would occur in the general populationfrom all of this it should be concluded that case-fatality rates from influenza as another very dangerous viral disease have been mathematically reduced compared to the current reports of case-fatality rates for coronaviruses for the three reasons i mentioned the first is because we vaccinate those most vulnerable to the flu the second is that health statistics do not assign the majority of flu deaths to influenza but rather to the exacerbations of pre-existing underlying illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases diabetes malignant tumours and others the third is that the denominator we use to calculate case-fatality rates from influenza is much closer to the actual number of those infected while the denominator for coronavirus is not yet known with sufficient certainty from their experience with other respiratory viruses epidemiologists know that all events in hospitals will dramatically over-represent the most vulnerable this is why those case-fatality rates should by no means be applied to the general populationhowever lay members of the public cannot have a good sense of these nuances that is why it is best to avoid comparisons between case-fatality rates for the flu and for the novel coronavirus until we learn more on the seroprevalence of the latter the general public underestimates the risk of influenza for the three reasons mentioned above they are also likely to overestimate the risk of the new coronavirus due to its intense media focus if influenza infections and deaths were monitored in the same way each year the public would realise how dangerous the flu really is and how reasonable it is to be vaccinated against ittherefore it still does not seem possible to me at least at this stage of the pandemic to decisively state which of the two diseases is inherently more dangerous to human beings or which will eventually cause more human deaths in 2020 flu will cause fewer deaths because the most vulnerable will be vaccinated and health statistics will not properly attribute many indirect deaths to flu which really caused them covid-19 in turn will cause fewer deaths due to epidemiological surveillance the prevention of its spread and possible strict quarantine it may also have seasonal characteristics and simply disappear with the arrival of late springwhen we have no other means of defending ourselves against the new virus all we can really do is retreat indoors and prevent the virus from jumping from infected to healthy individuals too quickly people generally do not have an intuitive sense of exponential growth if each newly infected person infects just one more person each day the number of newly infected people will increase from 2 to 16 during the early phase which does not seem like a big increasea little later it will jump to 1024 infected people from 128 over the next three days and that does not sound so terrible either but there will also come four days in which the number of newly infected people will increase from 100 000 to 800 000when china realised that the covid-19 epidemic was out of control and that it already entered this explosive phase the authorities immediately cut off wuhan and then fifteen other cities from the rest of the country in addition the authorities ordered that the population within these cut-off areas stay in their apartments and not leave it was an unprecedented measure in human history  tens of millions of people were quarantined for weeks everything stopped 12however this measure produced excellent results and china could keep its death toll below 5000 although the epidemic caught them unprepared and the virus spread to all chinese provinces a recent report from the world health organisations commission made up of 25 international experts visiting china concluded the followingchinas bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic faced with an unknown virus china has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history 12this may be because on these large ships people are mostly older one should look very closely at the age and gender structure of passengers which would tell us more about the final outcome it is also quite possible that a mutated version of the virus which is somewhat more dangerous could have entered such a pocket such isolated groups can always emerge and the disease may actually run a more severe course there this is possible but not very likely also this case-fatality rate should not be extrapolated to the entire country for the same reasononce the virus begins to spread through the entire human species it will continue to mutate it will try to adapt to humans as quickly as possible according to previous epidemiological experiences many of those mutations should make it less dangerous for human health as this would lead to a better adaptation however some random mutations could make it more dangerous to us this is why we need to be on our guard until we get better acquainted with the virus and the pandemic is over it is unlikely that the novel coronavirus will mutate to become significantly more dangerous than it is now but we will only be able to assert that with certainty when the pandemic is overthese are very difficult questions to answer until we get more quality data from both countries in principle it is possible that the first entry of the virus into a new country may be through an infected person in whom the virus has mutated into a more severe form if all further cases arise from that mutant then the situation in those countries may initially seem more difficult than elsewhere in population genetics this development is known as the so-called founder effect 19 however patterns of spread and case-fatality rates in both countries may also have many different explanationsthe reason why the death toll among infected people in italy appears to be very high is because the disease is spreading in small-town hospitals and elderly care homes which were completely unprepared for the epidemic the elderly and infirm are at much greater risk of dying if they become infectedcase-fatality rates in hospital outbreaks where older sick and immunocompromised people are affected will be much higher than those in the community among younger and healthy people among the first several hundred deaths in italy almost all people were over 60 years of age and had underlying illnesses 20 that is why the case-fatality rate seems so high there but it is not representative of the entire population a harsh flu season would probably have done similar damage if people had not been vaccinated against it but it is also possible that there are many more cases in the population than previously thought because the virus has been spreading for a long time in iran however the situation is unclear so far the most likely explanation too is that there are already significantly more cases of infection among the population than it was thought initiallyif covid-19 proves to be significantly more dangerous than seasonal influenza then one million deaths worldwide could indeed be expected perhaps significantly more unfortunately such a scenario is still possible in principle with a virus that is new and unknown to us for a variety of reasons because of this all experts in the field including myself are constantly urging people to take caution but without the unnecessary panicin which scenarios could the situation become much more difficult first most epidemiologists based on their experience with previous epidemics and pandemics expect the covid-19 case-fatality rate to fall below 1 when the total death toll is divided by a better estimate of the total number of infected people however the virus is new so it is possible in principle for this specific virus that the number of infected individuals who are not confirmed through testing may not be as large as epidemiologists would expect this would come as a surprise to science and would indicate a different nature of this virusthe new coronavirus causing covid-19 is somewhat similar to that caused by sars the sars pathogen however had a much higher case-fatality rate if the total population infected by the novel coronavirus is found to be higher than the registered infected population by only two or three times and not by eg ten times or more then the case-fatality rate of those infected with covid-19 could be significantly higher than the flucombined with the lack of an available vaccine in such a case it would lead to a significantly higher number of deaths than the flu however such an occurrence should still be prevented by measures of isolation of the patients and their contacts as well as by quarantines which are not applied in the case of flu we also hope that with the winter ending and the new seasons arriving seasonality would slow down or completely hinder the further spread of the virusfurthermore the virus could spread to infected people in some of its more dangerous forms as well as in milder forms previous experiences with epidemics have shown that mutation into milder forms is more likely but mutation into more dangerous forms or those that are more easily spread is not impossible either 3 in some countries such a variant would increase the case-fatality rate locally compared to other countries or accelerate infectionthis would put their health systems in a really difficult situation as intensive care units would soon become overburdened with poorer care available case-fatality rate of all those infected would increase further with the likely collapse of part of the health system it is also a very tricky scenario in which many health care professionals would become infected over time in providing care to patients which would make the situation worsetherefore currently perhaps the most important citizens of any country are health care professionals who work in hospitals for infectious diseases especially in their intensive care units they should be protected not only from work overload but also from coronavirus infection by their patients with the increasing number of infected people with severe forms of disease the demand for quality intensive care respirators and ecmo devices for extracorporeal oxygen enrichment will become the bottleneck of the health care system the same is true for healthy and well rested doctors and nurses in these wards those parts of the health system should be amplified and further strengthened before they come under increased pressurethe worst-case scenario imaginable right now is the entry of some more dangerous mutated version of coronavirus into one of the very poor countries in the world with a dysfunctional health system such countries cannot implement satisfactory quality epidemiological surveillance measures then a more dangerous version of the virus would likely infect a larger percentage of the countrys population relatively quickly panic would ensue probably also a black market for the transport of migrants to other countries then a more severe variant of covid-19 would start to expand uncontrollably and in a whole new wayin the event of any of these unfavourable developments all of which are unfortunately possible though not likely an entirely new protection strategy would be required each country will have its own approach when the death toll in each of the affected countries begins to rise so much as to cause fear among the population people will become increasingly willing to undertake much stricter epidemiological measures in such a case an increasing number of countries will resort to a solution that has proven effective in wuhan  ie declaring large very strict quarantines it is essential to buy time in such quarantines so that health systems do not become overburdened we should then anticipate the end of winter and hope that there would be evidence of possible seasonality of this virus it may then begin to spread in a weakened manner or disappear altogether at least until next winterthere are at least several reasons for optimism first of all epidemiological surveillance and first lines of defence are currently in place throughout the european union if they work well in most countries it is possible that their outbreaks will be controlled and would not enter a phase of exponential growth in the number of infected cases in the most favourable scenario with this retention this novel coronavirus would show seasonality then it would gradually disappear from circulation among humans with changes in nature characteristic of late spring and summer 3 however this is the most favourable scenario in which the final death toll would be much lower than that already caused by the flu this yearhowever if the front line of defence and epidemiological surveillance is broken through by the virus then governments will resort to strict measures to ban assemblies and organise quarantines as the chinese did several models done in recent weeks indicate that strict quarantine should completely suppress the spread of this coronavirus within up to three months 21 this is exactly what we have already seen in china that is why it seems that one great positive lesson of this pandemic is that humanity today would be able to survive even more dangerous infectious diseases than covid-19 with strict quarantine in which people would remain until scientists developed vaccines in this unusual situation this answer has been revealed to us allfinally the tireless work of numerous scientists currently testing over a hundred drugs against this virus as well as at least eleven experimental vaccines should be noted 22 it is not impossible that some existing medicines may show some effect and be repurposed to treat covid-19 also vaccines should become available over time in this unusual situation emergence of an effective drug or a vaccine could make a sudden and important differencewe should try to find something good in all the bad things that seem to be happening many people may finally realise how dangerous flu is more of them may start getting vaccinated against it each year the flu kills between 250 000 and 650 000 people worldwide 18in china which is one-sixth of the worlds population the death toll from covid-19 could be stopped below 5000 by the wuhan quarantine if all other countries could implement anti-epidemic measures like china then the death toll from covid -19 could be at most six times higher ie up to 30 000 that would be ten times fewer deaths than the total number of deaths caused annually by seasonal influenza unfortunately many countries will not be able to follow chinas example closely and will have uncontrolled outbreaks if the warmer season does not stop the spread of the virusfurthermore if the virus continues to spread throughout 2020 it will demonstrate in a very cruel way how well the leadership and public health systems of individual countries function it will be possible to produce performance charts for each country in controlling this new infectious disease given the population size and age structure these will be very important lessons to learn in preparation for a future pandemic which could be even more dangerousadditionally viruses generally spread by contact this means that it is good to be reminded that hands should be regularly and properly washed during epidemics and touching surfaces that many people touch should be avoided knobs handrails atms shaking hands should also be avoided and we should keep at least two steps away from people who have symptoms of respiratory infections it is also advisable to regularly ventilate all living quarters it is also helpful to strengthen personal immunity with sufficient sleep exercise and good nutritionwe all hope at this point march 7 2020 that there would be very few i explained why it is no surprise that after the previous six coronaviruses the seventh has now also managed to infect humans nor is its spread rate a surprise as there are both more and less infectious respiratory viruses 3 it would be somewhat surprising for epidemiologists if the total number of infected people in the population was not significantly higher than the number of registered infected people in such occurrence case-fatality rate would indeed become significantly higher than that of the flu we should continue to await the information of well-conducted studies on this key questionperhaps the biggest surprises so far have been related to the clinical course of covid-19 rather than its epidemiology for now clinicians in china have reported that registered infected people report to the hospital rather late on average after as many as 9-12 days of home care 23 this may reflect their fear of being admitted to the hospital during an epidemic but it may also be an interesting feature of an illness with slow development in comparison to other respiratory infections furthermore fever does not appear to always accompany other symptoms of the disease in the first few days making it difficult to identify possibly contagious cases by controlling peoples temperatures 23the media has also reported on the possible return of the virus after suffering from the infection in some cases 24 for now it is hard to know how common these cases are and how many exceptions there are it is often wise to rest well after many viral respiratory infections to allow the body to recover after the infection has ended it is unknown whether this infection can return if the immune system has not completely removed the virus from the body but with all new and unknown viruses such surprises are possible so one should be careful until the pandemic is overin all the answers provided in this editorial i endeavoured to convey the most likely scientific explanations for the abundant information that is published about covid-19 in the domestic and international media over time some of the likely scientific explanations may need to be modified in the light of new information one should not forget that this is a new and unknown virus therefore surprises and deviations from the expected scenarios are in principle possible that is why i emphasise that caution is needed but not panic the community of scientists and health experts will continue to closely monitor the further development of the pandemicobviously we need to prepare for a very serious flu-like illness against which no-one will be able to be vaccinated against for quite a while therefore elderly people and those with underlying illnesses should be extremely careful because the infection is the most dangerous for them having gained our first knowledge of covid-19 we now need to concentrate on preventing the spread of the virus and buying time until the arrival of warmer days then we might be lucky enough to see the virus slowly disappearing due to seasonality unfortunately we cannot know that right now from everything written here it should be understood that all measures of active searching and the isolation of affected patients and their contacts are justifiedthese also include bans on gathering together larger groups of people as well as possible quarantine if the epidemic starts to elude epidemiological control particularly older people should be looked after because the probability of a bad outcome increases significantly with age in addition those with heart disease diabetes or undergoing cancer treatment should take special careunlike certain types of nosocomial bacterial and fungal pathogens human pathogenic viruses are not a part of normal body flora but are shed for varying periods only by those infected with them many types of viruses can remain viable for several hours on hands and generally much longer on environmental surfaces8 infectious virus particles have been isolated from naturally contaminated hands of caregivers and fomites5 since hands can donate or receive viruses during casual contact with animate and inanimate surfaces9 proper and regular decontamination of hands by caregivers is crucial in preventing and controlling the spread of viral and other types of pathogen evidence from experimental as well as epidemiological studies indicates that environmental surfaces may also play a role in the nosocomial spread of respiratory and enteric nosocomial viral pathogens8
the capacity of a given virus to spread from host-to-host is determined by among other things its ability to remain viable during transit to the susceptible host virus shedding generally begins prior to the onset of clinical symptoms and lasts for several days after recovery chronic cases of hepatitis b for example can be life-long sources of the virus the actual amount of virus discharge varies considerably depending on the type of infecting agent and the stage of the infectionthe extent of virus survival on a surface or object is the key to its potential to act as a source of the virus the most important contribution to survival is perhaps the protection afforded to the virus by the fluid in which it is discharged virus survival in the environment in general is inversely proportional to air temperature relative humidity rh also has a pronounced effect on virus survival and its effect is modulated by air temperature enveloped viruses usually survive better in dryer conditions and lower rh than can be tolerated by non-enveloped viruses8 10
apart from direct contamination both animate and inanimate surfaces can become contaminated indirectly through transfer of virus from other vehicles figure 1 of these deposition by settling of virus-containing aerosols or contact with contaminated fluids are obvious less obvious are the transfers which may occur between different types of surfaces our laboratory-based studies on rotavirus transfer between animate-inanimate animate-animate and inanimate-animate surfaces have shown that virus transfer a readily occurs irrespective of the nature of donor and recipient surfaces b was reduced with increase in the age of the inoculum most likely due to greater loss of moisture c was directly proportional to the amount of pressure applied during contact and d increased substantially when friction was applied during contact11

figure 2
illustrates the many applications of microbicides in hospitals for controlling the environmental spread of pathogens including viruses the use of such chemicals in infection control in general operates on the basic premise that the risk of acquiring a given infection is directly proportional to the amount of its causative agent in the vicinity and that proper use of microbicides lowers this risk by reducing the pathogen load microbicides can also interrupt pathogen transfer from contaminated to clean surfaces in hospitals viruses which lend themselves to interruption by proper microbicide use are those which spread mainly through hands fomites medical devices and environmental surfacesa major difficulty in halting virus transmission in hospitals is that most virus-infected individuals remain free of obvious disease symptoms and such silent cases generally are unrecognized while discharging viruses into their surroundings viruses discharged by them could cause serious disease in others particularly those who are debilitated due to immunosuppression or other causes most hospitals have a pool of such highly susceptible individuals insufficient numbers of or inconvenient location of sinks and a lack of availability of skin-friendly products discourage compliance with handwashing by caregivers while the use of non-aqueous liquids and gels for hygienic hand antisepsis has been a long-accepted practice in europe12 13 such formulations are now meeting with increasing acceptance in north america as well25 the use of such products has the potential to reduce handborne spread of viruses14
virus transfer from contaminated to clean surfaces can be interrupted through the use of microbicides15 however not all products are equally effective in this respect in fact the use of an ineffective product with a good surfactant can dislodge the virus from the surfaces without killing it thus making it more readily available for transfer upon contact in other words the use of certain formulations for the decontamination of environmental surfaces may inadvertently enhance their potential in the direct or indirect spread of virusescaliciviruses of humans eg noroviruses a frequent cause of nosocomial outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis cannot be grown in the laboratory therefore animal caliciviruses such as the feline calicivirus fcv are commonly used as surrogates for the human ones16 17 we have recently assessed the activity of several environmental surface disinfectants against fcv using a quantitative carrier test18 a soil load was used in all tests and water with a standard hardness of 400 ppm as caco3 was used to prepare use-dilutions of those formulations requiring dilution in water all testing was carried out at 20 c the virucidal effectiveness criterion was arbitrarily set at a log10 reduction factor of 4 in the infectivity titre of the virus as can be seen from table i
 all formulations tested met the effectiveness criterion but with a wide variation in contact timethe findings of the activity of domestic bleach 5 sodium hypochlorite against fcv are given in figure 3
 bleach diluted to contain 1000 ppm of available chlorine reduced infectivity titre of fcv by a log10 factor nearly 45 in a contact time of only one minute a further 2-fold dilution 500 ppm required a contact time of 10 min to achieve the same level of reduction in virus activity when the level of available chlorine was reduced to 100 ppm there was virtually no reduction in the virus infectivity even at a contact time of 5 minthese findings show that fcv is somewhat less resistant to many microbicides than other nosocomial viral pathogens such as hepatitis a virus hac19 fcv also does not survive on human hands and environmental surfaces sattar et al unpublished data as well as hav and human rotaviruses8 however profuse diarrhoea and vomiting which are the hallmarks of noroviral gastroenteritis cause extensive contamination of surfaces and rapid and proper use of microbicides could reduce the environmental spread of such viruses in case of airborne spread the decontamination of hands and environmental surfaces alone is likely to be less effective in outbreak controlthe recent discovery of the sars coronavirus and its ability to cause devastating nosocomial outbreaks has regenerated much interest in coronaviruses in general the sars virus can remain viable on environmental surfaces for a few hours20 whether it can be transmitted through environmental surfaces and hands in healthcare settings remains unknown however earlier studies with another human coronaviruses 229e have found it to be somewhat more resistant to microbicides when compared to a human parainfluenzavirus21 in these tests 10 l of the virus was suspended in mucin to give a final mucin concentration of 5 gml each carrier stainless steel disks of 1 cm diameter with the dried virus inoculum was covered with 20 l of test microbicide for 1 min at room temperature the eluates were plaque assayed in l-132 cells and the arbitrary virucidal effectiveness criterion was a log10 reduction factor of 3 in virus infectivity
table ii
summarizes the data on coronavirucidal activity from the study21 in spite of the fact that 229e is an enveloped virus quaternary ammonium compound and a phenolic were unable to meet the product performance criterion in these tests a 001 solution of domestic bleach 100 ppm available chlorine also failed to achieve the desired level of virus inactivation it should be noted that the contact time in these experiments was one minute which more closely simulates the application of microbicides in the decontamination of environmental surfaces studies are now underway here to determine the activity of microbicides against the sars virus itselfviruses in general continue to exert a heavy toll on human health and the recognition of their impact as pathogens in most likely to increase further as new viruses are being discovered continually and new roles for old viruses are being identified22 relatively recent nosocomial outbreaks of noroviral gastroenteritis23 and sars24 which caused enormous health and economic impacts and major disruptions in health services clearly illustrate how vulnerable our hospitals are to such infectious agentswhile viruses constitute important nosocomial pathogens our understanding of the actual mechanism of spread of many viral infections remains weak this makes it difficult to design and apply proper strategies to prevent and control nosocomial outbreaks of viral infections hand are universally recognized as vehicles for the spread of a number of viruses25 but lack of compliance with handwashing and perhaps the use of ineffective handwash agents continue to undermine the full potential of infection control measures in this regard the ease with which washed hands can pick up infectious viruses upon contact with contaminated environmental surfaces and objects suggests that the emphasis on handwashing should be combined with an awareness of the need for proper and frequent decontamination of those surfaces and objects that come in frequent contact with washed handswhile pre-market evaluation of hygienic hand antiseptics is often carried out using bacteria only laboratory-based testing shows many such products to be less effective against those viruses which are believed to spread via hands in healthcare settings8 this reemphasizes the need for regularly testing such products against representative nosocomial viral pathogens and allowing suitable label claims for virucidal activity26 at the same time label claims against viruses such as human immunodeficiency viruses as well as hepatitis b and c viruses should be discouraged because hands of caregivers are not known to spread these otherwise important nosocomial pathogens27 standardized in vivo methods are new available to assess the activity of hygienic handwash and handrub agents against viruses28
our lives are shaped by constant encounters with an extraordinarily diverse and staggering number of microorganisms in our environment most of these microorganisms pose little threat to vertebrates such as ourselves and many enrich our lives tremendously either directly eg commensal gut microbiota or indirectly eg nitrogen fixation cheese beer however some microbes have evolved to prey upon vertebrate hosts either by feeding on us or hijacking our cells to generate countless copies of themselves in the evolutionary arms race between host and pathogen vertebrates have evolved potent front line innate immune defenses that recognize conserved pathogen associated patterns as well as hostderived danger signals 1 these innate immune mechanisms rely on germlineencoded receptors to recognize highly conserved and unchangeable structural components that pathogens cannot easily mutate 2 3 4 vertebrates have also evolved complementary adaptive immune mechanisms that are highly specific and establish immune memory such that future challenges of the same type will be abortive or blunted through an elegant series of stepwise dna rearrangements adaptive lymphocytes generate tremendous antigen receptor diversity using a limited number of germlineencoded antigen receptor genes resulting in clonally diverse populations with wideranging specificities 5 6 7 the two classical adaptive immune cell types are b and t lymphocytes b cells represent the humoral adaptive immune effector arm secreting soluble antibody proteins directed against intact antigens to bind and neutralize pathogens 8 however intracellular pathogens are often sequestered from antibody binding and therefore must be eliminated using different strategies t lymphocytes discriminate between host and pathogen via protein antigen fragments peptides presented in the context of cell surfaceexpressed major histocompatibility complex mhc molecules 9 10 11 12 tcell antigen recognition is typified by tcell receptor tcr binding to mhcbound cognate peptide and cd8 or cd4 coreceptor interaction with mhc class i and ii respectively tcr and peptidemhc pmhc engagement results in a cascade of intracellular signaling events that ultimately govern tcell fate and function it is these interactions that usually determine whether antiviral tcell effector activity is pathogenic or nonpathogenicinitial studies in vitro demonstrated the formation of stable interactions between t cells and antigenpresenting cells apc 13 14 15 these interactions were dependent on tcr recognition of cognate pmhc and resulted in a highly polarized surface of engagement the junctional interface between an antigensensing t cell and apc is classically referred to as an immunological synapse as the focal point for tcr signaling this immunological synapse is thought to be an essential communication port pmhc serves to nucleate synapse formation and establish an avenue for vectorial information to flow into t cells following pmhc engagement an abundance of accessory and costimulatory molecules in and around the developing synapse allow apcs to ultimately authorize expansion arming and execution of tcell effector functions the priming and regulation of tcell function is also heavily influenced by factors within the extracellular milieu however tcell function is by necessity predicated on tcr signalingwork by kupfer et al 14 15 illuminated the close juxtaposition and requirement for cellcell contact between t cells and apcs especially b cells during thelper responses in vitro in 1998 monks and kupfer 16 provided seminal threedimensional 3d evidence for specific interaction domains on the tcell surface during pmhc encounter they showed that the central supramolecular activation cluster csmac is surrounded by a peripheral supramolecular activation cluster psmac to form an archetypal bullseye pattern that represents the mature immunological synapse structure 16 classically the csmac is rich in clustering tcrs crossjunctionally engaging pmhc whereas the psmac contains adhesion molecules such as leukocyte functionassociated antigen1 lfa1 that physically stabilizes longterm cellcell interactions several additional csmac constituents have been identified including cd2 cd4 cd8 cd28 pkc lck and fyn reviewed in 17 18 the formation of the immune synapse was classically believed to be critical for directional and specific intercellular communication such as cd40cd40l interactions and delivery of effector molecules eg lytic granule and cytokines 19 20 21 although the term immunological synapse was initially meant to describe a specific highly dense region of tcr clustering with a peripheral adhesive ring we now use the term more loosely to imply the contact interface through which cellcell communication occurs between t cells and their cognate pmhcbearing targetsusing a planar bilayer system grakoui and davis 22 observed initial tcrpmhc engagement along with adhesion to intercellular adhesion molecule1 icam1 at the tcell periphery this initial interaction phase was followed by the dynamic accumulation of pmhcengaged tcr within a central cluster surrounded by a ring of bound icam1 a broad range of tcrpmhc affinities led to tcr clustering and ca2 signaling indicating that csmac formation is a conserved feature of tcrs with different affinities lee et al 23 provided similar evidence for csmac formation using a cellcell instead of planar bilayer system however this group also noted that tcr signaling occurred at the periphery of the immunological synapse and actually preceded csmac formation raising questions about the importance of mature synapse formation in tcell activationin addition to tcr signaling integrin signaling through lfa1 can also occur during immunological synapse formation providing costimulation as well as a link between synapse formation and dramatic changes in tcell cytoskeletal structure 24 25 26 in particular the directional secretion of effector molecules relies on polarization of the microtubule organizing center mtoc to the immunological synapse 14 interestingly effector molecules are shuttled along the microtubule network toward the tcrpmhcdriven synapse 13 27 many proteins are linked to mtoc polarization and the targeted release of effector molecules reviewed in 28
in vivo evidence of csmac formation has been difficult to acquire particularly in priming interactions this is partially a technical challenge in resolving protein microdomains within fixed or living tissues but could also reflect the physiological infrequency of smac formation by studying antiviral cd8 t cells in the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus lcmvinfected brain we demonstrated in vivo that cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctls polarize signaling tcr lck adhesion lfa1 and effector perforin molecules toward the contact surface with virally infected target cells 29 fig 
1 in some instances ctls were able to form synapses with up to three separate targets simultaneously fig

d because these studies were performed on static tissue sections we were unable to observe the temporal relationship between ctlapc contact and the migratory behavior prior to arrest and polarization importantly barcia et al 30 expanded upon our work by capturing 3d in vivo evidence of csmac and psmac formation along the contact interface of t cells and virally infected astrocytes in the brain the formation of smacs was specific to t cells engaging infected astrocytes and preceded tcellmediated clearance of these cells although these findings provide clear evidence that smac formation occurs in vivo it remains unclear whether csmac generation is a functional necessity for cytolytic or helper t cells in fact yang et al recently concluded that mature immunological synapses did not appear to correlate with ctlmediated clearance of brain tumors 31 suggesting that smac formation is not a requirement for delivery of ctl effector functionsearly studies utilizing bilayers and unsupported cells in vitro indicated that t cells rapidly halt their migration upon initial antigen encounter 32 however it is still debated whether longlived tcellapc interactions are required for priming and effector functions gunzer et al 33 provided the first counterpoint to the stable immunological synapse paradigm by modeling in vivo tissue migration using a collagen matrix culture containing t cells and apcs in this study it was observed that t cells engaged in dynamic shortlived interactions with cognate pmhcbearing apcs instead of halting their migration and forming stable immune synapses 33 this observation led to the development of a serial encounter model in which a rapidly formed stable immunological synapse is not required after initial antigen encounter instead a multitude of shortlived serial tcrpmhc interactions occur additively generating a cumulative activation signal 34 there is substantial evidence supporting the physiological relevance of serial antigen encounters during in vivo tcell priming 35 36 37 there are also data showing that tcrpmhc interactions can induce release of effector molecules in the absence of stable immunological synapse formation 38 39 40 interestingly a recent study demonstrated that nuclear localization of nuclear factor of activated t cells nfat imprinted transient tcr signals and remained active for tcr tolerance genes however more sustained tcr signaling was required for interferon ifn expression 41 these findings provide a mechanistic basis for why transient tcr signaling induces tolerance in naive t cells thus it appears that prolonged tcr signaling whether achieved serially or continuously is required for tcell priming and effector differentiation 42 although serial tcrpmhc encounters can eventually generate a cumulative stop signal resulting in tcell arrest 36 37 it remains unclear if the tight interactions observed after several hours of transient serial interactions are characterized by classic immunological synapse formationthe high antigen doses used in the initial characterization of the immunological synapse likely facilitated the development of a rapid stable cellcell interface 43 increasing the frequency of tcr engagements in vivo markedly enhances cellcell conjugate formation and migratory arrest indicating a strong role for antigen dose in promoting rapid motility arrest 37 however t cells operating in vivo often encounter priming and effector phase conditions in which cognate antigen is presented at a low level this can occur when an apc is not infected or is simply presenting low levels of exogenously acquired antigen in contrast when t cells encounter infected target cells filled with antigen and densely covered in pmhc the resultant engagement and tcr signaling may be strong enough to favor formation of a stable mature immunological synapse recently moreau et al 44 reported clear associations among tcr affinity signal strength and the formation of stable immunological synapses stable synapses were associated with the strongest tcrpmhc interactions whereas dynamic interactions referred to as kinapses 45 46 were observed in vivo with ligands of weaktomoderate affinity importantly kinapse interactions did result in tcell activation and proliferation albeit with a delay proportional to the pmhc signaling strength 44while stable csmac formation may occur in vivo under certain conditions 30 there is increasing evidence that many immune synapses can accommodate tcr signal integration with continued motility 47 48 49 50 these interactions have been termed kinapses to reflect the importance of movement or kinesis 45 46 a kinapse represents a region of cellcell contact that serves to communicate information between the cells but remains motile during signaling migrating t cells in vitro display motile synapses of tcr microclusters that move directionally along with the t cell independent of csmac formation 51 utilizing a transgenic mouse with green fluorescent protein gfptagged tcr friedman and colleagues 49 observed dynamic tcr trafficking in vitro and in vivo during naive tcell priming in these studies the authors found little evidence of extended tcr clustering or classic csmac generation upon antigen encounter moreover upon antigen encounter tcr internalization which is evidence of tcrpmhc signaling also occurred rapidly without generation of csmac structure even more importantly t cells were shown to cluster tcrs flux calcium and then internalize their tcr clusters all while maintaining motile surveillance of pmhcpresenting dendritic cells dcs 49 similarly azar and colleagues using a fluorescently tagged linker for activation of tcells lat protein found little evidence for distinct areas of large scale tcr signaling clusters along the tcelldc contact zone in vivo
52 these authors also reported that activated effector t cells more frequently engage in kinapselike interactions with apc when compared with naive t cells these data indicate that tcell activation state naive effector memory influences the type of cellcell contact zone eg mature synapse versus kinapse that is formed 52 the formation of motile versus fixed synapses may also be linked to the apc itself as interactions between t and b cells were shown to facilitate classical fixed synapse formation where tcelldc interactions were more brief and serial 53 collectively the aforementioned studies provide a framework for the relationship between tcr signaling and the tcellapc interface strong high affinity tcrpmhc interactions are usually indicative of a t cell that has encountered a foreign peptide which immediately authorizes the cell to activate following weaker tcrpmhc interactions t cells use serial engagements and record cumulative signaling events to gather more evidence before crossing over a threshold and committing to activation this helps to ensure that the serially engaged peptide warrants tcell activationwhether stable or dynamic tcell recognition of pmhc usually generates an interaction surface between cells it is postulated that this interaction surface in vivo is highly dynamic but does on occasion result in the formation of stable smac structures that facilitate prolonged signal integration numerous transient yet productive tcrpmhc encounters also occur in vivo and can regulate tcell priming and effector functions both in lymphoid as well as in nonlymphoid tissues in the following sections we discuss how pmhctcr interactions modulated by accessory molecules can influence the fate of antiviral tcell interactionsbcell production of neutralizing antibodies is the foundation for nearly all currently utilized vaccination strategies 54 neutralizing antibodies are also critical to clearance of many viral infections however their very nature as extracellular soluble effector molecules often precludes their ability to clear intracellular viral reservoirs therefore eradication of many viral infections requires coordinated effector activity by antiviral cd8 and cd4 t cells lcmv virus is the prototypic model for tcellmediated viral clearance 55 lcmv is a noncytopathic arenavirus that infects rodents and humans and provides an excellent system for understanding the mechanics of antiviral immune responses depending on the strain dose and infectious route a wide array of responses to experimental lcmv infection can be elicited that include but are not limited to acute viral clearance immune suppression viral persistence hepatitis and fatal choriomeningitis lcmv infection generates an enormous cd8 tcell response dominated by welldocumented pmhc specificities 56 the generation of lcmv glycoprotein gpspecific cd8 dbgp3341 specific p14 mice 57 and cd4 iabgp6180 specific smarta mice 58 tcr transgenic mice has provided transferable and traceable populations of virusspecific cells allowing further characterization of antiviral tcell responseslcmv has the capacity to induce a remarkably reproducible fatal meningitis the disease for which the virus is named 6 days following intracerebral inoculation into a murine host reviewed in 59 60 61 62 63 fig 
1 lcmv is able to induce a similar disease in humans 64 65 after intracerebral inoculation lcmv gains access to systemic circulation and draining lymph nodes where it is available for naive tcell priming professional apcs can be directly infected by lcmv which may provide an abundance of pmhc for naive tcell recognition 66 67 because strong tcr stimulation preferentially affects proliferation during priming 68 the abundance of pmhc presented by infected apcs may explain the massive burst in antiviral t cells with up to 90 of circulating cd8 t cells becoming specific to lcmv 56 69 lcmvspecific t cells traffic into many infected peripheral tissues but their arrival into the central nervous system cns precedes a cascade of cellular events that ultimately leads to death fig 
1a multistep adhesion cascade regulates the tethering and extravasation of circulating t cells into infected tissues tcell entry into the cns relies on selectins chemokines and integrins reviewed in 70 lcmv infection is associated with massive type i ifn ifni release 71 which plays an essential role in antiviral defense through induction of a myriad of antiviral proteins 72 73 and by promoting adaptive immunity 74 75 our laboratory has shown that ifni also leads to widespread increases in mhc i throughout the brain following lcmv infection and this can be maintained indefinitely during states of persistent infection 76 within the brains of mice persistently infected with lcmv elevated mhc i expression was detected on endothelial cells and microglia endothelial cells have been reported to present antigen directly to t cells 77 and in one model enhanced mhc i expression by cns vascular endothelial cells facilitated the antigenspecific entry of cd8 t cells 78 it is known that tcr signaling events can link integrin and chemokine signaling to cytoskeletal changes required for motility 79 80 indeed tcr signals can synergize with signals mediated by 1 integrin 81 which is the very late antigen4 complex that helps t cells gain access to the cns thus it is conceivable that pmhcdependent immunological synapse or kinapse formation with vascular endothelial cells may sensitize t cells to transmigrate thereby increasing the homing specificity however it is important to note that bystander t cells of an irrelevant tcr specificity are known to traffic into sites of infection including the brain 82 83 therefore the general role of tcrpmhc interactions in the preferential recruitment of t cells to sites of infection remains unclear that it does occur in certain scenarios 78 underscores the diversity of potential antigenspecific functions that tcr recognition can generateit is well described that tcell entry into the lcmvinfected cns is a harbinger of death 59 fatal disease is absolutely dependent on lcmvspecific cd8 t cells as shown by cd8 tcell antibody depletion 84 genetic deletion 85 and peptide blocking 86 studies similarly cd8 t cells specific to ovalbumin ova an irrelevant antigen are capable of entering the lcmvinfected cns but cannot cause fatal meningitis 82 cd8 tcr transgenic t cells specific to ova referred to as oti mice 87 are unable to mount a lcmvspecific tcell response and are completely resistant to lcmv meningitis 82 following lcmv infection these mice become asymptomatic lifelong viral carriers however adoptive transfer of as few as 103 naive lcmvspecific cd8 p14 t cells into oti mice can fully restore lethal meningitis illustrating the crucial role of ctlpmhc interactions in mediating this disease 82 a single monoclonal population dbgp3341 specific of virusspecific t cells operating in a repertoire of bystanders is sufficient to drive a fatal disorderto gain advanced realtime insights into this disease process and determine how virusspecific cd8 t cells induce a rapid onset fatal seizure disorder we employed a technique referred to as intravital twophoton laser scanning microscopy tpm 63 88 89 90 and imaged the brain through a surgically thinned skull window 91 92 by imaging gfptagged lcmvspecific cd8 t cells in the living brain we were able to define the realtime interactions of these cells during the development of lcmv meningitis 47 63 in symptomatic mice virusspecific ctls invaded and interacted with the virally infected meninges interestingly we observed that ctls divided locally within the cns environment 48 up to 30 of ctls were in active stages of cell cycle in the virusinfected meninges this dynamic observation of virusspecific ctls undergoing mitosis in the lcmvinfected meninges has expanded our general understanding of tcell division programming the traditional view of tcell proliferation is that the proliferative burst which occurs within lymphoid organs during priming is a hardwired program 93 instituted by dcs 35 contrary to this paradigm we found that during lcmv meningitis up to one third of antiviral ctls depart lymphoid tissues and migrate through the blood while still in cell cycle 48 peripherally cycling cells showed no overt differences in surface molecule expression or effector program from noncycling cells in circulation or the cns these cycling cells likely represent a stochastic vestige of the proliferative program initiated in secondary lymphoid tissues during cd8 tcell priming using tpm we observed that the number of motile ctls in the lcmvinfected meninges far outnumbered those that were stably arrested we postulate that migrating ctls integrate pmhc signals obtained from multiple infected target cells which is consistent with the concept of serial signal integration in the meninges migrating ctls often arrested briefly approximately 1015 min to undergo mitosis before resuming their migration 48 interaction with cognate pmhc was critical to advancing the ctl division program but costimulatory molecules such as cd80 and cd86 were dispensable these data extend upon the serial encounter model of cumulative tcrpmhc signal integration in lymphoid tissues to include the summation of signals accumulated systemically in other words antiviral t cells likely have the capacity to record and integrate signals obtained from multiple tissues another advantage of advancing the tcell division program serially is that antiviral tcell numbers can be modulated locally at sites of viral infection based on the signals delivered tcell numbers can be easily increased to promote viral clearance or decreased to prevent immunopathology serial programming is more amenable to local controlctl interactions with pmhc drive the fatal consequences of lcmv meningitis 85 however the exact effector mechanism employed by t cells remained unclear mice deficient in perforin granzyme b tumor necrosis factor tnf ifn receptor fas and the degranulation pathway unc13d also known as jinx 94 are all susceptible to fatal meningitis 47 this was unexpected given the absolute requirement for ctls in the disease process thus we used tpm to determine how ctls were linked to the development of fatal immunopathology time lapses revealed large numbers of antiviral ctl migrating through the meningeal space in addition increased ctl motility was observed following antibodymediated disruption of tcrpmhc interactions which indicated that mhc i interactions regulate most if not all antiviral ctls within the lcmvinfected meninges 47blood brain barrier bbb breakdown 47 95 96 and convulsive seizures 97 98 are two hallmarks of lcmv meningitis at day 5 postinfection ctls begin to survey the meninges but the bbb remains intact and mice are asymptomatic 47 however at 6 day postinfection ctl influx increases markedly and this coincides with a massive secondary recruitment of innate myelomonocytic cells ie monocytes and neutrophils that burst forth from meningeal vasculature leading to vascular breakdown and seizure onset 47 this tidal wave of myelomonocytic recruitment into the cns was precipitated in part by tcrpmhc interactions driving meningeal ctl to release chemokines such as ccl3 4 and 5 from a survival perspective we postulate that direct chemokine release by ctls is critical to the development of rapid onset fatal convulsive seizures this does not however negate the importance of cell death induced by classical ctl effector pathways like lytic granule secretion onto virally infected target cells which does occur in this model 29 depletion of myelomonocytic cells eliminates rapid onset seizures on day 6 and extends survival but mice eventually succumb to a disease that is likely mediated by ctls additional studies are required to prove this definitively in general these data revised our understanding of how antiviral t cells contribute to immunopathological diseases it is well documented that ctls cause immunopathology through release of cytotoxic effector molecules 99 our studies demonstrate that they can also contribute to cns disease by recruiting pathogenic innate immune cellsregulation of cytokine and chemokine secretion by tcrpmhc is commonly associated with cd4 tcell function however antiviral ctls can produce large quantities of ifn tnf and the aforementioned chemokines although it is not clear how ctlderived chemokines trigger emigration of circulating cells it is possible that endothelial pmhc complexes in addition to enhancing transmigration 78 also elicit chemokine deposition within glycosaminoglycan networks on the luminal endothelial cell surface which has been shown in vivo to facilitate interactions with circulating lymphocytes 100 it is expected that as the number of circulating antiviral ctls increases so too will the number of interactions between ctls and brain endothelial cells at some critical threshold ctldeposited chemokines lead to widespread integrin activation and transmigration by myelomonocytic cells further studies are required to determine how ctls coordinate synchronous extravasation of myelomonocytic cells following cns viral infection 47the original observation that cytokines were polarized 13 toward the immunological synapse led to the elegant model suggesting that tcrpmhc interactions generate longlived cellcell interactions required for targeted delivery of effector molecules onto cells in need of them synaptically targeted delivery allows for strict communication between two authorized partners which spares the surrounding uninfected tissue from pathology and maintains the fundamental principles of antigen specificity within the adaptive immune system however although polarized delivery of lytic granules makes intuitive sense and directional cytokine delivery by cd4 t cells during humoral tbcell interactions must be antigen specific there are situations in which directional delivery simply cannot accomplish certain goals in the case of cd4 t cells relying solely on directional cytokine delivery precludes their ability to help cells that lack mhc ii expression as mhc ii expression is far more restricted than mhc i many cell types that could benefit from cytokine exposure would not be able to receive directional cytokine support importantly huse et al 101 have shown that while some tcellderived cytokines eg ifn il2 are targeted to pmhcexpressing cells by an immunological synapse others such as tnf and il4 are secreted multidirectionally ie not only at the cellcell interface moreover the chemokines ccl3 and ccl5 also appear to be multidirectionally secreted 101 whether this is the case for chemokine production by antiviral cd8 t cells remains unclear but it seems reasonable to assume that meningeal tcrpmhc interactions drive ctls to produce a cloud of chemokines within the lcmvinfected meninges 47 in fact even directional synapses have been shown to be leaky barcia and colleagues 102 recently demonstrated that cd8 t cells within the virally infected cns use directional csmaccontaining immunological synapses to release ifn and lytic granules toward targets however cell contacts lacking csmac structure referred to as nonkupfer interactions were also shown to result in ifn secretion these nonkupfer interactions are still directional because they are regulated by tcr engagement using a clever in vitro technique to probe the true directionality of ifn release by cd8 t cells this same group showed that while antigenbearing target cells were directly exposed to ifn evidenced by stat1 relocalization so were their nonantigenbearing unengaged neighbors 103 this observation implies that following formation of a tcrpmhcdependent contact interface ifn can at least partially leak out into the surrounding extracellular area this may be particularly relevant in immunoprivileged tissues where mhc i and ii are not widely expressed within the virally infected cns many cells especially neurons express little to no mhc i 104 105 making it difficult for t cells to directly engage them even if they are infected if nearby cells such as microglia or dcs present antigen to cd8 t cells ifn production can exert antiviral effects regionally as opposed to only on the pmhcbearing target cellscd8 t cells are idolized for their ability to specifically lyse pmhcbearing cells ctls can mediate target cell lysis through the directional release of lytic granules or through interaction of ctlpresented fasl with target cell expressed fas 99 106 the life or death decision ctls make based on tcrpmhc contact is highly regulated as little nonspecific killing is observed 82 interestingly it is estimated that ctls make the decision to kill after engagement of as few as 3 pmhc molecules whereas 10 pmhc molecules are needed to establish the csmac 40 although directional cytokine secretion requires greater tcrpmhc signaling and favors formation of the csmac ie a classical immunological synapse very little antigen is needed to induce lytic granule secretion 27 107 thus this pathway must be exquisitely regulated to avoid severe tissue injurya number of factors and molecular queues modulate tcrpmhc signaling interactions between b7 primarily cd8086 and cd28 superfamily members dominate the costimulatory landscape tcell expression of these factors which include cd28 cytotoxic tlymphocyte antigen 4 ctla4 programmed death 1 pd1 and inducible tcell costimulator icos regulate tcell functionality by dampening or enhancing tcr proximal signaling cascades reviewed in 17 activation by innate signaling pathways causes apcs to upregulate costimulatory molecule expression in preparation for tcell priming interactions immature apcs with low costimulatory molecule expression can nevertheless present pmhc complexes to t cells tcrpmhc interactions on the surface of immature or tolerogenic dcs can result in tcell tolerance induction tcell interactions with these immature dcs were shown to be shorter and less productive than those with mature apcs 108 although these shorter interactions were deemed independent of cd8086 influence they nevertheless support an orchestrating role for apcs during tcell priming interactions in addition to upregulation of classic costimulatory molecules apc maturation itself results in increased tcell adhesiveness regardless of peptide presentation 109 the signals being exchanged in nonspecific interactions remain unclear but t cells themselves can engage in interactions with one another that facilitate differentiation and acquisition of effector functions 110 111naive t cells constitutively express cd28 and upon tcr engagement it is recruited along with tcr to the signaling synapse cd28 interactions with apcexpressed cd8086 amplify tcrpmhc signaling and permit tcell activation by only a small number of triggered tcrs 112 naive t cells are dependent on cd28 costimulation especially when tcrpmhc interactions are limiting 113 114 115 although effector t cells appear less dependent on cd28 to elicit effector function memory t cells benefit from a reactivating encounter with cd28 costimulation 116 117 tcr and cd28 signaling elicits expression of the secondary costimulation marker icos by activated cd4 t cells 118 therefore icos ligation is important for activated rather than naive t cells and supporting continued cd4 tcell expansiondifferentiation 119 120 icos ligation was also shown to augment the proliferative and cytokine responses of activated cd8 t cells in vitro
121 although icos blockade had no effect on antiviral ctl responses in vivo
122upon tcr engagement naive t cells upregulate ctla4 123 124 which subsequently traffics into the immunological synapse 125 compared with cd28 ctla4 possesses a much higher affinity for cd8086 and instead of enhancing tcr signals ctla4 binding contributes to the dephosphorylation and suppression of proximal tcr signaling reviewed in 126 this interference with tcr signaling allows ctla4 to override the tcrpmhc stop signal and further disrupt tcrpmhc interactions as cells migrate away from their antigen 127 128 animals deficient in ctla4 succumb to a fatal multiorgan autoimmune reaction only weeks after birth illustrating the crucial role in negatively regulating tcr signaling 129 130 although essential in preventing autoimmune activation of t cells ctla4 does not appear to critically regulate antiviral ctl function 131 132another tcellexpressed negative regulator of tcr signaling is pd1 an inhibitory molecule expressed on activated t cells that is especially pronounced in chronic infections 132 although both pd1 and ctla4 negatively regulate proximal tcr signals they do so using distinct mechanisms 133 studies have demonstrated that pd1 and tcr cocluster upon pmhc engagement and coalesce within the csmac in stable immunological synapses 134 135 interactions between pd1 and one of its ligands pdl1 at membrane sites of tcrpmhc interaction serve to promote dephosphorylation of proximal tcractivating signals which in turn blunts activation and effector functions dynamic in vivo studies of autoreactive cd4 t cells have indicated that pd1pdl1 interactions disrupt tcrbased stop signals resulting in increased motility and decreased interaction times between cd4 t cells and apcs 136 overriding tcrinduced stop signals was proposed as an important mechanism to prevent the development autoimmune disease however our recent work with antiviral cd8 t cells in a model of chronic lcmv infection using the clone 13 strain 137 has shown that while pd1 coassociates with tcr at the immunological synapse pd1pdl1 engagement promotes longterm stable arrest instead of reducing the contact time between antiviral cd8 t cells and apcs pd1 interactions stabilized cell contacts and immunological synapses while remaining disruptive of proximal tcr signaling 135 in the lcmv clone 13 model of viral persistence ctls undergo active suppression to prevent severe immunopathology 138 we propose that motility paralysis imposed by the pd1pdl1 pathway decreases tcell scanning efficiency and facilitates continued engagement of regulatory pathways that negatively impact antiviral tcell function importantly pd1 blockade resulted in a rapid recovery of cd8 tcell motility signaling and expression of the antiviral cytokine ifn pd1pdl1 management of tcr signaling quality was critical to maintaining a tolerable level of hostpathogen interplay as pd1 blockade resulted in rapid initiation of viral clearance followed by ifnmediated death of the host 135 it is interesting that pd1 blockade triggers the synthesis andor release of ifn which is a synaptically targeted cytokine 101 the molecular relationship between pd1 signaling and ifn secretion is not clear although tcr proximal signals driving ifn transcription are certainly involved as pd1 blockade has a rapid effect on ifn transcription 135 it is possible that pd1 signaling blocks ifn shuttling to the target cell synapse causing preformed intracellular ifn protein to freeze in transit for targeted release until pd1 blockade unlocks the synaptic paralysis consistent with this model pd1 signaling has little effect on tnf production 135 which is a nonsynaptic multidirectional cytokine 101 that apcs play a significant role in regulating tcrpmhc interaction outcomes during both the priming and effector phase is clear yet how they modulate the quality of these interactions remains incompletely understoodregulatory t cells treg are a class of cd4 t cells that by a variety of means suppress autoimmune and nonspecific tcell responses reviewed in 139 tregs are critical for survival 140 and have been shown to influence the immune response and outcomes to a number of viral infections 141 mempel and colleagues 142 observed that the presence of antigenspecific tregs inhibited the ability of ctls to lyse target apcs within draining lymph nodes despite engaging in longlived conjugates with their targets the presence of tregs prevented ctl lytic granule exocytosis in a tgfdependent manner prolonged physical contact between the ctls and tregs was not required to suppress cytolysis which is in accordance with tregmediated inhibition of cd4 tcell responses in two autoimmune disease models 143 144 tregs interact with apcs to dissolve or prevent autoreactive cd4 tcell clustering the presence of tregs appears to impair tcr signal integration such that the dynamic swarming behavior observed after successful tcrpmhc signaling does not occur and cd4 t cells fail to proliferate or acquire effector functions interestingly it was also recently reported by marangoni and colleagues 41 that tregs can actually destabilize ctl interactions with primary tumor target cells in nonlymphoid tissue however it still remains unclear what mediators tregs deploy to influence t cells or apcs in these different models to suppress tcell responsesin addition to inducing lethal meningitis lcmv can establish a carrier state of chronic infection referred to as lcmv carrier mice wherein animals remain viremic with high viral burden in all tissues but have no overt signs of immunopathology 145 146 147 although strong tcrpmhc interactions in lcmvinfected secondary lymphoid tissues typically results in tcell priming and expansion the tcrpmhc interactions of developing t cells in the thymus of neonatal carrier mice negatively selects lcmvspecific t cells from the tcell repertoire establishing immune tolerance 57 148 this negative selection is not complete and some lcmv reactive cells escape selection 149 however the cells that do persist in the circulating tcell pool are tolerized rendering them incapable of clearing virus viral clearance from lcmv carrier mice can be achieved by an adoptive immunotherapy strategy in which memory t cells are transferred into carrier mice 150 fig 
2 simultaneous transfer of both cd8 and cd4 t cells is required 151 152 to rapidly control viremia 153 and purge virus from most peripheral organs however it takes much longer for cns virus to be cleared 153 154 within the cns of carrier mice neurons bear a heavy viral burden 154 155 which presents a conundrum to cd8 t cells ctl lytic effector function typically destroys infected target cells 99 this cytolysis is acceptable in most peripheral organs with regenerative capacity like the liver but is not ideal within the cns because the majority of neurons are postmitotic and their lysis poses a significant risk to host fitnessuninfected neurons protect themselves by expressing little mhc class i thus reducing the likelihood of direct stable engagement by ctls and potential cytolysis 104 105 during some cns viral infections ctls do employ lytic effector mechanisms both perforin and fasdependent neuronal killing have been reported 156 157 certain pathogens may antagonize cytokineinduced antiviral protein function resulting in viral resistance and ongoing replication 158 the increased inflammation and pmhc expression associated with continued viral replication may override a t cell desire to act noncytopathically however in most cases ctls do not destroy infected neuronal networks but rely instead on noncytopathic mechanisms 159 to clear viral infections interestingly forced expression of neuronal mhc i leads to profound illness and death in lcmv carrier mice following adoptive immunotherapy 160 nevertheless adoptive immunotherapy requires cd8 t cells and does succeed in clearing neuronal viral reservoirs from wildtype lcmv carrier mice in a tcrpmhcdependent manner without induction of overt pathology 154 155 the cns must therefore impose specific regulation on ctl by providing activating signals such as pmhc without eliciting the negative consequences lytic function initial adoptive transfer of antilcmv memory cells into carrier mice results in robust secondary tcell expansion rapid clearance of peripheral virus and tcell trafficking into the virally infected cns fig

d although cnsresident microglial cells as well as emigrating dcs and macrophages expressed antigenpresenting machinery only dcs from immunotherapy recipients stimulated t cells to produce effector cytokines ex vivo intriguingly brainderived dcs from immunotherapy recipients elicited tnfbiased cytokine production from antiviral cd8 t cells which was in stark contrast to splenic dcs from carrier mice which induced ifnbiased responses 155 this diametric change in cytokine production was crucial to successful viral clearance as tnf deficient memory t cells were unable to facilitate a reduction in viral load upon adoptive immunotherapy our data indicate that not only do transferred memory ctls infiltrate the cns of lcmv carrier mice they also interact with cns dcs to produce tnf that is required for successful immunotherapy how cns dcs specifically suppress directionally secreted ifn production while still eliciting tnf production is unknown but it likely involves immunoregulatory molecules interacting with proximal tcr signaling to affect ctl secretory machinerylcmv clearance from the livers of immunotherapy recipients involves some degree of infected hepatocyte cytolysis yet many cells are cleared noncytopathically through memory tcell cytokine production 161 interestingly guidotti and colleagues 161 found that cytolysis was required to purge virus from nonparenchymal liver cells and splenocytes indicating that host cell factors may intrinsically regulate which tcell effector mechanism will most efficaciously clear a viral infection ctl clearance of cns coronavirus infection is also mediated by contrasting mechanisms bergmann et al 162 reported that cd8 tcellderived cytolytic action but not ifn was required to clear astrocytes whereas ifn alone could only inhibit viral replication in oligodendroglia in these examples of liver and cns viral clearance t cells presumably produce ifn during contact with tissueresident cell types but somehow decide when to abandon nonlytic effector mechanisms and resort to lysing infected cells the mechanisms that guide these fate decisions remain unclear very little tcr stimulation is required to induce ctl cytotoxicity whereas stronger antigen encounters ie tcrpmhc signaling are needed to generate effector cytokine release 107 this model may explain why ctls favor cytokine release following contact with infected hepatocytes that express high levels of pmhc yet this model is difficult to reconcile with observations in the cns neuronal infection is certainly not associated with abundant mhc i presentation which should favor engagement of lytic effector mechanisms but these serial low peptide encounters within the cns typically do not result in killing and instead bias antiviral t cells toward cytokine release and noncytopathic clearance following adoptive immunotherapy in lcmv carrier mice we have observed juxtaposed antiviral ctls and neurons suggestive of a productive interaction fig

e f however our preliminary dynamic studies of ctl interactions with virally infected neurons suggest that the preponderance of these interactions is very rapid and t cells for the most part remain highly motile authors unpublished observations cxcl10 a cxcr3 ligand is expressed by neurons in the virally infected cns 163 and cxcr3 ligands suppress tcr activation and override stop signals to force motility upon t cells 164 these findings might explain rapid migration along infected neurons with a lack of cytotoxicity but it remains unclear how antigenspecific t cells produce antiviral effector cytokines under these conditions of enforced motility we have shown that lcmv infection of mice with a restricted tcell repertoire directed against ova oti mice results in establishment of a novel carrier state in which viral tropism is expanded to include astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in addition to neurons 165 immunotherapeutic memory tcell transfer into oti carrier mice results in uncharacteristic illness and death during viral clearance oti mice have tregs with highly restricted tcr expression in addition to reduced treg numbers we found that cotransfer of treg cells with antiviral memory t cells significantly dampened pathologic tcell activity while still allowing for eventual viral clearance in oti carrier mice 165 the role for tregs in the tcr diverse lcmv carrier model is unknown but it is possible that only interactions with certain infected cell types require mediation by tregs and normal neuronal clearance as observed in wildtype carrier mice can unfold safely mechanistically the role for cellmediated suppressive effects within the cns remains unclear and in fact varies widely based on the model under investigation 139 how neurons dictate their preferred effector mechanisms from ctls is still a mystery although tcrpmhc interactions are a key element of the decisionmaking process further work is needed to elucidate how these nonpathologic t cells integrate the tcrpmhc interactions in the cns with potentially unique molecular queues that bias t cells away from cytotoxicitythe life of a t cell revolves around tcrpmhc interactions in the beginning the positive and negative selection synapses formed between t cells and thymic apcs ie dcs and medullary thymic epithelial cells result in clonal expansion of progenitors for further diversification and selection as well as clonal deletion but do not result in effector differentiation or effector activity tcrpmhc interactions regulate these diverse outcomes potentially through accessory molecules or differential signaling 166 167 once in the periphery tonic tcr signaling due to interactions with selfpeptides supports tcell survival 168 until the tcr encounters activating pmhc complexes mature apc encounter leads to tcrpmhc interactions that synergize with costimulatory molecules and the extracellular milieu to initiate the priming synapse and drive tcell proliferation and acquisition of specific effector functions following a successful priming synapse t cells can form effector synapses that result in authorization to execute an effector program through cytokinechemokine production and cytolytic granule release bifurcation of freshly activated t cells into memory or effector precursor cells can result from asymmetric division 169 170 however it remains unclear what role tcrpmhc signaling plays in directing asymmetric division tcrpmhc interactions drive cell division in peripheral tissues 48 yet it remains unknown whether these division events are asymmetric if indeed asymmetric division does occur within peripheral tissues it could play an underlying role in generating tissueresident memory cells 171successful entry into the memory pool finds t cells again awaiting pmhc encounter at which point they form a secondary priming synapse that reinitiates the priming program in antigenexperienced memory t cells likely with qualities different from the primary phase every time a tcr interacts with pmhc the interaction results in information transfer through tcr proximal signals that depend on the tcrpmhc affinity and synaptic partners controlling the outcome of tcrpmhc encounters is paramount for pathogen clearance and immunopathology in some target organs ctls kill directly without the requirement for apc interactions within the cns ctls typically appear to favor noncytotoxic effector mechanisms understanding how tcr signals integrate with immunomodulators and secreted factors in the milieu to deliver varied effector programs will allow for a greater potential to manipulate and tune tcell responses to promote viral clearance while preventing undesirable immunopathologywe recently published a narrative review of infection control and operating room management for the care of patients undergoing surgery during the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 crisis and who are not thought to have covid-19 1 in the current article we consider these topics for the period when surgery transitions from urgent to essential procedures and progressively as queues resolve to elective surgery 2 from the many studies published in the intervening weeks it is apparent that some of the recommendations made can be relaxed for many patients 1we limit consideration to ambulatory surgery expecting that for a considerable time following the peak of sars-cov-2 infection hospital beds often will be occupied with covid-19 patients 34 the scheduling of surgery requiring inpatient admission will need to consider the constraint of limited intensive care unit and ward beds and the risk to such patients of nosocomial covid-19 infection 56 there also will be considerations related potentially to the exclusion of visitors unreliable availability of blood products and a reduction in the healthcare workforce due to the consequences of the pandemic however ambulatory surgery accounts for 747 of surgical cases performed on regular workdays ie non-urgent 78 essential and high-priority elective surgery that can expand earliest comprise procedures that can be performed safely in free-standing buildings whether in hospital outpatient departments or at facilities unaffiliated with hospitals 9 although we refer to ambulatory surgery our intention is for the principles to apply fully to all procedures whether or not an anesthesia provider is involved in the care of the patient eg includes brief interventional pain procedures with known efficacy eg single transforaminal epidural steroid injection for new-onset pain 10we assume that rt-pcr nasopharyngeal testing of all ambulatory surgery patients would not be combined with screening computerized tomography of the lung 1112 there are patients infected with sars-cov-2 and presymptomatic or asymptomatic 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 a presymptomatic patient has virus present but is not yet manifesting any signs or symptoms of covid-19 in the asymptomatic patient radiographic changes in the lung are present but the patient lacks any symptoms or has symptoms attributed to a different process eg occasional cough in a patient with thoracic disease 15 16 17 18 19 recognizing this potential hazard the american association of nurse anesthetists american society of anesthesiologists anesthesia patient safety foundation and american academy of anesthesiologist assistants recommend as optimal practice that all anesthesia professionals should utilize personal protective equipment appropriate for aerosol-generating procedures for all patients when working near the airway 2021 we presume that all operating room staff ie anesthesia providers surgeons and nurses would be using some version of droplet precautions for all such patients 2021 other authors have discussed the implementation of barrier protection strategies such as the use of traditional surgical mask and face shield well fit n95 mask and face shield etc for our purposes of considering the economics of ambulatory surgery in the covid era we correspondingly partition ambulatory surgery into three categories section 3 no aerosol production by both the surgical procedure and the anesthetic section 4 aerosol production by tracheal intubation and extubation and section 5 aerosol production by the surgical procedure and general anestheticthere not only are patients infected with sars-cov-2 who are presymptomatic but also asymptomatic patients with radiological changes pathognomonic for covid-19 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 therefore we expect that all patients undergoing anesthesia will have rt-pcr testing the day before surgery early in the disease viral load is predominantly that of the upper airway nasopharynx oropharynx 2223 rt-pcr testing of the oropharynx subsequently referred to as covid-19 testing has high sensitivity 2223 the negative predictive value probably is effectively 999 and patients would be receiving topical viral decolonization preoperatively see section 3 therefore we expect limited economic effects of covid-19 from presymptomatic and asymptomatic patients not undergoing general anesthesia however during progression of the disease there is a substantive false negative rate of oropharyngeal testing observed clinically 24 25 26 27 bronchoalveolar lavage specimens have detectable sars-cov-2 for more samples 93 than sputum 72 and much more than oropharyngeal swabs 32 28 consequently as we address in 4 5 we expect large economic effects of covid-19 from patients receiving general anesthesiathis section applies to patients a undergoing procedures without airway aerosol production eg excluding interventional pulmonary and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy 29 30 31 and b receiving local anesthesia monitored anesthesia care andor regional anesthesia including peripheral and spinal blocks with moderate sedation consequently there would not be a need for airborne precautions 31 restricting many operating rooms from aerosol producing surgical procedures and general anesthesia would be practical because ambulatory surgery visits in the usa in 2006 were performed without general anesthesia for 69 of visits 32 anesthetics performed without general anesthesia accounted for 72 se 2 of the anesthesia minutes among ambulatory surgery procedures performed in the usa in 2010 with an anesthesiologist andor nurse anesthetists 33 these statistics are functional overestimates because some aerosol producing procedures eg upper gastrointestinal endoscopy 30 are coded as being monitored anesthesia care even though the patient is deeply sedated for at least a portion of the procedure nevertheless the point is that more than half of ambulatory surgery is performed without general anesthesia there also are many common interventional procedures performed with local anesthesia alone again with interventional pain procedures as examples 3435 for this review we reanalyzed the 2010 national survey data to find that 18 se 2 of the ambulatory procedure room time was performed without an anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist 36during anesthesia bacterial and viral contamination of the anesthesia workspace routinely occurs largely due to activities of the anesthesiologist andor nurse anesthetist caring for the patient throughout the case 137 38 39 40 multiple steps can be followed to mitigate this risk as follows a decolonize patients using preprocedural chlorhexidine wipes two doses of nasal povidoneiodine 41 within 1 h of incision and chlorhexidine mouth rinse 42 43 44 45 46 47 in the unlikely event of an upper respiratory sample for covid-19 being false negative among patients with presymptomatic disease sars-cov-2 will have been inactivated 48 b designate and maintain clean and dirty areas 49 c place alcohol-based hand rubs on the intravenous pole to the left of the provider  spatial orientation matters 50 d place a wire basket lined with a zip closure plastic bag on the intravenous pole to the right of the provider for deposit of contaminated instruments eg laryngoscope blade and handle 49 e create a closed lumen intravenous system and use hub disinfection 5152 prevent bacterial infection and coronavirus viremia 53 f double glove before touching the patients nosemouth and remove the outer glove following contact eg placement of a nasal cannula 54 55 56 g after patient positioning wipe down equipment and high-touch surfaces with disinfection wipes that contain a quaternary ammonium compound and alcohol 404956 57 58 59 h provide data feedback by surveillance of enterococcus staphylococcus aureus klebsiella acinetobacter pseudomonas and enterobacter spp eskape transmission to provide feedback on the application of these basic preventive measures 60 61 62 these processes ah are known because they significantly reduce the transmission of pathogenic bacteria and viruses 37 38 39 4042 43 44 4549 50 51 52545563 they are important but not unique to covid-19 as an illustrative example orthopedic surgery under spinal blockade neither produces aerosol from the nosethroat nor uses general anesthesia yet patient nasal decontamination reduces surgical site infections 46 the consequence of covid-19 is that they are more important than ever to follow because infection affects not only the patients but also the ambulatory surgery center staff and surgeonsprocedures performed without general anesthesia can be facilitated to increase daily surgical caseload and therefore reduce surgical queues management strategies include case scheduling for surgeons to have days with only monitored anesthesia care or regional anesthesia 64 using block areas with registered nurses trained to assist with regional anesthesia reduces operating room time and increases throughput 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 the use of peripheral regional anesthesia reduces how long patients stay in the phase i post-anesthesia care unit 697374 and their time to discharge 75 monitored anesthesia care also facilitates bypass of the phase i post-anesthesia care unit 76 77 78 this quicker discharge and greater throughput can thereby facilitate surgeons completing more cases per day and thereby provide care to more patientsthere may be constraints on performing ambulatory surgery due to inadequate supplies of personal protective equipment potentially some anesthesia machines may be out of service awaiting terminal decontamination due to their use for covid-19 patients who developed respiratory failure however sedation peripheral nerve blocks and spinal anesthetics can be performed safely although not ideally in the absence of an anesthesia machine regardless essential surgery needs to be completed to reduce the progressively growing surgical queues shifts should be as long as reasonable eg 12 h 1 considerable data show that with this approach ambulatory surgery centers have underutilized capacity extending working hours to 5 pm or 7 pm would contribute substantively to reducing the national surgical queues which are progressively growing the united states 2010 national ambulatory surgery survey included outpatient surgery performed at hospitals and unaffiliated free-standing surgery centers 36 there was 64 se 1 of all operating room time completed before 12 noon and 90 se 1 before 300 pm 36 data for all surgery in hospitals in iowa 2013 through 2015 were studied 79 among the 117 hospitals on days when a surgeon performed at least one ambulatory surgery case they performed only 1 or 2 cases total for 77 se 2 of such days and just 1 case for 54 se 2 79 this shows available capacity for more surgery because those single cases were of brief duration eg the most common being repair initial inguinal hernia age 5 years or older reducible 79as context from above general anesthesia was provided in 31 of ambulatory surgery visits in the usa in 2006 32 general anesthetics accounted for 28 se 2 of the anesthesia minutes among ambulatory surgery procedures performed in the usa in 2010 with an anesthesiologist andor certified registered nurse anesthetist 33 this section does not apply to surgical procedures with airway aerosol production eg thoracic surgerythe infection control steps summarized in section 3 apply after tracheal intubation deposit the laryngoscope blade and handle in the designated wire basket 49 double glove before intubation and remove the outer glove after depositing the blade 54 55 56 because a multimodal bundle alone ag is insufficient for infection control monitor s aureus transmission for data feedback and to mitigate intervention fatigue 40 use a standard behavioral methodology 63 that works in the high task density and fast-paced operating room environments 5080 and provide feedback that further reduces transmission events 40 the optimization of this sampling is known 81sars-cov-2 is transmitted through respiratory droplets eg coughing sneezing causing environmental contamination 82 there are patients with minimal or ambiguous symptoms eg occasional cough but harboring sars-cov-2 in their respiratory system based on radiological imaging 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 estimated false-negative rates of oropharyngeal testing based on patients with disease diagnosed by chest computerized tomography are 17 635 24 29 1551 25 41 4131014 26 and 63 384610 27 pooled 48 8181710 the estimates are heterogeneous because upper airway involvement declines as the disease progresses 2223 bronchioalveolar lavage 93 and sputum samples 72 have lower false-negative rates than oropharyngeal samples 32 28 asymptomatic patients will cause environmental contamination not only during tracheal intubation 83 but also after tracheal extubationfor example to apply these results to the university of iowas phase i postanesthesia care unit approximately 13 of the 1000 presymptomatic or asymptomatic patients screened for essential procedures have been sars-cov-2 positive by rt-pcr as context between march 31 and april 7 there were 33 of the 49 other us states with a greater weekly increase in the incidence per capita of covid-19 infection 84 using a 0 false-positive rate and a 29 false negative rate observed clinically 25 less than the pooled value of 48 1 patient in 182 would be expected to test negative yet be infected1
sars-cov-2 is detected on plastic and stainless steel surfaces eg in the phase i post-anesthesia care unit for 4 days 48 the university of iowas ambulatory surgery center has 12 operating rooms based on 4 cases per day per room and 50 of cases being general anesthetics approximately 41 of 4-day periods would be expected to have at least one exposure event1
viral pathogen survival on environmental surfaces extends for several days sars-cov-2 can survive for at least 3 days on a variety of materials commonly encountered in ors eg stainless steel plastic 85 covid-19 infectivity cannot be accounted for population-wise without including environmental contamination 86 the necessary environmental cleaning 5859 applies to the area around the patient including the phase i post-anesthesia care unit we do not think that ambulatory surgery centers will be able to sustain reporting and contact tracing for all providers and patients exposed to a nurse or anesthesia provider who develops covid-19 several days after their shift for covid-19 the mean days from infection to symptom onset is 5 days 95 confidence interval 4 to 7 with 95th percentile 12 days 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 87 the economic implication is that patients should have their initial phase i post-anesthesia recovery in the operating room where they had surgery by initial we mean the period of coughing disorientation and sometimes bronchospasm right after tracheal extubation 1the cost of having patients undergoing initial phase i recovery in the operating room need not be as large as it may seem apropos this recommendation there are very few phase i post-anesthesia care units in japan 88 even for long-duration cases patients in japanese hospitals spend vastly less time in the operating room than do patients at hospitals spend in phase i post-anesthesia care units 89 ambulatory surgery cases with an anesthesiologist andor nurse anesthetist are brief averaging 61 min se 2 min of operating room time by national us survey 36 the incidences of prolonged times to extubation meaning end of surgery to tracheal extubation are negligibly small for cases of such brief duration 9091 there are multiple studies from the late 1990s and early 2000s on the use of different anesthetic techniques to achieve faster initial recovery for the patient to have a very brief phase i post-anesthesia recovery time 7692 93 94 95 96 97 anesthesia providers might need to alter some of their routine anesthetic practices accordingly regardless having patients initially recover in operating rooms is a considerable change administratively for ambulatory surgery centers in north america that do not routinely bypass the phase i postanesthesia care unit among their patients undergoing general anesthesiafor many otolaryngology gastroenterology general surgery oral surgery interventional pulmonary and thoracic surgery cases etc the changes described in the preceding two sections would be necessary additionally there would be multimodal environmental decontamination after each case 1 this process includes treating operating rooms using a source generating ultraviolet-c 9899 or equivalently fast technology to supplement personnel cleaning usual operating room and recovery cleaning practices especially for noncritical items are often inadequate 5859100101 for many ambulatory surgery centers this will increase turnover times considerably regardless nearly all operating rooms are positively pressurized with respect to the external environment meaning that contamination is spread away from the operating room table to the walls and exterior even when doors are open 102 103 104 105statistical methods to help the ambulatory surgery center determine how many housekeepers are needed have been developed and validated 106 107 108 109 these methods are useful in part because they are non-intuitive first determine the times of the workday when there are the largest number of unusually long turnovers using one-hour epochs 106 making graphs or tables of the counts by hour will be helpful because the workdays should be far longer than typical before covid-19 for ambulatory surgery centers 3679 this increase in the length of the workday will occur because long-shifts reduce the amount of personal protective equipment used and reduce patient queues for care 1 the graphs and tables help managers determine the times when the largest numbers of housekeepers are needed 106 next each increase in the number of housekeepers andor turnover teams will be associated with less overall mean minutes that teams work later than planned 107109 and lesser probability of prolonged turnovers 107108 however the relationship is asymptotic such that each increase in the numbers of housekeepers or teams has progressively lesser benefit 107109 a useful statistic to use for managerial decisions is the mean daily minutes when the number of simultaneous turnovers is exceeding the number of housekeepers or teams 107 the statistic is related directly to the minutes that teams will work later than planned 107 the difference is taken in the statistic calculated with and without the addition of 1 more housekeeper or team 107as we think will be apparent the economic effect of covid-19 on daily operating room management of ambulatory surgery centers after the acute crisis period likely will be for those operating rooms being used for surgery with aerosol production to have the sometimes frustratingly slow performance of hospitals surgical suites we think that a good analogy would be the management of cases on saturdays the reason is that among us surgical suites on saturdays anesthesia and nursing teams often can have each team working in 2 operating rooms allowing cleaning and setup while they are caring for another patient 8 we previously published a review article for making operating room management decisions to reduce the hours that staffs work late for use by surgical suites with long 10 h workdays 110 the methods apply directly in the current paper we do not repeat this extensive and fully covered topic 110 rather we make three points useful as ambulatory surgery centers learn how to apply the sciencefirst a common challenge in applying principles to achieve maximal operating room utilization balanced versus preventing the hours that teams work late over-utilized time is that different operating room managers reasonably disagree about how much time is worth saving to warrant moving a case from one room to another eg 15 min or 30 min 111112 such heterogeneity of perspective on decisions can be neglected because turnover times will be 45 min or longer for most casessecond usually making decisions to reduce the hours that staff work late while filling the operating rooms depends on calculating the operating room allocations meaning the hours into which cases are scheduled 110113114 that characteristically would be done by the combination of service and day of the week 110113114 this usually is important because there are substantial differences among combinations of service and day of the week 115 after the peak of the covid-19 pandemic has subsided at facilities with a nearly unlimited queue of patients for surgery and with staff working at most 12 h daily this mathematics can be skipped these dual objectives will need to be met while relying on few historical data 116 117 118 119 120 for cases operating room times by procedure because previously phase i post-anesthesia care was not in the operating rooms ambulatory surgery centers ie facilities performing many brief cases 36 should schedule cases into operating room hours selected by policy eg 11 h calculated for the end of the day to finish reliably by 12-h 121122 case scheduling would pack as much as possible into those hours while not causing over-utilized time 110112123third decision-making to maximize productivity is both difficult and counter-intuitive because of the conditions that will apply for these operating rooms long workdays long-duration cases ie including phase i recovery in the room and long turnover times 110 physicians and non-physicians tend to make operating room management decisions based on rules of thumb such heuristics perform poorly and people do not realize the extent to which their case scheduling decisions are suboptimal 108124 125 126 127 128 the knowledge and problem-solving skills to make those decisions well are not learned on the job by experience 108124 125 126 127 128 but rather by study eg a formal course in operating room management 129 130 131 132 133 134we performed a narrative review of studies to predict the future economic effect of covid-19 on daily operating room management of ambulatory surgery centers after the acute crisis period ends in their region but covid-19 remains prevalent the review suggests the following targeted strategies for facilities using rt-pcr covid-19 screening preoperatively but not chest computerized tomography 111215 16 17 18 19use multimodal perioperative infection control practices eg including patient decontamination and monitor performance eg s aureus transmission from a patient to the environment as a marker of behavioral performance for details see references 1 and 40 and infographic checklist and videos prepared by the anesthesia patient safety foundation 135 these infection control recommendations are unchanged from our initial study 1dedicate most operating rooms daily to ambulatory procedures that are not airway aerosol producing and do not need general anesthesia 32 33 34 35 36 increase throughput of these cases by using block areas with registered nurses to assist in the performance of regional anesthesia 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 plan long-duration workdays eg 12 h to reduce the impact of personnel exposed to asymptomatic patients with covid-19 and to reduce the large queues of patients needing essential surgery 1136 bypass the phase i post-anesthesia care unit by appropriate choices of anesthetic approach and drugs 73 74 75 76 77 78 these recommendations are relaxed from our initial study 1 because of the findings on the timing of viral load in the upper airway and the effectiveness of patient decolonization drugs for inactivating sars-cov-2until a low-risk cure or effective prevention for covid-19 is discovered or a safe and widely used vaccine is developed surgical procedures that do not result in aerosol production but for which general anesthesia is administered should have initial phase i post-anesthesia recovery in the operating room where the surgery was performed consider following anesthetic practices that achieve fast initial recovery 8992 93 94 95 96 97when the surgical procedure results in aerosol production eg bronchoscopy have phase i recovery in the operating room and use multimodal environmental decontamination after each case 1 use statistical methods to plan for the long resulting turnover times 106 107 108 109 whenever possible have the anesthesia and nursing teams work in more than one room so that they are doing one surgical case while the other room is being cleaned
although our paper is limited to ambulatory surgery we do not think that this is an important limitation healthcare exists to provide care to the population of patients because one patient is not more important than another brief duration essential procedures should take precedence over longer ones because more patients will receive care ambulatory surgery cases with anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist are brief averaging 61 min se 2 min of operating room time and 72 min se 2 min of total recovery time to discharge by national us survey 36 thus performing cases in ambulatory surgery centers especially those without general anesthesia serves the objective of increasing societal utilitywhen patients have initial phase i post-anesthesia care in the operating room after general anesthesia or surgery with aerosol production the anesthesia provider could staff the recovery that would be logical if they would not go right away to another room to start a case if they would start another case in another room the post-anesthesia care unit nurse could come to the room as done for some regional anesthetics 64 that would however increase exposure of more healthcare workers to each patient during the period of airborne precautions and consume more personal protective equipment 1we have not addressed general anesthesia andor airway aerosolizing surgical procedures among patients who had covid-19 and subsequently had two negative tests ie the current method to assess that an individual no longer is contagious we are unaware of sufficient data on developed immunity and its influence on subsequent infection we do not think that this lack of direct consideration would have an effect however on the principles ie this does not represent a practical limitation to our workthis study was funded in part by the 1013039100000080anesthesia patient safety foundation and by the department of anesthesia 1013039100008893university of iowa

summarizes the proposed safety measures for the food sector during the pandemic fig 1a emphasizing the most critical precautions needed for each stage of the food supply chain from farm to fork fig 1b actions are grouped in workers medical condition eg stay home if sick personal hygiene eg wash hands disinfection of surfaces keeping working environments clean food preparation and delivery and finally social distancing although these measures apply in all five stages of the food chain most precautions are critically necessary at the last stages eg consumption this observation is generated by the fact that the more we move to the final stages of the food supply chain the more people potential sources of infection are involved moreover it is of the highest importance for the food sector to ensure that the food reaching consumers plate is safe and does not risk their health in any step of the process eg even at the moment of deliverybesides there are precaution measures eg during food preparation that mostly apply to the consumption stage at the beginning of the crisis many restaurants cafeterias and health authorities in central europe stopped serving rare steaks and meats as a general precaution measure euractiv 2020 against viruses and pathogens even though foodborne transmission of sars-cov-2 is unsupported by scientific evidence moreover in the united states for instance some of the largest beef-packing and meat processing companies and announced plant closures reiley 2020 nonetheless these plants closed when employees tested positive for covid-19 not because of the virus transmission from raw meat this is why fda did not anticipate that food products need to be recalled from the market fda 2020ca few weeks later the majority of restaurants and cafeterias around the world lockdown and remain functional only for take-away or delivery services to this line the transmission of sars-cov-2 is monitored closely by the food safety authorities around the world like the european food safety authority efsa and the united states food and drug administration fda both organizations agree that up to now the 21st of april 2020 there is no evidence that food is a likely route of transmission however they continue to gather information related to the potential persistence of the virus on foodsfood was not a transmission route in previous outbreaks mers and sars-cov efsa 2020 fda 2020c while it is known that the acidic conditions of the stomach ph  35 inactivate sars-cov coronavirus darnell et al 2004 both mers and sars-cov which possibly originated from bats crossed the species barrier and infected humans through an intermediate host which could be a domestic animal a wild animal or a domesticated wild animal suggesting that transmission of sars-cov-2 could happen in a like manner lu et al 2015 based on that some eating and cooking habits may be a risk factor for the reemergence of the virus into the human population cheng et al 2007coronavirus may reach fresh food products eg vegetables fruits or bakery or food packaging through an infected person who is sneezing or coughing directly on them transmission appears to be possible if the virus is transferred shortly afterward via the hands or the food itself to the mucous membranes of the mouth throat or eyes bfr 2020 as a study showed physical contact and shared food during a conference resulted in a cluster of covid-19 patients in singapore pung et al 2020 similarly to sars-cov and mers coronaviruses studies for sars-cov-2 showed that the virus is highly stable at 4 c and it is expected to have similar behavior to its predecessors at freezing temperatures meaning it could remain infectious at 20 c for up to 2 years who 2020b however as previous studies demonstrated coronaviruses are thermolabile sars-cov can be inactivated after incubation for 15 min at 75 c while mers is inactivated after incubation for 1 min at 65 c darnell et al 2004 leclercq et al 2014 in a like manner sars-cov-2 found to be inactive after 5 minutes incubation at 70 c chin et al 2020 these outcomes suggest that normal cooking temperatures 70 c are sufficient for viral inactivation but transmission from frozen food may still be possible this is why thorough hand washing after handling raw food is imperative furthermore the likelihood is even lower for foods packaged or not that are shipped over days at the room frozen or refrigerated temperatures bfr 2020 additionally according to centers for disease control and prevention cdc and environmental protection agency epa drinking water likewise food is not considered as a way of the spread of sars-cov-2 and the typical water treatment methods are sufficient against the virus cdc 2020b epa 2020to minimize the risk from touching food potentially exposed to coronavirus handling of packages and goods should be followed by hand washing or using hand sanitizer seymour et al 2020 fda has also suggested that good hygiene practices as well as cleaning and sanitization of kitchens and restaurants surfaces are preferred precaution measures compared to the environmental monitoring of sars-cov-2 fda 2020a taps door handles refrigerator handles and other areas of high touch should be subject to frequent and effective cleaning the personnel involved in the preparation of food should be encouraged to adopt standard hygiene practices used to control known foodborne viruses and bacteria these include handling carefully raw animal products to avoid cross-contamination with other foods washing vegetables and fruit before eating cooking eggs or meat thoroughly and covering nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing among others safefood 2020 since current evidence shows that individuals who are symptomatic comprise the most significant risk of sars-cov-2 transmission food businesses should be following employee health department recommendations and policies to keep those individuals at home seymour et al 2020 the usage of gloves and masks in the food industry can also be useful in reducing the spread of covid-19 but only if appropriately used who 2020b takeout drive-thru and delivery of food are also considered good risk management practices especially for high-risk populations eg older adults as the number of touchpoints is reduced university of florida 2020 consumers and individuals should also wash their hands thoroughly before eating as well as after changing a childs diaper touching animals or using the toilet who 2020ewould these measures be adequate in the post-lockdown period as of the april 21 2020 strict rules placed on peoples movements are applied to limit the spread of covid-19 these restrictions peoples freedom and disruptions to food environments give even more reason to ensure that everyone has the right to adequate food and the right to health on the other hand while grocers and supermarkets have become a confronting barometer of pandemics scale shopping of food is one of the only practices with what people knew as normal life unscn 2020 after lockdown food service businesses as the last actor of the food supply chain will have to operate again under pressure prioritizing the health of the workers in the sector and their outcomes fao 2020 at the same time they will have to face consumers phobia for transmission the safety and hygienic conditions of animal-based food sources during retailing and cooking in big local markets and especially wet markets are challenging to be monitored by authorities nevertheless laws and regulations concerning safety in food markets should be re-evaluated as poor practices such as wildlife trade continue to be practiced in inadequately regulated sites around the world galanakis 2020 yuan et al 2020 taking into account the status quo of food safety within the covid-19 pandemic and the forthcoming post-lockdown period the need for developing accurate and fast tools for the detection of sars-cov-2 in food and working environment is emergingthe role of the environment in the covid-19 pandemic indicates the diverse needs of applied research that should be met to effectively control outbreaks of novel enveloped viruses wigginton  boehm 2020 once spread in the air virus particles are exposed to different environmental conditions eg air temperature and relative humidity influencing their inactivation rates casanova jeon rutala weber  sobsey 2010 casanova rutala weber  sobsey 2010 kim et al 2018 other factors such as the specific strain of the virus and the type of surface play a crucial role who 2020c however especially for built environments the proper disinfection of toilet areas sanitization of surfaces open space and window ventilation can effectively limit the concentration of sars-cov-2 dietz et al 2020 liu et al 2020 this practice is also supported by a study conducted in a restaurant inside a building without windows in china in this study 10 out of 83 customers became ill with covid-19 at the same time smear samples from the air-conditioning of the restaurant that tested with a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for sars-cov-2 found to be negative the airborne transmission was considered as the origin of the outbreak however as distances among the first documented patient patient a1 and other affected persons were longer than 1 m it was underlined that the air circulation caused by the air-conditioning might have aided the droplet transmission and the covid-19 spread among the customers fig 2
 lu et al 2020although not sure how long sars-cov-2 survives on air and surfaces it seems possible to behave like other coronaviruses eg that of sars-cov van doremalen et al 2020 a recent review discussing the survival of human coronaviruses on surfaces noted large variability from 2 hours to 9 days kampf et al 2020 furthermore according to a recent study conducted by van doremalen et al 2020 sars-cov-2 remains viable in aerosols for 3 hours but still being detected on surfaces even after 72 hours however after a specific time the load of the virus is importantly reduced eg the viability of sars-cov-2 on stainless steel and plastic is 56 and 68 hours respectively in contrast no viable sars-cov-2 measured after 4 and 24 hours application on copper and cardboard respectively an effective inactivation of sars-cov-2 could be achieved using common disinfectants eg 6271 ethanol 05 hydrogen peroxide or 01 sodium hypochlorite l kampf et al 2020the sars-cov-2 rna shedding pattern suggests that the virus is replicating in the gastrointestinal tract woelfel et al 2020 and thus may be found in stool samples similar to sars-cov leung et al 2003 besides recent findings suggest that the sars-cov-2 is capable of infecting human and bat intestinal organoids zhou et al 2020 once aerosolized sewage-contaminated with the virus could potentially expose a large number of people niva 2020 sars-cov-2 was recently detected in sewage samples of different cities in the netherlands medema et al 2020 in spain randazzo et al 2020 and australia ahmed et al 2020 in any case more studies are needed to explore the survival of sars-cov-2 in water or sewage the sars-cov-2 may be inactivated significantly faster than non-enveloped human enteric viruses eg rotavirus hepatitis a norovirus and adenoviruses with a known waterborne transmission high or low ph sunlight heat and disinfectants eg chlorine facilitate die-off who 2020eat this moment the most exposed environments in coronavirus are the healthcare settings there is an increasing number of studies showing extensive environmental contamination in covid-19 patients rooms guo et al 2020 ong et al 2020 santarpia et al 2020 yung et al 2020 given the environmental persistence of the virus van doremalen et al 2020 social distancing measures and quarantine of exposed persons are considered imperative not only in hospitals but in nonhealthcare settings such as workplaces and schools the importance of these measures has been studied regarding the influenza pandemic fong et al 2020 concerning covid-19 a recent study demonstrated via mathematical models the transmission dynamics of sars-cov-2 in the post-pandemic period and suggested that prolonged or periodic social distancing may be necessary for the next few years kissler et al 2020as the global interest for coronavirus is focused on human health the full impact of the pandemic on food supply chain and food industries is not yet known however the adverse effects on food systems and people along the food supply chain are already evident for this reason the development of detection tools for sars-cov-2 that can be applied to foods is essential to ensure food safety and prevent the disruption of food supply chains the reliable detection of viruses in foods remains a challenge due to the heterogeneous distribution of viral particles the low viral load and the non-optimal tedious isolation bosch et al 2018 for this purpose different methodologies have been suggested such as molecular detection assays based on rt-qpcr bosch et al 2018 enzyme-free immunosorbent assay wu et al 2016 and nano-elisa wu et al 2019currently the two predominant laboratory testing methods for sars-cov-2 detection are the molecular test which is used to identify the presence of the virus and the serological tests which detect either the antibodies against the virus or the viral antigens table 1

who 2020d worldometer 2020approximately 25 years after their discovery in 1915 ref 1 the use of phages to answer fundamental questions about the mechanisms of inheritance began taking advantage of the ease with which they could be manipulated2 between the years 1940 and 1970 phage experiments laid much of the groundwork for the science of molecular biology that science once dubbed modern as distinct from classical biology has long since been assimilated into the textbooks however recent research indicates that the historical contributions that phage studies have made to molecular biology might be overshadowed by their future influence on biology in general and on genetics in particular phages have important roles in global ecology and bacterial pathogenicity these emerging roles together with the increasing number of recent publications on phage genomics highlight the need for a timely assessment of phage biology and its bright future here i summarize the studies of the molecular ecological and evolutionary biology of phages that have led to this renaissance of interest and define some crucial unanswered questions
background
bacteriophages also known as phages are viruses that infect bacteria as with all viruses phages are infectious particles that have at least two components nucleic acid and protein if a phage invades a susceptible bacterial cell the phage or at least its nucleic acid enters the cell and triggers a cycle of phage production fig 1 during this cycle the cell is reprogrammed to become a phage factory in which the components of the biosynthetic apparatus such as ribosomes and atp generators are diverted from their normal tasks in bacterial growth the various pathways for reprogramming are initiated by phage-specified proteins which are translated from phage mrna that is made after infectionthe temporal programme is ordered and regulated generally nucleic-acid replication occurs first followed by the synthesis of structural proteins of the phage particle new phage particles are then assembled and are later released from the cell for most of the classically studied coliphages release is effected by the disruption of the cell envelope and sudden lysis of the cell the contents of which including the new phage particles spill out into the medium the whole cycle can last 40 minutes and produce 100 new phages fig 1this type of lytic cycle is the only mode of reproduction for many phages other temperate phages have an alternative life cycle in which a fraction of the infected cells go into the lytic cycle whilst other cells survive infection and permanently harbour the phage genome in a quiescent form prophage cells that harbour a prophage are known as lysogenic certain agents such as ultraviolet light can induce lysogenic cells to re-enter the lytic cycle fig 1one reason that phages have been useful in research is the ease of synchronizing the lytic cycle in a population of cells so that the progression of molecular events can be measured over the whole culture synchronization might be achieved either by simultaneous infection or by the induction of phage development in lysogenic cells a second reason is the ease with which mutations that affect specific stages of the cycle can be isolated and analysedphages are as varied in size and form as the viruses that infect eukaryotes several formal classification schemes have been proposed but none is widely useful or known to reflect phylogeny table 1 summarizes basic information on common model phages and illustrates some of the diversity in phage morphology and lifestyle
evolution
the phylogeny of viruses has eluded generations of virologists modern methods have redefined the questions rather than achieved definitive answers in closely related groups isolates can be arranged by the degree of similarity but whether all viruses or even all phages constitute a monophyletic group remains uncertainthe development of ideas starting in the pre-genome era is illustrated by work on phages and their relatives in the 1950s numerous temperate phages lambdoids were discovered that resembled the phage- morphologically and could recombine with it electron microscopy of heteroduplexes coupled with the results from genetic crosses verified that the lambdoid phages have a common genetic map but show diverse specificities for properties such as integration repression and host range these studies also showed that any two lambdoid phages are similar in some segments of their genomes and dissimilar in others with abrupt transitions from similarity to dissimilarity3extensive dna sequencing has confirmed this general picture it has also shown that segments with altered specificity such as repressor genes although differing greatly in sequence are nonetheless orthologous comparing all the known lambdoid phages there is little doubt that they have undergone extensive recombination in nature mixing and matching heterologous specificity determinants sequencing also verifies the sharpness of most boundaries between segments of close similarity and those of extreme dissimilarityhendrix4 offered the most comprehensive interpretation of these results if different closely related phages such as lambdoids encounter one another in nature they can recombine the frequency of recombination depends on the degree of similarity of the two partners at the recombination points so between any two phages shared segments of homology can serve as recombinational linkers and even identities of oligonucleotide length can create preferred exchange points none of this is new however breakage and joining sometimes occur even if there is no homology  which represents new ground  and over evolutionary time this happens often enough to generate the sharp boundaries between homology and non-homology that are observed in phages most such new junctions should be lethal or deleterious but natural selection has preserved some benign combinationsthis raises the question of how the parental phages that give rise to a new junction came to be so different from one another however before addressing this issue we leave the myopic consideration of lambdoid phages to look at what genome analysis implies about phages that are essentially unrelated even those that come from highly diverse hostson that level the message is clear natural phage genomes are frequently chimeric in origin and contain genes that have been transferred over great evolutionary distances5 as with the genesis of new junctions among the lambdoid phages the potential number of such transfers must greatly exceed what has passed through the sieve of natural selection among the more marked examples of molecular chimerism is phage n15 whereas most of its phage genes are related to and in the same order as the genes of a lambdoid phage its prophage form persists as a linear plasmid that includes sequences that are related to the f plasmid of escherichia coli as well as to coliphages p1 and p4 ref 6this widespread chimerism forces us to believe that phage genomes collectively constitute a pool that is subject to continual mixing this pool includes groups such as the lambdoid phages in which mixing is even more frequent however some gene blocks that are found in lambdoid phages might have resided elsewhere for much of their history and have diverged over long periods during which they were not subject to frequent recombination with other lambdoid phages it should be noted that molecular clock estimates indicate that some allelic variants of -genes diverged long before the existence of e coli which is the host of  perhaps even as long ago as the branching of bacteria from archaea and eukaryotes47 there are many reasons to question the accuracy of dating by molecular clocks8 however the antiquity of viral genes is also indicated by an independent line of evidence9 there are marked examples such as adenoviruses and reoviruses in which the morphology of the viral capsid is similar in a group that includes animal viruses plant viruses and bacteriophages these similarities extend from the shapes of individual proteins to the overall morphology of the virus particle composed of several protein species and seem unlikely to represent evolutionary convergence this indicates a common ancestry for reoviruses and phage 6 for example although the rna and protein sequences show no significant similarities and therefore must have diverged anciently perhaps before the separation of the main domains of the living worldone characteristic of a phage family such as the lambdoids is a common genetic map the main determinants for structural and regulatory elements in the phage genome are present in the same order throughout the family as discussed previously these elements have sometimes been replaced by homologues or analogues from other phages however at some time in the past these genomes must have come into being probably by the merging of smaller genomes with more limited functions so the original lambdoid phage might have derived its replication genes from one source its lysis genes from a second source and its structural genes from a third genes might have been added one at a time or in larger blocks34the exciting point is that such gene addition is not just a long ago fait accompli but is an active continuing process the hendrix group4 have identified segments of the genomes of lambdoid phages that seem to have been spliced into the phage genome recently these segments dubbed morons typically include a single gene which is often of unknown function and generally differ in base composition from the rest of the phage genome each moron is present in some lambdoid phages and absent from others the incorporation by phages of toxin genes and longer pathogenicity islands might be an example of the same kind of process see latera complete understanding of the natural dynamics that underlie the recombinational origin of new phage types will require more specific information on the role of natural selection  not only the elimination of maladapted types as mentioned earlier but also active selection for the few superior variants further efforts in this direction are desirable not just for their intrinsic interest but also as models for viruses that infect eukaryotic hosts for example it is well documented that members of the coronavirus group which has attracted attention recently through the emergence of a deadly new human pathogen that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome sars undergo frequent recombination in nature1011
ecology
the long-held suspicion that phages are ubiquitous throughout the prokaryotic world has been confirmed as our knowledge has expanded to include more phages and phage-related sequences in prokaryotic genomes the numerical abundance of phage-like particles in aquatic ecosystems generally exceeds that of prokaryotic cells and might represent 10 of the biomass of those cells furthermore as documented in recent reviews121314 there is increasing evidence to indicate that a large fraction of these visible particles comprises viable infectious phagesat the base of the natural food chain are the photosynthetic microbes green algae and cyanobacteria for both of these groups a substantial fraction of their biomass is liberated as dissolved organic material by viral infection heterotrophic consumers of dissolved organic matter are also frequently killed by viral infection no account of the natural food web that omits bacteriophages is even close to being complete1516
models for molecular biology
molecular machines the focus of biochemistry has advanced from chemical catalysis by individual proteins to mechanical processes that are carried out by molecular assemblages phage systems provide many instructive examplesthe forces that drive dna injection during infection by the large-tailed dna phages have long eluded direct identification for many common phages such as  and t4 this remains the case more progress has been made with phages such as t7 which inject their dna slowly the initial step is the injection of t7 proteins from the phage particle to form a channel across the cell envelope that conducts dna into the cell by a process that is apparently enzymatic17 next the dna is pulled into the cell by transcription with an effectively stationary rna polymerase first host then phage polymerase that reels dna through itself1819 the type i restriction enzyme eco ki can replace rna polymerase to reel in dna20in assembling large double-stranded dna dsdna phages viral dna can be pulled into preformed heads by the portal protein that is located at one vertex of the icosahedron detailed studies of the physical mechanism were made on bacillus phage 29 ref 21 the dodecameric portal protein rotates in the protein shell of the phage in steps of 12  which reel in phage dna and are powered by atp hydrolysis fig 2 the forces that act on individual dna molecules that are being packaged into the heads of 29 have been accurately measured and show that the 29 portal protein generates one of the strongest known molecular motors22as well as such motors phages use numerous molecular machines the insertion of phage dna into the chromosome during lysogenization is a good example several molecules of -integrase form an assemblage the intasome that binds to a specific segment of phage dna recruits the bacterial insertion sites into the complex then makes concerted single-strand cuts in the two dnas the strand cutting proceeds through the covalent joining of a 3 phosphate to a tyrosine of the integrase protein the terminal three bases of the free 5 ends then rotate to exchange partners followed by ligation with removal of the integrase protein from the 3 ends to form a holliday junction the assemblage then undergoes a rearrangement isomerization and resolves the holliday structure by cutting the two previously uncut strands on the other side of the junction which allows the exchange of partners by the freed 5 ends followed by resealing23 the reverse reaction excision from the chromosome requires a second phage-specified protein excisionase and proceeds by an analogous mechanism which is however not a simple chemical reversal of the integration reaction24probably the most important recent breakthrough was the discovery that both initiation and resolution involve strand swapping of the free 5 ends as described earlier22 it was previously thought that holliday junctions were formed by re-ligation at the cutting site followed by branch migration to the resolution site 7-bps removed since then important progress has been made on the nature of the initial dnaprotein interactions2526 and the characterization of intermediate stages of the dnaprotein complex2728gene regulation in a series of incisive experiments ptashne and colleagues defined the modus operandi of the lysislysogeny decision in phage as a model genetic switch that operates in the right operator sites or29 fig 3 this work has recently been extended by the discovery that the natural switch is strongly influenced by the simultaneous interaction of the repressor with the leftward operator ol which is more than 3-kb away303132 this was predicted by the finding that the repressor assembles to form octamers as required for cooperative binding33our initial understanding of in vivo switching was incomplete in another respect the earlier work showed that the or switch by itself is bistable the ci gene which encodes the repressor is transcribed leftward from or whereas the secondary repressor cro and other gene products come from the rightward message both repressor and cro can bind to three sites in or and shut-off transcription in both directions however one or the other will eventually get the upper hand if repressor synthesis is established cro synthesis is shut off and vice versa the system therefore provides an elegant model for how switching events might be controlled in other contexts such as in cell differentiation in multicellular eukaryotes2834as for the phage system it might seem gratuitous to question whether the crucial events have been identified as the simple model seems to provide a sufficient explanation the shut-off of repressor synthesis by cro depends on cro binding to the or3 operator site which could be the crucial step in activating the lytic cycle in this view the establishment of repression depends on a race between cro and the repressor however it has been known from early on that another protein cii which acts at the promoter site pre is crucial in repressor establishment35 and that cro that is bound to the other or sites or2 and or1 decreases cii production this makes it equally possible that the decisive race is between cro and cii with or3 having at most an ancillary rolethe definitive experiments are yet to be done a comprehensive modelling of the switch is available36 which agrees with the published data on lysogenization frequencies as a function of average phage input37 the complex regulation of the switch is shown in fig 3 however in this pioneering work most of the kinetic parameters are estimates rather than direct measurements this work underscores the potential for modelling whole-cell physiology with the present high-throughput data on transcription rates and protein abundance still lacking is a complete model that predicts the strong overshoot in repressor concentration that is observed during lysogenization34 because the rate of repressor synthesis from cii-stimulated pre is much higher than that observed in a lysogen it seems unlikely that cro that is bound to or3 can prevent repressor establishment if cii synthesis achieves its maximum rate
tools and pests
phage therapy following their discovery phages were regarded as possible agents to combat pathogenic bacteria as discussed by merril et al38 most early attempts at phage therapy were unsuccessful or inconclusive apparently for trivial technical reasons such as the absence of placebo controls or the rapid clearance of injected phage from the bloodstream before it had time to reach its intended target3839 with the advent of antibiotics the development and use of phage therapy almost disappeared from the western world although it continued in the soviet union and eastern europe39 as the incidence of antibiotic resistance continues to rise the field has been reactivated38 phage therapy has some inherent advantages over antibiotics in both the specificity and the ability of the agent to propagate in the desired location advantages that were seldom realized in earlier work with impure phage preparations39 as with antibiotics the efficiency is limited by bacterial mutation which will doubtless be a great challenge to future developmentat present phage therapy can be described as promising but despite its long history its ability to deliver on the promise remains to be fully shown however there have been clear successes with experimentally infected animals4041 and mathematical modelling corroborates the expectations of feasibility42 much of the earlier work was relatively crude and less controlled and the whole area was dismissed without a thorough evaluation largely because of the availability and economy of antibiotic therapy now the numerous potential problems such as the deleterious effects of the phages themselves the inactivation of phages by neutralizing antibodies and the genesis of phage-resistant mutants remain to be rigorously addressedphages as pests in the food industry in other areas that require bacterial survival under conditions of incomplete sterility such as industrial fermentation phages are the enemy phage lysis of lactic-acid bacteria has long been a nuisance in cheese factories extensive studies on phages that infect lactic-acid bacteria are continuing in many countries434445 a long time holy grail of research that is directed towards the elimination of the problem has been the isolation or engineering of stable bacterial mutants that are resistant to all of the phages that might attack a given culture4647phage display libraries there are many occasions on which molecular biologists would like to identify from a large collection of proteins or peptides those few that have some special property such as binding to a low molecular-weight ligand or to a specific site on a protein or dna molecule it is easy to fractionate the collection on the basis of its binding properties but if a binding species is rare it might be impractical to isolate enough material to determine its structurein such cases it is preferable to isolate not the protein or peptide but rather the dna that encodes it and can easily be amplified the simplest way to do this is in a system in which the fractionation process brings the dna along with the protein it encodes surface antigens on bacterial cells can be treated in this waya more powerful method is to display the protein or peptide on the surface of a phage phage particles are much smaller than bacteria so larger libraries can be screened if the library is composed of translational fusions to a protein that is abundant on the surface of a phage particle the sensitivity is high under conditions of single infection the binding properties of a phage particle are determined by the gene fusion in its dnarecent examples include fusions of domains of surface antigens of the human pathogen neisseria meningitidis onto the surface protein of phage t4 for possible use in vaccine construction and fusions of random five amino-acid sequences to identify possible binding partners for a nuclease that cuts t4 dna for packaging4849
phages in bacterial pathogenicity
it was discovered early on that in some important bacterial diseases such as diphtheria50 and botulism51 pathogenicity depends on the presence of certain prophages which generally encode toxins knowledge has accumulated gradually but the area has recently blossomed for at least two reasons first advances in eukaryotic cell biology and bacterial gene regulation allow a more profound understanding of the interaction between pathogenic bacteria and the human cell second whole-genome sequencing of pathogenic bacteria has disclosed the prevalence not only of prophages but also of pathogenicity islands that are potentially phage-related so a framework for incisive studies on phage-mediated diseases has developed5253it is easier to guess the future of the mechanistic studies than that of the evolutionary studies in which many lines of inquiry converge even from the vantage point of whole-genome sequencing the prevalence of lysogeny might be underestimated because the identification of prophages requires homology to known phages it has also long been known that complete prophages which are able to generate plaque-forming particles frequently deteriorate into incomplete defective prophages by changes that range from point mutations to extensive deletions andor insertions a particular type of defective phage  specialized transducing phages  can result from faulty excision from the chromosome which replaces some phage dna by host dna adjacent to the insertion site54 this is one mechanism whereby phages might have acquired toxin genes another is direct insertion of toxin genes into phage dna which might be transposon mediated the latter possibility is more likely if the toxin gene is not at a terminus of the prophage but rather in the middle as in the -related coliphage 933w which encodes a shiga-like toxin55the evolution of bacterial pathogenicity can only be understood by including the role of phages and pathogenicity islands prophages and pathogenicity islands seem to be closely related however assumptions about the nature of the relationship might be premature pathogenicity islands belong to a broader category of dna known as specialization islands specialization islands are blocks of contiguous genes that are distinguished by several criteria first they are dedicated to a common function such as pathogenicity which is not directly needed for simple survival second they differ from the surrounding dna in molecular statistics such as the gc content codon usage and neighbour relations third they are present in certain strains of a bacterial species and absent from others their widespread occurrence has only come to light through whole genome sequencing and their molecular statistics indicate that such elements have been derived in the relatively recent past from other bacterial species to which they might be indigenous56 their intercalation in only certain strains of the species in which they are now observed indicates the operation of an insertion mechanism such as phage integration or transposition also some islands are flanked by phage-insertion sites which technically qualifies the whole unit whatever its historical origin as a defective prophage5758this raises a host of questions for future research one scenario perhaps overly facile is that the whole unit arose in the species of origin by rearrangements of host and phage dna that it was introduced into the species in which we now find it by packing into a phage coat followed by injection and lysogenization and that in its present host it moves from one strain to another by infection and lysogenization there is at present an extreme paucity of evidence to show that the transfer among strains happens by this method rather than by genetic recombination mechanisms that affect all chromosomal genesat the other extreme we might imagine that pathogenicity islands similar to other genes that are scored as alien59 could move between species by some other mechanism perhaps transformation or conjugation and become inserted into the recipient chromosome by transposition or some other mechanism in this picture such foreign dna is frequently found inside prophages or defective prophages simply because from a bacterial perspective prophages constitute junk dna the disruption of which does not affect bacterial survival insertion of island dna into a pre-existing prophage might seem to add an unnecessary step to the mechanism of origin but that is not the case the insertion of island dna into the surrounding phage-related dna must have happened somewhere sometime and it frequently now bears no traces of known insertion processes such as transpositionfurther work should illuminate two outstanding questions first if this and other alien dna came from some distantly related donor species of bacteria what was the donor the bacterial genomes that have been sequenced so far provide only a handful of examples of lateral transfer in which both donor and recipient might be inferred  perhaps simply because not enough bacteria have yet been sequenced second is the potential mobility of the element in its present host a significant factor in the epidemiology of the diseases

a scientific field derives its interest less from what we know than from the unanswered questions that seem approachable by the available methods i have tried to indicate some such questions here many of which have been incubating for years and have been explored through more lines of evidence than could be discussed however the time is ripe to seek definitive answers with improved methods future research should include the rigorous demonstration of molecular mechanisms examination of the global impact of phages on the biosphere and studies of the evolution of bacterial hoststhe mucosal immune system must maintain composure in the presence of an onslaught of antigenic and potentially pathogenic material exposed to the outside world with in most cases only a single epithelial cell barrier protecting them our mucosal surfaces have developed a sophisticated system of immune exclusion ignorance and tolerance the best characterized of these are described in the gastrointestinal tract an understanding of immunity in the respiratory tract has lagged behind that of the gut and although numerous key components have emerged the sequence of events from initial inhalation to immune pathology in the lower respiratory tract is still unclear despite best efforts to maintain immune homeostasis respiratory inflammatory disease is common and significantly life threatening this review will highlight mechanisms that maintain lung immune homeostasis and current therapeutic efforts to contain infection-induced exaggerated acute inflammation once it occurs the respiratory tract includes the nasopharyngeal cavity trachea and larynx bronchi bronchioles and finally the alveoli organized lymphoid tissue is embedded in some but importantly not all of these stages in the respiratory tree similarly draining lymph nodes are associated with only a few of these sites the cellular composition requirements for activation and expansion dynamics of respiratory tract associated lymph nodes are virtually similar to any other lymph node and will therefore not be discussed in detail here we will focus on the regulation or de-regulation of immune cells embedded in the respiratory tract itselfconsidering the total surface area of the respiratory tract constitutive embedded organized lymphoid tissue is actually quite rare figure 1 organized structured lymphoid tissue exists in the nasal cavity of rodents nasal associated lymphoid tissue nalt as paired lymphoid structures at the entrance to the pharyngeal duct but identical structures in man remain elusive for a review see reference bienenstock and mcdermott1 organized lymphoid follicles are observed in post-mortem specimens extracted from 150 children that contain occasional germinal centers which are associated with lymphocytes in the overlying nasal epithelium and the presence of high endothelial venules however in adults such lymphoid tissue is disseminated across the whole nasal mucosa2 and is analogous to the less well-organized diffuse lymphoid tissue termed d-nalt lining the nasal passages of mice3 in man diffuse nalt develops after birth likely in response to antigen and b- and t-cell responses parallel those that occur in lymph nodes the waldeyers ring comprising the nasopharyngeal upper midline in naso-pharynx adenoids paired tubal around openings of auditory tube paired palatine either side of the oropharynx and lingual under the mucosa of the posterior third of the tongue tonsils are thought of as analogous structures to nalt but are located outside of the respiratory tract and probably also contribute to gastrointestinal immunity experiments with mice show that unlike peripheral lymphoid organs nalt develops independently of lymphotoxin- however its structure and function are perturbed in lymphotoxin--knockout mice possibly due to impaired expression of cxcl13 cc chemokine ligand19 ccl19 and ccl21 which are crucial for the recruitment and placement of lymphocytes and dendritic cells dcs4the only other organized lymphoid structure described to date located within the respiratory tract is bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue balt reviewed by bienenstock and mcdermott1 whether it routinely contributes to primary immune responses or maintenance of t- and b-cell memory in the respiratory tract is not known5 6 however a recent study in mice lacking peripheral lymphoid organs suggests that balt can initiate anti-influenza immunity and provide sufficient t cells to mediate protection against a second infection7 humoral immune responses elicited by balt are primarily mediated by immunoglobulin a iga and igg produced both locally and by balt-derived b cells that traffic to distant mucosal sites8 9 similarly located t-cell responses have been noted on the basis of these findings balt can be thought of as functionally analogous to mucosal lymphoid aggregates in the intestine present in up to 40 of children and adolescents to age 20 balt is rare in the lungs of healthy adults10 11 although originally described at the bifurcations of the bronchi immediately beneath the epithelium12 13 in the absence of antigen balt is rare14 and may be controlled or limited by regulatory t cells15 inflammation in the lung is associated with balt neogenesis and is described in a variety of pulmonary moyron-quiroz et al7 and references therein and non-pulmonary16 inflammatory conditions homeostatic chemokines including ccl19 and ccl21 in mice are required for development of such inducible balt ibalt4 the extent of ibalt appears to depend on the level of inflammation in the local microenvironment and suggests that it is developed when required mice lacking oxidoreductases that protect from oxidative stress display heightened cellularity and inflammatory cytokines and ibalt is more prevalent17 whether it remains associated with larger airways and persists long after resolution of inflammation is still uncertainintriguingly mice lacking peripheral lymph nodes and spleen but retaining ibalt clear influenza infection albeit slower and survive higher doses of virus than do immune-competent mice such lymphotoxin-knockout mice show slower generation of influenza-specific t cells that eventually reach wild-type levels similar to antibody isotype switching to igg and t-cell cytokine production and effector function this indicates that immune responses generated in ibalt although slower are protective and potentially less pathologenic7 this may represent a qualitative difference between local and peripherally derived immune cells or simply reflect the reduced magnitude of immunity when ibalt is the only inducing immune compartment regardless in the case of lung immunity secondary lymphoid tissues are not essential for the maintenance of immunological memory since a pulmonary infection with influenza virus is handled equally as efficiently in their absence18to date no studies have shown that organized embedded lymphoid tissue such as ibalt and nalt contribute directly to inflammatory pathology in the lung they may initiate production of immune t and b cells that then track to less organized lung immune compartments7 19 20 21 and 22 but their neogenesis ibalt or continued presence nalt per se is not associated with pathology instead pathological lung inflammation is attributed to those compartments that lack organized lymphoid structures the airways and lung parenchyma this could also be said of inflammation in the gut peyers patches and mesenteric lymph nodes may not be directly associated with pathology whereas the lamina propria is what the lamina propria and lung parenchyma have in common is a loose scattering of non-organized immune cells and a vast surface area of potentially non-professional antigen-presenting cells apcs the epithelium the epithelium expresses constitutive mhc class i and when inflamed mhc class ii and b7 molecules23 24 it can therefore process and present antigen and activate t cells but can it turn them off we believe this non-professionalism and lack of immune-cell organization leads to immune dysregulation during inflammation the mediastinal lymph nodes and ibalt expand in an organized and precisely compartmentalized manner although low frequencies of antigen-specific cells can be observed in these sites25 the ratio of immune-cell subsets does not significantly change contraction of lung-associated lymph nodes is also well controlled again cell proportions are retained in lung compartments devoid of organized lymphoid tissue however immune cells are recruited in droves by a chemotactic gradient26 27 and 28 from infected epithelium andor tissue resident and alveolar macrophages once in the lung parenchyma or the airways they do not form structures analogous to ibalt or lymph nodes and it is here that pathological damage occurs toll-like receptors ligands dominate and inflammatory cytokines are produced by the infiltrate in abundance unlike the lung-associated lymph nodes the airways and lung parenchyma therefore experience dramatic shifts in their cellular compositionthis is illustrated graphically in figure 2 the approximate cellular composition in nalt airways and lung is shown in homeostasis and at the peak of respiratory infections by three very different pathogens influenza virus the bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae and the fungus cryptococcus neoformans obviously at other stages of the infection slightly different cells will dominate but only the peak of inflammation is presented for clarity for example natural killer cells dominate in the airways at days 34 of a viral infection29 at its peak of activity the influenza-infected airway and lung is dominated by cd8 and cd4 t cells25 30 31 and 32 whereas during s pneumoniae infection macrophages neutrophils and t cells are more abundant33 34c neoformans in c57bl6 mice induces an eosinophil-dominated response in the lung and airways35 36 and 37 this infiltrate in the air spaces and lung for all pathogens is dramatically different to the same sites in homeostasis that contain few lymphoid cells but a prominent macrophage population38 39 and 40 note that the nalt despite being infected with all three pathogens does not substantially alter the proportion of immune-cell subsets present and the same is also true for the relatively non-infected lung draining lymph nodesthis lack of control and excessive response is only observed in a minority but when it occurs it is life threatening for most of us respiratory pathogens are cleared by non-inflammatory means including iga that does not fix complement well but in dimeric form agglutinates and physically excludes antigen by a process known as immune exclusion41 42 what therefore goes wrong in a minority to address some of these questions we need to understand how immune homeostasis is maintained in health in these non-organized lung compartments reviewed by holt43 and what pathways contribute to immune pathologyepithelial cells contribute a multitude of strategies to maintain lung immune homeostasis for a review see reference holt43 in addition to barrier function they secrete a variety of antimicrobial substances surfactant protein c mucins and antimicrobial peptides affect airway smooth-muscle dc and memory t-cell activation via nitric oxide production44 45 assist in cell recruitment via production of cytokines and chemokines46 47 and prolong cell survival by secreting stimulating factors such as granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor48 49 raz and co-workers50 51 highlight an interesting pathway critical for maintaining alveolar macrophage homeostasis involving integrin v6 that localizes these cells next to epithelial expressed transforming growth factor- tgf- this may explain why these cells are refractory to migration to the draining lymph nodes52 for inflammation to proceed this inhibitory pathway must be overcome which is mediated by a toll-like receptor-induced conformational change of macrophages disruption of tgf- signaling and reduced integrin expression we often assume that innate immunity is inactive in the absence of antigen however the work of raz et al clearly shows that active suppression is required for homeostasis this is also observed in mice lacking components of nadph oxidase53 that have heightened basal levels of airway macrophage activation due to loss of feedback inhibitionactive suppressive mechanisms therefore set a threshold of ignorance those that succumb continually to inflammatory lung disease may therefore have dysregulated homeostatic pathways or the threshold which antigen must exceed to induce inflammation set too low in the cases of tgf--mediated suppression of alveolar macrophages homeostasis is overcome by cleavage of the integrin tethering it to the respiratory epithelium homeostasis is restored when macrophage-released matrix metalloproteinases transform latent tgf- into its active form51 it may therefore be possible to harness these pathways artificially to dampen inflammatory lung disease with the caveat that pathogen clearance may be affected by such a global anti-inflammatory strategy54macrophages particularly in the airways have long been known to have an immune-suppressive phenotype renewal is achieved primarily via local cell proliferation recruitment via ccl2ccr2 does occur although such cells may take days to mature into the classical immune-suppressive phenotype55 in addition to shielding the immune system from inhaled antigens56 they display poor phagocytic activity57 and tend not to migrate well to draining lymph nodes macrophages held in homeostasis also affect other cell types that may otherwise be proinflammatory within the respiratory tract for a review see reference holt43 58 dc migration to the draining lymph nodes is enhanced upon macrophage depletion52 and t-cell-mediated inflammatory disease ensues to antigens that would otherwise have been ignored59 most likely due to the usual direct suppressive influence that alveolar macrophages have on dc function39both myeloid and plasmacytoid dcs pdcs are present within the lung both increase and are recruited rapidly during inflammation and are attracted by chemokines and cytokines produced by epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages43 60 61 and 62 myeloid dc responses are similar to counterparts found elsewhere in the body pdcs however also appear to play a tolerogenic role in the respiratory tract they have poor apc activity63 but once activated enhance cd8 t-cell responses in vivo64 and possibly cd4 t cells at distant sites65 promote inhalation tolerance66 and can protect from development of allergic airway disease reviewed by de heer et al66 hammad and lambrecht67 and lambrecht68 during acute respiratory viral infections pdcs perform dual functions of promoting viral clearance by secretion of type i interferon ifn and limit inflammation by induction of interleukin-10 il-10 reviewed by grayson and holtzman69 their role in limiting lung inflammation can be clearly seen in respiratory syncytial virus rsv-infected mice where pdc depletion leads to increased viral replication and enhanced immunopathology in the lungs70 71 dcs encounter antigen predominantly in the lung parenchyma although microbial sampling via dendrite projections through the epithelial cells into the airway lumen may induce activation maturation and migration arming them to support potent t-cell responses72 quite what returns these cells to homeo-stasis is unknown but may involve the level of toll-like receptor signals andor the influence of surface expressed inhibitory receptors such as cd200r73 airway epithelial cells may also control dc activity via tgf- analogous to alveolar macrophages51 although this has not been proven whether dcs actually transmigrate into the airspaces is still controversial74 75 and 76 ccr2 assists their transit across the endothelium and ccr6 their subsequent migration into the airway74 the recently described cd103 e7 cd207 cd11blo dcs express all of the requisite chemokine receptors to draw them into the airways77 but their presence in this compartment has not been provenclearly harnessing the homeostatic pathways described above may help to resolve ongoing inflammation however it is equally likely that immune cell types and pathways brought into the lung with inflammatory cells during inflammation also provide a therapeutic opportunity it would not be possible to cover all of the pathways attempted to limit lung inflammation we will therefore restrict our analysis to acute infectious events ie not asthma and to targeted therapeutic strategies ie not global anti-inflammatories such as corticosteroids or experiments in gene-deleted animals immune-mediated pathology can be manipulated at any stage of its generation from a clinical perspective however after onset of identifiable symptoms would be the most beneficial for this reason it is often resolution of inflammation that is targeted which can include modulation of cell survival successive waves of recruitment and ongoing innate immunityit is still unclear whether immune excess in the respiratory tract stems from over-exuberant recruitment proliferation within the airspaces andor accumulation in the absence of clearance of innate and adaptive immune cells evidence suggests that the airspaces may not support efficient t-cell proliferation78 79 and 80 despite memory t cells acquiring bromodeoxyuridine staining at the same rate as secondary lymphoid organs25 80it is likely that the inflammatory cytokine and chemokine cascade that ensues upon infection81 82 83 84 85 and 86 will prolong immune-cell survival but at the same time enhance their recruitment either directly or by altering vascular or epithelial permeability87 88 an inflammatory environment is also associated with the highest expression of late co-stimulatory molecules on t cells that prevent activation-induced cell death and rely on cognate ligands expressed on apcs for signalling ox40 cd134 is one such late co-stimulator that is restricted to recently activated t cells whereas the ligand ox40l is expressed on a number of cell types predominantly apcs89 stimulation through ox40 promotes cd4 and cd8 t-cell survival clonal expansion90 inhibition of regulatory t cells91 and enhanced immunity to a variety of pathogens36 92 93 and 94 however during acute influenza virus infection of mice transient blockade of ox40 is more beneficial alleviating illness and pathology to influenza without compromising pathogen clearance or immunological memory95 a permanent absence of multiple late co-stimulators however can compromise immunological memory96 97 and 98 manipulation of one late co-stimulatory pathway therefore leaves others intact to seed the memory t-cell pool97 this suggests that a full compliment of late co-stimulators may actually be prolonging t-cell survival and contributing to pathology inflammatory cytokines such as those abundantly expressed in the airways during infection are known to increase ox40l on apcs99 due to lack of immune organization in the airways late co-stimulatory molecules and their ligands may be downregulated too late to avoid bystander tissue damage the observation of ox40l on inflamed endothelium highlights the difficulty in separating the effects of immune modulators on cell survival vs cell recruitment100 101 especially when ligation of ox40l on endothelial cells induces secretion of chemokines101 102 4-1bb like ox40 is restricted to late-effector t cells and its absence or blockade impairs cd8 t-cell responses to influenza103 although the effect on associated respiratory pathology is not yet known care must be taken however since not all inducible co-stimulators result in a beneficial outcome when blocked during lung influenza infection icos blockade impairs respiratory t cells to such an extent that the virus escapes clearance32 this is similar to treatment of influenza-infected mice with a ctla4-ig fusion protein that blocks cd28 binding to b7 molecules104 and cd40l-knockout mice infected with c neoformans105 where macrophage antimicrobial strategies are impaired it is likely that targeting cd27 may also produce untoward side effects since it is expressed on resting nave and memory t cells and is crucial for the formation cd8 t-cell responses96 106 perhaps the defining line for therapeutic potential should be placed between those late co-stimulators that absolutely depend on t-cell receptor and constitutive cd28 signaling for their expression and those that can appear in a bystander fashion in the presence of inflammatory cytokines the likely effect of co-stimulatory blockade and the site where manipulation may have the most effect is shown in figure 3in addition to late co-stimulatory molecules a number of other pathways affect the longevity of lung inflammation during acute infection whether apoptosis is beneficial or harmful depends on the specific infection and the dominant cell type that mediates its clearance107 as a general rule apoptosis favors the host in chronic and acute intracellular bacterial and viral infections as the process clears the pathogen but is detrimental for extracellular bacteria107 for example during infection of rats with pneumocystis alveolar macrophage apoptosis delays clearance of the organism that can be improved by administering caspase-9 inhibitors108 similarly apoptosis of airway epithelial cells via fasfas ligand is essential to prevent dissemination of pseudomonas aeruginosa109 however during influenza infection it may be more advantageous to reduce cell survival especially in the case of tnf producing cd8 t cells tnf receptor-ii and very late antigen--1 synergize to protect cd8 t cells in the influenza virus infected airways from apoptosis110 whereas engagement of qa-1b by cd94nkg2a transmits a negative signal that limits immune pathology111 it may therefore be possible to resolve t-cell inflammation before bystander tissue damage occurs by blocking or enhancing these surface receptors once the viral load has reduced this would only be useful however if the strategy specifically targeted a defined cell population since apoptosis of airway epithelial cells and leukocytes may be linked to the pathology observed in those infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza112 113 furthermore apoptosis leading to systemic lymphopenia114 observed during influenza infection may assist virus propagation and survival other respiratory pathogens such as cytomegalovirus and parainfluenza virus use antiapoptotic strategies to prolong survival of the cells they infect115 chlamydia blocks apoptosis by affecting the release of cytochrome c from mito-chondria116 the extracellular pathogens pseudomonas cepacia and s pneumoniae cause apoptosis of neutrophils and airway epithelial cells table 1117 respectively to aid survival modulation of apoptosis is therefore complicated what may benefit the host for one infection would compromise it to anotherthe recruitment and trafficking of leukocytes in response to inflammation is a tightly regulated process that can tip the balance between protection from infection and immune mediated damage in the lung in brief it involves slow rolling conco-mitant to the activation of leukocytes an increase in integrin expression and avidity to regulate the rolling arrest adhesion strengthening as well as spreading and intravascular crawling culminating in paracellular or trans-cellular migration118 119since excessive cell recruitment is a feature of many acute lung infections targeting specific molecules involved in any of the above-mentioned events may be beneficial blocking monoclonal antibodies against the integrin very late antigen-4 natalizumab120 and lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 efalizumab121 are currently used to treat inflammatory autoimmune disorders and crohns disease but are also immunosuppressive and have not been studied in the context of acute respiratory infection122the potential benefit of blocking chemokines or their receptors using competitive blockers or antagonistic compounds is well described reviewed by glass et al123 and charo and ransohoff124 secreted chemokines bind glucosaminoglycans on endothelial cells forming chemoattractant gradients that direct cells to inflammatory sites125 and are classified into constitutive homeostatic and inflammatory requiring a pro-inflammatory stimulus such as ifn- tnf or microbial products chemokines126 chemokine receptors are transmembrane g-protein-coupled molecules that trigger a signal transduction event resulting in activation and firm adhesion of the migrating cell127 the interactions between chemokines and their receptors are functionally redundant many chemokines bind the same receptor and one chemokine can bind several receptors as such it can be difficult to design reliable therapeutics that disrupt the interaction of one particular chemokine with its receptor128 therapeutic administration of antibodies that block macrophage inflammatory protein-2 during influenza infection reduces neutrophil recruitment by 49 and improves lung pathology without altering viral clearance129 however this strategy requires testing in co-infection models since neutrophils are critical for clearance of most respiratory bacteria that commonly cause secondary pneumonia in the presence of influenza virus130 131 rantes ccl5 is another potential target produced by respiratory epithelial cells during a variety of viral infections rantes induces ccr1- ccr3- and ccr5-expressing t cell eosinophil and monocyte recruitment to the lung132 during rsv infection ccl5 is expressed by infected epithelia and resident macrophages and secreted into the airway during the first 48 h of infection production is then taken over by newly recruited t cells blocking this chemokine with a competitive inhibitor met-rantes133 during a primary rsv infection reduces lung immunopathology however heightened cell recruitment occurs during homologous rsv re-challenge suggesting that manipulation during the first infection severely compromises immunological memory134 the same strategy has been tested in a mouse model of pneumonia virus infection this highly lethal mouse pathogen induces a disease closely resembling severe human rsv infection in man that is abrogated by co-administration of the antiviral agent rivabirin and met-rantes135in contrast to inhibition of chemokines during virus-induced lung inflammation some infections may require their administration p aeruginosa lung infection causes airway neutrophil infiltration that rapidly apoptose and become toxic administration of recombinant monocyte chemoattractant protein-1ccl2 recruits and activates lung macrophages that clear apoptotic neutrophils before they cause pathology136 ifn-inducible protein 10 cxcl10 is critical not only for clearance of klebsiella pneumoniae137 but is also produced during lung viral infection where neutralization may be beneficial138many chemokine receptors are also increased during respiratory viral infection cxcr3 for example is upregulated during murine gammaherpes virus b8 infection and its absence delays viral clearance139 antagonism of ccr1 reduces mortality of pneumovirus infection of mice140 and absence of ccr1 also prevents the rsv-induced exacerbation of asthma141 relatively little has been accomplished in this area especially therapeutically however due to the paucity of reagents available for chemokine-receptor blockadeanother method for altering lymphocyte migration is to manipulate sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors that are required for egress of lymphocytes from the thymus and peripheral lymph nodes and impact on vascular permeability fty720 is a novel synthetic immunosuppressive drug that inhibits lymphocyte emigration from lymphoid organs by binding and activating sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors142 sphingosine 1-phosphate is known to play a role in endotoxin-induced lung injury by affecting endothelial barrier function143 and is currently in trial for a variety of inflammatory disorders including transplantation144 but is yet to be tested in acute lung infectionone way to temper innate immunity is to mature the lung microenvironment or instill probiotic microbes that would compete with the survival of pathogenic microorganisms oral administration of lactobacillus casei during lung s pneumoniae infection is protective resulting in more rapid clearance a shorter period of septicemia and decreased s pneumoniae load in the lungs this benefit is attributed to increased neutrophils myeloperoxidase and il-10 that limits lung tissue damage and is likely mediated by migration of mature apcs from the gut to the lung that are better equipped for bacterial clearance145 prior infection in the lung also has a beneficial effect on some subsequent acute respiratory infections through modification or maturation of the microenvironment146 147 148 149 150 and 151 prior influenza infection for example reduces subsequent toll-like receptor responsiveness of alveolar macrophages for prolonged periods of time152 administration of microbial products such as cpg dna or a modified bacterial labile toxin ltk63 also protects against an array of subsequent respiratory pathogens153 154 as do chronic or acute infections in distant sites155 156 and 157 the ability of pathogen-derived proteins to modify acute respiratory infections however is yet to be tested therapeuticallyresveratrol a polyphenolic compound found in red wine inhibits nuclear factor-b activation decreases mortality and pro-inflammatory cytokines tnf il-1 and il-6 to serratia marcescens pneumonia in rats though this strategy increases neutrophil numbers they resolve more rapidly158 similarly an acidic polysaccharide compound from cordyceps militaris an insect-borne fungus has anti-viral properties in a murine influenza infection model159 intranasal administration of the fungal polysaccharide decreases mortality and influenza viral titers while increasing lung pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro influenza infected macrophage cell lines treated with resveratrol display enhanced inducible nitric oxide synthase and nitric oxide no suggesting that this compound may function through non-specific stimulation of alveolar macrophages in vivo159 enhanced innate and adaptive immunity and reduced microbial load is also observed upon therapeutic administration of retinoic acid in mice infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis160 the increased numbers of macrophages natural killer and t cells and increased expression of ifn- tnf inducible nitric oxide synthase il-10 and cxcl10 may also benefit other acute respiratory bacteria or fungi though during viral infection it would be predicted to be detrimental acute respiratory infections are yet to be examineda critical pathway for clearance of pathogens and infected lung epithelial cells is via no and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species no contributes to host defence and mediates both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects reviewed in161 162 as with many of the therapeutic treatments discussed the timing and extent of modulation of no and associated free radicals is critical while there is no clear consensus in the literature there are a few examples of successful intervention in this pathway in rats with p aeruginosa pneumonia treatment with inhaled no post-infection improves bacterial clearance through direct bactericidal effects increased recruitment of neutrophils to the airways163 or enhanced endothelial permeability164 during k pneumoniae infection of rats inhaled no also suppresses bacterial replication and decreases lung intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression myeloperoxidase activity tnf levels and nuclear factorb activity thus no has many paracrine effects on inflammatory cells but also promotes bacterial clearance165 during viral infection the impact of no manipulation is less clear inhibition of no during rsv infection reduces pulmonary inflammation and bystander tissue damage but viral replication increases166similar therapeutic strategies have been employed to reduce local concentration of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species which are produced by infected lung epithelium and macrophages during rsv infection of mice administration of the antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole decreases illness scores weight loss and lung neutrophil recruitment again a multi-factorial attenuation of inflammation occurs167 the same is observed in influenza-infected mice treated with a free-radical scavenger manganese superoxide dismutase within 4896 h of infection this enzyme has potent anti-inflammatory properties resulting in less lung consolidation and improved arterial oxygen saturation presumably as a result of decreased tissue damage168 reduced tissue damage also occurs in mice lacking superoxide dismutase or treated therapeutically with a manganic porphyrin that scavenges reactive oxygen species53 therefore inhibition of reactive oxygen speciesreactive nitrogen species and no is beneficial for acute respiratory viral infection but likely to be detrimental for concurrent respiratory bacteriamodulation of immune-receptor signaling is in its infancy with regards to acute respiratory infection and may be limited by a the toxicitysafety profile of available drugs b formulation challenges for in vivo delivery c a lack of specificity due to shared receptor associations and d problematic pharmacokinetics sustained blockage will be detrimental for protection against infection and drugs may have to be delivered locally to prevent systemic effects the only truly therapeutic manipulation to date is abrogation of airway fluid clearance during rsv infection caused by interaction of uridine triphosphate with purinergic receptors by post-infection administration of an active metabolite of leflunomide a77-1726 leflunomide restores airway fluid clearance providing symptomatic relief and reduced lung inflammation and hypoxemia without impairing viral replication or clearance169although signaling molecules associated with pattern recognition and cytokine receptors are well described little is known about the complexity of innate pathways induced by a whole pathogen especially in the lungs170 controlling the signaling pathways leading to exuberant inflammation is of major interest but a balance needs to be struck to maintain host defence against infection a feasible approach might be by treating patients at the peak of inflammation where immune mediators are in excess and using drugs with a short half-life this is a promising strategy but to our knowledge no drugs targeting signaling components are reported efficacious in human lung infection although they are under development171 a comprehensive review of relevant inhibitors of inflammatory signaling pathways can be found elsewhere172receptors recognizing pathogens such as toll-like receptors or nod-like receptors but also tnf and il-1 which are often involved in amplification of the inflammatory response are potent activators of nf-b173 nf-b induction is a key factor triggering inflammation in the influenza-infected epithelium174 mice treated with a cell-permeable peptide that reduces nf-b levels via an effect on i-kappa-b kinase beta reduces pulmonary rsv-induced inflammation175 again this strategy may negatively affect respiratory bacteria since intra-tracheal adenovirus delivery of a dominant nf-b inhibitor impairs clearance of respiratory p aeruginosa176 despite the reduced inflammation observed with purified bacterial products177 178 peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- is a nuclear receptor involved in the stress response during lung injury and attenuates inflammatory responses by inhibiting nf-b179 180 many steroids target peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- and show encouraging results in models of lung inflammation172 a series of natural and synthetic ligands for these receptors have been developed and rsv-specific responses in human lung epithelial cell lines are reduced by some of these agonists181mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 and c-jun-n-terminal kinase pathways may also provide future suitable targets activation of the p38 pathway is often associated with induction of nf-b in toll-like receptor responses for example and is thought to maintain inflammatory responses by stabilizing cytokine mrna182 inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway may therefore favor termination of inflammation inhibitors of p38 reduce the epithelial disruption caused by rsv and bordetella pertussis183 184 again inhibition of this pathway to our knowledge although tested in asthma185 has not been tested in lung infection modelsanother approach to reduce pathogen-induced immunopathology during acute infection is to target signaling molecules involved in cell migration downstream of chemokine receptors is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase which activates protein kinase c and rho gtpases186 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors reduce the recruitment of neutrophils and t cells in vivo187 188 and 189 although this treatment is efficient in alleviating chronic inflammation such as asthma190 it is not validated for acute microbial infection in addition use of phosphatidylino-sitol 3-kinase inhibitors may interfere with development of the innate response to bacteria191with the identification of each new cytokine a series of papers describing their manipulation in models of acute infection has followed all of them cannot be detailed here due to space constraint but our discussion can be limited to those that have been tested therapeutically in acute lung infection models the first type-i ifn plays such an important role in limiting viral replication that they have developed strategies to avoid it during rna virus lung infection ifn- is produced predominantly by alveolar macrophages or to a lesser extent pdcs whose depletion impairs viral clearance192 dosing with ifn- and a double-stranded rna ifn- inducer 4 h after sars coronaviruas infection reduces lung viral titers193 similarly rsv or human metapneumovirus-infected balbc mice treated intranasally with recombinant ifn- have reduced lung viral titers and inflammatory disease as compared with untreated controls194 prophylactic treatment of sars coronavirus-infected macaques with pegylated ifn- significantly reduces viral load and pulmonary damage post-exposure treatment is effective although producing intermediate results195 recombinant ifn- therefore appears beneficial for reducing viral replication and associated pathology when administered early after infection the influence of concomitant bacterial infection requires examinationother early innate cytokines important in respiratory viral and bacterial infections include il-1 il-12 and tnf their blockade or promotion however is complicated by the fact that respiratory bacteria tend to require them for clearance for example rhinovirus induces il-1-receptor antagonist il-1ra from airway epithelial cells which facilitates resolution of inflammation196 however il-1ra enhances bacterial outgrowth in the lungs of mice with pneumococcal pneumonia without the benefit of reducing the host response197 therefore this pathway is predicted to be good for one lung infection but bad for another blockade of il-12 is another example where neutralization benefits the severity of lung viral infection198 199 but impairs clearance of lung histoplasma capsulatum200 and legionella pneumophila201 infections the list continues with neutralization of tnf which benefits immune pathology induced by influenza and rsv infection81 202 but not respiratory bacteria or fungi203 204 especially if treatment is prolonged although this will depend on the precise strategy used205 webster and co-workers reported recently that absence of tnf and il-6 is of no benefit during murine influenza h5n1 infection206 however up to 50 survival was observed in some experiments and the gene-depleted animals used may harbor other developmental abnormalities viruses induce local production of ifn- by t and non-t cells in the respiratory tract and its neutralization not only reduces local lung cellularity and systemic humoral responses to influenza virus infection in mice207 but may also delay viral clearance208 ifn- is also required for clearance of s pneumoniae209 it would appear that the new cytokine on the block il-17 may also present opposing effects in viral and bacterial lung infection suitable reagents are yet to be developed for il-17 neutralization but in vivo blockade of il-23p19 alone or in combination with il-23il-12p40 required for th17 development significantly reduces mycoplasma pneumoniae-induced il-17 and subsequent bacterial clearance possibly via reduced neutrophil activity210k pneumoniae clearance also depends on il-17211 but the influence of il-17 or il-23 neutralization on respiratory viral infection is unknownadministration of immune suppressive cytokines has been considered for infection induced lung inflammatory disease and encountered similar problems il-10 neutralization increases survival of mice infected with k pneumoniae212 in contrast influenza induces indoleamine 23-dioxygenase and il-10 production which may limit lung inflammation however treatment with an indoleamine 23-dioxygenase inhibitor that would reduce il-10 induces a 20-fold reduction in lung s pneumoniae load213 intranasal il-10 treatment of rsv-infected mice reduces lung nuclear factorb dna-binding activity chemokine gene expression and airway inflammation175 similarly administration of tgf--encoding plasmid reduces inflammation to viral and fungal lung pathogens but without exception prevents their clearance54although a plethora of strategies have been used to modulate lung inflammation during acute infection few are tested therapeutically after the onset of clinical symptoms and even less are tested in models of common co-existing lung pathogens hundreds of immune modulators are therefore beneficial during influenza infection but what of the bacteria that sometimes accompany them would immune therapeutics work best in combination with antibiotics equally selection of immune modulators requires precision in determining exactly what the patient is infected with in the absence of this knowledge we may apply a beneficial strategy to one supposed infection but create an altogether different type of problem several gaps remain in our knowledge of how immune homeostasis is maintained in the respiratory tract inflammatory pathways that overcome them and the precise effectormemory phenotype of immune cells within the airways and lung parenchyma controversy also still surrounds the potential of acute respiratory infections to persist since detection of pathogen genome is common but few studies have been able to demonstrate classical reactivation long after the primary infection should persistence exist then depending on the nature of the persisting organism immune modulators may cause their reactivation the development of sensitive tools for pathogen detection and elucidation of specific gene expression patterns in patients with acute infection214 mean that future use of targeted immune modulators is not impossible as long as we are able to strike a balance between immune pathology and immune defencethe authors declared no conflict of interest viral disease is one of the most significant human health concerns in modern medicine manifesting as a broad range of acute infections chronic diseases and virus-associated malignancies viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus hiv hepatitis c influenza rotavirus chikungunya and dengue affect millions of people each year worldwide the emergence of novel strains of h1n1 flu1 and previously unrecognized pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus2 and sfts bunyavirus3 4 has highlighted the threats of viral emergence and pandemic with which humanity regularly contends this along with the emergence of antiviral resistance among viruses such as influenza highlights the need to better understand virus replication and the virushost interaction to identify critical restriction points that can be targets for antiviral drug development and vaccine generationone controlling aspect of viral pathogenesis and replication is their dependence on the cells that they infect unlike other microbial pathogens such as bacteria and fungi which are capable of autonomous growth viruses are completely dependent on cellular processes for replication it has long been recognized that viruses are dependent upon the use of cellular machinery for protein synthesis nucleotide and protein building blocks ribonucleic acid rna and deoxyribonucleic acid dna polymerases and membranes more recently it has become clear that viruses also rely upon intracellular communication5 6 particularly viruses appear to be adept at capturing protein phosphorylation cascades for their own usemost if not all viruses require protein phosphorylation in order to replicate this would initially suggest that viruses would gain a replication edge by generally promoting protein phosphorylation however simply promoting all cellular protein phosphorylation is not likely to be advantageous to viruses as the activity of some host kinases and the resultant phosphorylation events are known to antagonize viral replication thus a nonspecific increase in phosphorylation would trigger an antiviral response viruses have a need for specificity in activating host kinases and phosphatases simply stated viruses need to activate signaling pathways that promote their replication7 8 9 while blocking or avoiding the activation of antiviral signaling pathways10
controlling kinase activity can promote protein translation11 increase metabolic activity drive cell division and inhibit cellular apoptosis all of these are advantageous for virus replication in addition many viruses produce virus proteins that require direct phosphorylation in order to properly function but make no kinase that will carry out this phosphorylation9 10 this dictates that they must recruit kinase activity from their hostit is therefore not surprising that viruses have developed mechanisms to control cellular signaling through regulating kinase and phosphatase signaling cascades what is surprising is the commonality of host pathways that are targeted in theory any number of kinases might be important for the replication of any particular virus but this possibility of each virus using different kinases is not actually observed rather as is emphasized below one signaling pathway has emerged as a common player in the replication of many different virusesthe phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase pi3kakt phosphorylation cascadethe repeated identification of the pi3kakt pathway as a central player in virus replication has underscored the importance of this pathway as a central regulator of cell health and metabolism as a central regulator of multiple cellar processes that control translation metabolism and cell death active pi3kakt signaling can fulfill many viral needs this is not to suggest that this signaling pathway only provides positive feedback for the virus studies of virus interaction with this pathway have also shown that the pathway is not simply a proviral kinase when activated but that it also acts as part of the host response to viral infection this suggests that pi3kakt signaling represents a two-faced player in interactions between the virus and cell able to both promote viral replication and be an active part of the immune response that will eventually quash virus replication this review will describe the different approaches that viruses have taken to dominate the pi3kakt signaling pathway the viruses chosen in this review highlight the varied manner in which this pathway is manipulated and turned to the advantage of the invader while also pointing out how the pathway also plays a role in host defensethe pi3kakt signal transduction cascade is a classical phosphorylation cascade that utilizes tyrosine lipid and serinethreonine phosphorylation to transduce external signals to internal responses see fig 1
for a schematic diagram normally signaling through this pathway is initiated by the stimulation of a receptor tyrosine kinase rtk by a cytokine or a growth factor at the cell surface activation of the rtk recruits and activates pi3k pi3k is a heterodimer consisting of a p110 catalytic and a p85 regulatory subunit12 pi3k is responsible for converting phosphatidylinositol 45-bisphosphate pip2 to 345-triphosphorylated phosphoinositide pip3 pip3-rich membrane domains serve as docking sites for proteins that contain a pleckstrin homology domain such as aktthe recruitment of inactive akt protein to pip3-rich areas of the plasma membrane results in a conformational change that exposes the activation loop of akt13 akts activating kinase phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase pdk114 is also recruited to pip3 microdomains pdk1 phosphorylates akt on threonine 308 thr308 of the exposed activation loop activating akt and leading to a second phosphorylation of akt at serine 473 ser473 by a kinase presumed to be mtorc2 that further potentiates kinase activity13 15 16 17
activated akt can control the signaling of several key pathways supporting different types of cellular functions fig 1 the pi3akt signaling pathway promotes cell growth cell survival and tumorigenesis through the phosphorylation and inactivation of cell cycle kinase inhibitors such as p21 and the inactivation of transcription factors that can inhibit cell cycle progression and promote apoptosis such as the forkhead family of proteins eg foxo118 akt also can block the actions of metabolically repressive kinases such as ampk19 and so can drive the up regulation of metabolic activity in the cell20
akt also promotes cellular translation through gsk3 phosphorylation and the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 mtorc1 a kinase complex that activates ribosomal s6 kinase and inhibits the translational repressor eif4e-bp1 4e-bp121 akt activation of mtorc1 is indirect akt phosphorylates and represses the hamartin and tuberin complex tsc1 and tsc222 inhibition of tsc1tsc2 allows rheb-mediated activation of mtorc1 complex kinase activity mtorc1 phosphorylates and activates the ribosomal protein s6 kinase p70s6k and inactivates the translation suppressor 4ebp1 leading to increased translationakt activity antagonizes apoptotic signaling this is accomplished through direct actions such as inhibiting pro-apoptotic factors eg phosphorylation and inhibition of bad23 a pro-apoptotic member of the bcl-2 family and through more indirect actions such as the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa b nf-b24 and as mentioned above the inactivation of foxo1 with actions that influence multiple phosphoprotein cascades involved in different core aspects of cell function pi3kakt signaling pathway is a prime candidate for a hub kinase whose activation can have a diverse set of consequences all of which are centered on promoting cell survival and increasing the metabolic capacity of the cellseveral viral proteins are known to directly activate the pi3kakt signaling axis through molecular mimicry or replacement fig 2
 these viral proteins helped in elucidating the initial understanding of the pi3kakt signaling cascade the paradigm example v-akt was originally described as a retroviral oncogene encoded by the akt8 mouse transforming retrovirus27 the kinase was described as a fusion protein with the viral gag matrix protein it was quickly recognized that the protein had a cellular homolog28 which was named c-akt this protein was later determined to be the same as the cellular kinases that had been characterized under the names of pkb29 and rac-pk30 though the role of v-akt in the life cycle of the akt8 virus was never established v-akt is capable of transforming cells suggesting that the virus utilized the v-akt protein to drive cell cycle progression the finding that a cellular kinase had been essentially directly incorporated into the viral genome as a fusion protein with the viral gag protein was the first demonstration of the importance of this kinase for viral replicationthe control of the pi3kakt signaling pathway by molecular replacement extends to several other viruses notably avian sarcoma viruses the av16 sarcoma virus encodes for a pi3k homolog named vp3k31 which encodes a homolog of the cellular catalytic subunit of pi3k p110 like v-akt vp3k acts to provide constitutively active pi45-bisphosphate kinase activity without the need for the p85 regulatory subunit generating high levels of pip3 this serves to activate akt32 which phosphorylates and inactivates the foxo1 transcription repressor33 and promotes cellular translation through the phosphorylation of 4e-bp134 these actions remove a cell-cycle brake allowing proliferative signals to dominatea slightly different approach to activation of the pi3kakt pathway activation is taken by the ct10 and av1 viruses these viruses each encode a homolog to the cellular crk protein35 36 37 vcrk activates the pi3kakt signaling pathway through the recruitment of pi3k to the focal adhesion kinase38 this activity leads to the transformation of vcrk-infected cells39 presumably by mechanisms similar to those described for vp3k activation of cellular translation and inactivation of transcription factors such as foxo1in all of these examples a consistent theme is evidentretroviruses have repeatedly captured host proteins that can activate the pi3kakt pathway it is thought that the cell proliferation induced by these proteins is critical for the replication of these viruses as the breakdown of the nuclear envelope during the cell cycle gives these retroviruses access to cellular dna and thereby allows the virus to integrate within this dna further proliferating cells are more likely to activate retroviral gene expression to stimulate virus production however this may not be the only role for the pi3kakt pathway in the retrovirus life cycle and more recent research into viruses such as hiv suggests that the virus may benefit from inducing akt activity to prevent premature apoptosis40
viruses have also adopted approaches of inducing pi3kakt pathway signaling by attacking phosphatase activity as is true in most kinase cascades the activity of akt signaling can be decreased through phosphatase-mediated dephosphorylation of akt activation domains conversely kinase signaling can be potentiated by decreasing phosphatase activity for pi3kakt signaling the cellular phosphatase pp2a is at least partially responsible for the dephosphorylation and inactivation of akt41 42 by decreasing the activity of pp2a more akt will remain in the active state this approach to activating akt signaling has been adopted by the genus polyomaviridae simian virus 40 sv40 is the prototype example of a polyomavirus that stimulates akt activation by inhibiting the dephosphorylation of akt43 to do this the sv40 small t antigen of sv40 sv40st binds the cellular phosphatase pp2a that is responsible for a large fraction of akt phosphatase activity44 pp2a is a heterotrimeric protein comprising a scaffolding subunit a a catalytic subunit c and a regulatory subunit b there are many variants of the b subunit and each is believed to be responsible for directing the phosphatase catalytic subunit directly to a single substrate such as akt or set of substrates sv40st displaces the b subunit from the a and c pp2a subunits inhibiting much of the phosphatase activity which would normally dampen or reverse akt and mtor activation see fig 2 the resulting potentiation of akt signaling helps drive cell proliferation moving the cell into s phase where virus dna synthesis is initiatedthis modulation of pp2a to alter pi3kakt signaling is utilized by other viruses in the polyomavirus genus as well including bk virus45 mouse polyoma virus46 and jc virus47 in addition polyomaviruses can indirectly stimulate the pi3kakt pathway through additional mechanisms48 49 50 indicating that these viruses attack the pi3kakt pathway at multiple points to ensure pathway activationa similar mechanism of activating akt signaling inhibition of pp2a activity that increases akt activation has been proposed for the e7 oncoprotein of papillomavirus hpv51 the hpv e7 protein is critical for the maintenance of cellular dna synthesis in hpv-infected cells52 which is a necessity as hpv requires the host cell dna synthesis machinery for its replication53 thus activation of akt to remove brakes on cell dna synthesis ie foxo is of clear value to virus replication this action is also important in the cases where the e7 gene is incorporated into host dna not part of the normal virus life cycle under these circumstances akt signaling may promote malignant transformation51 thereby underscoring a potential link between viral control of cellular phosphorylation for its own means and the induction of cancerin the examples presented above virus takeover of the akt signaling pathway was associated with the induction of cellular proliferation in many examples though viruses that activate the pi3kakt pathway do not benefit from the promotion of cellular proliferation or cellular transformation for many viruses the pi3kakt pathway can provide the short-term benefit of keeping the infected cell alive through the suppression of apoptotic signals the critical nature of pi3kakt-mediated suppression of apoptosis is best illustrated by viruses that cause acute infections such as the rna virusesfor most rna viruses their life cycle is carried out in the cytoplasm of their host cell these viruses therefore have minimal requirements for nuclear components or cell cycle progression and in many cases block nuclear functions and cell-cycle progression54 55 56 thus pi3kakt-mediated promotion of cell division or alteration of transcription does not play an essential role in virus replication instead phosphorylation of cytoplasmic proteins in order to delay apoptosis keeps the host cell alive until viral progeny can be producedthe trigger for pi3kakt activation in infection with paramyxoviruses often occurs early in infection as an example respiratory syncytial virus rsv a significant pediatric pathogen activates pi3kakt signaling at the level of pi3k activation57 pathway stimulation appears to involve the activation of sphingosine kinase which in turn leads to the phosphorylation and activation of akt through a mechanism that may involve the extracellular signaling of sphingosine 1 phosphate58 akt activity is critical for delaying cellular apoptosis during rsv infection57
similarly the genetically related sendai virus human parainfluenza virus 5 hpiv5 and hpiv3 have also been shown59 or suggested59 60 to activate pi3k and akt early in infection an action associated with delaying apoptosis and potentially activating the viral polymerase for all of these viruses signaling through the akt pathway allows the completion of the viral replication cycle inhibition of pi3k or akt signaling leads to faster apoptosis59 and in some reports reduced virus growth60 in the case of sendai virus akt activation may also play a role in the ability of this virus to establish a persistent infection in cells in tissue culture59
viruses in the picornavirus family are also reported to activate pi3kakt signaling for both poliovirus and the common-cold-causing rhinovirus viral attachment and entry serve as the trigger for pi3kakt activity61 for poliovirus the exact trigger is unknown for rhinovirus binding of the virus to its receptor recruits the tyrosine kinase syk which interacts directly with the p85 subunit of pi3k and activates pi3kakt signaling62 63 it is likely that the activation of akt is important for avoiding cell death in the case of both viruses an important role for akt in forestalling apoptosis has been shown in the case of poliovirus where the akt phosphorylation of ask1 limits the activity of its downstream effector jnk1 and thereby decreases apoptotic signalscardioviruses also appear to manipulate akt activity to limit apoptosis in infected cells for both encephalomyocarditis virus emcv and coxsackievirus viral infection is associated with the stimulation of pi3kakt activity64 unlike poliovirus and rhinovirus infection the activation of pi3k does not appear to be entry dependent64 activation is important for suppression of apoptosis and promotion of virus replication for coxsackievirus akt activation results in the stimulation of nf-b activity which promotes cell survival65
pi3kakt activation to promote the survival of infected cells is also seen during infection of cells with double-stranded rna viruses of the reovirus family as an example rotavirus stimulates pi3kakt activity within the first 2 h of infection66 through the use of both mutant virus and viral protein overexpression approaches it has been shown that akt activation is carried out by the rotavirus nonstructural protein 1 nsp167 the activation of akt by nsp1 can occur even in the absence of other viral components and involves a direct interaction between nsp1 and pi3k see fig 3
 suggesting that the protein alters kinase activity the mechanism of this targeting is currently unknown activation of akt has also been suggested for the avian reovirus a113368 the activation of akt in rotavirus-infected cells suppresses apoptosis to allow the completion of the virus life cycle69 akt signaling in infected cells is also required for the expression of integrin proteins66 which can strongly promote both survival signaling and virus attachment suggesting that akt activation may send survival signals and promote viral attachment in infected cellslike many viruses the flaviviruses dengue virus and japanese encephalitis virus70 stimulate pi3kakt activation within the first few hours of infection for these viruses the mechanism of activation is unknown but activation appears to be transient70 and curiously does not seem to impact virus replication in any fashion hepatitis c another flavivirus has not been reported to activate either pi3k or akt but has been shown to promote cell survival through the activation of the downstream effector mtor kinase71 this activation is facilitated by the viral nonstructural protein ns5a which has the capacity to bind directly to fkbp38 a negative regulator of mtor72 see fig 3 the association of fkbp38 with mtorc1 is blocked by ns5a binding thereby stimulating mtorc1 activity promoting translation and limiting apoptosis this mechanism of targeting mtorc1 by relieving an inhibitor action is seen in the actions of a cytomegalovirus cmv virus protein ul38 see belowthe herpes virus family consists of several viruses that have each taken differing approaches to achieve the same result preservation of a favorable environment for both viral transcription and viral translation the life cycle of these viruses is particularly pertinent to their interaction with the pi3kakt pathway as herpes viruses have both a lytic phase where they actively replicate in cells and a latent phase where they are maintained as episomes in the host genome this dual life cycle means the virus requires different cell environments at different times during latent infection the virus requires little from the host while during the lytic phase many host factors and a high metabolic throughput are desirableone example of how herpes viruses interact with pi3kakt signaling is the epsteinbarr virus ebv ebv is associated with burkitt lymphomaleukemia and other lymphoproliferative disorders ebv establishes a latent stage in which most viral proteins are not produced and replication is dormant in this phase virus-infected cells produce a latency protein lmp2a lmp2a promotes akt phosphorylation provides a general antiapoptotic signal and also promotes c-myc translation through translational upregulation caused by mtor activation73 the development of ebv-driven burkitt lymphomaleukemia is dependent upon the constitutive expression of c-myc which modulates the expression of target genes that encode many cellular processes including cell growth division and apoptosis lmp2a protects cells that express c-myc from apoptosis through the upregulation of antiapoptotic genes74
lmp1 another latency-associated protein produced by the ebv genome also activates the akt pathway75 for lmp1 the activation of akt activity is associated with a nuclear functionthe inhibition of dna damage repairand not protein synthesis promotion this suggests the lmp1 and lmp2 proteins of ebv target different pools of pi3k and akt to control the function of this signaling pathway in different cellular compartmentsthe activity of akt is also targeted in the lytic phase of ebv replication expression of brlf1 a protein that induces lytic replication of ebv results in the activation of akt in overexpression studies suggesting that pathway pi3k activity is an important signal for the emergence of the virus from latency76 consistent with this inhibition of pi3k signaling blocks ebv reactivation from a latent statethis dual use of the pi3kakt signaling for both latent and lytic replication reveals an interesting paradigm for cellular signaling in virus infection akt activity appears to be a basic requirement for the survival of ebv-infected cells but cannot in itself be a trigger for reactivation akt activity is much more likely to be a basal maintenance factor further research will undoubtedly uncover true triggers that cooperate with the pi3kakt pathway to drive reactivation in the interim the apparent requirement for pi3kakt signaling to maintain a latent state and help drive reactivation has identified an achilles heel of ebv-infected cells targeting ebv-infected cells for death by adding inhibitors of this pathway are showing initial promise as a way to inhibit ebv  tumor growth77
unlike ebv the activation of the pi3kakt phosphorylation cascade in herpes simplex virus 1 infection is transient78 the activation has been proposed to be due to the actions of the viral vp1112 protein79 though virus binding to the cell surface has also been proposed as the activating trigger80 despite the transient nature of akt activation78 downstream effectors of akt such as 4e-bp1 remain phosphorylated throughout virus infection81 the preservation of the phosphorylated state appears to be the responsibility of the viral kinase ul3 ul3 is capable of phosphorylating multiple akt substrates including tsc2 gsk3 and the transcription factor foxo ul3 appears to stimulate the assembly of translation initiation factor complexes that drive the translation of viral mrnas though additional actions seem likely81 as the phosphorylation of multiple akt substrates suggest ul3s kinase activity impacts multiple signaling pathways fig 3 this host kinase mimicry is functionally analogous to that seen for the retroviruses described above where a virus acquires or evolves a kinase that phosphorylates the same substrates as akt the hsv example is distinct in that ul3 is not homologous to akt at a protein sequence levelunlike ebv and hsv cmv is a herpes virus family member that has not been shown to directly or indirectly activate pi3k or akt instead cmv targets the downstream effector mtor through a viral proteinhost protein interaction strategy cmv encodes a protein named ul3882 that interacts directly with the tuberous sclerosis protein 2 tsc2 a protein that is involved in suppressing mtor activity binding of ul38 acts to silence the tsc2 inhibition of mtor activity fig 3 resulting in an increase in mtor substrate phosphorylation82 83 this action phenocopies akt activation as akt will directly phosphorylate and inhibit tsc2 by producing ul38 cmv replaces this function of akt activation further the ul38 inactivation of tsc2 also blocks the ability of the metabolic sensor ampk to modulate mtor activity by activating tsc2 in cmv-infected cells expression of ul38 acts to preserve the mtor arm of the pi3kakt pathway an action that promotes viral translation and replicationsimilar to the multifactor targeting of the pi3kakt pathway seen in ebv-infected cells it has also been reported that cmv-infected cells show a change in the substrate specificities of the mtor complexes mtorc1 and mtorc284 these changes are not associated with the ul38 protein but may be important for a change in substrate specificities that accompany a localization of mtorc1 to the replication centers of cmv in infected cells85 these findings suggest that there are mechanisms of mtor control in addition to ul38-mediated activation of mtorpoxviruses are some of the most genetically complex viruses known expressing more than 200 genes from a dna genome including viral homologs of many cellular proteins while a homolog of pi3k or akt is not present signaling through the pi3kakt pathway is critical for virus replication for vaccinia cowpox86 and myxoma viruses87 pi3kakt activity is rapidly induced following productive infection this activation appears to play at least three distinct roles during poxvirus infection one is the suppression of apoptosis which has been suggested to be important to allow proper viral replication86 the second is the promotion of assembly of the eif4f translation initiation factor complex through mtor-mediated inhibition of 4e-bp1 function this promotes virus mrna translation88 89 pi3kakt activity appears to be especially critical for allowing the transcription of mrnas that encode for proteins involved in the assembly and budding of poxviruses86 the third role for pi3kakt is at a late stage of viral infection where it is important for the proper progression of morphogenesis89 90 addition of pi3k inhibitors during infection or deletion of the p85 alpha and beta subunits of pi3k altered multiple aspects of vaccinia replication90 of note were a decrease in late gene expression and the progression of the virus particle from an immature form to the intracellular mature virusat least one poxvirus the rabbitpox virus myxoma produces a protein dedicated to harnessing and activating akt this protein named m-t5 is an ankyrin-repeat protein it was recently shown that this protein binds directly to akt see fig 3 and promotes its activation and signaling in a manner that is analogous to the cellular protein pikea87 91 m-t5 not only activates akt but also forces relocalization of nuclear akt to the cytoplasm92 removal of m-t5 from the myxomavirus genome results in a markedly attenuated virus that is incapable of causing lethal disease in rabbits93 this highlights the importance of akt activity for poxvirus pathogenesis how akt activation supports the pathogenesis of virus replication in an animal model is not fully resolved also unknown at this point is whether other poxviruses such as smallpox or monkeypox have proteins analogous to m-t5 that function to activate pi3kakt signalingas one of the most significant endemic pathogens confronting humanity influenza virus represents a virus that has repeatedly shown its ability to infect and adapt as a virus that produces fewer than a dozen proteins it is not surprising that host factors aid in influenza replication what is striking about influenza is the extent to which the virus appears to utilize akt-related signaling throughout the viral life cycle binding of influenza virus to the cell surface leads to the activation of akt potentially through clustering of rtks such as the epidermal growth factor receptor egfr94 while a role for pi3k in flu virus entry seems clear other signaling pathways eg the ras signaling pathway also appear to cooperate with the pi3kakt pathway to promote virus entry95
the importance of pi3kakt signaling for influenza continues after infection following virus entry influenza a virus directly activates akt signaling96 97 through the binding of the viral nsp1 to the p85 subunit of pi3k96 98 fig 3 ns1 binds to p85 at a coiled-coil region of p8599 100 relieving contacts between p85 and p110 subunit of pi3k that normally inhibit activity the resulting activation of pi3k dramatically stimulates akt activity in influenza-infected cells for some strains of flu it has been shown that ns1 will also bind the cellular adaptor crk an action which further potentiates pi3kakt signaling101 functionally this activation of akt signaling has been proposed to lead to the inhibition of apoptosis and to allow the preservation of cell integrity during the viral replication cycle102 103 however this may not be universally true viruses lacking ns1 function are stronger inducers of apoptosis during infection but stimulation of akt activity in viruses that lack the ns1 protein does not inhibit apoptosis this suggests the true role for akt activation during the replication of influenza is yet to be definedthe pi3kakt pathway is also a signaling pathway that is utilized in the cellular defense against invading pathogens as described above phosphorylation signals are the backbone of the antiviral response akt signaling is increasingly recognized to play a role in this response104 this is particularly true for the host response to interferon where pi3k and akt signaling potentiates the translation of interferon-stimulated genes through the actions of mtor and p70s6k which stimulate interferon-responsive gene translation105 106 akt also plays a role in stimulating the production of inflammatory cytokines by contributing to the activation of the nf-b transcription factor57
there are many examples of virus-mediated activation of akt signaling leading to the activation of host innate immune genes such as inflammatory cytokines akt activation results in the increased production of proinflammatory cytokines il-6 and il-1 in avian reovirus infected cells68 in cells infected with rsv the stimulation of akt activity leads to the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-8 il-8 during infection57 107 108 emcv also stimulates inflammatory cytokine production through the activation of the pi3kakt pathway109
influenza-infected cells produce il-8 and rantes in a pi3kakt-dependent manner110 and virus activation of akt potentiates the expression of interferon-97 influenza virus-infected macrophages can be kept alive by chemokine receptor-5-mediated activation of the akt pathway which allows the infected cell to clear other infected cells111 thus activation of akt signaling can act as a double-edged sword during infection promoting viral infection and replication and driving the expression of host danger signals that can recruit immune cells to the site of infection thus though many viruses appear to activate the pi3kakt pathway this activation also seems to carry with it some negative consequences one approach to avoiding these negative consequences is to inactivate this signaling pathway upon infectionthe first example of virus inhibition of pi3kakt signaling was described for measles virus a pediatric pathogen whose hallmark of infection is the suppression of immune function this immune suppression occurs through the decreased proliferation and responsiveness of lymphocytes112 113 while it is not fully understood how measles induces immune cell quiescence recent studies point to a strong role of the pi3kakt pathway in this effect both in vivo and in vitro the attachment of measles virus to the surface of t cells can force akt dephosphorylation in uninfected cells fig 4
 this inactivation of pi3kakt signaling is not a consequence of infection but merely requires virus binding to a cell surface receptor114 the receptor that is responsible for signaling this downregulation is currently unidentified but following the binding of measles virus particles to the cell surface there is both a decrease in pi3k and akt signaling and an upregulation of the inositol phosphatase sip110115 that lowers the overall level of pip3 in the cell membrane this promotes long-term suppression of pi3kakt signaling the artificial stimulation of akt activity overcomes measles-induced immunosuppression suggesting that the inhibition of akt is a central cause of measles virus-induced immune suppressionin addition to the effect of virus particle binding on akt signaling active infection of cells by measles virus continues to block akt activity even after entry this suppression of a central cell-viability pathway has no demonstrable negative effect on measles replication116 thus unlike most viruses even related viruses such as rsv and hpiv5 measles replication appears to be insensitive to the activity of the pi3kakt pathway and does not require the antiapoptotic protection that could be afforded by activating this pathwaya different mechanism of akt suppression is seen upon infection by another rna virus vesicular stomatitis virus vsv vsv is a veterinary pathogen that is being developed both as an oncolytic agent117 and as a platform for effective vaccines118 vsv replication is unaffected by akt signaling119 as is seen in measles virus infection of cells with vsv results in a rapid inhibition of akt signaling in infected insect120 and mammalian cells121 this inhibition which extends to inhibit the downstream components mtor122 4e-bp1123 and rps6124 makes cells insensitive to normal akt-stimulating factors such as insulin and epidermal growth factor and is due in large part to the actions of the viral matrix protein fig 4121 unlike measles vsv does not block akt activity through inhibition of pi3k signaling instead the virus blocks the activating phosphorylation of akt by inhibiting the phosphorylation of akt at the plasma membrane through the actions of the viral matrix proteinthe inhibition of pi3kakt signaling is also noted in cells infected with rift valley fever virus rvfv recent phosphoproteome analysis of rvfv-infected cells showed that infection led to the dephosphorylation of the akt-phosphorylated sites of foxo1 and gsk3125 the authors also observed a dephosphorylation of irs1 an insulin-receptor adaptor that can facilitate pi3kakt activation while the proteomics analysis did not identify akt phosphorylation changes the results are very much in line with rvfv inhibition of the akt pathway it is not clear how this virus evokes that inhibition of signaling at this point but the analysis is consistent with the interpretation that it is downregulating rtk activityrecent studies of alphaviruses show that these viruses also appear to downregulate the pi3kakt signaling pathway analysis of cells infected with the prototype alphavirus sindbis virus showed that the virus downregulates pi3kakt activity this downregulation of akt phosphorylation had little effect on virus replication and mtor inhibitors did not significantly alter the replication of sindbis virus126 this shows that alphaviruses are also capable of replicating without the contribution of these signaling pathways which is directly analogous to what is seen in measles and vsv replication the inhibition of pi3kakt signaling by sindbis is likely relevant to the pathogenesis of alphaviruses as these viruses are known to be neurotropic and akt activity is an important survival factor for these cells127
the startling regularity with which viruses appear to utilize the akt pathway has not gone unnoticed in the antiviral drug discovery field there have been many suggestions that akt inhibitors or inhibitors of downstream effectors such as mtor might be used as either specific or general antiviral compounds targeting steps of the virus lifestyle ranging from fusion and entry128 to transcription inhibition60 to triggering cell death of infected cells40 however given the important role of akt in promoting immune cell responsiveness114 129 and the negative effect of pi3kakt inhibition on host immune cell function seen during measles virus infection such an approach seems likely to dampen the host immune response this latter conclusion is supported by reports showing that the pi3kakt pathway controls interferon production in dendritic cells130 131 and that it is important for controlling an autophagy-based antiviral response120 this suggests that such an approach is unlikely to succeed as a broad-spectrum approach however for viruses that activate pi3kakt signaling to maintain a latent infection such as the ebv inhibiting signaling through this pathway appear to be successful in limiting downstream effects of latency such as cellular transformation132 this suggests that there may be limited situations in which this approach will be successfulthe pi3kakt signaling pathway itself may represent an evolutionary tug-of-war for viruses if the pi3kakt signaling pathway is just as essential for host response and survival as it is for viral function inactivation is not an effective response for the infected host similarly for viruses that have adapted to activate the pathway and that rely on the downstream effect of this activation they must also contend with unwelcome results of such pathway activation including the stimulation of cytokine production this suggests that pi3kakt signaling is part of the evolutionary red queen race between virus and host where virus attempts at controlling the host cell are often thwarted by host evolutionwhile it has long been recognized that viruses are wholly dependent upon the use of cellular machinery for macromolecular events such as protein synthesis it is now clear that viruses additionally rely upon cellular phosphoproteins and signaling cascades to mold the cellular environment to their advantage the pi3kakt phosphorylation cascade is an emerging paradigm for how these interactions occur many viruses have incorporated methods to activate pi3kakt signaling in order to forestall apoptosis drive the cell cycle and thereby support their replication processes somewhat paradoxically other viruses have evolved an opposite approach short-circuiting the pi3kakt signaling axis in this latter case viruses appear to benefit from the repression of the host antiviral response that comes from blocking akt signaling why do different viruses some from the same families take different approaches this is a question that will need to be answered in future researchit is likely that a better understanding of the importance of viral control of the pi3kakt signaling will be gained when the akt substrates that are vital for viral replication are defined some significant progress has been made already the phosphorylation of host factors such as the mtor substrate 4e-bp is important for the robust translation of many viral messages and it is likely that other akt substrates that stimulate translation will also be sown to be important it is likely that still more akt-regulated phosphoproteins play a role in viral processes perhaps the most obvious but most poorly understood is the possibility that viral proteins themselves serve as substrates for akt or effectors such as mtor and gsk3 recent work has suggested that akt may phosphorylate the phosphoprotein of several negative-stranded rna viruses60 and that it may also control calicivirus polymerase function133 future discoveries will likely greatly expand the number of viral substrates and more clearly point out the viral dependencies on this signaling axisthe new coronavirus called 2019-ncov is a new type of virus that was first identified in wuhan china in december 2019 ghinai et al 2020 the 2019-ncov is from same family as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars community-acquired pneumonia cap and other common colds the 2019-ncov is a relatively large virus with a size of about 12 nm and is from a group of enveloped virus family containing a positive-sense single-stranded rna fehr and perlman 2015 ebrahimi et al 2020 the virus is transmitted through direct contact with infected persons respiratory droplets coughing and sneezing as well as contact with infected surfaces the 2019-ncov can survive for hours on surfaces but a simple disinfectant can eliminate it lai et al 2020a covid-19 signs and symptoms include fever cough and shortness of breath in more severe cases the infection can lead to pneumonia or respiratory severe problems and ultimately in rare cases the disease will be fatal huang et al 2020ain the absence of a safe and effective vaccine as well as a lack of specific drug treatment the only solution is preventing its transmission performing general education and implementing appropriate prevention and control precautions can help people prevent risk of infection such as washing hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol-based disinfectant gel covering mouth with your bent napkin or elbow when sneezing or coughing avoiding close contact with those who have symptoms and being sure to see a doctor if have a fever cough or difficulty breathing haybar et al 2020 the virus transfers through direct and close contact with respiratory droplets of the affected person cough or sneeze or contact with contaminated surfaces ghinai et al 2020 yu et al 2020 and it can survive for hours on surfaces but a pure disinfectant can eliminate itepidemiologic and field studies show that 2019-ncov just similar to sars and mers is spread through fine-grained particles such as particles sneezing out of the mouth yu et al 2020 schwartz and graham 2020 in only a single old study tang 2009 the survival of the airborne human coronavirus 229e hcv229e a virus used in research as a representative or surrogate of coronary respiratory viruses was studied under different temperature and relative humidity conditions the study showed that under such conditions the virus has a half-life of 27 and 67 h at 30 and 50 humidity respectively while its half-life at 80 humidity is only 3 h when the temperature drops as 6 degrees the viruss half-life is increased 3 h at 80 humidity similar conditions and consequences have been reported for seasonal flu lowen and steel 2014 this severe effect of lowering the temperature on prolonging the viruss half-life at high humidity could help the 2019-ncov spread under these conditions in spite of several clinical studies that claimed that spreading the virus into droplets can be prevented using appropriate masks it is challenging to prevent it from spreading into aerosol forms as well as the type of mask makes no significant difference long et al 2020 wang et al 2020b subsequent studies showed that viruses that had become airborne aerosols and spread through defective sewage were the possible cause of the sars coronavirus that killed lots of people in hong kong in 2003 yu et al 2004 in the same year only one incident in sars contaminated 22 out of 120 passengers on a 3-h flight olsen et al 2003 surprisingly the contamination included people who were outside the persons 2-m distance and viruses could not be transmitted to them through aerosols and droplets la rosa et al 2013 although it is difficult to prove that the virus has spread only through aerosols and droplets the relatively low humidity of the aircraft has undoubtedly contributed to the higher survival of the sars virus in the particles but a later study did not observe that transmission of sars-associated coronavirus and suggested that the risk of transmission is not amplified aboard aircraft vogt et al 2006a research report from canada points to the fact that open oxygen masks can help to spread disease agents such as sars in fact viruses such as sars are transmitted through the droplets emitted from these masks somogyi et al 2004 air exhaled through the oxygen masks transmits viruses in the droplets farther away increasing the risk of the respiratory disease spreading to health facilities further research is needed to fully determine that the sars virus and similar viruses can survive and stay live and spreadable in the warm and humid environment of oxygenated airresearch findings on the impact of humidity and temperature on the survival of the virus in airborne particulate matter indicate contrary to that li et al conducted a comprehensive study on the spread of the sars virus at the hong kong hospital and found evidence of the transmission of the virus aerosols they also suggested improving the air conditioning or ventilation system to reduce the risk of spreading such diseases li et al 2005 the 2019-ncov is claimed does not survive at temperatures above 26 c but it can survive for approximately 510 min on the skin 6 to 12 h on plastic materials and 12 h on metal fig 2because safety and ethical considerations do not allow the covid-19 infection test on the human specimen researchers used human coronavirus 229e hcov-229e as a surrogate to study the survival of the coronavirus on human hands initial findings from these tests show that about 45 of hand-infected viruses survive and remain viable after 1 h warnes et al 2015 such a survival time is much longer than other viruses such as the para-influenza virus type 3 which disappears after only 10 min in another study researchers used human fingers to show that by washing only with water the concentration of hcov-229e was reduced by 70 however with the use of hand-sanitized alcoholic disinfectants the concentration of this virus decreased by 9999 within 30 s geller et al 2012 this study highlights the importance of effective hygiene and disinfection preventing and controlling of infectious diseases caused by coronavirus familythere is no evidence that corona is transmitted through food or drinking water and recreational water one study shows that sars in the water can survive to a very limited degree wang et al 2005coronavirus is more stable and more resistant to environmental surfaces than other coated viruses warnes et al 2015 otter et al 2016 recently molecular methods such as pcr have been studied for the transmission of pathogens to the environmental surfaces of aircraft maris 1990 however the detection of pathogenic viruses in environmental samples seems to be necessary to assess their potential ability to infect and spread the disease mathematical simulations also confirm the fact that environmental levels play an essential role in the spread of coronavirus in health facilities ikonen et al 2018three-level biosafety has been suggested for protectivity 1 level 1 protection disposable hats disposable surgical masks disposable isolation clothing and disposable gloves wang et al 2020c 2 level 2 protection level 1 but with medical protective masks such as n95 goggles or protective masks and as outer cover a medical protective suit 3 level 3 protection level 2 but with the addition of face mask or a medical mask goggles or face mask to a full set or with an electric air filter respirator pei et al 2020wearing a face mask is suggested for healthcare workers and people who have respiratory symptoms but is not recommended for healthy people organization wh 2020a nonmedical masks made of other materials such as cotton fabric has not been well evaluated esposito and principi 2020scientific research to date on the covid-19 has yielded no conclusions that the covid-19 outbreak will decline with the start of the warm season many researchers have said it is too early to predict whether the covid-19 will decrease as the season progresses mahase 2020 studies have hypothesized that areas where covid-19 has suffered the most have similar weather patterns lipsitch et al 2020 countries located in the east and west of the globe did not have a significant impact on the prevalence of the disease among communities and on the other hand the north and south have provided a model for the relative prediction of disease outbreaks gates 2020 but now scenario has changed and countries located on east and west of globes usa  japan have already declared emergency and this statement was in contradiction with reality also it is estimated that this disease will reach saturation in the usa in july 2020 arias velsquez and meja lara 2020 and outbreak of covid-19 significantly correlated with average temperature minimum temperature and air quality bashir and ma 2020there are striking similarities between average wuhan city air temperature in january time of outbreak here and other polluted places in february as well as their humidity vetter et al 2020 the temperature at meteorological stations in these areas between 4 and 9 c and in cities due to urban factors has been slightly above and between 5 and 11 c sajadi et al 2020b it can also be predicted that with the onset of summer in northern hemisphere of the covid-19 it may be slightly influenza-like in the tropics and spread simultaneously in the southern hemisphere anderson et al 2020in addition to known factors influencing the transmission of viruses such as population displacement and human-to-human contact environmental factors can affect transmission of droplets and the viruss survival but for covid-19 disease the evidence is still very limited absolute humidity which is defined as water in the ambient air is considered a robust environmental factor for virus transmission huang et al 2020b oliveiros et al 2020 islam et al 2020 qi et al 2020 berumen et al 2020 guo et al 2020 barreca and shimshack 2012 in examining the relationship between climate and sars-cov-2 it is important to note that different regions of the world which have had a high prevalence in recent weeks have had different climates also no significant relationship has been found so far sajadi et al 2020b table 1 in analysis of regional regression countries affected by high prevalence of disease are divided into different regions and in these regions climate will be examined and recorded in several changes then for first period from first day of outbreak to day of study regression of daily aggregate growth against average temperature and relative humidity will be taken bukhari and jameel 2020b in this model we try to control variables such as population and gdp table 1 however temperature was not associated with epidemic growth of covid-19 and case counts zhu and xie 2020in a study by wang et al the effect of air temperature and relative humidity on the transmission of 2019-ncov from 105 samples of viruses carrying infected and contaminated pairs calculated the number of daily virus production per 100 chinese cities with more than 40 confirmed cases they reported that high temperatures and high humidity significantly reduced transmission of virus respectively also 1 c significantly reduces temperature increase and 1 decrease in relative humidity of daily virus production previous studies have shown that high temperature and humidity reduce the transmission of influenza and sars which is consistent with wang et als study this study showed that the arrival of summer and rain in the northern hemisphere might effectively reduce 2019-ncov transmission wang et al 2020ain a study by lou et al they looked at the number of covid-19 reproductions across chinas provinces and found that rising temperatures and humidity necessitated the arrival of spring and summer in the northern hemisphere alone without extensive public health interventions it does not reduce the number of viruses luo et al 2020 therefore it is important to understand the impact of environmental factors on the increasing prevalence of covid-19 to support disease control decisions ma et al 2020 it is especially important in areas with high temperatures and humidity where the risk of transmission is minimized shi et al 2020 distribution of significant disease prevalence in the community at limited latitude and longitude temperature and humidity is consistent with the behavior of seasonal respiratory viruses due to the fact that temperature and humidity are known factors in the survival of sars-cov mers-cov and influenza chan et al 2011 the prevalence of covid-19 in long periods of time has occurred at certain levels of temperature so that conditions of prolonged exposure to this temperature range increase the risk of disease outbreak rahman et al 2020b in addition to prolonging half-life and survival of virus other possible mechanisms related to temperature and humidity including droplet stabilization and increased virus spread in the nasal mucosa like other respiratory viruses are further evidence that these two factors affect 2019-ncov schaffer et al 1976 shirbandi et al 2020 it is important to note that although colder areas are relatively free of 2019-ncov they can affect the survival of the virus due to the low freezing cycle lamarre and talbot 1989 the researchers also found that low humidity was a factor in transmission of influenza in laboratory and onset of seasonal flu lowen et al 2007 shaman et al 2009many researchers and politicians have suggested that the covid-19 disease will go away on its own in warmer weather in the coming months in the northern hemisphere roy 2020 some have even said that the sars experience in 2003 is an evidence of this claim what can now be said in response to this claim based on existing studies is that it is possible to reduce the transmission of 2019-ncov in hot and humid weather with the closure of gathering centers such as schools and universities but it is not logical because these reductions do not occur alone or without any effective public healthrelated intervention it should be noted that even sars does not disappear for natural reasons but does not survive due to very severe public health interventions these include isolating and quarantining infected people and people in contact with them social distancing and other targeted actionstherefore it can be concluded that in case of 2019-ncov it is expected that like other beta-coronaviruses virus may be slightly more effective at low temperatures such as in winter although the underlying mechanism is not well-known therefore the size of this change in transmission and pathogenicity of the virus is expected to be moderate and will not stop by itself comparing to the pandemic the 2019-ncov is expected to be less immune to humans and even easily transmitted outside the cold season changing seasons and closing down gathering centers such as schools and universities may help but it is unlikely to stop the transmission of the virus to make effective policy it is necessary to determine whether the closure of gathering centers such as schools and universities may help to reduce the rate of transfer effectively in which if it would not be effective the resources are wasted during such closures for example recent evidence suggests that children may be as susceptible as adults bi et al 2020 so the critical question is whether the virus is easily transmitted under different temperature and humidity conditions finally except for a limited number of articles it is currently being published and shows that there is no conflict in the results regarding the effect of these two variables on the survival and transmission of the virusthe more practical and quantitative method of qct-2 showed that ethanol could kill 999 of hcov-229e policy et al nd other studies showed that alcohol-based mixture such as lozenge that contains amyl meta-cresol and dichlorobenzene alcohol could have direct and significant effects in reducing the infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov oxford et al 2005 morokutti-kurz et al 2017 another research evaluated the impact of alcohol-based hand sanitizer on positive cases of mers-cov and showed that using this mixture had a significant increase in the utilized amount of virus as well as hand hygiene compliance rates increased to 88 al-tawfiq et al 2019formaldehyde 4 is used as a complete sterilizer and disinfectant however for safety reasons its use as a regular disinfectant is not recommended this disinfectant can kill the tgv virus in 99999 in 5 min and a 2 solution can kill more than 999 of hcov-229e sattar et al 1989phenolic-based ingredients have a long history of using coal tar soap with creosol although some disinfectants use the same historically active chemical changes in creosol have been made to make them more effective against germs for example o-phenyl phenol with a concentration of 200 ppm is quite effective against coronavirus sattar et al 1989 however adding detergent or ethanol can increase its effectiveness and eliminate 999 of the hcov-229e within 5 min similarly chemicals made from phenolics need other helpers to be effective shah et al 2020many studies were ongoing according to clinicaltrialsgov database according to this database bacillus calmettegurin bcg vaccine which primarily used against tuberculosis tb will be intervening other vaccines such as inactivated sars-cov-2 vaccine lv-smenp-dc vaccine measles-mumps-rubella vaccine autologous dendritic cells loaded with sars-cov-2 antigens av-covid-19 chadox1 ncov-19 angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inhibitors or angiotensin ii receptor blocker arb igm and igg antibodies vpm1002 development of the bcg vaccine and adoptive cellular transfer act are ongoing there are no food and drug administration fdaapproved vaccines to prevent or trial covid-19 however fda issued emergency use authorization eua for emergency use of remdesivir for the treatment of hospitalized covid-19 patients grein et al 2020the scientific evidence in this review article suggests that the spread of 2019-ncov may be influenced by climatic variables such as temperature and humidity apparently warm humid weather may indicate less transmission of the 2019-ncov considering the topic that seems to impose both the positive and negative data on the possible effect of environmental factors especially humidity and temperature on the stability and transmissibility of the 2019-ncov almost all available evidence revealed the possible positive effectcountries located in the east and west of the globe did not have a significant impact on the prevalence of the disease among communities and on the other hand the north and south have provided a model for the relative prediction of disease outbreaks gates 2020 the government and public health organizations can take steps to reduce the rate of covid-19 transmission in the future for example in addition to helping their people leading countries can help low- and middle-income countries lmics prepare for the epidemic and most effectively fight against the disease khadka et al 2020many lmic health systems are now vulnerable and a pathogen such as covid-19 can quickly lead to serious problems and challenges and eventually collapse of healthcare system given the natural inclination of richer countries to give priority to their own people over other countries this has led to a political and economic leverage in poor countries pioneer countries can save the lives of their own people by slowing the global transmission of the covid-19 by helping to prepare african and south asian countries to fight the disease gates 2020helping lmic is essential to strengthening the primary care system with the infrastructure to fight epidemics well-trained healthcare workers not only provide vaccines but also monitor disease patterns as part of early warning systems that warn the world of a possible outbreak given the limited testing capacity in african countries the numbers of confirmed cases of covid-19 may greatly underestimate the true burden although there was little evidence of unexplained outbreaks of the virus at face value the figures suggest that an african continent people had suffered fewer covid-19 deaths than the top list countries such as usa russia and uk zhao et al 2020b khafaie and rahim 2020baccording to epidemiologists 2019-ncov is not among the thermophile viruses so it will become inactive once the cold season begins however others suggested that 2019-ncov disappears at 30 c which is a misconception about the virus it is also reported in the multimedia that it is better to use fried food to eliminate covid-19 while the virus is cold-friendly and will survive longer with lower temperatures based on the results of new studies on the 2019-ncov the virus can survive on the surface for 4 to 28 days but if the temperature drops to less than 30 to 40 c the life span of the virus will be reduced rather than eliminated casanova et al 2010 some scholars think that if the temperature reaches 30 c the virus will not survive which is a misconception because at this temperature the viruss survival will reduce and does not mean that the virus will completely eliminate wang et al 2020a since the bats body temperature is 48 c so the 2019-ncov has nothing to do with these creatures levesque et al 2016 the virus is also sensitive to humidity in addition to temperature therefore sars coronavirus and possibly 2019-ncov have a longer life span of 50 than 30 humidity chan et al 2011 according to published data the human coronavirus can survive at temperatures of 20 c for up to 9 days and if the temperature rises to more than 30 c it perhaps decreases 2019-ncov viability but the lower the temperature is associated with the more virus activity in such a way that it can continue its activity for up to 28 days casanova et al 2010 thus the most effective way to reduce the activity of this virus is to use disinfectants such as ethanol 70 these types of substances can kill the virus within a short minutecurrently in a modeling study using the classification of covid-19 confirmed cases was investigated as one of the epidemic diseases consequentially the average daily temperature and relative humidity of hubei province in china and the number of covid-19 confirmed cases were selected they demonstrated that the relative humidity and the maximum daily temperature had the highest impact on the confirmed cases the daily temperature and relative humidity affected 2019-ncov positively and extreme daily temperature with an average of 154 c affected this virus negatively pirouz et al 2020 recently a published evidence reports that 2019-ncov significantly contaminates air surface environment and protective equipment by droplets of an infected person meaning that environment is an important issue to consider because it is a potential medium of transmission thus it is necessary for strict adherence to environmental and personal protection and hygiene as well as social distancing ong et al 2020we are poorly aware of their survival in the environment and the precise factors of their transmission however limited studies in this field show that 2019-ncov is more resistant to environmental factors than other coated viruses the environmental conditions necessary for the survival and spread of 2019-ncov are somewhat clear but unlike animal coronaviruses the effect of humidity and temperature on the 2019-ncov activity is controversial researchers in the field of epidemiologists believe that the 2019-ncov is not a thermophilic virus so it will be activated with the onset of the cold seasonaccording to published data human coronavirus can survive for up to 9 days at 25 c and if this temperature rises to 30 c its lifespan will be shorter the 2019-ncov is sensitive to humidity and the lifespan of viruses in 50 humidity is longer than that of 30 also temperature and humidity are important factors influencing the covid-19 mortality rate and may facilitate 2019-ncov transmission seasonal factors are recognized to play an essential role in the transmission of viruses responsible for various respiratory diseases besides most of these diseases reach epidemic proportions and key outbreak during winter recently researchers claimed that the two main causes contribute to the description of any association between viral outbreak and the seasonal factors including changes in environmental parameters and human behavior specifically changes in temperature and humidity disturb the viral stability and transmissibility thus considering the recent and available evidence it seems that low temperature as well as dry and unventilated air may affect the stability and transmissibility of the 2019-ncovlong before knowing why it worked the ill were quarantined to prevent the spread of disease 1 the idea that microorganisms were solely disease-causing agents to be avoided began with the discovery that basic hand hygiene and aseptic techniques reduced the spread of disease 2 3 and led to the proposals of germ theory in the 1860s 4 5 and kochs postulates in the 1890s 6 this idea captured our imagination 7 and shaped public policy 8 9 protocols best practices and infection control trainingparticularly in the healthcare and food service industries successive developments in microbiology and microbial ecology technology and theory advanced our understanding of microorganism taxonomy anatomy physiology ecology and infectious potential and continued to refine our relationship to microorganisms and move us past a strict definition of germ theory 4 10in the early-1900s culture-based investigations revealed the possibility of a commensal microbial community 11that which benefits from its association without impacting the host in the following decades led by early work from hungate on protozoa in cattle 12 and mcnall-ngai et al on squid and vibrio fischeri 13 14 the understanding that microorganisms could not only be commensal but mutualistic with their hosts began to develop investigations into host-microorganism relationships exposed a multitude of microorganism-driven benefits for the host and even the reliance of some microorganisms or strains on host ecosystems thus the abstraction of host-associated microorganisms was solidified 12 1416 even more nascent is the concept that microbial exposure is integral to our health 17 refuting the paradigm that pathogenic microorganisms are consistently pathogenic and that some microorganisms could in fact be beneficial and essential due to their antagonism with hosts our wariness of infectious disease led us to become infatuated with preventing microbial exposure including those essential microbial-host interactions which were only latently understood concurrent to this urbanized populations saw a rise in allergies asthma and inflammation-related chronic diseases many of which were or seemed to be linked to a lack of microbial exposure a correlation which was described by the hygiene hypothesis 18 19 in response calls propose to redefine hygiene from practices that remove all microbiota to simply acting to prevent the spread of pathogenic microorganisms 20 yet not all microorganisms interact with a host in the same way and not all interactions lead to positive outcomes and the hygiene hypothesis as originally defined did not encompass this nuance 21the collective change in ideology regarding microorganisms as beneficial has led to the development of the old friends hypothesis 22that early childhood exposure to microorganisms can properly tune the developing immune system such that it will not overreact to future challenges and aid in establishing a diverse symbiotic host-associated community the change in ideology has permeated enough to be implemented into practice the health sector has redefined its view of the roles that microorganisms play in human health particularly in establishing an active yet restrained immune system and that of a stable and functional microbial community in preventing the overgrowth of certain taxa or activation of pathogenesis 1721 health procedures have even begun to incorporate microorganisms into treatment or prevention regimens in particular with fecal microbial transplant or probiotics to help stabilize the gut microbiota against disturbance or to recover a diverse community 2327microorganisms can be found in every environment including built environmentsour habitat of buildings roads vehicles and other human-associated spacesand even in ultra-clean rooms and space stations 28 collectively these factors mold the built environments microbiome 2931all the genetic material of the microbial members present from which can be derived taxonomic identification and metabolic potential including activities like nutrient utilization and antimicrobial production 30 32 the indoor microbial community is a blend of microorganisms sourced from various ecosystems which seed each particular built environment thus no two homes or two offices share the exact same microbial footprintthe majority of interest in microbiology of the built environment has focused on microbially-mediated building deterioration or detriment to occupant health from specific microorganisms of interest despite advances in awareness of the potential for microbial exposure indoors 33 microorganisms in the built environment are still considered as debris to be removed instead of members of a microbial ecosystem which is inexorably linked to the influences of building inhabitants 29 31 3437 given the propensity for microbial biofilms or overgrowth to pose a threat to the health of occupants it is not difficult to understand why yet in the same way that a stable host-associated microbial community can resist disturbance that would shift the community and cause harm to the host indoor microbiologists and architects have pondered the equivalent in the built environmentie a house-associated microbial community these so-called healthy buildings or bioinformed designs would keep microbiology in mind 3840 hypothetically these designs would acknowledge the impossibility of ridding the built environment of microorganisms indoors and instead learn to carefully use selective pressures and microbial sourcing to cultivate a healthy symbiotic microbiome 41 examples of current practices and supporting research are discussed belowarchitectural design affects human or animal behavior ie their interactions with each other and their surroundings indoors 42 43 and how and where we emit and deposit our unique individual microbial communities 4446 the occupant-associated proportion of indoor microbial communities can be directly attributed to the individuals who spend sufficient time within that space 43 4752 and what household activities are performed allowing for epidemiological tracking of infectious organisms 53 or microbial forensics 54 the amount of occupancy in buildings influenced by building type occupancy schedule and indoor activity facilitates the accrual of human-associated microorganisms 34 44 55 56 higher occupant density and increased indoor activity level typically increases social interaction and connectivity through direct contact indirect contact with shared surfaces or via shared air all of which may facilitate the spread of disease 5759 for example schools and libraries which have long occupancy schedules high occupant density and high turnover of individuals throughout spaces in a day often have high concentrations of putative human pathogens in the air 60 61 overcrowding in hospitals contributes to the risk of patients contracting a hospital-acquired infection hai during their initial stay as well as to staff illness 62 63 despite incorporating many ways to isolate occupants prisons are not designed with infection control in mind 64 hygiene practices are hampered by resource rationing or location of hygiene facilities facilities may be overcrowded proper infection control training may not be provided to staff and inmates are under stressful conditions which can modify the host response and their personal microbiome leaving them vulnerable to infectious disease 64the primary avenue of reducing person-to-person microbial transfer is quarantine achieved indoors by spatial or temporal separation quarantine remains an effective way of preventing the spread of infectious agents however it is typically applied reactively to control a known infection and many infectious agents are shed asymptomatically eg clostridioides difficile 65 66 single-patient rooms in hospitals or assisted-living facilities create a proactive modified quarantine which may reduce patient stay durations and reduce errors in care 67 in work spaces quarantine may take the form of single-occupancy offices rather than shared or open floor plans which in survey-based assessments are correlated with more employee sick leave 68 69 however open floor plans may support aspects of teamwork or increased access to natural light and air which make them desirable or necessary to a space likewise model simulations of social networking and disease transmission indicate that schools that reduce interaction and contact within and between groups of elementary students would be able to reduce influenza transmission more effectively than total school closures 70 which provide the opportunity for out-of-school contact while effective quarantine is often at cross purposes with spatial habitation and may be impossible or only possible for only short periods of time and in most cases requires significant infrastructure and therefore costa contrasting strategy to reducing human-human microbial transmission indoors that has only recently been proposed is simply a return to social practices that embrace positive host-microbial transfers to facilitate a diverse human microbiota cohabiting humans share microbiota with each other the degree of which corresponds to the nature of their relationship and level of intimacy they share 49 71 in terms of the built environment this involves combining space types or otherwise fostering certain human-human interactions for example the integration of child-care and aged-care facilities seeks to improve emotional social and physical wellbeing 72 and may be inadvertently improving microbial-wellbeing as well the human microbiome becomes disordered later in life 7375 which can decrease resistance and resilience to disturbance providing social interaction with children who have a diverse microbiota and whose gastrointestinal tracts still contain beneficial early-colonizer taxa such as bifidobacteria 74 76 may help older adults recolonize their own microbiotasomething like a two-legged probiotic however microbial transfer in these instances cannot be limited to potentially beneficial microorganisms and the transference of pathobionts or viruses will pose a risk to elderly adultscorrespondingly host-sourced probiotics may come in a four-legged version exposure to dogs but not cats are associated with decreased risk of developing asthma or allergies if children are exposed early in life 19 attributed to differences in pet species microbial community in mouse models early exposure to dust from homes with dogs reduced the immune response to various allergens later in life and altered the gut community 77 78 specifically exposure to dust from homes with dogs increased the abundance of the bacteria lactobacillus johnsonii in the gut 77 78 and even oral administration of the bacteria alone demonstrated similar positive effect to that of the dog-associated dust 77 78 colonization of the gut by l johnsonii creates favorable conditions for co-colonization of the beneficial bacteria bacillus fragilis by providing an n-glucan biosynthesis pathway something which is reduced in the gut of asthmatics 79 oral probiotics are often effective in managing respiratory illness symptoms 80 and a small but encouraging amount of evidence exists on aerosolized or inhaled probiotics to similar effect 81 82 intranasal lactobacillus paracasei reduced inflammation and immune system markers but increased neutropenia in the lungs of mice 81 and aerosolized lactobacillus rhamnosus protected mice against transplanted lung tumors 82 importantly successful probiotics for humans in these and other studies are comprised of lactic-acid bacterial species which are typically found on or near human mucosal surfaces at various body sites but are not found in the built environment except when sourced from mammalian occupants even then lactobacilli often do not survive the aerobic conditions of buildingswhile the concept of prescribed host-microbial transfer between individuals holds promise it is also at cross-purposes with instances where quarantine would be prudent it is important to recognize that in any given public building be it hospital school or office building there is a diversity of individuals with differing degrees of immune system health and inflammatory exacerbation therefore architectural design and building operation would ideally be flexible and adaptable enough to respond in a manner to best serve differing communities of human inhabitantsmoisture is one of the most potent contributors to microbial survival in air and on surfaces 100103 including resistance to electrostatic charges on surfaces 104 microbial activity 86 105 and the structure of the microbial community overall as survivors prosper 34 56 106 the ability of microbial cells or spores to become aerosolized from surfaces and be resuspended into air due to occupant traffic or disturbance 107 108 is increased by a low-relative humidity 109 low-relative humidity such as 2030 increases the infection rates of aerosolized particles such as influenza 110 111 as well as overall hai frequencies 112 this reflects two mechanisms of low relative humidity 1 the drying of host mucous membranes which increases susceptibility to infection 111 113 and 2 the increased potential for particles to aerolosize as smaller droplets stay aloft longer and travel further distances 111 low humidity is also perceived as less comfortable and less fresh 111high relative humidity such as 80 contributes to microbial survival and activity on surfaces fig 1 100103 it is associated with more mucosal irritation and antigenic potential from fungi 109 114 and can better facilitate the direct-contact transfer of microorganisms from fomite to host 95 microenvironments within surfaces particularly carpet can create pockets of higher relative humidity which can further mediate transfer from surfaces fig 1 115 similarly air thermodynamics creates updrafts and other turbulence which can bring microorganisms into a persons breathing zone 116 and warm or moist air rises and can create pockets of higher relative humidity when trapped by ceilings however by allowing for larger aerosolized particles high relative humidity can cause particles to settle out of air more quickly a variable gradient or localization of relative humidity within a building or a space may be required to provide optimal conditions for reducing the dispersal and contraction of potential pathogens in the built environment 111dampness or water damage which supports microbial biofilms is especially important for overt microbial growth especially fungal or mold growth and biodeterioration of building materials fig 1 117121 dampness has also been extensively studied in relation to the exacerbation of asthma symptoms 122 and these efforts are not repeated in this review motile escherichia coli are capable of traveling from sink traps back up the drain into the sink at a rate of 25 cm per day from where they spread to other areas via droplet spray during sink use 123 similarly water heaters host bacterial communities which can spread mycobacterium via aerosolization at faucets and showerheads 124126 and legionella pneumophila can persist in building ventilation systems and infect building occupants 127 128however development of building systems or cleaning products which intentionally create biofilms have also been utilized to positive effect recently microbial biofilms have been used to reinforce building surfaces instead of decomposing them namely through mineralization and deposition of calcium carbonate into concrete 129 the hydrophobic nature of many bacterial biofilms can impart that protective hydrophobicity onto building surfaces 130 as well biofilms have also been used to remediate water and air especially when other filtration eg reverse osmosis or sterilization techniques are impractical microbial biofilms treat building waste water and even provide non-potable water for reuse within building systems 131 similarly active green walls have been used to improve air quality measured via clean air delivery rate by utilizing a combination of plant and plant- or soil-associated microorganisms to degrade particulates in conjunction with active airflow 132134 however green walls do have the potential to increase humidity indoors and poor infrastructure in installations can result in moisture-related structural damage potentially providing adequate microbial growth conditions the potential health benefits or infection risks of intentional microbial biofilms indoors have not been thoroughly examined yet the possibility exists to try and make use of biofilms particularly where they might not interact with occupantsambient indoor air temperature has been both positively 34 114 135 and inversely 56 114 correlated with indoor microbial community richness fig 1 it is likely that this correlation has more complex underpinnings such as the relation of temperature to relative humidity and with seasonal or local weather conditions and the resultant change in building operations most of the studies noting a change in the microbial community correlated with temperature were in buildings utilizing air conditioning 34 56 135 given that most buildings are maintained at temperatures conducive to microbial growth it seems less probable that temperature alone is a suitable mark for microbial control indoors with the exception of viruses which are more sensitive to temperature 103 however ambient indoor air temperature does affect animal and human hosts and the rate at which they shed microorganisms or the degree to which they are susceptible to them for example low air temperature 5 c did not affect the susceptibility of guinea pigs to acquiring aerosolized influenza virus as the immune system response was not impaired but this low air temperature did cause infected guinea pigs to produce and shed more virions in oronasal fluids to produce virions for 40 h longer and to increase the rate of transmission 110a great deal of work has focused on the effect of light and architectural design to improve human health productivity and comfort 136 137 specifically pointing to the beneficial effects of full-spectrum sunlight on human physiology as early as 1845 it was understood that sunlight in buildings was important for human health and there were calls from the medical community to repeal the 100-year old glass tax in britain 138 the shift towards industrialization and the reduction of natural daylight indoors to which the glass tax contributed was having noticeable health effects for those spending more and more time indoors 136 in the pre-antimicrobial era sunlight was used to treat microbial infections such as tuberculosis of the skin 139 140 and architectural design responded to accommodate health-based infrastructure 136 140 141 in the late 1800s researchers began studying the bactericidal effects of sunlight 142144 quickly realizing the importance of sunlight for controlling pathogenic bacteria particularly in health care facilities 145147 there were even concerns that tall buildings in cities would block the sunlight needed to kill the agent of typhoid fever 148 in cities like new york the skyline still reflects codes related to building setbacks for access to light and air and the british law of ancient lights dating back to the prescription act of 1189 highlights the understanding of the value of light for health 149a large body of research has been conducted on the effect of full-spectrum sunlight light 141 150 151 ultraviolet light 147 152156 and blue or red wavelengths 157160 on mono-cultured bacterial or fungal survival and activity fig 1 additionally light has been shown to reduce virus virulence and increase viron decay 103 141 161 however microorganisms particularly bacteria may easily evolve resistance to uva and uvb light exposure 153 uvc light to control microbial growth has recently gained popularity because there is no a priori resistance to it as it does not penetrate the atmosphere while effective 155 it is logical to predict that resistance to uvc might develop over time with increased exposure only a few studies evaluate the effect of light on whole microbial communities related to the built environment including those in house dust or on human skin 85 162 163 a recent study demonstrated that different light wavelengths affect the survival of bacteria in complex dust communities differently visible or uv light reduces the number of living bacteria in dust and results in a less human-associated bacterial community than darkness does 85 143 similarly indoor surface bacterial communities contained fewer human-associated taxa as the amount of illumination in hospital rooms increased 164 in terms of light exposure it appears that daylighting schemes which benefit humans in a myriad of ways also facilitate control of bacterial populations indoors 141 and is likely one of the easiest strategies to support healthy buildings anecdotally when architects describe healthy building principles they routinely speak of access to daylight and outside air and this is supported by the prioritization of daylight in building performance rating systems such as leed and well 165 166control of indoor microbial communities typically involves the removal of microbial biomass new infection-prevention standards have been integrated into healthcare facilities architectural designs and clinical procedures 167 168 sophisticated technology exists to monitor hand-hygiene compliance time-outs during surgical procedures for safety checklists and surface disinfection 169 mechanical filtration non-ionizing uvc disinfection of building cavities and wall assemblies room pressurization and laminar ventilation air-flow have been implemented to control pathogen spread 170 yet few studies confirm that these interventions decrease hai 103 110 171 172 this may be due to the fallibility of typical cleaning behaviors common surface cleaning techniques do not remove all microbial biomass from surfaces where after just a few days 173 microbial communities are found even in clean rooms or reagents that are considered to be sterile 28 174176 furthermore the use of cleaning materials which are themselves contaminated with bacteria simply relocate bacteria between surfaces without removing them 177 often times the use of powerful antimicrobial cleaning solutions can contribute to complacency by cleaning staff 178 and adherence to cleaning protocols may lapse over time 179 leading to the persistence of microorganisms in spaces that are considered clean 176 however education on correct and thorough cleaning has been demonstrated to significantly decrease microbial load on frequented surfaces in healthcare environments 180disruption of microbial transfer can be achieved in real-time using ventilation with sufficient air exchanges andor directed air flow to reduce the impact of potentially contaminated air 57 58 this has been widely implemented in health care settings or clean rooms and spaces and has been proposed for other crowded public spaces 181 while appropriate ventilation may not effectively reduce all infection transmission depending on microbial transmission potentials and pathology it has been demonstrated to reduce the spread of bacterium mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as a number of viruses measles chickenpox varicella influenza smallpox and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 182 natural ventilation which has a lower energy impact and can help mediate relative humidity has been demonstrated to reduce disease transmission risk 141 183 and to reduce the human occupant microbial signal in dust by introducing outdoor-associated microorganisms 48 55 184 however high ventilation rates which cause too much turbulence can negatively affect health by retaining particulate matter in the air 185the concept of promoting a dynamic and living indoor microbial community is not widely accepted and infection control practices continue to view indoor microbiota as a problem that can be rectified given the right cleaning protocols with the demonstrated failure of current cleaning protocols and mandates some have investigated the intentional addition of benign microorganisms in the built environment to control pathogenic microorganisms and neutralize the potential negative impact that the microbial world has on our health in recent years microbial-based cleaning products mbcps have gained popularity 186 and typically include microorganisms that can outcompete and degrade organic elements of pathogenic microorganisms 187 the most commonly utilized microorganisms typically belong to the genera archromobacter actinobacter alcaligenes arthrobacter rhodopseudomonas rhodobacter and lactobacillus 186 the majority of which have been found to degrade xenobiotic compounds 188 and are widely accepted as non-hazardous bacillus-based cleaning products have shown promising results in decreasing the viability of pathogenic microorganisms with continued decreases in pathogenic bacterial load associated with continued cleanings 189 further bacillus-based cleaning has been shown to reduce antibiotic resistance genes including those associated with species associated with hospital associated infections 190 microbial aerosolizers have also become commercially available to provide a probiotic for the home which are typically bacilli-based and do not appear to contain lactobacilli regardless of the bacterial composition intended use and health claims probiotic cleaners generally lack clinical trials at this timewhen contemplating the indoor microbiome we invariably return to the goal of enhancing the experience and health of its macroscopic occupants aside from clear evidence for infection-potential the role of the built environment on long-term health or chronic conditions is unclear occupants may face indirect effects on health or exacerbation of chronic conditions from microbial byproducts including dozens of bacterial 191 and over 150 fungal allergens 192 as well as microbial volatile organic compounds mvocs these mvocs have as yet only been associated with adverse health effects such as neurosensory mucosal membrane or respiratory reactions 193 which can result in absenteeism or the need for medical intervention 61 194196 asthma in particular is exacerbated by antigens and mvocs as well as building material-sourced vocs 194 in the united states an estimated 199 million adults suffer from asthma 197 which accounts for more school absences than any other chronic health condition 198 and for approximately 6169 million usd in losses per year for the united states economy from lost productivity absenteeism and emergency medical visits 199different indoor bacterial communities are commonly reported in the homes of dermal or asthmatic atopy or non-atopic asthma sufferers 56 200 in comparison with otherwise healthy homes one study found the urban homes of young children with atopic dermatitis or wheezing had lower bacterial richness than homes with healthy children 201 while another study found there was no difference in bacterial richness of asthmatic vs nonasthmatic homes 200 despite the differences in outcome both studies concluded that the overall community was significantly altered in addition to reports of decreased abundance of members of the phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes in homes with children who suffer from wheezing or atopy 201 members of the phyla cyanobacteria and proteobacteria were increased in asthmatic homes 200 many human pathobionts microorganisms capable of pathogenicity but not inherently infectious 202 belong to the proteobacteria phylum cyanobacteria typically found in water systems has been detected in office buildings 203 and were posited to be responsible for the prevalence of allergic reactions to algae 204 yet it has not been demonstrated whether an altered community in dust is a cause of atopic or asthmatic symptoms or the effect of having a respiratory condition and altering cleaning and ventilation habits which subsequently alter the indoor community moreover phylum-level changes in a dust community may not be meaningful for all phyla firmicutes bacteroidetes and proteobacteria are found in host-associated and environmental ecosystems with species or strain-level differences in community composition based on the specific conditions therefurthermore while buildings can exacerbate pre-existing respiratory conditions the role of the built environment in causing or preventing the development of respiratory conditions remains unclear recent research has shown that a diverse and abundant microbial community in house dust which is often associated with rural farmhouses and homes with pets is not deleterious to human health 205208 longitudinal studies which point to the presence of pathobionts and antigens in the home during the first few years of life having a long-term protective effect against the development of adverse symptoms 201 lend support to the old friends hypothesis specifically exposure to allergens from cockroaches dogs and cats were associated with a lower risk of recurrent wheezing 201 some of the bacteria of interest were correlated with allergen concentration including a known cockroach symbiont and researchers speculated that some of these bacteria in dust may be sourced from cockroaches or mice and that a combination of low bacterial diversity and high antigen concentration may be most efficacious in causing antigen sensitization 201outside of the importance of early microbial and antigen exposure in developing a well-functioning immune system the potential for positive feedback from the built environment to human health is less well understood it is possible that a diverse microbial community indoors can facilitate a more diverse host-microbial community or at least provide a regular source of immune system challenge that can facilitate better host-microbial control however environmental microbial communities appear to have short-lived effects on skin microbiota in healthy individuals 163 209 in hospital patients the skin and digestive tract microbial community can be modulated in stays less than 2 weeks and this disordered host microbiome may allow for colonization from unlikely sources such as the built environment 210 microorganisms found on various surfaces within neonatal intensive care units nicus were subsequently observed in the digestive tract of resident infants including the same strain of enterococcus faecalis in the gut of two infants housed in the same ward 211 the lack of biodiversity within the infants gut at the start of the study provided an ideal environment to track specific strains of microorganisms being transferred between the sterile environmental and the human microbiome similarly the hospital microbiome project observed surfaces and patients in a newly opened hospital for the span of a year revealing more of the intricate relationship between the human microbiome and the built environment using 16s rdna sequencing 212 it was observed that when a patient was admitted to a room they initially acquired taxa that was in the room prior to their stay however over several days of occupancy the patients microbial signature began to influence that of the room patient skin and the room surfaces were found to be more similar further into the patients stay 212as in any complex system a simplified model reveals patterns in the same way that the transfer of building-sourced microorganisms and the resulting health effects is most easily observed in infants and the immunocompromised humans living in extreme built environments can model how a simplified indoor microbiome might affect otherwise healthy individuals in isolated communities such as in the arctic or antarctic heightened social connectedness created by consolidated living conditions can contribute to the spread of human-to-human 213 and building-to-human 214 infections gastrointestinal disease from water recycling systems is a constant concern 214 the bacterial community in the gastrointestinal tract of antarctic visitors decreased in diversity and lost key beneficial members such as bifidobacterium 215 both of which can lead to a disrupted intestinal community and risk of disease similarly the sterilization of food and equipment prior to launch the harsh conditions of space travel and the isolation from any outside microbial source contributes to the development of a low-diversity microbial community which is both sparse and tough 28 216 217 and does not make for pleasant company 218220 the harsh conditions and increase in radiation can contribute to accelerated evolution a distinct strain of aspergillus niger was isolated from the international space station 221 over time rapid evolution to support hardiness can lead to the development of survivor strains which are extremely difficult to kill or eradicate and recent research has demonstrated this in the built environment 222 in the same way that hai are a growing threat to public safety space-evolved microorganisms and built environments devoid of life may one day hamper our efforts for long-term space travel or residency without radical design changeswhile we are beginning to describe the ways in which the built environment affects health more research is clearly needed before any accurate conclusions can be reached the majority of indoor microbiology studies rely on observations and variation within the microbial community but have not connected these to any potential health outcomes 29 44 49 223 224 similar to the loss of host-associated microorganisms contributing to human immune dysfunction it has been hypothesized that the loss of macro- and microorganism diversity seen in most urban environments has also reduced our environmental microbial exposures which help train the immune system 225 however the loss of ecosystem-scale biodiversity is inexorably tied to increased pollution as well as changing lifestyle ie activity levels and changes in social engagement and it is difficult to disentangle these other effects from that of reduced diversity in microbial exposures moreover it has not been conclusively established that a diverse indoor microbiome has any effect on health in otherwise healthy individuals and the diversity and plasticity of occupants and their respective immune status requires flexibility in the content of that indoor microbiome thus healthy indoor microbiome eludes definition and may only apply to the young or the immunocompromised 210 211epidemiological investigation has shown humans can acquire infectious disease from the built environment 99 127 128 226 227 but outside of pathogen-based investigations only a few studies demonstrate microbial transmission from a built environment to a human or animal host 163 209 evaluating the transfer of microorganisms from the built environment to humans has challenges not the least of which are the technical and logistical challenges of tracking individual cells moving from an area of very low biomass to very high biomass additionally surface material and microorganism characteristics contribute to the likelihood of resuspension or transfer 95 228 229 and the complexity of the microbial community of the recipient likely mediates the potential for retention on a hostas with all microbial communities elucidation of trends requires both a temporal and spatial resolution of sampling microbial transfer from the built environment to humans is often successfully observed using individuals whose microbiota are in a dysbiotic state such as the very young or very sick 127 128 210 211 230 231 transcriptomics is the sequencing of all an organisms or communitys rna transcripts 232 yet it only provides a snapshot of activity in built environments which may only allow for sporadic activity from microbial communities or time-dependent activity in the case of communities exposure to daylight transcriptomics may not yield information on the entire community due to the low probability of observing a spontaneous transfer event an in situ microbial transfer from the built environment to an occupant requires a high resolution of spatial and temporal samples can financially preclude the use of omics-technologies which could provide more highly resolved data some of these difficulties have been overcome by large-scale or long-term projects which accumulate sufficiently large datasets to locate infrequent microbial transmissions interestingly several of these utilize 16s rdna sequencing data yet with sufficient time or spatial resolution of samples the inclusion of regular sampling from patients regardless of symptoms or the examination of low-diversity communities from built environments and hospital patients the transmission of microorganisms from buildings to bodies was successfully observed 209 211 212 despite these successes the logistical difficulty of finding the transmission of a microbial needle in a dust haystack remains a barrier to understanding how microorganisms in buildings affect human health a great deal of discussion has centered around the development of low-cost real-time microbial sensing capabilities in buildings 31 233 which would track total biomass or detect certain species or antigens and interface with building automation services to alter operationsthe majority of studies determine the identity of bacteria present by sequencing the 16s ribosomal rna gene rdna this highly conserved prokaryotic gene provides a useful and reliable yet inexpensive means of taxonomic identification however the increased use of universal prokaryotic primers favors bacteria over archaea and typically results in underestimated diversity and taxonomic resolution of archaea similarly the difficulty in predicting ecology and host-microorganism interactions using only taxonomic markers eg 16s rdna 18s rdna internal transcribed spacer its regions provides fodder for hypothesis but not mechanism another major limiting factor is the lack of strain-specific identification which obscures evidence that microorganisms from the built environment and those identified as causative agents in hosts are the same microorganisms in some cases the specificity of strain is not needed to determine where the microorganism came from as in the case of legionella in water systems due to the specificity of niche location within the built environment that one may find the microorganism however many microorganisms spend parts of their lives in different habitats making it more difficult to determine the origin of that strain later research into the microbiomes of the built environment has included the use of metagenome sequencing which generates data on all the dna material in an environment including genomic and plasmidic metagenome sequencing has given researchers a holistic view of the indoor microbiome for example the ability to determine what genomic characteristics are typical of a specific built environment 46 222 234 yet genetic potential does not always translate to activity and dna-based technology easily picks up relic dna from an environmentan important feature to assess in any microbial community is the determination of which species present are alive and metabolically active 235 rdna and rrna extracted from the same sources resulted in significantly different overall characterization of the microbiota 32 236 analyzing both rna and dna in combination even just rrna and rdna can provide further insight than just one method alone such as the effect of environmental conditions on which microorganisms thrive while others struggle or perish there are other methods to select for living microorganisms which may be dormant or only slightly metabolically active such as amplification inhibitors added prior to nucleic acid extraction for example propidium monoazide pma is a membrane-impermeable dye that is only able to enter into cells which have a damaged cell membrane 237 pma preferentially covalently binds to double stranded dna dsdna where it strongly inhibits polymerase chain reaction pcr from occurring in downstream laboratory protocols allowing studies to solely amplify the dsdna of living cells by comparing samples from the same community with and without pma treatment researchers can begin to understand the current state and recent history of the community in which they are studying 85 respectively for example pma treatment was used to determine how different types of light might select for microbial communities in dust 85 the detection of living cells is an added technological challenge for real-time microbial monitoring in buildings however the detection of living cells may be immaterial in certain circumstances such as the detection of microbial antigensprevious studies looking at health effects have used either correlational studies 191 238 or mouse models 239 mouse models provide a good starting point for epidemiological studies but often react differentially in comparison to humans when exposed to the same compounds 240 due to differences in metabolic rates prenatal development and immune system and interactions related to social structure and use of their environment moreover microbial and chemical exposure may be localized within a building and the sum of an occupants path through the built environment over time leads to tailored exposures from the built environmentrecently coined exposomes 241 242 in recent years a new technology organ chips has emerged as a potential medium through which to study the built environment organ-on-a-chip ooc systems replicate human organs by combining microfluidics three-dimensional tissue constructs and cultured human cells 243 oocs allow researchers to study the effects of differing exposomes on human metabolism immune response and toxicity by combining multiple oocs to create a system of organs just as in the body 244 ooc technology could develop into an invaluable tool in the study of the daily exposome on the inhabitants of the built environmentyet another challenge in the study of the built environment is determining what effects if any may come from our daily exposomes perhaps the clearest example of the potential future investigation of the built environment is the recent research that piloted wearable collection devices to track the overall accumulation of microorganisms and abiotic factors over the course of three test subjects normal day 242 a combination of dna and rna sequencing liquid chromatography-coupled spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy was used to determine the identities of the microorganisms and chemical compounds that the study participants encountered during the sampling period this study found strong location-dependant relationships between the movement of the study participants and the microorganisms and compounds they were exposed to alluding to the potential impact that varying built environment compositions could have on microbial exposure the three individuals were exposed to over 2500 species of microorganisms however the authors reported that 4374 of the analyzed dna could not be connected to a known species this demonstrates the tremendous amount of research that needs to be done and is on its own a strong reason to invest more time energy and money into studying the built environmentoverall our understanding and our views of the relationships we have with microorganisms are evolving 20 31 202 245 what remains is the ability to know why when and how microorganisms transfer from the built environment to occupants when these interactions matter under what circumstances these transfers lead to disease and when these interactions are beneficial to built environment occupants 33 the variety of occupants and health needs in a space will likely dictate strategies to inform that indoor microbiome including fostering or inhibiting human to human contact removing or adding microbial biofilms and integrating microbial communities into building systems similarly the move towards building automation will need to incorporate technologies designed to monitor and manipulate microorganisms in ways which do not create the harsh selective pressures that may lead to dangerous survivor phenotypes such as full spectrum sunlight instead of antibiotics or single-ingredient cleaning products technological advances such as high-throughput sequencing and transcriptomic analysis have given us new insights into the communities and activities of the microorganisms with which we share our everyday lives despite these new insights we still conceive of our living spaces as places that must protect and isolate us from the world of microorganisms using new technology to understand microbial dynamics and host interactions we continue to evolve past the idea that buildings are isolation chambers to protect occupants from contact with the microbial world and begin to shape salubrious indoor microbial ecosystems through building designthe potential for airborne transmission of sewage-related infectious disease was demonstrated by horrocks over 100 years ago1 when he cultured airborne microorganisms from sewage drain systems and also detected airborne transport from one hospital building to another via the sewer drains similar results were seen by others including andrewes2
bioaerosol production during toilet flushing was first reported in the 1950s by jessen3 who seeded several types of toilets with serratia marcescens then termed bacillus prodigiosus and measured bioaerosols produced by flushing agar-filled settle plates caught bioaerosols that fell out of the air because of gravity and a bourdillon slit impactor4 collected air samples cistern-fed gravity-flow toilets and a mains-fed pressure-valve toilet were examined in addition to colonies found on the floor-based settle plates microbes were still being captured from the air 8 minutes after the flush indicating collection of droplet nuclei bioaerosols droplet nuclei are the tiny particles that remain after the water in a droplet evaporates they have negligible settling velocity and will float with natural air currents5 jessen observed that the amount of bioaerosol increased with increasing flush energy3
darlow and bale6 seeded a wash-down type toilet with s marcescens and sampled air above the toilet with liquid impingers and a bourdillon impactor a wash-down toilet releases the flush water from the toilet rim where it flows down the bowl walls and washes the waste into the s-shaped exit trapway7 bioaerosol was detected in samples collected above the toilet 5 to 7 minutes after the flush indicating droplet nuclei bioaerosol despite over 99 reductions in bowl water microbial concentrations with each flush air samples indicated only 50 to 60 bioaerosol reductions they concluded that this was at least partially attributable to a reduction in the number of bacteria per droplet rather than a reduction in the number of droplets containing bacteria because both a multiorganism droplet and a single-organism droplet would appear as 1 colony when deposited on an impactor agar platesiphonic toilets which feature a submerged jet that propels the waste into the trapway to initiate a siphon action that clears the waste have generally replaced wash-down models bound and atkinson8 found that the higher energy siphonic toilet produced approximately 114th as much bioaerosol as the wash-down design for the same flush volume newsom also demonstrated higher bioaerosol production with higher flush energy when he compared high and low cistern toilets seeded with homogenized feces or suspensions of various bacteria9
gerba et al10 seeded a siphonic gravity-flow toilet with escherichia coli and sequentially placed 3 arrays of settle plates on the floor around the toilet with each set exposed for 2 hours for the first sample set 0-2 hours cultured bacteria were predominantly from plates near the toilet whereas in later sample sets 2-4 and 4-6 hours the positive plates were more randomly distributed around the room this was consistent with an initial deposition of large droplets close to the toilet immediately after the flush followed by dispersion and mixing of the droplet nuclei into the air with delayed deposition throughout the room the e coli bioaerosol remained airborne and viable for at least 4 to 6 hours postflushbarker and bloomfield11 seeded a gravity-flow toilet with salmonella enteritidis pt4 and collected surface wipe and air samples after flushing they observed contamination of the toilet seat and the underside of the lid and also cultured salmonella from the air sample they detected salmonella in the bowl water after 12 days and in biofilm below the bowl waterline for 50 days after seeding which suggested a possible role of biofilm as a long-term reservoir and active source of pathogenic organisms in the bowl waterbarker and jones seeded a toilet with s marcescens or ms2 bacteriophage12 air samples were collected in front of and above the toilet seat with the toilet seat lid open they also exposed settle plates at 5 locations around the toilet including 2 above and behind the seat bioaerosols were present up to 60 minutes after flushing and all settle plates were positive for all test conditions and sampling locations demonstrating droplet nuclei bioaerosol they also examined toilet bowl clearance and bioaerosol production during sequential flushes without reseeding with results similar to those of darlow and bale6 newsom9 and gerba et al10 in that bioaerosol concentration did not decrease in proportion to bowl water concentrationrecently best et al13 flushed a toilet seeded with fecal suspensions of clostridium difficile settle plates were placed near the toilet and air was sampled at seat height flush handle height and midway in-between with the toilet lid both up and down settle plates showed widespread dissemination of large droplets with the lid up but not with the lid down c difficile was recovered from air sampled at heights up to 25 cm above the toilet seat and up to 90 minutes after flushing at concentrations 12-fold greater with the lid up than with the lid down they concluded that lidless conventional toilets increase the risk of c difficile environmental contamination and thus discouraged their use in the united states however this would contradict current uniform plumbing code specifications regarding toilet seat design and the installation of toilet seat lids on health care and other public facility water closets14 as well as similar requirements for gap-front seats without cover for water closets in the us veterans administration specifications often cited for health care facility design15
it may be concluded from the above that flush toilets produce substantial quantities of toilet plume aerosol capable of entraining microorganisms at least as large as bacteria that sufficiently small microbe-laden droplets will evaporate to form droplet nuclei bioaerosols small enough to be inhaled deep into the lung and that these bioaerosols may remain viable in the air for extended periods and travel with air currents production of these bioaerosols during multiple flushes after contamination suggests a long-term potential for a contaminated toilet to be an infectious bioaerosol generatora number of studies have demonstrated the contamination of toilet seats and lids the surrounding floors and the nearby surfaces by toilet flush aerosols3 6 9 10 12 13 16 because both the vomit and feces of infected persons may contain extremely high pathogen concentrations eg 105 to 109
shigella17 104 to 108
salmonella17 and 108 to 109 norovirus18 per gram of stool and at least 106 norovirus per milliliter of vomit19 some fraction of the aerosol droplets produced during toilet flushing may be expected to contain microbes20
a critical determinant of the infection risk posed by a deposited pathogen will be the organisms ability to survive on a surface21 many pathogens including shigella e coli c difficile severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus and norovirus can survive on surfaces for weeks or even months22 these pathogens can also be present in vomit or stools of infected personsin 1956 hutchinson associated the transmission of sonne dysentery with shigella contamination on toilet seats23 and a number of subsequent field studies have detected contamination on toilet seats and surrounding surfaces with fecal organisms9 11 24 25 thorough cleaning and disinfection of environmental surfaces in health care facilities is a foundational component of infection control programs26 and disinfection is particularly important because many studies have shown that microbial surface contamination including c difficile vancomycin-resistant enterococcus and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa may persist even after cleaning27 28 29 the limits of environmental cleaning in preventing spread of viral disease are apparent with acute gastroenteritis age age is frequently caused by norovirus and the diarrhea and vomiting typically associated with age as well as the high viral loads in both stools and vomit suggest a likely toilet role in disease transmission environmental contamination has been shown to be a major source of age infection on ships30 31 32 33 34 35 including during sequential voyages of a cruise ship in spite of aggressive sanitation efforts and a documented history of good centers for disease control and prevention cdc vessel sanitation program inspection scores34 this may be due in part to the ability of toilets to continue generating contaminated toilet plume during multiple flushes after original contamination as well as the apparent resistance of norovirus36 and perhaps other viruses to cleaning and disinfection gerba et al observed that ms2 bacteriophage and poliovirus were not completely cleared from a toilet even after 7 flushes and that scrubbing with or without addition of a surfactant to the water was only minimally effective in eliminating these residual organisms10 the manner in which cleaning and disinfection is performed is also important in ensuring complete disinfection of surfaces especially when surfaces are heavily contaminated37
although chapin dismissed the airborne route as unimportant in his 1912 review of infectious disease transmission38 by the 1960s it was accepted that droplet nuclei microbial aerosols were important in the transmission of many infectious diseases in both indoor and outdoor environments39 40 we now understand that whether pathogenic droplet nuclei bioaerosols actually cause infection and disease will depend on numerous factors including the organisms viability under existing environmental conditions the size and chemical composition of the droplet nuclei matrix the number of organisms inhaled and their virulence and the exposed persons immune status40
a number of diseases are known or suspected to be transmissible by the airborne route however most are either not transmissible from human to human or are not present in feces or vomit and so are not relevant to the present discussion toilet-related pathogens that are of interest include those causing gastroenteritis and a number of gastroenteritis-causing bacteria protozoa and especially viruses will be shed in stool and vomit giardia and cryptosporidium protozoa may be present in feces have low infective dose and are stable in the environment but aerosolization of oocyst-containing droplet nuclei has not been documented41 gram-negative bacteria with the notable exception of legionella are susceptible to drying and do not usually spread by the airborne route the gram-positive mrsa is an airborne nosocomial infection concern42 but the potential for toilet plume bioaerosols to cause nosocomial mrsa infection has not yet been assessed
mycobacterium tuberculosis tb appears to be most efficiently transmitted via droplet nuclei43 and is an occupational hazard to health care workers as well as a nosocomial infection hazard to patients44 tb affects primarily the lungs but tb bacilli can also be swallowed in sputum to infect the gastrointestinal gi tract45 at least 21 of 2009 us tb cases involved this extrapulmonary infection including infection of the gi tract46 although perhaps less than 5 of all tb cases involve lower gi tract infection45 the bacilli can survive intestinal transit to be shed in stool47 48 and because one of the symptoms of gi tb is diarrhea45 there appears to be a possibility of aerosolizing infectious tb droplet nuclei in toilet flush aerosol m tuberculosis is a lipid-rich hydrophobic bacterium and hydrophobic bacteria have been shown to concentrate on the surface of aqueous suspensions49 50 and to be aerosolized with even slight disturbance of liquid surfaces51 52
the most significant toilet plume airborne infection risks are likely to be due to viruses and perhaps the most significant of these is norovirus norovirus accounts for 73 to 95 of nonbacterial gastroenteritis outbreaks and half of all gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide53 it may also be transmitted in aerosol and has a low infectious dose54 it is shed both before and aftersometimes long afterthe symptomatic phase of infection is resistant to inactivation and can persist on environmental surfaces for extended periods55 56 57 diarrhea and vomiting are both common with norovirus age so both the use of toilets by infected persons and the toilet disposal of feces or vomit by other persons could produce norovirus bioaerosolsanother important viral pathogen is the sars coronavirus sars cov which is known to be shed in both feces58 59 60 and vomit60 a number of studies discussed below have suggested that it can be spread by the airborne route61 62 63 64 and although not presently a common disease it has demonstrated its potential for explosive spread and high mortalitynovel influenza a virus h1n1 has also demonstrated some important epidemiologic features that indicate a potential for airborne transmission via toilet plume seasonal influenza does not normally present with diarrhea or vomiting but each had a prevalence of 25 in the first 642 us cases65 and 17 and 22 respectively among the first 938 us cases66 diagnosed during the 2009 pandemic h1n1 influenza outbreak it has been measured in respirable-size aerosol in health care and other facilities67 68 has been detected in both stools and urine of h1n1 patients even in the absence of significant gi symptoms69 and has shown a potential for extended virus shedding in stool70 the presence of h1n1 in vomit seems likely and although no report documenting this was found a suggestive study by papenburg et al noted that the likelihood of h1n1 transmission in a household was greatest for patients with both diarrhea and vomiting71
widdowson et al investigated age among passengers on an 8-hour international flight72 on which 8 of 14 flight crew members experienced vomiting and diarrhea no episodes of diarrhea or vomiting occurred outside of a restroom and there were no reported indications of restroom soiling with vomit or feces passengers who developed probable norovirus illness 18 to 60 hours after disembarkation were found to have visited a restroom significantly more often than noncases the authors concluded that inapparent environmental contamination may have been an exposure sourceho et al studied an outbreak of viral age during a transatlantic passenger ship voyage73 they compared disease frequency in cabins varying from 1 to 4 occupants either having or not having a private bathroom and showed an increasing age risk with increasing number of occupants where a private bathroom was available as compared with cabins where one was not available age incidence among those using communal bathrooms correlated significantly with the bathroom usage density it was also shown that in cabins with multiple occupants the risk of a second person developing disease was higher in cabins where the first person had vomited even though none of the subsequent cases either assisted the ill person or cleaned up the vomit presence in the room when vomiting actually occurred also did not appear to matter the authors concluded that person-to-person and aerosol routes were the likely modes of transmission with vomit being implicated as a source and suggested that contact spread was facilitated by contaminated communal bathroomsmarks et al74 studied restaurant diners who developed age following nonprojectile vomiting by the source diner and showed a pattern of decreasing attack rate with increasing distance from the source 91 at the sources table 71 and 56 at the 2 adjacent tables respectively and lower rates farther away this study strongly implicated airborne norovirus transmission by vomit aerosol and thus the likelihood of airborne transmissibility by toilet plume aerosol contaminated with vomitepidemiologic experimental and modeling studies of sars are among the most compelling indicators of the potential for toilet plume to cause airborne disease transmission a report on the 2003 sars outbreak in hong kongs amoy gardens apartment complex concluded that exposure and disease propagation was likely due to virus-laden aerosols originating in the sanitary system64 the system was contaminated with sars cov when the index patient who was suffering from diarrhea visited one of the apartments and used the toilet sewer drain bioaerosol was believed to be drawn through dry floor drain u-tube traps into the bathrooms of other apartments by bathroom exhaust fans and some may have then been exhausted to the outside of the multistory building and carried upward to other apartments prevailing winds were thought to be responsible for carrying the infectious aerosol to nearby buildings where cases also occurred63 75 these studies suggest that sars cov droplet nuclei bioaerosols produced from contaminated sewage may have been highly infectious for significant periods and over long distances because the infectious waste whether feces or vomit is most concentrated in the toilet bowl and substantial quantities of aerosol are known to be produced during flushing it might reasonably be expected that infectious sars cov droplet nuclei bioaerosol would also be produced during toilet flushing to date however this has not been either experimentally or epidemiologically demonstratedno epidemiologic studies of the 2009 h1n1 pandemic have conclusively shown airborne transmission via droplet nuclei and the primary transmission mode is still considered to be by contact with large particle respiratory droplets or contaminated surfaces76 studies involving confined environment exposures in aircraft and buses concluded that the airborne route did not appear to be an important transmission mode77 78 79 80 in contrast to the high influenza transmission rate observed on an older aircraft with poor ventilation81 although these epidemiologic studies have not demonstrated airborne infection 2 recent environmental studies measured influenza a virus in respirable size aerosols collected in health care facilities day care centers and aircraft67 68 this finding the shedding of influenza virus in stool and perhaps vomit and the prevalence of diarrhea and vomiting in novel h1n1 patients encourage exploration of the potential for toilet plume to contain infectious virus-containing droplet nuclei aerosolsepidemiologic and laboratory studies provide evidence that potentially infectious aerosols may be produced during flushing of toilets contaminated with vomit or diarrhea from infected persons further assessment of the airborne infection risk requires research to address the following questions 1 what are the physical properties of toilet plume 2 how much toilet plume is produced and which toilet design or operating characteristics most influence aerosol production 3 how persistent are flush-generated droplet nuclei bioaerosols in the air 4 can infection be transmitted by toilet flush droplet nuclei bioaerosols and if so what are the airborne concentrations and dispersion patterns of flush-generated pathogenic droplet nuclei bioaerosols in health care environments 5 what interventions or practices might prove effective in controlling toilet plume bioaerosolscontaminated toilets have been clearly shown to produce large droplet and droplet nuclei bioaerosols during flushing and research suggests that this toilet plume could play an important role in the transmission of infectious diseases for which the pathogen is shed in feces or vomit the possible role of toilet plume in airborne transmission of norovirus sars and pandemic influenza is of particular interest additional research is needed to assess the exposure risk posed by toilet flush bioaerosols in health care facilitiesthe significance of regular and proper handwashing by caregivers and food handlers for infection control is incontrovertible however the use of formulated handwashes or handrubs may reduce the risk of spread of viruses topicals are used as surgical scrubs and preoperative skin preparations where the targets are both transient and resident microflora of the skin and as hygienic handwashing or antiseptic agents mainly to eliminate transient microorganismsnot only can hands carry viruses but they are often considered the preeminent means of their transmission the importance of viruses as human pathogens is also well recognized5 although some handwash or handrub products notably those containing a high proportion of alcohol have demonstrated efficacy against many viruses in experimental settings6 there is a general lack of effort to formulate hygienic handantiseptics against viruses test them for their virus-eliminating potential and an absence of suitable regulations to prepare and review label claims for such activity when such products are tested for activity against viruses it is often with inappropriate methodology and use of viruses that may be unsafe or irrelevant in hand antisepsis7 it is also important to note that many marketed topical formulations are not more effective against viruses than unmedicated soap and water8 however little incentive exists for the development of improved virucidal antiseptics because of the lack of a means to register label claims for effective products in contrast general purpose disinfectants which may be less important than hand antiseptics in intrepreting the spread of viral infections can make label claims against viruses it is difficult to know whether the major obstacle to more effective virucidal topicals is lack of regulations the lack of demand for regulation by manufacturers or users or both other complicating factors are the high cost of testing and the lack of accepted standard methods to examine virucidal activity of topicalsalthough there is no intent to negate the value of handwashing there is plenty of evidence from experimental literature to suggest that some handwash agents notably products formulated with alcohol as a major active ingredient19 outperform soap and water against many pathogens including viruses this article will therefore focus solely on germicidal soaps and waterless products formulated for hygienic hand antisepsis rather than handwashing with soap and waterterms such as disinfection and antisepsis often imply the inactivation of pathogens however in the field the reality is a combination of both removal and inactivation particularly in handwashing it is difficult to arrive at a neutral term that includes both removal and inactivation of microbial targets and could be used in the debate to determine whether these issues need to be regarded separately in the regulation of topicals for this purpose and to try and maintain neutrality early in the debate the word eliminate will be used at various places in this article decontamination has also been used here to denote the ridding of hands of harmful transient microorganisms with or without their in situ inactivationthere is rapidly increasing acceptance and use of alcohol-based waterless agents in the united states and canada for hand antisepsis between traditional handwashings10 11 because the use of such agents does not require any water rinse after treatment they would be expected to inactivate any transiently acquired pathogens in situ on hands even if they do not substantially remove soil and other debris unless otherwise stated the phrase hygienic hand antiseptics in this article includes both traditional water-aided and waterless agentsthe primary focus of this article is on the importance of enteric and respiratory virses the role of hands in their spread and the potential benefits of formulating topicals to include activity against viruses it will also critically assess the methods available for testing topicals against viruses as well as the main conditions and criteria for such testing perhaps 2 aspects that will require particular attention in this context are the level of virus-eliminating activity desired in topical agents and which if any viruses should be used as surrogates for human pathogenic viruses it is hoped that this critical analysis helps to clarify the topic and stimulate discussion more information on this and related issues are summarized elsewhere6 10 11
viruses are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in humans5 even mild viral infections can be a heavy burden on the health care system12 13 14 and the general economy indeed the relative significance of viruses is increasing as we successfully combat common bacterial diseases and many ongoing changes in our societies are adding to the importance of viruses as pathogens15 factors that make viruses significant pathogens have been summarized recently12 in the continued absence of safe chemotherapy and vaccines measures such as hand hygiene remain crucial for interrupting the spread of many types of viruses particularly by caregivers and food handlersseveral animal viruses16 can also infect humans17 and such zoonotic agents are important when handling domestic or experimental animals it is also quite likely that human hands can spread viruses between animals18 data from human experiments show the infectious dose of viruses to be as low as one infectious unit19
us data from more than 2 decades ago incriminated viruses in 5 of all cases of nosocomial infections20 in pediatric settings the rate was as high as 3221 these figures were most likely underestimations even when gathered because of the general difficulties in the differential clinical and laboratory diagnoses of viral infections moreover many changes in medical and surgical techniques as well as health care practices have occurred in the intervening years without any significant developments in the chemotherapy of viral infections these factors when taken together suggest the effect of viruses as nosocomial pathogens may be greater nowof all the viral infections of humans those of the respiratory and enteric tracts are most common globally according to the world health organization22 acute respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases lead to an annual loss of 83 and 73 million years of healthy life respectively in 1998 alone these 2 types of infections killed a total of 57 million people worldwide22 they are also among the most frequent nosocomial pathogens21 23 notwithstanding the difficulties of laboratory diagnosis of viral infections the most reliable data on the prevalence of respiratory and enteric infections are in the industrialized world better surveillance and enhanced application of molecular tests would undoubtedly increase the relative significance of viruses in the etiology of both acute and chronic diseasesthe following is a summary of the relative importance of respiratory enteric and other viral infections of humans evidence for their spread by hands and the role of topicals in interrupting such spread the basic characteristics of such viruses as they pertain to their potential for spread by hands are summarized in table 1
viruses cause most upper respiratory tract infections urti or colds in humans24 25 except in the young and the elderly urti are generally mild and self-limiting but can result in considerable economic losses also viral infections can trigger attacks of asthma26 27 close similarities between the clinical presentations of many viral and bacterial infections of the respiratory and enteric tracts could lead to underreporting of viral infections28 29 even milder viral infections can be important predisposing factors to more severe and possibly fatal secondary bacterial infections30 moreover coinfections of the respiratory tract with a viral and a bacterial agent may lead to atypical clinical presentations thus masking the role of viruses in such cases many viruses do not confer long-term immunity and consequently reinfections are common31 as is true for other microbial pathogens induced or acquired immunosuppression enhances a hosts susceptibility to viruses32
as shown in table 2 viruses are incriminated in no less than 69 of acute urti in the united states33
viruses are particularly significant as etiologic agents of respiratory infections in the young and the elderly table 3 is a summary of data from 2 recent studies34 35 on the relative importance of viruses as causes of respiratory infection in the elderly in the united states
acute gastroenteritis is also among the most common problems of human health throughout the world22 31 it kills an estimated 22 million children annually22 it also has a greater health effect on adults than had been realized before and data gathered during a period of 17 years 1979-1995 show that in the united states at least 450000 people 20 years of age or older are hospitalized each year for gastroenteritis36 as stated above for respiratory viruses many enteric viral infections also do not give rise to long-term immunity and reinfections are therefore frequentduring the past 30 years several viruses have been discovered as the major causes of acute gastroenteritis in humans5 in the united states however rotaviruses are the most common cause of diarrhea among children and infect virtually every child in the united states and canada by the age of 4 years other relatively recently identified pathogens include the norwalk group of viruses the enteric adenoviruses and astrovirusesenteric viruses are a common cause of gastroenteritis in adults as well studies on adults hospitalized for gastroenteritis in the united states found 14 of the cases resulted from these viruses and bacteria were incriminated in less than 9 of the cases36 the available information shows that rotaviruses hepatitis a virus hav and norwalk-like viruses are the most common enteric viral agents in the united states according to the centers for disease control cdc37 the average total of cases of viral gastroenteritis is more than 30 million whereas bacteria and parasites account for nearly 8 million cases of gastroenteritis this attests to the high significance of viruses in the etiology of acute gastroenteritis fig 1 shows the relative importance of bacteria parasites and viruses as agents of foodborne disease in the united states37
it is not possible to speculate on what proportion of such infections may be spread by hands however if improved hand hygiene results in even a small reduction in the number of cases it would still represent a substantial reduction in the burden on human healthby definition enteric viruses are shed in the feces of those infected and enter the body mainly by the mouth38 making the fecal-oral route the predominant means of their spread and hands a common vehicle in such transmission39 directly through inoculation of self or others and indirectly by exposure to articles handled by virus-contaminated hands this does not however preclude a more circuitous route where aerosolized viruses settle and are picked up as hand contaminants through contact40 or are inhaled and translocated to the throat and swallowedoften it is the asymptomatic patients that may present the most risk because failure to recognize an infection may lead to a breakdown in the barrier protection normally implemented when disease is apparent moreover workers in the health care and allied professions or those employed in food handling may report for work not recognizing that they are infectedrhinoviruses are responsible for most cases of urti41 in the united states they were incriminated in 52 121 of 231 of the laboratory-diagnosed cases of urti in 60- to 90-year-old persons living at home36 these viruses can survive on human hands for hours fig 2 and experiments with human volunteers have clearly demonstrated the potential of hands to spread rhinoviral colds42 43 and the ability of hand antiseptics in interrupting such transmission25

in addition to urti adenoviruses can cause conjunctivitis hemorrhagic cystitis pneumonia and gastroenteritis5 serotypes 40 and 41 primarily affect the gut contributing to 5 to 20 of hospitalizations of childhood diarrhea in developed countries44 outbreaks of adenoviral infections are not infrequent in settings such as hospitals and daycare centers45 adenoviruses are also a major cause of serious respiratory infections in military recruits possibly resulting from over-crowding and sharing of facilities46 the oral vaccine against adenoviruses used for such people is no longer available with the resultant reemergence of these viruses and possible fatalities resulting from them47 in canada adenoviruses cause nearly 5 of all laboratory-diagnosed cases of respiratory infections48 they can survive on human skin for many hours49 suggesting the potential for spread through hands in fact the half-life of adenovirus type 4 was found to be nearly 6 hours on ex vivo human skin and approximately 1 hour on disks of stainless steel at the physiologic skin temperature of 32c49
nosocomial outbreaks of adenoviral infections are common50 that such outbreaks in pediatric respiratory units can be devastating is clearly illustrated by the report of wesley et al51 where hands of attendants are believed to have spread the virus and the case fatality rate in the nosocomially-acquired cases was 91outbreaks of adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis are a particularly common occurrence in ophthalmology clinics and quite frequently the virus spread is iatrogenic and involves the hands of health care personnel52 interestingly jernigan et al53 showed that the hands of physician and patients remained culture-positive for the incriminated adenovirus even after washing hands with soap and water and drying them with a paper towel azar et al54 recovered infectious adenoviruses from the hands of 46 12 of 26 of the patients with epidemic keratoconjunctivitis and emphasized the potential of virus transfer to hospital personnel through casual hand contactthis group includes several members that are sometimes referred to as small round-structured viruses srsv human caliciviruses which cannot be cultured in the laboratory include the norwalk agent which has emerged as the most important cause of acute gastroenteritis and outbreaks resulting from it occur regularly in communities and institutional settings55 56 they are also the most common causes of foodborne disease in the united states57 58 59 accounting for more than 67 of all cases of known etiology 33 of hospitalization and 7 of deaths37
a presymptomatic food handler was the most likely source of a foodborne outbreak of acute gastroenteritis resulting from an srsv that affected nearly 200 people in 4 hospitals served by a central kitchen60 srsv can cause chronic gastroenteritis in children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus hiv61
recently an animal calicivirus has been found to infect humans and cause vesicles on hands62 but it is not known if the virus can be spread to other hosts through such infected handsin north america the only hepatitis virus currently relevant to this discussion is hav however if hepatitis e virus was more prevalent it may also have the capacity to spread through hands infection with hav is common worldwide63 and it is the only notifiable foodborne viral infection in canada and the united states in many developing countries hav is endemic and 90 of children may be infected by 6 years of age64 in industrialized countries improved sanitation and water supply have given rise to large pools of highly susceptible people increasing the risk of massive common-source outbreaks in young children hav is frequently asymptomatic but transmission to older age groups can result in clinically evident disease the most common risk factor for hav infection is contact with another infected person often in a daycare setting food and waterborne outbreaks contribute only 1 to 5 of the total cases reported in any year65 in all surveillance studies no source was identified for 20 to 30 of hav cases65 the vehicles of transmission in foodborne outbreaks of hav are most often prepared uncooked foods such as sandwiches or salads or foods touched by human hands after cooking58
in spite of the availability of vaccines against it cases of hav continue to occur in the united states and canada hav can survive for several hours on human hands8 and its ability to spread through hands is well recognized66 a recent study by bidawid et al67 has shown that as much as 9 of infectious hav on experimentally contaminated hands of adult volunteers could be transferred during a 10-second contact with vegetables that are consumed rawin another study of reports of foodborne disease58 that examined outbreaks rather than total numbers of cases hav was more commonly found than the norwalk group of viruses whatever the causative agent it is apparent that foodborne viral infections not only result in considerable morbidity and some mortality they also contribute significantly to the societal costs of infectious diseases in one particular foodborne outbreak of hav in the united states68 there were 43 cases and a possible exposure of 5000 patrons the high cost of the available vaccines limits their use and hav continues to be among the most frequently reported vaccine-preventable diseases in the united states69
according to the cdc the incidence of hav infections in the united states has been cyclic during the past several decades with nationwide epidemics occurring every 10 to 15 years between epidemics hav infections continue to occur at relatively high levels with a recognized underreporting of cases for example in 1993 24238 hav cases were reported to the national notifiable diseases surveillance system of the cdc these reported cases are estimated to correspond to 75000 actual cases of hepatitis a and 125000 hav infectionsrotaviral infections are the leading causes of severe gastroenteritis in infants and young children worldwide70 in the united states rotaviruses cause an estimated 39 million infections with 27 million cases of gastroenteritis among children younger than 5 years of age this results in approximately 500000 outpatient and emergency visits and 49000 hospitalizations71 the economic effect of rotavirus infections in health care is estimated at 264 million with overall costs of approximately 1 billion71
outbreaks of rotaviral infection are common in infants and young children in institutional settings such as hospitals72 daycare centers73 74 and schools75 and hands of caregivers are believed to play an important role in virus spread10 although asymptomatic infections are common subjects with clinical cases excrete relatively large amounts of infectious virus in their feces contributing to the ease of virus spread fecal excretion of infectious rotavirus can be chronic in those who are immunocompromised76 the rapid water loss resulting from rotaviral gastroenteritis can be fatal without intravenous or oral rehydration therapyadults can also be sources of infection and asymptomatic cases are a recognized problem in spreading human rotaviruses the frequency of rotavirus infection in contacts also demonstrates the highly contagious nature of these viruses a vaccine against them was recently introduced and withdrawn soon after because of serious side effects in the vaccinated children77
since 1991 the national respiratory and enteric virus surveillance system has prospectively monitored rotavirus activity in the united states78 of the 22912 specimens tested from july 1997 through june 1998 by antigen-detection and electron microscopy 5343 23 were positive for rotavirus the most recent analysis of prevalence of rotavirus diarrhea in the united states shows 39 million cases in 1998 on average annual cases of foodborne illness resulting from rotaviruses is estimated to be 39000 which is 03 of all the foodborne illnesses resulting from viruses37 seasonal increases in rotavirus detection were noted throughout the united states and the period of peak rotavirus activity varied by geographic location such seasonal variations are consistent with data collected from other temperate countries79 and may coincide with or follow climatic conditions favoring rotavirus survival80
the disease caused by astroviruses is similar to that caused by norwalk-like viruses but it is milder than rotaviral gastroenteritis chronic diarrhea and shedding of virus may occur in children who are immunocompromised81 82 astroviruses spread mainly via the fecal-oral route children younger than 1 year of age are most often affected although adults can be infected and suffer mild disease studies of hospitalized children suggest that astroviruses may account for 3 to 5 of the admissions for diarrhea83 outbreaks of astroviral gastroenteritis have been reported from institutional settings such as nursing homes hospitals schools and daycare centers84 85 fatality resulting from astrovirus infection is low 10 deaths per year and probably 1 of cases of astroviral infections are foodborne86 hands are believed to play an important role in the nosocomial spread of astroviruses84
there is increasing recognition of the importance of papillomaviruses as human pathogens apart from causing warts they are now known to be involved in certain types of cancers in humans87 88 89 90 human papillomaviruses hpv are difficult to grow in cell lines or experimental animals and this limits the knowledge of their ability to survive on human skin and also the action of hand antiseptics against them however recent studies on the detection of papillomavirus dna on the hands of patients with genital warts suggested their potential for spread by hands91 92 the analyses of fairley et al93 also suggests that hands may play a role in the spread of genital warts those who are immunocompromised are particularly prone to infections by papillomaviruses and develop numbers of warts on their hands94 such cases can also be quite refractory to treatment94
bovine papillomaviruses can be cultured to a limited degree in the laboratory and xenografts of human skin into athymic mice95 and cellular rafts96 can be infected with hpv the use of such surrogate systems shows some potential to study the survival and inactivation of papillomaviruses on human skin another approach is to use the closely related papovaviruses such as sv40 as a surrogate for hpv in testing the virucidal activity of topicals97
these viruses can also cause nosocomial outbreaks and hands of caregivers most likely play a role in their spread the cdcs investigation of an outbreak of aseptic meningitis in parents of children attending daycare centers showed that more frequent handwashing was associated with a lower rate of infection98
respiratory syncytial virus rsv is the most frequent cause of serious respiratory infections in young children99 and unlike other enveloped respiratory viruses the available epidemiologic evidence suggests that hands of caregivers play a significant role in its spread99 100 more frequent handwashing by health care personnel in conjunction with cohorting of patients has been found to reduce the nosocomial spread of rsv101 in canada rsv has been incriminated in nearly 46 of all laboratory-diagnosed cases of respiratory infections48
infections resulting from cytomegalovirus cmv are common and infected young children are often the source of the virus for those in close contact with them women of childbearing age in daycare centers and pediatric wards have a higher potential for occupational exposure102 103 this virus can damage a developing fetus infectious cmv has been isolated from the diapers of infected children and the hands of hospital personnel caring for them but not from environmental surfaces in the same settings104 isolation of cmv from the hands of daycare workers has also been reported105
the ability of cmv to survive on hands is not known but because it is relatively fragile it is not likely to survive on skin for more than 5 to 10 minutes faix106 used experimentally contaminated gloved hands and cadaveric skin to show that the virus was highly susceptible to inactivation by even ordinary soapcoronaviruses are believed to be responsible for almost 14 of all cases of acute urti in humans33 but their association with acute gastroenteritis remains uncertain these viruses are generally fragile and their ability to survive on human hands is not known also there is no evidence thus far for their spread through handsparainfluenzaviruses are second only to rsv as etiologic agents of serious respiratory infections in young children5 they most likely spread by air and there is no evidence to suggest the role of hands in their transmission limited experimental studies with adult volunteers have found human parainfluenzavirus type 3 to fare quite poorly fig 2 on the skin of hands107 among the 3 human influenzaviruses type a is the predominant cause of respiratory infections and it can also give rise to pandemics from time to time5 although influenzaviruses are also among important causes of respiratory infections in humans and often cause nosocomial outbreaks there is no convincing evidence for their spread by hands like parainfluenzaviruses they do not survive for more than 5 to 10 minutes on hands108
zoonotic poxviruses can contaminate or even infect the skin of hands but such cases are rare and limited mainly to those who are in direct contact with infected animals109 110 111 adult cases of such infections are believed to have given rise to secondary cases in children112
as mentioned above human pathogenic viruses are not a part of the normal microflora of the body they are shed for varying periods only by those infected with them however a large proportion of those infected with viruses possibly more than 90 remain asymptomatic while discharging infectious viruses into their surroundings this presents a serious problem for infection control because viruses discharged by asymptomatic shedders could cause serious disease in others this is particularly true in hospitals and nursing homes where there is a pool of highly susceptible people who are debilitated as a result of disease immunosuppression or other causes the large numbers of silent cases of viral infection also pose serious difficulties for halting virus spread in other settings where a single infected person may come into direct or indirect contact with a large number of uninfected but susceptible hosts in this context daycare is recognized as a setting where viruses are readily transmitted but indirect virus transmission from food handlers through contaminated food is becoming increasingly important58
the shedding of viruses from infected hosts generally begins before the onset of clinical symptoms and often lasts for several days occasionally weeks after recovery the actual amount of virus discharged varies considerably depending on the type of infecting agent and the stage of the infection for example at the peak of rotaviral gastroenteritis every gram of feces may have more than 1011 virions and 107 to 108 infectious virus particles113
viruses are always discharged in a body fluid from an infected host and they cannot replicate unless they infect another susceptible host the longer a virus can survive outside the body of a host the higher is its potential for spread by vehicles such as hands hands can become contaminated readilydirectly by contact with any virus-containing body fluids from self or others or indirectly by touching or handling virus-contaminated surfaces or objects the degree of contamination and the area over which it is spread are also key considerations here fingers especially the pads and tips are the most likely to come into contact during touching of infected people and their body substances as well as other contaminated materials in addition these same parts of the hands are the most likely to be inadvertently or deliberately brought into contact with portals of entry for susceptible hosts self-inoculation from virus-contaminated hands is likely to be frequentthe main modes and vehicles for the spread of human pathogenic viruses and approaches to interrupting their transmission have been summarized previously114
for hands to spread viral infections it is necessary that viruses survive long enough to permit transfer to and inoculation of a susceptible host and this appears to be the case with many viruses114 although virus survival on many types of inanimate surfaces and objects is frequently much longer than on skin114 viruses that are particularly sensitive to drying may survive better on the skin than when dried onto surfaces depending on the ambient relative humidity for example human herpes virus type 2 which had a half-life of nearly 2 hours in an ex vivo human skin model survived less than 30 minutes on stainless steel disks115
fig 2 is a composite of data from several studies on the survival of selected enteric and respiratory viruses on the hands of adults for comparison it also shows the figures for staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli all the nonenveloped viruses survived as well as if not better than s aureus  which is a common member of the normal microflora of the human skin in contrast the behavior of human parainfluenzavirus type 3 enveloped was similar to that of e colihuman hands could act as vehicles for many types of viruses and by corollary regular and proper decontamination of hands could reduce the risk of spread of such infectious agents however the link between hands and the spread of viral infections is defined mainly by circumstantial evidence and limited experimental studies with human subjects114 this lack of direct evidence is not surprising in view of the general difficulties in working with viruses the seasonal nature of most viral infections as well as our inability to distinguish between simultaneous spread of a particular infectious agent by hands and other vehicles in a given setting experimental studies have also clearly demonstrated the ease with which virus transfer can occur to and from hands during casual contact116 infectious virus particles have also been recovered from naturally contaminated hands of caregivers from fomites and from environmental surfaces that are frequently touched or handled114 only recently have standardized methods become available to test the ability of viruses to survive on human hands to be transferred to and from hands during casual contact and the potential of topical agents to rid hands of viruses114
hands are among the most obvious surfaces to become contaminated this is true whether the contamination is of self or a caregiver the nature and extent of such contamination will depend on the site of infection the degree and nature of the discharge from the host the personal habits of the infected individual and the hygienic facilities available the degree of contamination can vary widely for example some enteric viral infections can produce a profuse and almost explosive diarrhea that may be difficult to contain addressing such an infection in wards or facilities for bed-ridden or mentally handicapped patients can be quite difficultregular interactions between hands and their surroundings suggests that transfer of contaminating virus can occur readily between the contact points such transfer of infectious virus to and from hands upon casual contact with objects or other animate or inanimate surfaces can be demonstrated to occur readily in experimental settings114 117 118
recent studies have used surrogates to study acquisition and spread of pathogens by hands the dna of a cauliflower virus was used to show that hands played an important role in the dissemination of the marker in daycare settings118 as well as in neonatal intensive care units119 the use of a bacterial virus phix174 showed that clean hands could readily become contaminated when objects or surfaces with infectious virus on them are touched or handled117 the reverse has also been shown to be truetransfer of a rhinovirus was observed in 15 of 16 trials in which a plastic surface contaminated 1 to 3 hours previously was touched by a volunteer42 people with acute rhinovirus colds were shown to deposit infectious rhinovirus particles on objects they touched120 infectious rhinovirus particles could be recovered from fingertips of volunteers who handled objects such as doorknobs previously touched by virus-contaminated donor hands and rhinovirus transfer also has been shown to occur by direct hand-to-hand contact43
studies with human subjects have also established that self-inoculation with rhinovirus- and rotavirus-contaminated fingers can lead to infection121 122 frequency of contact will also promote virus acquisition and transfer for example a caregiver with frequent contacts among daycare participants may inadvertently transfer viruses from one child to another simply by hand contact although significant numbers of viral particles can be transferred when contamination levels are high the percentage of virus transferred during experimental contacts has been shown to be fairly low this suggests that the further along the chain of contacts the susceptible host is from the point of primary contact with the virus the lower the risk that an infection will result and vice versathere has been much progress in recent years in the development and evaluation of standardized protocols to assess the virus-eliminating activity of handwash and handrub agents and details in this regard have been presented before6 10 123 124 table 4 presents a summary of this information125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135
factors that are considered crucial in the design and performance of tests on the virus-eliminating potential of hygienic hand antiseptics are enumerated in table 5
as yet there are no recognized surrogates for testing topicals against viruses and this encourages the practice of testing a given formulation against as many viruses as possible and listing them all on the product label this is particularly true in the united states such an approach 1 makes product development unnecessarily expensive and time-consuming 2 encourages the use of the pathogenic viruses themselves eg hiv or hantaviruses that are unsafe to handle and may cause undue risk of laboratory-acquired infections 3 results in the listing of easy-to-kill enveloped viruses such as hiv on product labels thus gaining an unjust market advantage 4 encourages label claims against viruses eg influenzaviruses that may not be amenable to control through the use of chemical germicides and 5 makes product comparisons difficult because of the use of nonstandardized viral strains and variations in test protocolssuch testing should be conducted with proper surrogates provided the test conditions are rigorous enough as shown in table 6 many types of viruses possess characteristics desired in a surrogate and 1 or 2 of them can be selected to test hand antiseptics
some studies have used viruses naturally found in clinical samples43 122 but this approach is unsuitable in standard test protocols because of wide variations in the levels of infectious virus and the soil loading in them the use of phages137 138 139 alone in such testing would not be sufficient for product registration but it could be an inexpensive and rapid way of screening a large number of potential formulationsin many in vitro carrier tests for germicides a product must reduce the infectivity titer of the test virus by at least 4 log10 to be considered effective10 this is too high a requirement for most hygienic hand antiseptics to meet in in vivo tests with the whole-hand or the fingerpad protocols alcohol-based products often achieve virus reduction levels between 2 and 3 log108 128 in contrast water or soap and water as well as many other products may achieve only as much as 1 log10 reduction in virus infectivity8 128 perhaps a level of virus reduction of no less than 1 log10 above that achieved for mechanical removal by water with a standard level of hardness may be considered as appropriate for allowing an effectiveness claim for handwash or other topical products against viruses the ultimate objective here is the reduction of the risk of disease spread through hands without discouraging compliance with handwashingprecleaning and rinsing after treatment are integral parts of the disinfection process for semicritical medical devices but precleaning and rinsing may or may not occur in the chemical disinfection of environmental surfaces in the case of hygienic handwashing one normally wets hands with tap water applies the antiseptic agent rinses them again in water to wash off the hand antiseptic agent and then dries them with one of several possible means water rinsing after treatment and the drying of washed hands can additionally reduce viruses on washed hands128 the fingertip123 140 and whole-hand128 methods described earlier determine virus reduction only as a combined action of all the steps in hand antisepsis is this appropriate does this determine the virus-eliminating potential of a product or does it assess the efficiency of the handwashing or drying process as a whole how does this approach then compare the potency of water-aided and waterless formulationsglobally viruses cause millions of cases of morbidity and mortality in humans every year and thus far the development of chemotherapy against them has met with limited success also many viral infections of the enteric and respiratory tracts remain refractory to prevention by vaccination therefore controlling their spread through regular and proper hand antisepsis remains crucial however the use of formulations without proven activity against viruses may only create a false sense of security with respect to viral illness47 there is an urgent need to develop and introduce a suitable regulatory framework to allow reasonable label claims against viruses this is also necessary to promote innovation to broaden the germicidal spectrum of hand antiseptics while keeping them safe to the user and friendly to the environmenttransfer of infectious viruses to and from hands can readily occur on contact with other animate and inanimate surfaces8 114 117 141 suggesting that touching soiled surfaces with decontaminated hands can recontamination them proper disinfection of environmental surfaces122 and washing hands114 with certain types of agents can interrupt virus transfer to clean surfaces it is important that decontamination of hands and environmental surfaces reinforce each other particularly in hospitals and food handlingthe safety and testing requirements for topicals should fall somewhere in between antiviral drugs and other types of germicides even though germicides have been discussed at many forums in the past 2 decades the issue of topicals and viruses remains essentially unexplored the fdas tentative final monograph on topical antimicrobials4 does not mention viruses at all whereas the fdas center for food safety and nutrition58 regards enteric viruses as important targets regulators manufacturers and users alike are seeking information and directions respectively for the registration marketing and purchase of hygienic hand antiseptics142 therefore this issue needs to be addressed through research and development and discussed between the stakeholders to bring safe and effective products to the market it is hoped this article will serve as a springboard for discussions in this regardas shown here the numbers of cases of respiratory and enteric viral infections are high even for only the reported ones it must be recognized that simply encouraging testing of hand antiseptics against viruses and establishing label claims against them would not prevent all such infections the real questions relate to how much disease could be prevented and how much would need to be prevented before the measure became cost effective for society as a whole this is a complex issue and many factors need consideration including the possibility that the young and immunocompromised with their higher susceptibility to infections34 may require more frequent use of germicidal products and consequently greater exposure to potentially harmful chemicals in them the challenge for makers of topicals would be to develop safe but effective alternative virucides and regulators would be challenged to ensure the proper evaluation of any label claims for virus inactivation or elimination materials managers in hospitals may also need to be made aware of potential savings in the overall budget even when spending more on the purchasing of better products for hand hygiene143 144
there continues to be much discussion on the significance of the hands of caregivers and food handlers as vehicles for a variety of infections there are also renewed efforts to increase awareness of this issue in professionals and the general public alike143 144 in spite of its high relevance in infection control the topic of hand antisepsis lacks the scientific profile necessary to attract funding for quality research regulatory agencies continue to demand evidence from clinical outcome studies when such investigations may or may not provide clear-cut data even with the investment of much time and resourcesthe members of the filovirus family ebola virus ebov and marburg virus marv cause a severe hemorrhagic fever in infected humans with high fatality rates 1 infected individuals who go on to succumb to filovirus infection exhibit dysregulated immune responses reviewed in two other articles in this issue this appears to result from several factors including viral mediated impairment of early innate immune responses and consequent dysregulation of innate immunity 2 some reports have suggested that adaptive immune responses may occur 36 but it is evident that these fail to clear the disease lymphopenia resulting from apoptosis as the infection progresses has also been suggested to contribute to the failure to clear the infection 7 studies of both human survivors and murine model systems suggest that a well-regulated cytokine response early in the course of the infection may be critical to the outcome of the disease 89ebolaviruses are currently subdivided into four distinct species zaire ebolavirus zebov sudan ebolavirus tai forest ebolavirus and reston ebolavirus rebov while there is only a single marv species lake victoria marburgvirus ictv virus taxonomy 2009 since the bundibugyo isolate is genetically distinct from the known ebola viruses a suggestion has been made to classify it as a new ebov species bundibugyo ebolavirus 10 the different ebov species not only show significant molecular differences they also vary in terms of virulence and pathogenicity the most pathogenic species in humans is zebov with a case fatality rate of about 80 followed by sudan with a case fatality rate of about 50 11 and bundibugyo with a fatality rate of about 30 12 to date there are two reported non-fatal human cases of tai forest ebolavirus 1314 and several asymptomatic human cases of rebov infection 1517the first reported marv outbreak occurred in germany and yugoslavia in 1967 and was caused by infected african green monkeys imported from uganda 1819 since this outbreak was associated with a case fatality rate of 22 it was believed for a long time that marv was less pathogenic than ebov however recent outbreaks of marv in the democratic republic of the congo in 19982000 and in angola in 2004 were associated with fatality rates up to 90 indicating that marv can be as virulent as ebov 2022despite the severity of the disease filoviruses have been regarded as exotic pathogens with fatal outbreaks restricted to central africa and with no major health threat outside of the endemic areas knowledge on their biology and pathogenicity consequently remained limited however there has been renewed interest given the potential for using filoviruses in bioterrorism attacks and the possibility for infected asymptomatic persons for bringing the disease to other countries indeed two cases of marv have been reported in the netherlands and in the united states both tourists returning from trips to uganda 2324 together the potential for spread outside central africa has reignited research endeavors to elucidate the biology of the filoviruses and to develop effective therapeutic strategiesin this review we will describe how filoviruses enter their target cells replicate their genomes and assemble progeny viruses by exploiting cellular machineries we will also briefly touch upon the interaction of filoviruses with cellular signaling pathways finally we will discuss the current understanding of the fate of infected and non-infected cells in filovirus infection in addition we will present ultrastructural data of infected and non-infected cells demonstrating the morphological changes in filovirus infectionthe structure of filovirus particles has been described in detail in 1 and multiple review articles briefly the single stranded non-segmented rna genome of filoviruses is of negative polarity and contains seven monocistronic genes it is associated with four viral proteins the nucleoprotein np which enwraps the viral rna the rna-dependent rna polymerase l the polymerase cofactor vp35 and the transcription factor vp30 the four nucleocapsid proteins are required for replication and transcription of the viral genome reviewed in 25 filovirus genomes encode two matrix proteins vp40 the functional equivalent of the matrix proteins m of other non-segmented negative-stand rna viruses and the minor matrix protein vp24 which is unique to filoviruses as a peripheral membrane protein vp40 is located at the inner side of the virions membrane it mediates budding and viral particle release 26 the minor matrix protein vp24 is involved in nucleocapsid formation and assembly 2729 and contributes to the regulation of viral transcriptionreplication 3031 ebov vp24 and marv vp40 are considered important virulence factors and play a crucial role in host adaptation both proteins block ifn signaling however they target different cellular proteins and use different mechanisms to antagonize the ifn response 3235 the role of ebov vp24 and marv vp40 in the innate immune response to filovirus infection will be discussed in more detail in another article in this issue filoviruses possess a single surface protein the type i transmembrane glycoprotein gp that mediates attachment to target cells entry and fusion 36 the precursor pregp is cleaved in the trans golgi network by furin or a furin-like protease resulting in two disulfide-linked subunits gp1and gp2 37 notably ebov gp has been implicated in cell damage which will be discussed in more detail in section 422ebov genomes encode an additional protein the nonstructural soluble form of the glycoprotein sgp as gp sgp is encoded by the fourth gene but is translated from non-edited mrna species while the membrane-bound gp is the result of mrna editing during transcription 3839 sgp is not incorporated into viral particles but is secreted from infected cells although the function of the protein is not fully understood there is evidence that it acts as an anti-inflammatory factor by protecting the endothelial cell barrier function during infection 40 besides sgp a second soluble gp variant generated by mrna editing the small soluble protein ssgp has been identified 4142 a nonstructural marv protein comparable to ebov sgp is not expressedfiloviruses have a broad cell tropism in susceptible host species among the target cells supporting viral replication are monocytes macrophages dendritic cells dcs hepatocytes adrenal cortical cells fibroblasts and endothelial cells 4357the earliest events during infection are likely to center around cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system including monocytes macrophages and dcs these cells not only orchestrate innate and adaptive immune responses 5859 but also serve as early targets of viral infection 47495556 6066 it is thought that the early infection of these cells is responsible for the rapid and widespread dissemination of the virus throughout an infected host 67replication of marv in peritoneal macrophages of guinea pigs can be detected within 24 h after intraperitoneal infection 50 in african green monkeys infected kupffer cells were identified in the liver early in infection on days 2 or 3 following infection with zebov or marv the liver and adrenals are target organs of these viruses whose parenchyma cells support filovirus replication infected hepatocytes and adrenal cortical cells can be detected a day or two after finding infected macrophages secondary target cells also include fibroblasts and endothelial cells which were observed 5 to 7 days after filovirus infection of non-human primates 474950 filovirus-infected macrophages fibroblasts and endothelial cells were found in all organs examined in these animal models 465255 the presence of these cell types in virtually all organs may account for the observed filovirus pantropism indeed marv or zebov can be isolated from any organ or tissue besides the typical target cells for zebov and marv infection in non-human primates additional target cells were occasionally found in individual animals these cells included alveolar epithelial cells bronchial epithelial cells and the cells of endocardial layer 50 in cynomolgus macaques rebov was shown to have similar target tropism and also to rarely infect alveolar and kidney epithelium as well as adrenal medulla cells 64filoviruses are present in the blood of infected animals and are therefore potentially spread to all parts of the body by blood flow both as free virions as well as within infected monocytes it is likely that the lymphatics also contribute to the rapid spread of the virus as free viruses and virus-infected dcs the structure of sinusoids and sinuses in the liver and spleen allows for the direct migration of filoviruses from the blood stream facilitating the infection of hepatocytes and splenic macrophages migration of infected monocytes from blood vessels may deliver the virus into connective tissue where it infects fibroblasts which then spread progeny viruses by their protrusions to sites far from the main body of the infected cell 46495068 it is therefore likely that filoviruses are disseminated in the infected host by multiple different mechanisms including transport of free virus particles by blood and lymphatic fluids migration of infected monocytes macrophages and dcs into various tissues and viral cell-to-cell spread via cell protrusionsone of the most intriguing features of fatal filovirus infection in animals and humans is that little or no inflammatory cellular response occurs at the sites of viral replication accumulation of neutrophils monocytes and lymphocytes around infected cells has been rarely observed in infected tissues the minimal inflammatory cellular response is considered to be a distinctive feature of filovirus infection 45495560636971 and may represent a part of the dysregulated immune response observed in fatal cases of ebov and marv infection in non-fatal ebov infections of guinea pigs in contrast a prominent inflammatory response is observed and infected cells are tightly surrounded by leukocytes forming a substantial barrier which could impair viral dissemination 4862the first step that determines if a cell will be a target for infection is the ability of the virus to attach filoviruses are able to infect multiple cell types in vivo and in cell culture by exploiting cellular entry machineries however some cells are more susceptible to infection than others and some are not permissive to infectionthe filovirus replication cycle is depicted in figure 1 filoviruses enter the target cells by different uptake mechanisms including lipid raft-dependent and receptor-mediated endocytosis 7275 and macropinocytosis 7677 receptor binding and attachment to the target cells is mediated by the glycoprotein subunit gp1 a number of cellular proteins have been implicated in filovirus entry and it is not clear whether there is a primary receptor for these viruses the different co-receptors likely provide access for the virus into different target cells the folate receptor has been suggested to be a significant filovirus receptor 78 however cells lacking folate receptor- are still permissive for infection 7980 an interesting group of glycan binding proteins that enhance filovirus uptake in a cell-specific manner belong to the c-type lectin family the highly glycosylated gp of both marv and ebov is decorated with a set of n- and o-linked glycans 8183 which depending on their specific structures can be recognized by different c-type lectins this includes asialoglycoprotein receptor on hepatocytes dc-sign and hmgl on macrophages and immature dcs and l-sign and lsectin on endothelial cells in liver and lymph nodes 8491 another group of proteins involved in filovirus entry are the 1-integrins 9293 integrins are expressed on a wide range of cell types and are involved in the uptake of a variety of different viruses interestingly detailed study of one of these integrins the 51-integrin has demonstrated that it is not involved in ebov internalization but rather in the regulation of endosomal cathepsin required for ebov fusion 93 more recently t-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 tim-1 has been suggested as a receptor for ebov and marv gp 94 tim-1 is not expressed by the primary targets of filoviruses macrophages and dcs but is expressed on mucosal epithelial cells whose role in infection is not clear yet another interesting group of proteins involved in ebov uptake are the members of the tyro3axlmer tam receptor family ligand-activated tam receptors are negative regulators of inflammation in macrophages and dcs by upregulating the expression of socs1 and socs3 proteins in a phospho-stat1-dependent manner 95 the tam receptor axl serves as a co-receptor for ebov entry by binding the viral surface protein gp 96 to bind gp the tam receptor ligand binding domain has to be intact 97 however it is not known if gp binding leads to the activation of axl recently axl has been shown to be involved in receptor-independent uptake of ebov by macropinocytosis 75after uptake the virus particles are internalized into the endosomes where fusion takes place fusion of the viral and cellular membrane is mediated by the fusogenic cleavage product gp2 98 to initiate fusion the proteolytic cleavage of gp1 by the endosomal proteases cathepsin b and cathepsin l is mandatory 99101 interestingly the cathepsin dependence of virus entry seems to be cell-type specific while virus entry into vero cells is dependent on the activity of both cathepsin b and cathepsin l infection of human dcs by ebov does not require active cathepsin l 102fusion of the viral and cellular membrane leads to the release of the viral nucleocapsids into the cytoplasm of the infected cell where transcription and replication of the viral genome take place figure 1 the nucleocapsid rather than the naked rna serves as the template for both transcription and replication during transcription the seven viral genes are sequentially transcribed into monocistronic mrnas which are capped and polyadenylated and are used for the production of viral proteins during replication the encapsidated rna is copied into full-length positive-sense replicative intermediates the rna antigenomes which are enwrapped by the nucleocapsid proteins in turn the antigenomes are used as templates for the synthesis of progeny genomes the nucleocapsid proteins do not only encapsidate the rna genomes they are also essential for replication and transcription the viral polymerase consisting of l and vp35 catalyzes replication as well as transcription including polyadenylation and capping reviewed in 25the driving force for nucleocapsid formation is np 103104 it has been proposed for ebov that np forms helical structures which interact with vp35 and vp24 resulting in the formation of nucleocapsid-like structures 105106it is believed that the amplification of the viral genome and the assembly of newly synthesized nucleocapsids occur in highly organized regions in the cytoplasm the viral inclusions 103106107 figure 2a the appearance of granular material of average electron density in the cytoplasm of the infected cells at 12 h marv and 9 h zebov post infection pi respectively is the first morphological sign of viral replication as revealed by electron microscopic studies following the course of marv and zebov infection in vero and mdck cells 50 the granular material is closely associated with the surface of the er and contains viral proteins and rna figure 2c tubular structures with an average diameter of 50 nm then appear in the granular material representing the newly synthesized viral nucleocapsids 50105 figures 2bc the viral inclusions can be easily detected as large irregularly formed cytoplasmic aggregates by immunofluorescence microscopy 108109 to date it is not known if cellular components are required for inclusion formationthe morphological characteristics of filovirus replication in animal cells in vivo are identical to those observed in cell culture we analyzed the morphology of inclusion bodies in ebov and marv-infected cells of various organs of non-human primates guinea pigs mice and chick embryos as well as vero bhk-13 and mdck cells and observed that filovirus inclusions though morphologically heterogeneous are always composed of granular material and varying numbers of nucleocapsids 50 a few examples of filovirus infected cells in animal tissues are presented in figure 3following assembly newly synthesized nucleocapsids are transported to the sites of virus budding immunoelectron microscopy of ebov-infected cells revealed that np and the matrix protein vp40 accumulate in the viral inclusions and are closely associated during viral morphogenesis 110 meanwhile it has been confirmed by multiple studies that the filoviral vp40 protein is the major player in viral budding though various viral proteins significantly enhance the release of viral particles reviewed in 111113 importantly filoviruses exploit the vesicular transport machineries of the infected cell for viral egress and viral proteins of both marv and ebov have been reported to interact with various protein components of the copii vesicular transport system and the escrt machinery reviewed in 111114115 viral budding occurs either at intracellular membranes the multivesicular bodies mvb 116 or at the plasma membrane 50105117 in cell culture marv particles are preferentially released at filopodia which may facilitate the infection of neighboring cells 117electron microscopic studies of filovirus-infected cells suggested two models for the release of the long filamentous viral particles horizontal budding after lateral association of the nucleocapsids with the plasma membrane or vertical budding 50105117 figures 2df a recent electron tomography study of marv-infected cells convincingly reconciled the results into a single model welsch and colleagues 118 showed that the budding process is initiated by the lateral association of the intracellular nucleocapsids with the plasma membrane starting from one end the nucleocapsids are then subsequently wrapped by the plasma membrane until the viral particles protrude vertically from the cell surface the formation of such long filamentous particles 700900 nm or more is certainly challenging for the infected cells and may lead to membrane perturbation in the cells and in the released viruses notably the release of infectious filamentous marv from cultured cells has been reported to peak at early time points post infection 12 days pi when the cells were still intact at late time points 4 d pi most of the infected cells were vesiculated the released virions were morphologically different being round or bent and coincidentally infectivity was decreased 118viruses exploit the host cell for successful replication potentially leading to death of the infected cell since the production of progeny viruses is hampered when the infected cells are destroyed early in infection many viruses have evolved mechanisms to avoid host cell death as reflected by a complex interaction between viruses and cell death signaling pathways reviewed in 119120 different types of cell death including apoptosis necrosis and autophagy can be described by different morphological and biochemical characteristics reviewed in 121122 apoptosis or programmed cell death is characterized by shrinking of the dying cell plasma membrane blebbing nuclear condensation and final fragmentation of the cell in apoptotic bodies 123124 tissue lymphocytes from filovirus-infected non-human primates showing typical signs of apoptosis such as condensation and marginal localization of chromatin are shown in figures 4be biochemically apoptosis is characterized by activation of caspases caspase cleavage can be activated by extrinsic pathways via death receptor signaling induced by trail fascd95 fas or tnf or by intrinsic pathways via regulation of cytochrome c efflux from the mitochondria reviewed in 125127 lymphocyte apoptosis plays an important role in t cell development and control of t cell tolerance 128 and might also play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of filovirus infection as discussed in section 43 in contrast to apoptosis necrosis is generally described as uncontrolled cell death but recent findings suggest that it also might be regulated by conserved biochemical mechanisms reviewed in 129130 necrosis is characterized by swelling of the cell and cellular organelles membrane blebbing vacuolization and results in rupture of the plasma membrane 121124 autophagy is a conserved pathway of eukaryotic cells for recycling cellular components however extensive cellular stress can lead to autophagic or type ii cell death autophagic cells feature vacuolization and formation of double membraned vesicles the autophagosomes for degradation of cellular content 131132 characteristic features of non-apoptotic cell death such as vacuolization swelling and the lack of chromatin condensation can be seen in figures 3efthe striking lack of infected apoptotic cells reported in most studies raises the question if filoviruses manipulate signaling pathways involved in apoptosis or cell survival a first hint pointing in this direction has been given by a recent study showing that ebov entry leads to the activation of the pi3kakt signaling pathway very early in infection resulting in the activation of rac1 a regulator of endocytosis and vesicular trafficking 141 pi3k is embedded in a complex network of signaling cascades regulating cell metabolism proliferation and survival and many viruses modulate the pi3kakt pro-survival pathway to prevent premature apoptosis of infected cells 142 the temporal modulation of pi3k activation during viral infection is critical and different arms of the pi3k signaling network might be activated by distinct viral triggers during the replication cycle thus it has been shown for influenza virus that transient pi3k activation during entry leads to the activation of rac1 while late in infection pi3k activation prevents the induction of premature apoptosis 143 it is currently not known if pi3kakt pro-survival signaling cascades are activated at late stages in filovirus infection but this would be an attractive model to at least partially explain why apoptosis does not seem to be the preferred mechanism of cell death in filovirus infectionfiloviruses are known to interfere with antiviral signaling pathways since the innate immune response to filovirus infection and the corresponding viral countermeasures are the main subject of another review article in this issue we will focus on the mechanisms involved in the regulation of apoptosis to combat viral invasion cells have evolved multiple antiviral defense mechanisms that are activated upon infection and ideally will lead to the elimination of the viral intruders the antiviral response is initiated by a cellular detection process mediated by various cellular pattern recognition receptors ppr that specifically recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps typical pamps of negative-sense rna viruses are surface proteins and rna 144145 a prominent filovirus pamp are the 5triphosphate ends of the genomic rna which can be sensed by rig-i leading to the induction of the type i interferon ifn response 146 however in cells infected with ebov the induction of the type i ifn response via rig-i activation is blocked by the polymerase cofactor vp35 reviewed in 147148 recent findings show that rig-i activation may lead to the induction of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis which is triggered by binding of the ifn regulatory factor 3 irf-3 to the pro-apoptotic bax protein the irf-3-mediated induction of apoptosis has been considered an important antiviral defense mechanism against rna viruses 149151 in addition it has been reported that the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein mavs also known as ips-1 visa or cardif an adaptor protein in the rig-i signaling pathway is able to activate apoptosis signaling and this activation can be inhibited by viruses to prevent the induction of apoptosis 152153 although one can speculate that the inhibition of rig-i signaling by vp35 may prevent the induction of apoptosis in infected cells no data are available to support this hypothesis noteworthy the activation of pprs by viral infection or double-stranded ds rna may likewise induce anti-apoptotic signaling through nfb resulting in increased host cell survival 154156 reviewed in 157the antiviral protein dsrna-dependent protein kinase r pkr senses dsrna and is a main regulator of ifn signaling and apoptosis since dsrna is formed during replication and transcription of multiple rna and dna viruses 158 it is considered to be a major pamp in viral infection upon activation by dsrna pkr phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eif2 leading to translational arrest and apoptosis 159 intriguingly pkr is not activated in zebov-infected cells and vp35 has been shown to actively block pkr activation 160161 it has been reported for various viruses that they inhibit pkr-mediated eif2 phosphorylation to prevent host cell apoptosis 162164 however it is not known if the inhibition of pkr in ebov-infected cells blocks the induction of apoptosistoll-like receptors tlrs are another important group of prrs recognizing viral pamps 145 trl signaling was found to play pro- and anti-apoptotic roles in different cell types highlighting its role in regulation of host cell death 165166 the ebov surface protein gp is recognized by tlr4 and activates tlr4 signaling including activation of nfb 167 it remains unclear however if tlr4 signaling is triggered in the context of ebov infection since in a recent study ebov vp35 was found to interfere with the maturation of dcs induced by lipopolysaccharide an agonist of tlr4 168 vp35 was also shown to inhibit the induction of ifn in murine dcs after treatment with cpg dna an agonist for tlr9 169 however a recent study by leung et al 170 suggests that cells utilizing tlr-mediated antiviral pathways such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells are less prone to the inhibitory effects of vp35 ebov than cells relying on rig-like signaling pathways in conclusion the role of tlr signaling in filovirus infection is not well understood and additional studies using filovirus infection models are neededmultiple expression studies have implicated the ebov surface protein gp in cytotoxicity and cell damage inducing cell rounding detachment and membrane permeabilization 92171177 while other ebov proteins did not induce cell detachment 171 expression of gp also leads to a general downregulation of cell surface proteins including adhesion molecules mhc class i proteins and egf receptor 92174176178 moreover gp expression in explanted blood vessels resulted in endothelial cell loss and increased vascular permeability 171as mentioned above gp is proteolytically cleaved in two subunits gp1 and gp2 intriguingly both gp subunits contribute to the observed cytopathogenicity the cytopathic domain within gp1 has been mapped to the so-called mucin-like domain a highly o- and n-glycosylated serine-threonine-rich region of about 150 amino acids in length which is sufficient to cause detachment and downregulation of cellular surface proteins 171178179 interestingly the mucin-like domain does not only induce cytopathic effects in cells expressing ebov gp but was also shown to induce activation of nfb and erk signaling pathways in cells treated with ebov-like particles 180it has been suggested that the gp-induced cytotoxic effects are caused by the interaction of gp with the gtpase dynamin leading to interference with the intracellular trafficking of cell surface proteins 176 however a recent study has questioned the involvement of dynamin in gp-induced cpe 178 gp has also been shown to modulate the erkmapk signaling cascade by reducing erk2 activation this effect is dependent on the mucin-like domain since downregulation of active erk2 leads to a decreased alphav-integrin expression which is associated with cell rounding and detachment it has been suggested that erk2 signaling cascades are involved in the induction of gp-mediated cytopathic effects 179 another possible mechanism of gp-induced cytotoxicity might be the induction of er stress associated with the unfolded protein response a recent study reports that ectopically expressed gp containing the mucin-like domain accumulates in the er whereas gp lacking the mucin-like domain is distributed throughout the cell and does not localize in the er when the membrane-anchored gp2 subunit is expressed in cells in the absence of gp1 it also induces cytopathic effects by enhancing the permeability of the plasma membrane this effect is mediated by the transmembrane domain 177181 if and how the different proposed mechanisms to explain gp-mediated cytopathogenicity are connected is currently not knownthere is some debate over the ability of gp to induce cell death several groups reported that expression of gp though inducing detachment of the cells does not lead to cell disruption 172174 while others observed cell death 171175179 it is possible that the observed differences are due to experimental differences including gp expression rates the expression system used long-term versus short-term expression and the cell type intriguingly gp has been shown to induce a specific form of apoptosis anoikis in primary human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells while thp-1 cells a human monocytemacrophage-derived cell line did not undergo cell death upon gp expression 175 another group has shown that gp-induced cell death is non-apoptotic 179since the described data are based on ectopic expression of gp in the absence of other viral proteins the question arises what happens in the infected cells volchkov et al 173 addressed this question by using a recombinant ebov system the membrane-anchored full-length gp is synthesized from an edited version of the gp mrna which accounts for about 20 of the total gp mrna when the editing site was mutated in the viral genome all gp mrna molecules were translated into the full-length version of gp leading to the production of enhanced levels of membrane-anchored gp the mutant was significantly more cytopathogenic than wild-type virus indicating that the expression rate of gp in infected cells determines its cytotoxic properties these results were confirmed by more recent studies showing that low expression rates of gp helped to avoid cytotoxic effects 133 in addition there might be other regulatory mechanisms in infected cells to mitigate gp-induced cytotoxicity as mentioned above vp35 is able to block various signaling pathways involved in the antiviral response to viral infection and it is conceivable that vp35 also interferes with cellular signaling pathways involved in gp-induced cellular stressit remains puzzling that marv gp does not seem to be cytotoxic when expressed in the absence of other viral proteins although it is as highly glycosylated as ebov gp 172 also infection studies in non-human primates revealed that the endothelium remains relatively intact even late in infection suggesting that the hemorrhagic symptoms in ebov infection are not caused by ebov-induced cytolysis of infected endothelial cells but are rather the result of dysregulated immune mechanisms targeting the vascular system 54182183 endothelial cells are secondary target cells in filovirus infection and the morphological characteristics of filovirus replication in these cells do not differ from those in other tissues or in cell culture 47505154110lymphocytes do not support filoviral replication perhaps because they lack receptors for these viruses 184185 nevertheless lymphocyte apoptosis is a characteristic feature of filovirus infections and can be observed in both blood and tissues of infected patients and animals 755138186188 figure 4 shows apoptotic lymphocytes in lymph node tissue from filovirus-infected animals the apoptotic lymphocytes are not infected and are engulfed by surrounding macrophages filovirus-induced lymphocyte apoptosis is also observed in ebov-infected human pbmcs 137 the apoptosis of non-infected lymphocytes is not unique to filoviruses it has been reported in a number of viral infections including lymphocyte choriomeningitis virus 189 human immunodeficiency virus 190 human herpesvirus 6 191 and vaccinia virus infections 192 although protection from apoptosis of infected cells is a strategy for survival for a number of viruses 193 induced periods of transient or chronic lymphocytopenia brought about by bystander apoptosis is thought to contribute to the generalized immunosuppression that accompanies some viral infections 192194as mentioned above apoptosis can be initiated by both extrinsic factors and intrinsic mechanisms both of which activate caspases and lead to dna fragmentation and cell death reviewed in 195 the best known example of bystander lymphocyte apoptosis in viral infections is in cd4 t cells during hiv infection nevertheless despite years of study the mechanisms of depletion of these cells remain controversial however extrinsic and intrinsic pathways appear to be involved although cd4 t cells are a target of hiv the majority of lymphocytes that are depleted are uninfected and the depletion of uninfected cells accelerates with disease progression 190196 both viral proteins released from infected cells 197199 and host-derived proteins 200201 have been suggested to contribute to cd4 t cell death more recently an accumulation of incomplete viral transcripts during abortive infection of resting cd4 t cells has been demonstrated to activate intrinsic pathways that lead to apoptosis during hiv infection 202 it is unclear which of these mechanisms account for the majority of t cell apoptosis during hiv infection or if multiple mechanisms are important in hiv pathogenesis given that many gaps remain in our understanding of bystander t cell apoptosis in hiv infection despite years of study it is not surprising that we would have even less of a universal view of how filoviruses cause bystander cell lossin the case of filovirus infection not only are cd4 t cells depleted but cd8 t cells and nk cells as well 755186 suggesting that some generalized mechanisms may contribute to lymphocyte apoptosis in filovirus disease using a mouse model of ebov infection bradfute et al 3 suggested that both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways may contribute to lymphocyte depletion if this is also the case for the disease in humans and non-human primates then it is likely that multiple mechanisms contribute to the generalized lymphocyte depletion the loss of lymphocytes has been postulated to contribute to the failure to generate fully protective adaptive immune responses in these species 7203205 in fact extensive lymphocyte apoptosis has been shown to proceed the generation of adaptive responses in humans with fatal disease 7 making this hypothesis all the more plausibleebov-infected cells may secrete trail and increased levels of soluble fas have been detected in the sera of some ebov-infected non-human primates 55206 moreover increased expression levels of trail and fas mrna have been observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of infected non-human primates 55 these could trigger conventional extrinsic pathways of apoptosis in susceptible cells including t cells this view is supported by an analysis of fas expression on t cells from patients who survived or succumbed to ebov infection 188 in patients who died a very high proportion of the few remaining cd4 and cd8 t cells were fas positive in contrast to t cells from survivors although fas can be induced as a result of specific t cell activation 207 it is unlikely that the residual cells in these patients were only antigen-specific t cellsit is also possible that dysregulated dcs and macrophages could contribute in other ways to lymphocyte apoptosis infected dcs and macrophages fail to produce regulated cytokine responses and they are also impaired in their ability to upregulate costimulatory molecules such as cd40 and the b7 family member cd86 consistent with their inability to efficiently prime t cells 208209 interestingly however other members of the b7 family including co-inhibitory molecules such as programmed death ligand 1 pd-l1 are upregulated on infected dcs and its receptor programmed death 1 pd-1 may be upregulated on cd8 t cells in ebov infections 210 the interaction of these molecules could lead to apoptosis the pd-1pd-l1 pathway is important for controlling t cell tolerance and has been shown to be used by pathogens to down-regulate t cell responses 128211 pd-1 signaling results in decreased t cell proliferation and recent findings suggest this might be due to induction of apoptosis via pd-l1 binding 212213 while this might explain the depletion of antigen-specific t cell populations this mechanism is unlikely to explain the generalized lymphopenia observed during filovirus infection since the infected dcs would not be expected to engage t cells that were not specific for filovirus epitopes sufficiently to trigger pd-1 signalingalternatively t cell apoptosis may result in part from the dysregulated cytokine responses during filovirus infections ifn helps productively modulate cd8 t cell responses if present at or near the time of t cell activation however if not ifn can have pro-apoptotic consequences on t cells 214 interestingly ifn is present at high levels in the serum late in fatal filovirus infection 2162 and these high levels could result in the activation of t cell andor nk cell apoptotic pathways finally a 17-mer in filovirus gps which resembles an immunosuppressive motive found in retroviral envelope proteins has been reported to induce lymphocyte death and suppression of cytokine responses 215217 this is puzzling because lymphocytes do not bind to the viral gp 184185 so the mechanism by which the 17-mer mobilizes lymphocyte death remains unclearwe have learned a lot about the interaction of filoviruses with infected and non-infected cells including identification of target cells elucidating stages of the replication cycle cytopathic effects induced by the viruses and host restriction factors nevertheless there is still a long way to go towards understanding both the cellular and organismal events that lead to the outcome of this devastating disease there remain major gaps in our understanding of the alterations in signaling pathways in infected cells the cellular components that contribute to filovirus replication and the mechanisms that control cell fate in infected cells moreover we remain largely ignorant in our understanding of the mechanisms that impact the innate and adaptive immune system and modulate inflammatory responses during infection these avenues of inquiry will be crucial for us to have a more complete understanding of the pathogenesis of filoviral diseasestudies on the activities of rna in the cell in particular about rna interference against viruses 12 have revolutionized our understanding of the many roles played by this macromolecule the discovery that rna can not only replicate but also possess catalytic activity suggested that a single macromolecule could have originally carried out both replication of information and catalysis viral sequences in the genomes of various organisms and unexpected amounts of viruses and phages in the biosphere suggest that viruses helped in building genomes and in driving evolution 3this article will deal with the contrasting effects that the avian paramyxovirus newcastle disease virus ndv exerts in different species like birds mice and humans 4 it tries to answer the question how it is possible that a virus which is pathogenic in birds can have beneficial effects in mouse tumors and in cancer patientsthe recognition of 5-triphosphate non-capped viral leader rna in the cytoplasm of ndv infected human cells by retinoic-acid-inducible gene i rig-i 5 initiates a strong type i interferon ifn response 6 and is a good example of rnaprotein interaction another example is a recently identified host cell-derived microrna which targets rig-i mrna for degradation 7 escape mechanisms from type i interferon responses will be described which are a prerequisite for ndv replication in avian cells and for ebola virus ebov replication in human cellsthe review will give an overview of the characteristics and molecular biology of ndv and will then describe its interesting immunobiological aspects including oncolysis and immunogenic cell death icd a main part will summarize 50 years of clinical application of ndv in cancer patients including successful virus production according to good manufacturing practice gmp reverse genetics of ndv will be dealt with to provide a molecular basis for genetic engineering examples of newly engineered recombinant ndv viral vectors to protect against new emerging virus diseases will be givenduring approximately 200 million years of evolution viruses from mammals derived from therapsids have had time to adapt to the immune system of their host this will be exemplified later by ebov a devastating pathogen in man a majority of bird species developed approximately 66 million years ago according to a recent whole-genome analysis 8 thus in comparison to mammals bird viruses appear to have had a shorter period to adapt to the bird immune systemndv is an avian paramyxovirus type i apmv-1 which causes a serious disease in chickens and other birds known as nd 9 ndv outbreaks were first reported in indonesia and subsequently in newcastle-upon-tyne uk in the year 1926 there have been several panzootics of this disease in poultry and in domestic pigeons during the last four decades 1011 efforts in controlling the disease involved the development of new vaccines and vaccination protocols 12since the 1970s ndv has been considered a useful laboratory virus for replication and virulence studies as recently summarized 13ndv strains are classified as velogenic mesogenic and lentogenic according to their pathotypes and virulence velogenic strains are highly infectious in birds there are viscerotropic and neurotropic pathotypes once introduced into an avian population ndv is rapidly transmitted among susceptible birds by either inhalation or ingestion the virus spreads rapidly between premises by the movement of apparently healthy but infected birds by movement of people and contaminated equipment food and water and by airborne spread from one premise to another the generalized signs of nd include depression loss of appetite abnormal thirst severe dehydration emaciation and fever mortality can reach up to 100 913mesogenic strains of ndv usually cause respiratory disease in adult chickens while lentogenic strains are not pathogenic the first contact of the virus in permissive hosts occurs with respiratory epithelial cells viral attachment is mediated by the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein hn protein this binds to gangliosides and n-glycoproteins containing a distinct structure of sialic acid and sugars virus to cell binding is followed by the activation of the viral fusion protein f fusion of the viral and the host cell membrane 14 then allows the transfer of the viral genome into the host cells cytoplasm there the 15 kb non-segmented negative single-stranded rna ssrna is transcribed into mrnas and is translated into viral proteins 1516embryonated chicken eggs eces are universally used for virus isolation the presence of the virus in the allantoic fluid is determined by the hemagglutination ha test the hemagglutination inhibition hi test is commonly used to identify ndv in addition panels of monoclonal antibodies can be used to characterize and group isolatesthree in vivo tests have been used for assessment of the pathogenicity of ndv isolates these are performed either in nine-day-old eggs in one-day-old chicks or in six-week-old chickens currently the world organization for animal health uses two parameters to differentiate between virulent isolate notifiable disease and avirulent isolate not notifiable since the conventional in vivo pathogenicity tests are time consuming and expensive several rapid phenotyping methods based on reverse transcription rt-pcr have been developed of these assays the real-time rt-pcr rrt-pcr offers the highest sensitivity 1617ndv is very sensitive to heat 10 to 20 min at 56 c lipid solvents ionic and nonionic detergents formaldehyde and oxidizing agents due to the rna nature of its genome the virus is very sensitive to uv irradiation and resistant to -irradiationndv virions are 100 nm or more in diameter pleomorphic but mostly spherical in shape the virion is enveloped with a lipid membrane from the host cell plasma membrane the envelope contains two transmembrane glycoproteinsthe hn and the fusion f protein these proteins are present as homo-oligomers and form spike-like projections of 8 nm length on the outer surface of the envelope beneath the envelope lies a non-glycosylated membrane protein called matrix m protein inside the virion particle rests the nucleocapsid which has the classical herringbone morphology with a diameter of 18 nm the viral nucleocapsid consists of a single species of viral rna 15186 to 15198 nucleotides nt in length and replicon complex proteinsthe nucleocapsid n the phosphoprotein p and the large polymerase protein l 16ndv can be produced not only from eces but also from cell culture often it has been produced from human tumor cell lines 18 for good manufacturing practice gmp production it is advisable to use avian embryonic established cell lines following standard operating procedures sops under validated aseptic operation in a grade b area the first step consists of creating a master cell bank mcb this is followed by establishing a master seed virus msv and a virus seed stock mvss qualification of the msv involves titration via determination of tissue culture infective activity tcid50 19 identification by sequencing and proof for absence of adventitious non viral or viral agents the next step consists of establishing an ndv manufacturing process in a bioreactor involving upstream and downstream processing a batch is certified and released only when all batch specification and release criteria are fulfilled all this has been achieved worldwide for the first time at the iozk in germanythe complete genome sequences for many strains of ndv are available on the web at wwwncbinlmnihgov based on complete genome sequences a phylogenetic tree has been designed 1116 the codon-associated rate of change for the six ndv proteins revealed that the highest rate of change occurred at the fusion protein 20all genome sizes of ndv are consistent with the rule of six that is characteristic of apmv-1 21 this rule is thought to arise from the need to fully encapsidate the entire length of the genome with a chain of n protein monomers that span exactly 6 nt this prevents digestion by rna nucleases the genomic rna contains a 55 nt 3-extragenic region known as the leader and a 114 nt 5-extragenic region known as the trailer the leader and trailer are the control regions essential not only for transcription and replication but also for encapsidation of newly synthesized rnas into virus particles they flank the six genes 3-n-pv-m-f-hn-l-5 of the viral genome about 90 of the ndv genome carries coding sequencestranscription begins at a single promoter that is present in the leader region first a leader rna of 55 nt is synthesized which is followed by sequential transcription of the genes in the 35 order to yield individual mrnas by stop-start mechanism guided by conserved gene-start and gene-end signals gene-start initiates synthesis of the mrna and gene-end directs polyadenylation and termination of the mrna the leader rna is neither capped nor polyadenylated and is not functional as mrna the mrnas are capped methylated and polyadenylated by the viral polymerase 1116the incorporation of two g nucleotides at the rna editing site of the p protein results in the frameshift variant protein v v is an accessory protein that is involved in antagonizing the avian cellular antiviral response to infection v interacts in a species-specific fashion with bird cell proteins to inhibit ifn signaling this leads to degradation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 stat1 and to inhibition of interferon- ifn- induction 22this is a new method by which infectious viruses can be generated entirely from cloned dna c-dna the ability to recover negative-strand rna viruses including ndv from c-dna clones has allowed investigating structure and function of individual viral genes and their proteins reverse genetics technology has also enabled the design of recombinant live ndv vaccines and vaccine vectors a suitable cell line is transfected with a plasmid expressing the full-length antigenomic rna this is cotransfected with three support plasmids which encode the viral n p and l under the control of a bacteriophage t7 rna polymerase promoter the recovery of recombinant ndv requires activity of the t7 rna polymerase this enzyme can be provided by a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the t7 gene or by a cell line which constitutively expresses this polymerase 23 further details are contained in two recent reviews 2425the replication life cycle of all rna viruses involves the formation of double-stranded rna dsrna this foreign structure activates an important cellular defence system based on type i interferons such as ifn- and - mutations in tumor cells often cripple the interferon system which allows un-inhibited cell proliferation and provides relative resistance to apoptosis 26 in non-permissive hosts such mutations make tumor cells to a relatively permissive substrate for the replication of rna viruses such as ndv identified mechanisms that can explain tumor selectivity of viral replication and oncolysis in non-permissive hosts involve i defects in activation of anti-viral signaling pathways 27 ii defects in type i ifn signaling pathways 28 iii defects in apoptotic pathways 29 and iv activation of ras signaling and expression of rac1 protein 30infection of cells by ndv involves basically two steps 1 cell binding membrane fusion 14 transduction of the viral genome and transcription of viral genes and 2 viral replication using a newly produced nucleocapsid as anti-genome 2531 infection of normal cells from non-permissive hosts usually does not proceed to the second step 25262732 in contrast in nearly all tested humanmurine tumor cells and transformed cells ndv infection proceeded to the second step thus allowing tumor selective replication 33 ndv has the ability to replicate up to 10000-fold faster in human cancer cells than in most normal human cells 34ndv has a number of desirable properties that make it an attractive oncolytic agent in non-permissive not avian hosts such as mouse or man it is known to enter cells by binding to sialic acid residues which are present on most human cancer cells making it suitable for use in a broad range of cancer cell types ndv is a fast growing virus and is highly fusogenic in tumor cells there is virtually no pre-existing immunity to ndv in the general human populationan important new paradigm of oncolytic virus-mediated immunotherapy is the concept of immunogenic cell death icd 35 classical physiological apoptosis is non-immunogenic the features of icd induced by ndv in tumor cells include an endoplasmatic reticulum er stress response immunogenic apoptosis necrosis and autophagy 36 such icd features lead to shutdown of protein synthesis surface exposure of calreticulin heat-shock proteins hsps and of the viral proteins hn and f upregulation of major histocompatibility class i protein mhc i and adhesion molecules icam-1 and lfa-3 lead to improved antigen presentation 37 immunogenic apoptosis selectively recruits neutrophils as first innate immune responders infection by ndv causes release of the neutrophil attracting chemokines cxcl1 ccl2 and cxcl10 38 neutrophil recruitment by chemokines seems an old evolutionary conserved mechanism across vertebrates since chemokines evolved about 650 million years ago in fish 39pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps from ndv recognized by respective pattern recognition receptors prrs from innate immunity cells are i 5-triphosphate viral leader rna 5 ii dsrna 30 and iii the hn protein 4041 these pamps are recognized respectively by the following prrs i cytoplasmic rig-i ii cytoplasmic dsrna dependent protein kinase r pkr and endosomal toll-like receptors tlrs and iii plasma membrane expressed nk cell receptor nkp46 41 prrs initiate multiple response pathways leading to a strong type i interferon response to release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and to activation of immune cells finally cell necrosis leads to release of damage-associated molecular patterns damps and of further cytokines and chemokines 37in an orthotopic murine glioma model it was demonstrated that ndv virotherapy induces icd with its molecular determinants such as calreticulin hsp and high mobility group box-1 hmgb1 amphoterin this is followed by tumor-specific immune t cell memory 42the viral surface protein hn was shown to be recognized by the prr nkp46 of murine nk cells and to transmit cytotoxicity inducing signals 41 transfected and cell surface exposed hn but not f molecules induced in a paracrine stimulation assay in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc cell surface expression of tnf-related apoptosis-inducing ligand trail and secretion of ifn- 39 upon contact with ndv not only nk cells but also monocytes become activated to produce tumoricidal activity through trail 43 ndv infected macrophages produce nitric oxide no via activation of nuclear factor-kappa b 44the effect of ndv on human dendritic cells dcs has been studied in a sophisticated way using technologies developed by systems biology 45 due to its avian origin ndv was considered a prototype virus to study an uninhibited cellular response with human dcs the anti-viral state transition of the dcs occurred within 18 h post-infection by ndv the change of the genetic program was explained by a regulatory network of 24 distinct transcription factors tfs these regulated the expression of 779 of the 1351 up-regulated genes the anti-viral state transition was associated with polarization of the dcs towards type 1 dc1 this type of polarization favors the induction of t helper type 1 th1 t cell responses upon antigen presentation by the dcsthe genetic re-programming of dcs by ndv justifies the term priming which is usually associated only with cells of the adaptive immune response t and b lymphocyteswith regard to t cells hn molecules at the surface of infected tumor cells were shown to introduce new cell adhesive strength for interaction with lymphocytes 46 and for t-cell costimulation including cd4 t helper 47 and cd8 cytotoxic t cells 48ndv induces in human pbmc dcs and monocytes a strong type i ifn response 461540 this occurs within 1824 h and consists of an early phase and a late phase the early phase is initiated through the recognition of pamps through prrs see section 32 a signal transduction cascade to the nucleus then induces ifn- first followed by ifn- during the late phase of the ifn response the induced and secreted ifn- and - molecules interact with the cell surface expressed -chain of the type i ifn receptor ifnra this initiates an amplification loop of the ifn response involving stat proteins and the interferon regulatory factor irf-9in murine studies an association was described between the strength of the type i interferon response and the resistance of cells normal or neoplastic to virus replication following infection by ndv the studies revealed an important role in the ifn response of rig-i irf3 ifn- and irf7 627 in addition studies with cells from knock-out mice devoid of the gene for ifnra showed the importance of this receptor in its absence normal cells were incapable of preventing ndv replication 4950type i interferon was demonstrated to be important for the generation of cytotoxic t lymphocyte ctl responses in vivo a low basic level of ifn is constitutionally expressed following application of a neutralizing anti-ifn antibody in mice it was impossible to induce in these ctl precursor cells in addition in vitro in ctl restimulation cultures the addition of a neutralizing anti-ifn antibody inhibited the ctl response the augmented tumor-specific ctl response observed in mice immunized with ndv infected tumor cells in comparison to mice immunized with non-infected tumor cells was mediated via ifn- 51 and was a result of cd4 and cd8 immune t cell cooperation 52intranasal application of ndv in mice induced in lung epithelial cells pro-inflammatory cytokines and type i interferon which is important also for counter-acting regulatory t cell treg activity 49immune escape from type i interferon responses in permissive ndv infected avian cells is mediated via the v protein a frameshift variant of the viral phosphoprotein p v inhibits ifn signaling by targeting stat1 for degradation 4453 it also inhibits ifn- induction through interaction with melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 mda5 leading to the inhibition of irf3 activation 54 the v protein shows specificity for avian proteins and does not interfere with the ifn response in mammalian cells 55ebola virus ebov from primates has during evolution developed immune escape mechanisms from the type i ifn response of primate cells 50 ebov first discovered in 1976 belongs to the largest known rna viruses with a diameter of 80 nm and a length of up to 14000 nm it is a member of the filoviridae family similar to ndv the genome of ebov consists of a negative ssrna it codes for 8 proteins two of the eight viral proteins vp24 and vp35 are involved in immunosuppression vp35 antagonises the early phase of the interferon responseit binds directly to dsrna and inhibits anti-viral signaling it also blocks virus induced irf3 phosphorylation this prevents irf3 dimerization and nuclear translocation in cells expressing vp35 there was also an observed suppression of phosphorylation of pkr and of elongation initiation factor 2a eif-2a 56 in contrast vp24 is an antagonist of the late phase vp24 binds directly to stat1 and inhibits its nuclear translocation 57table 1 summarizes the described molecular determinants for rna viral immune stimulation ndv in man and for rna viral immune escape ndv in birds and ebola in manintra-tumoral and intra-peritoneal injection of oncolytic ndv mesogenic attenuated strain pv701 caused durable complete tumor regression in athymic mice bearing human neuroblastoma and fibrosarcoma xenografts 60 recombinant ndv strains derived from the velogenic strain italien after intra-tumoral injection induced syncytium formation and cell death it also prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing athymic mice and suppressed loss of body weight 61orthotopic glioma studies in immunocompetent syngeneic mice revealed that intra-tumoral virotherapy with ndv induced through icd long-term survival 42 the induced protective immunity was dependent on a functional adaptive immune system and on cd8 t cells 42these latter recent results corroborate earlier findings from the 1980s of post-operative anti-tumor vaccination in the murine esb lymphoma model with an autologous ndv infected tumor cell vaccine the induced immunity included cd4 th and cd8 ctl 5152 was highly specific protected against outgrowth of metastases and increased significantly the percentage of long-term surviving mice 62anti-tumor effects of ndv can also be expected in other non-avian vertebrate species this should be the case with tumors from domestic animals such as cat and dog and from animals of veterinary medicine like horse pig and cow another area of future ndv applicationndv has the capacity to replicate in non-proliferating tumor cells such as x-irradiated tumor vaccine cells since virus replication in the cytoplasm is independent of cell proliferation oncolytic ndv has the potential to target tumor stem cells or cells from tumor dormancy both of which may not be affected by chemo- or radiotherapy 463furthermore ndv can replicate in apoptosis-resistant tumor cells 29 in hypoxic cancer cells 64 and in interferon-resistant tumor cells 6232728resistance to immunotherapy can also be broken by ndv infection human t cell tolerance to melanoma could by broken by melanoma infection with ndv strain ulster 47 in a mouse melanoma model localized oncolytic ndv virotherapy was demonstrated to overcome systemic tumor resistance to immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy 65 this is important and suggests that results from clinical application of immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy can be improved by combination with oncolytic ndvliver fibrosis is a major health problem and the 12th most common cause of death in the unites states 66 activated hepatic stellate cells hescs are the crucial factor responsible for liver fibrosis hescs are liver-resident bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells located in the space of disse and store up to 80 of total body vitamin a upon activation the star shaped hescs differentiate into myofibroblasts to produce extracellular matrix ecm thus contributing to liver fibrosis when ndv was injected to hepatic fibrosis mice regression of liver fibrosis was observed replication of ndv in murine primary hescs or in human lx-2 hesc cells was demonstrated by colocalization of ndv and -smooth muscle actin -sma virus infection reduced the production of collagen fibrils and of matrix metalloproteinase mmp virus replication in hescs was followed by cell death via apoptosis 67 considering the importance of liver fibrosis and its connection to hepatocellular carcinoma hcc these findings have a strong potential clinical impacta number of ndv strains have been used for preventive vaccination against nd in the poultry industry 1216 vaccination is performed using either live or inactivated vaccines 68 mass application of live vaccines by sprays and aerosols is very popular several lentogenic strains such as lasota and b1 have been used for more than 50 years with proven track record of safety and efficacy however they do not completely prevent infection or virus shedding 68 they also do not possess genetic markers to allow differentiation between infected and vaccinated birds recently a recombinant nd vaccine innovax-nd was approved by the us fda for commercial use 16 it was recently also shown that an attenuated genotype vii ndv vaccine generated by reverse genetics effectively protected the vaccinated birds against homologous virulent genotype vii virus challenge and reduced virus shedding significantly more than in lasota vaccinated animals 69although it is not known which arm of the immune response nor which viral envelope glycoprotein is more important in providing protection against nd it is known that a robust immune response is required to completely cease virus replication and provide long-term protection this can likely only be induced by both envelope glycoproteins and participation of innate and adaptive cell mediated and humoral immune responses 16certain types of viruses have oncolytic andor other anti-neoplastic properties and can be used for virotherapy in cancer patients advantages exist in using oncolytic paramyxoviruses in comparison to viruses from other families eg retroviruses or dna viruses there is a lack of gene exchange via recombination and a lack of interaction with host cell dna even relatively high doses of ndv are well tolerated by cancer patients the reported side effects are mild grade 1 and 2 with the most common being mild fever 415in the 1990s a placebo-controlled phase ii clinical trial performed by csatary in hungary 70 included 33 late-stage cancer patients in the ndv treatment group and 26 in the placebo group they used an attenuated oncolytic veterinary vaccine strain mukteswar which they termed mth-68hthe virus was applied via inhalation to target lung metastases four thousand infectious unitsday of ndv was inhaled twice weekly for six months the clinical results suggested a decrease in cancer-related symptoms and better survival 70 this was however disputed because the study was not randomized and consisted of very heterogeneous groups of patients csatarys group later reported about a selected case series study of four high-grade gliomas treated with mth-68h this study showed radiographically-documented responses and long survival with improved symptomatology 71another oncolytic ndv strain pv701 was tested in patients with advanced cancers in a phase i trial conducted in the united states 72the patients n  79 were given escalating doses of virus intravenously their tumors had not responded to conventional therapy doses of three billion infectious particles were well tolerated dose-limiting toxicities included dyspnea dehydration and diarrhea when patients were desensitized with a lower initial dose the maximal tolerated dose was increased 10-fold 73 this suggests a priming or pre-conditioning effect on the immune system see section 34 and section 56cassel from atlanta ga usa reported as early as 1965 on ndv oncolytic strain 73 t as an antineoplastic agent 74 when they observed the development of post-oncolytic anti-tumor immunity 75 they focused on the development of viral oncolysates as vaccines they used such vaccines for post-operative management of malignant melanoma patients vaccinations were performed over many years and were never stopped completely details about 2 phase ii clinical studies involving 32 and 51 patients with stage ii metastatic melanoma ajcc stage iii have been summarized 8 cassel concluded from his results the unusual disease-free survival periods including exceptional survivals in 21 patients with head and neck disease and six cases with cerebral metastases suggest a unique role for the administration of ndv oncolysate in the management of stage ii melanoma patients 76my group at the german cancer research center dkfz in heidelberg had established in the 1980s an animal model system to study cancer metastasis and immunotherapy our concept was to use a live cell ndv infected tumor cell vaccine rather than a oncolysate because live cell vaccines apparently have higher immunogenicity than lysates the vaccine was termed atv-ndv it consisted of 10 million irradiated tumor cells which had been infected with ndv lentogenic strain ulster the anti-metastatic effects observed in the pre-clinical studies the specificity of the protective immunity induced and the mechanism of function have been summarized elsewhere 46263translational research from mouse to man was performed in the 1990s after a series of tests of human tumor cell lines or of tumor cells from fresh operation specimens we developed a protocol to produce a human atv-ndv vaccine which had pleiotropic immune stimulatory properties 31 with this type of vaccine more than 10 phase i to ii clinical post-operative vaccination studies were performed in patients with different types of cancer in the years from 1990 to 2008 46377 the trials involved among others carcinomas of breast 78 colon rectum 79 kidney 80 head and neck 81 pancreas 77 and glioblastoma multiforme gbm 82 only two studies will be summarized
ipatients suffering from gbm n  23 were vaccinated with atv-ndv from cell culture to assess feasibility safety and clinical benefit in a phase i study 82 the median progression-free survival pfs of vaccinated patients was 40 weeks vs 26 weeks in 87 non-vaccinated control subjects from the same time period and the same clinic the median overall survival os was 100 weeks vs 49 weeks in control subjects p  0001 in the vaccinate group immune monitoring revealed significant increases of skin anti-tumor delayed-type hypersensitivity dth reactivity of the number of tumor-reactive memory t cells mtcs in the blood and in the numbers of cd8 tumor-infiltrating t lymphocytes til in frozen tissue slices from gbm recurrences there was one complete remission of non-resectable tumor mass 82iia prospectively randomized phase iiiii trial investigated the efficiency of atv-ndv after liver resection for hepatic metastases of colorectal carcinoma crc as a tertiary prevention method 83 stage iv crc patients n  25 were vaccinated and compared with a similar number of non-vaccinated comparable patients for an exceptionally long follow-up period of about ten years at the end there was no significant difference between the vaccinated and the control arm however when stratified for tumor localization there were clear-cut differences between colon and rectum a significant benefit was seen in the colon but not in the rectum cancer subgroup in terms of long-term metastasis-free survival and os in the colon cancer control arm 786 had died in the vaccinated arm only 308 83the latter trial corroborated similar results about 30 increase in os obtained in most of the other studies 4153363 since the latter study was performed as a prospectively randomized phase iiiii study it provides clinical evidence for the effectivity and potential of the cancer vaccine atv-ndvthe potential mechanism of function of the long-term survival observed in stage iv colon carcinoma patients has been described in detail 59 an important role in long-term survival can be associated with cancer-reactive mtcs these can be primed against tumor-associated antigens taas in cancer patients either spontaneously or upon anti-tumor vaccination bone marrow has been demonstrated as a priming site for t-cell responses to blood-borne taas 84 patient-derived re-activated mtcs from bone marrow upon transfer to nodscid mice bearing autologous human tumor xenotransplants were capable of tumor rejection 85 thus demonstrating their importancetable 2 summarizes the various mentioned anti-tumor effects of ndv in mouse and manin spite of these promising results we generated new ideas for further improvements this appears necessary considering the fact that there is still a majority of patients that has to be considered as non-responders to this immunotherapy with ndv-based tumor vaccinesone strategy of improvement consisted in the augmentation of t-cell costimulatory signals this can be achieved by the attachment to atv-ndv of ndv-specific single chain antibodies with dual specificity bispecific bs antibody fusion proteins for instance anti-hnxanti-cd28 bshn-cd28 87 crc patients with late-stage disease that could no longer be subjected to surgery with curative intent n  14 were treated with atv-ndv-bshn-cd28 no severe adverse events were noticed in this phase i trial before vaccination none of the patients had detectable levels of tumor-reactive blood circulatory mtcs all patients showed an immunological response of tumor-reactive mtcs at least once during the course of five vaccinations additionally there was a dose-response relationship with the costimulatory molecule attached to the vaccine a partial response of metastases 30 decrease recist criteria was documented in four patients 87the other strategy for improvement was to combine viral oncolysate vol from atv-ndv with dendritic cells dcs vol-pulsed dcs vol-dcs were developed at the immunological and oncological center iozk in cologne germany the idea was meant to improve the de novo generation of taa-specific cells from nave t cells in 2015 iozk received an official permit for an individual application of this advanced therapeutic medicinal product atmp to cancer patientsthe new strategy of cancer immunotherapy at iozk consists in combining hyperthermia and oncolytic virus pretreatment with specific autologous anti-tumor vaccination 86 hyperthermia can activate the immune system when it is adjusted to reach a tissue temperature of 385 to 405 c systemic oncolytic ndv virus pretreatment has a positive pre-conditioning effect see section 34 and section 52 on the patients immune system and induces vol-reactive cd4 t helper cells 86 these create systemic recall responses at the site of vol-dc vaccination induce the chemokine ccl3 and thereby enhance dc migration to the draining lymph nodes with improved antitumor efficacy 88 in vitro cd4 t helper cells increased the maturation of human dcs much better than the maturation stimuli cd40-l and ifn- 89one case-report from iozk demonstrates long-term remission of prostate cancer in a patient with extensive bone metastases the patient had failed standard therapy the above treatment induced a long-lasting tumor-reactive mtc response 90 another case report relates to long-term survival of a breast cancer patient with extensive liver metastases after operation the patient refused further standard therapy instead she was treated with the above strategy at iozk the patient survived more than 66 months after the initial diagnosis in addition a continuous high quality of life was reported 91new results from iozk relate to case series studies of gbm patients 86 kaplan-meier survival analysis of 10 newly diagnosed operated patients show a median overall survival os of 30 months this has to be compared to 146 months after standard radiochemotherapy according to the stupp protocol remarkable is also a 5-year survival in the current series with combinatorial immunotherapy of almost 20 86this research topic is addressed in a recent e-book from frontiers in oncology 92 how can oncolytic viruses ovs be harnessed or combined with other agents to mediate stronger anti-tumor effects among others the following strategies were proposed and discussed i combine ovs with immune checkpoint blocking antibodies 93 ii combine ovs with hyperthermia 86 iii combine ovs with activated t cells 94 iv combine ovs with approved drugs and novel small molecules to dampen the innate and adaptive anti-viral responses increase the anti-tumor immune response or both 95 v combine ovs with chemotherapy or pharmaceutical immunomodulators 96 snf vi improve tumor targeting the specificity and efficacy of systemic tumor targeting of ndv could be improved using a bispecific adapter protein this also reduced unwanted side-effects 97 tumor targeting of grafted t cells could become improved via cell-bound tri-specific antibodies directed against a tumor-introduced viral antigen such as hn of ndv 94application of a plasmid encoding the hn protein of ndv phn at the ear pinna of mice induced high levels of systemic ifn- and reduced tumor growth in tumor bearing mice vaccination with phn dna compared to a control dna caused a significant increase in nk cell infiltration and a decrease in infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells mdscs 58recent studies underline the potential of recombinant ndv recndv as a vaccine vector the expression levels of foreign proteins such as influenza virus hemagglutinin 98 are high and the foreign genes are very stable after many virus passages in vitro and in vivo recndv can be engineered even with two genes to secrete full intact antibodies if respective heavy and light chains of igg from a hybridoma are incorporated into the viral genome 98new viruses or variants can cause epidemics and pose huge public health problems and economic losses within a short timendv-based live attenuated vaccine completely protected chickens and mice from lethal challenge with homologous and heterologous h5n1 avian influenza viruses 99 similar results have been obtained with recndv engineered to express the spike s glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov after intranasal immunization this vaccine protected african green monkeys against challenge with a high dose of sars-cov virus 100 ndv seems particularly suited as a vector against respiratory viral infectionsndv may be employed as an agent for immune stimulation and for prophylactic conditioning of the host immune system against the risk of viral infection see section 34 section 52 and section 56 this may be particularly relevant for individuals who come into contact with patients infected for instance with ebov 50 a recndv engineered to express ebov viral antigens could be well suited as a prophylactic vaccine because it would express hn as adjuvant to stimulate a strong type i interferon response as well as target antigens from ebov virus-like particles which also activate type i interferon pathways were shown to facilitate post-exposure protection against ebov 101acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus apmv was isolated from amoebae in a hospital while investigating a pneumonia outbreak a study of interaction of apmv with human cells revealed that the virus is able to evade the ifn system by inhibiting the regulation of interferon-stimulated genes suggesting that the virus and humans had hostpathogen interactions 102 this is another example where a recndv vector might in future become very usefulltable 3 contains future strategies for harnessing oncolytic virus-mediated anti-tumor immunity and for using ndv as vector against new emerging virus diseasesthere is much that can be learned from an avian rna virus such as ndv the virus was capable during evolution of adapting to the immune system of birds by generating the frameshift variant protein v that interferes with the type i interferon response of cells from birds emerging viruses causing fatal diseases in man such as ebola developed similar viral interferon escape mechanisms reverse genetics technology enables the development of ndv into a vector for incorporation of foreign genes such vectors are capable of protecting for instance chickens against h5n1 avian influenza virus and african green monkeys against sars-cov virustumor cells by somatic mutation often develop mechanisms to escape the growth inhibiting effects of type i interferons in non-permissive hosts such as mouse and human this allows the avian virus ndv to replicate selectively in tumor cells and to exert in these an oncolytic effect regarding medical application of ndv in cancer patients the following immunobiological mechanisms are important oncolytic ndv destroys tumor cells and induces a cell death that is immunogenic and initiates a dc1 and th1 directed anti-tumoral t cell response this leads to further destruction of tumor cells and to development of tumor-reactive memory t cells the latter play an important role for long-term survival in addition ndv has the potential to break various types of therapy resistances these findings explain the promising effects seen with oncolytic ndv and ndv-based vaccines eg atv-ndv vol-dc in cancer patients the iozk in cologne kln germany is the first and only place where vol-dc as an atmp is being applied with official permit if in future ndv would become included into protocols for standard treatment many more cancer patients would be able to profit from this than hithertondv fulfills many prerequisites for a new therapeutic drug in man high safety profile low side effects in comparison to chemo- or radiotherapy many-fold anti-neoplastic effects strong type i ifn response and broad immunostimulatory effects as reviewed here ndv has various applications i as viral vaccine in poultry ii as recombinant vector against emerging pathogens and iii as ov and immune stimulant in cancer patients there is good reason to expect many benefits from further research and application of ndvcontrol of infectious diseases is essential for the production of healthy poultry flocks and this is generally achieved by extensive vaccination programmes in combination with good management practices including biosecurity measures to reduce the risk of infection the success of vaccination programmes depends on the ability of the birds to mount a vigorous immune response after vaccination in addition to the innate ability of a particular bird to mount an immune response to a vaccine or an infection there are numerous external factors influencing the level of protective immunity the purpose of this chapter is to review the mechanisms and impact of immunosuppression which can have multiple causes and the ability of pathogens to counteract immune responses by immunoevasion immunosuppression is defined as  a state of temporary or permanent dysfunction of the immune response resulting from insults to the immune system and leading to increased susceptibility to disease as originally proposed by dohms and saif 1984 with the addition of  and often a suboptimal antibody response as suggested by ltticken 1997 such dysfunction often results from infection of cells of the immune system leading to their impaired function against the primary and subsequent infections in a non-specific manner for this chapter we define immunoevasion as  pathogen-initiated responses counteracting the immune responses to the specific pathogen the major difference is that immunosuppression is the consequence of the overall replicative strategy of the causative agent resulting in increased susceptibility to other pathogens but not necessarily to the causative agent while immunoevasion is achieved by specific pathogen-encoded determinants primarily favouring replication of the causative agent in some instances infections can result in immunosuppression and immunoevasion eg infection with mareks disease virus mdvimmunosuppression is a major problem for the poultry industry but actual figures indicating the scale of the problem are hard to find infection with pathogens andor environmental factors including management errors can result in immunosuppression and interactions between the two usually exacerbate the problem any infection causing clinical disease may result in immunosuppression but the focus will be on pathogen-induced immunosuppression in the absence of clinical disease viruses causing immunosuppression andor clinical disease at any age include mdv reticuloendotheliosis virus rev reovirus and although controversial avian leukosis virus alv other pathogens eg chicken infectious anaemia virus ciav may cause clinical disease in young chicks but the major damage consists of subclinical infection causing immunosuppression infectious bursal disease virus ibdv also causes clinical disease in young chicks but this acute infection results in damage to immune tissue particularly the bursa of fabricius and bursa-derived lymphocytes compromising the hosts ability to mount effective responses upon subsequent infection by other pathogens caution is needed however in the interpretation of the immunosuppressive effects caused by reovirus mdv rev and ibdv especially with older studies because it is not always clear if these viruses were free of ciav for example jakowski et al 1970 reported haematopoietic tissue destruction in chickens with mareks disease md but it was later learned that tumour material harvested from these birds was positive for ciav wellenstein personal communication cited by schat 2003 in addition to viral infections coccidial infections have been linked to immunosuppressionmost environmental factors causing immunosuppression are related to management problems such as inadequate water or food supply ammonia in the houses temperature stress social interactions within a flock etc in addition the presence of fungal toxins in feed is an environmental stressor most of these stressors enhance the production of corticosterone selection for high versus low corticosterone concentration in blood plasma can influence the degree of stress-induced immunosuppresionit has been recognized for a long time that social stress can exacerbate disease a classic example is the study by gross 1972 in which mdv-exposed chickens were kept in a socially stressful environment by moving every day one chicken from one cage into another cage these chickens developed a higher incidence of tumours than the mdv-infected chickens kept in a low stress environment the effects of social stress on md were especially enhanced in birds selected for high plasma corticosterone concentrations inoculation with chemicals blocking 11- hydroxylase which mediates the conversion of deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone in the adrenal glands reduced the impact of social stress on md and other diseases gross 1972 1989 inoculation of chickens with corticosterone using pharmacological doses resulted in a rapid lymphoid depletion in thymus bursa and spleen dohms and metz 1991 these authors suggested that bacterial infections eg escherichia coli may cause stress-type lesions in the bursa similar to corticosterone-induced lymphoid depletionthe importance of fungal stressors has been reviewed by bondy and pestka 2000 aflatoxin is the best known fungal stressor for poultry but fumonisins and ochratoxins have also been implicated as immunotoxicants in chickens and turkeys bondy and pestka 2000 suggested that the effects are more immunomodulatory than immunosuppressive but the molecular basis for the immunomodulation is poorly understood ingestion of aflatoxins can result in decreased antibody responses to t cell-dependent and -independent antigens decreased macrophage functions and decreased cell-mediated immune cmi responses but these effects are dose-dependent bondy and pestka 2000 chicks hatched from hens fed on diets containing aflatoxins also showed impaired immune functions when tested between 2 and 3 weeks of age qureshi et al 1998 but it is not known how long after hatching the effects last these results have important implications and can confound the interpretation of immune dysfunctions in commercial flocks as a confounding factor when virally induced immunosuppression occurs in young birds feed contaminated with fumonisins and ochratoxins also impairs antibody responses and macrophage functions but it is not clear if immunosuppression occurs in chicks hatched from hens fed contaminated diets bondy and pestka 2000two groups of coccidian species have been linked to immunosuppression cryptosporidium baileyi and eimeria spp although the evidence is rather limited in both cases infection with the latter has been linked to decreased mitogen stimulation responses rose and hesketh 1984 but antibody responses to t cell-dependent and -independent antigens were not affected bhanushali and long 1985 c baileyi replicates in the epithelial cells of the bursa of fabricius and respiratory tract of chickens and is probably more prevalent than diagnostic cases indicate mcdougald 2003 oral inoculation of young chickens with high doses of c baileyi caused histopathological lesions in the epithelium and lamina propia of the bursa rhee et al 1997 and decreased antibody responses to t cell-dependent and -independent antigens rhee et al 1998b 1998c titres to infectious bronchitis virus ibv and newcastle disease virus ndv were also decreased after inoculation of 2-day-old chicks with c baileyi rhee et al 1998a 1998d on the other hand abbassi et al 2000a 2000b found that infection with c baileyi neither increased md nor did it reduce the efficacy of the mdv vaccine strain cvi988 interestingly mdv infection before or after challenge with c baileyi aggravated the latter likewise mdv vaccination followed 4 days later with c baileyi challenge caused respiratory lesions within 6 days see also section mdvas mentioned before we will only discuss viruses that may cause immunosuppression independently of clinical symptoms although the independence may be a temporal feature as is the case for the tumour-inducing viruses and depending on the age of challenge ciav and ibdv the following viruses and their effects on the immune responses will be discussed ibdv ciav reovirus and the three tumour-inducing viruses alv rev and mdv detailed information on virus replication pathogenesis pathology and immune responses for these viruses can be found in several chapters in diseases of poultry 11th edition saif et al 2003 and other textbooks on avian diseasesibdv belonging to the birnaviridae has been divided into two serotypes of which only serotype 1 causes immunosuppression and disease in chickens several pathotypes are recognized within serotype 1 varying from mild to very virulent more recently strains within group 1 have been further subdivided into genetic groups based on restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing it has been recognized for a long time that serotype 1 strains can cause severe immunosuppression with impaired antibody responses and increased susceptibility to other pathogens especially when birds are infected before 3 weeks of age reviewed by sharma et al 1994 2000 lukert and saif 2003the genome of ibdv is characterized by a double-stranded rna dsrna genome consisting of segments a and b segment b codes for the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase and segment a codes for two structural proteins vp2 and vp3 an autoprotease vp4 and a small non-structural peptide vp5 which partly overlaps with the open reading frame orf coding for vp234 lukert and saif 2003 the polyprotein vp234 but not the mature vp2 vp3 or vp4 arrests b cell division probably by interfering with the cell cycle because it does not affect cell viability peters et al 2004 using a reverse genetics approach yao et al 1998 showed that deletion of vp5 did not prevent virus replication in vivo but did prevent the development of bursal lesions suggesting a role for vp5 in the pathogenesis interestingly in vitro studies suggest that very early after infection vp5 is anti-apoptotic liu and vakharia 2006 but during later stages vp5 accumulates in the plasma membrane lombardo et al 2000 and causes apoptosis yao and vakharia 2001 vp2 has also been linked to apoptosis when expressed alone from transfected rna rodriguez-lecompte et al 2005 in summary the molecular basis for ibdv-induced suppression of the immune response is the result of a complex set of interactions between the different viral proteins and infected b cellsit has been known since the 1970s that ibdv infection in chicks younger than 3 weeks of age causes severe damage to the bursa of fabricius with depletion of b cells expressing surface immunoglobulin igm affecting mostly primary antibody responses infection especially at 1 day of age also results in a significant decrease of surface ig-expressing b cells in spleen and peripheral blood lymphocytes but does not affect circulating cd4 and cd8 t cells hirai et al 1981 rodenberg et al 1994 the damage to the bursa is transient follicles become repopulated with lymphocytes and tissue architecture is restored but primary antibody responses remain depressed until at least 7 weeks post-infection pi but ultimately also recover the duration of the recovery process depends on the age of infection and the virulence of the strain vervelde and davison 1997 kim et al 1999 recently withers et al 2005 2006 described two types of follicles emerging after recovery from ibdv infection in neonatal chicks small follicles lacking a distinct cortex and medulla and large follicles with rapidly proliferating b cells and a normal structure b cells in the large follicles were still capable of undergoing gene conversion and may have been derived from small numbers of surviving bursal stem cells in contrast the b cells in the small follicles were considered to be derived from more mature b cells that had already undergone gene conversion these data suggest that the ability to recover from ibdv-induced suppression of antibody production and diversity is based on the proportion of small versus large follicles developing after infectionin addition to replication in b cells ibdv can also infect and replicate in macrophages khatri et al 2005 found viral rna and proteins by reverse transcriptase rt-pcr and immunohistochemistry respectively in bursal macrophages between 1 and 7 days pi the absolute number of macrophages in the bursa was decreased significantly at 3 and 5 days pi the actual impact on the immune response of this observation is not clear proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin il-6 il-1 and il-8 are increased at the transcriptional level in the bursa and spleen while the anti-inflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor tgf-4 is decreased kim et al 1998 khatri et al 2005 eldaghayes et al 2006 these different groups of authors reported somewhat conflicting results for the production of type i interferon ifn and ifn- transcription but these differences could be the result of using different virus strains andor infecting different age groups in addition the production of nitric oxide synthase ii  nos ii previously known as inducible nos inos bruckdorfer 2005  mrna was also increased in bursal macrophages khatri and sharma 2006 showed that the activation of macrophages is through the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk and nuclear factor-kappa b nf pathway but it is not clear whether these pathways are activated through specific viral proteins the alterations in cytokine transcription are compatible with the inflammation in the bursa during the acute infection however it is less clear how these changes play a role in ibdv-associated immunosuppression it will also be important to determine if the changes occur in ibdv-infected macrophages before they undergo lysis or that infection and cytokine deregulation occur in different subpopulationsalthough t cells are not susceptible to infection with ibdv these cells form an important component of the overall immunopathogenesis of ibdv there is an influx of cd4 and cd8 cells into the bursa between 1 and 10 days pi vervelde and davison 1997 sharma et al 2000 in addition to the proposed role of cd8 cells in lysing virus-infected cells bursal cd8 and cd4 cells may also contribute to the production of nos ii by ifn- production or other soluble factors stimulating nos ii transcription in macrophages and subsequent nitric oxide no production no can contribute to the inflammatory lesion development but may also be involved in downregulation of splenic t cell responses to mitogens which is associated with the acute phase of ibdv infection kim and sharma 2000in conclusion ibdv infection causes a complex set of interactions between b cells macrophages and t cells leading to destruction and subsequent partial recovery of the bursa and long-lasting suppression of primary antibody responses recent studies by several groups have provided a better insight in the immunopathogenesis of ibdv in young birds however important questions remain for example how can we explain the recovery from infection in the face of suppression of primary antibody responses if neutralizing antibodies are key to recovery do we have to postulate that cell-mediated immunity is far more important than previously believed another unresolved question is why young birds mostly develop subclinical disease while infection of older antibody-negative birds results in clear-cut pathology including haemorrhages there may be similarities between the situation in birds with ibdv and in mice with influenza virus where the immune response is responsible for most tissue damage and in which case the damage can be reduced by treatment with tgf- williams et al 2005avian reoviruses belong to the orthoreovirus genus of the reoviridae which have a genome consisting of 10 dsrna fragments avian reovirus infections can cause tenosynovitis in chickens and other diseases or result in a subclinical infection although horizontal transmission is the main route for infection egg transmission may occur infrequently menendez et al 1975 infections with pathogenic but not non-pathogenic strains have been associated with depletion of lymphoid cells in the bursa and thymus and decreased serological responses to inactivated ndv sharma and fredericksen 1987 however montgomery et al 1986 were unable to find a significant impact of reovirus infection on antibody responses to ndv sheep red blood cells srbc and brucella abortus antigen although a decrease in relative bursa weight and some lymphocyte depletion in the bursa were noted reovirus infection decreased the responses of peripheral blood monocytes and splenocytes to mitogens at 7 days pi but not afterwards montgomery et al 1986 sharma et al 1994 pertile et al 1995 1996 the latter group showed that removal of plastic-adherent cells primed to produce no restored mitogen responsiveness of t lymphocytes to some degree and suggested that suppressor macrophages were responsible for the immuno-suppression recent work with mammalian species suggests that the regulation of macrophage activation is rather complex for example il-13 may be responsible for the induction of macrophages producing no sinha and garg 2000 while il-10 through the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 socs3 may downregulate the inflammatory responses of macrophages qasimi et al 2006 the s1 genome segment of avian and mammalian reovirus which has been linked to immunosuppression garzelli et al 1985 codes for 3 open reading frames orf two of which are non-structural proteins these two proteins have pleiotropic functions many of which interfere with cellular signaling pathways liu et al 2005 additional research on the interactions of these proteins with cytokine pathways will be important to more fully understand reovirus-induced immunosuppression in chickensthe three tumour viruses associated with lymphoid tumours mdv alv and rev are discussed in more detail in chapter 19 in this chapter only the immunosuppressive aspects are reviewed extensive reviews on the diseases caused by these viruses are available fadly and payne 2003 witter and fadly 2003 witter and schat 2003mdv an alphaherpesvirus causing tumours of t lymphocytes in chickens has attracted the attention of virologists and immunologists since highly successful vaccines protecting against the disease became available during the early 1970s since then the virus has evolved from virulent to very virulent vv and more recently to vv pathotypes witter 1997 the increase in pathogenicity not only increased the incidence of tumours but was also linked to some new neurological syndromes gimeno et al 2002 in addition the vv strains caused more severe damage to the lymphoid organs than virulent and vv pathotypes calnek et al 1998 probably leading to increased immunosuppressionimmunosuppression caused by mdv has recently been reviewed by schat and markowski-grimsrud 2001 and schat 2004 and in this chapter we will only present the most important aspects of mdv immunosuppression and immunoevasion see section immunoevasion mdv-associated immunosuppression is often divided into an early immunosuppression phase during the cytolytic infection and a late immunosuppression phase when virus is reactivated and tumours develop one of the key characteristics of the early immunosuppression is the destruction of lymphocytes in the lymphoid organs during the first 2 weeks of infection causing severe atrophy of the thymus and bursa of fabricius this may be permanent or transient depending on the pathotype of mdv the model for the pathogenesis of md as originally outlined by calnek 1986 and schat 1987 and recently reviewed by calnek 2001 provides the basis for the understanding how mdv causes both b and t cell depletion briefly chickens become infected through cell-free virus present in feather-follicle dander virus is transferred to the lymphoid organs probably through macrophages and replicates first in b lymphocytes causing a productive-restrictive infection in which cell-associated but not cell-free mdv is produced and the infected cells are destined to die this phase is often referred to as the cytolytic phase as a consequence of the production of viral antigens and subsequent immune responses t cells become activated expressing mhc class ii antigens and other activation markers in contrast to resting t cells activated t cells are susceptible to mdv infection and become infected normally mdv establishes a latent infection in activated t cells through poorly understood mechanisms morgan et al 2001b although cytokines most likely play a role in the process schat and markowski-grimsrud 2001 depending on the pathotype of mdv and the genetic resistance of the host latency may be permanent temporarily followed by a secondary cytolytic cycle additional immunosuppression and tumour development or absent with continuous virus replication and frequently early mortalityas early as 3 days pi the expression of ifn- is upregulated xing and schat 2000 which led schat and markowski-grimsrud 2001 to suggest that this may upregulate the expression of il-8 receptors the upregulation of il-8 receptors is likely an essential step in the transfer of cell-associated mdv from b cells to activated t cells allowing viral il-8 vil-8 produced during the lytic infection parcells et al 2001 to attract activated t cells the increased cytolytic infection and thus increased damage to the lymphoid organs associated with some of the vv pathotypes may be caused by a more effective transfer of mdv from b to t cells due to increased levels of vil-8 production combined with the inability to establish latency after 7 days pi jarosinski et al 2003 reported that vv strains produced higher levels of vil-8 than less virulent strains but this is likely the consequence of increased virus replication yunis et al 2004 rather than an intrinsic ability to enhance vil-8 production the importance of vil-8 for the cytolytic infection is further shown by the fact that tissue culture-attenuated strains have no or very low vil-8 transcript levels jarosinski et al 2003 and that deletion of vil-8 cortes and cardona 2004 cui et al 2005 or deletion of exon 1 of vil-8 jarosinski and schat 2007 result in attenuation of the cytolytic infection the reasons for the continued replication of vv mdv instead of establishment of latency have not been elucidated it is of interest to note that vv mdv causes a highly significant upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines as early as 4 days pi in spleen and brain tissues jarosinski et al 2005 careem et al 2006 it is certainly feasible that the distortion in cytokine profile impacts on the production of cytokines involved in the induction andor maintenance of latency volpini et al 1995 with the consequence of a prolonged cytolytic infection leading to more profound immunosuppressionapoptosis is the most likely mechanism responsible for cell death during the cytolytic infection in the lymphoid organs morimura et al 1996 1997 affecting cd4cd8 thymocytes what needs to be resolved is do mdv-infected thymocytes become apoptotic or does mdv-induced cytokine deregulation affecting thymocyte maturation cause apoptosis of non-infected cells and a collapse of thymus architecture schat 2004 the latter is certainly possible based on the recent evidence that cytokines can be deregulated especially after infection with vv strains mdv infection can also cause apoptosis in cd4 peripheral t cells but cd8 t cells are apparently not affected morimura et al 1995 the reasons for the latter are not clear because cd8 t cells can be infected with and transformed by mdv baigent et al 1998 calnek et al 1989 thus far it has not been resolved which mdv gene products are responsible for the immunsuppression it is likely that the sorf2 gene plays a role based on two studies using opposing experimental strategies deletion mutants lacking several orf including sorf2 caused decreased cytolytic infection without preventing tumour formation parcells et al 1995 upregulation of sorf2 expression through the insertion of the rev long terminal repeat ltr resulted in enhanced cytolytic infection in the absence of tumour development witter et al 1997in addition to the destruction of lymphoid tissues mdv also induces immune suppression through activation of macrophages these macrophages were able to inhibit mitogen stimulation of t cells obtained from non-infected chickens lee et al 1978 schat and markowski-grimsrud 2001 suggested that this inhibition was likely the consequence of mdv-induced no production by the macrophages and was protective rather than immunosuppressive by reducing the pool of activated t cells the concept of immunosuppression around 7 day pi is conflicting because on the one hand there is destruction of lymphoid tissue potential immunoevasion and the activation of suppressor macrophages while at the same time ctl against several mdv proteins are present schat and markowski-grimsrud 2001 markowski-grimsrud and schat 2002 in contrast with the more classical strains vv strains may actually infect macrophages barrow et al 2003a and macrophages have been associated with mdv lesions in the brain barrow et al 2003b bl njaa kw jarosinski and ka schat unpublished data the importance of these observations for immunosuppression is not clear more likely it will be part of the enhanced proinflammatory response in the brain jarosinski et al 2005late immunosuppression can be caused by lytic infection of lymphoid cells upon reactivation of mdv from latency causing similar effects on the immune system as during the early lytic infection in addition tumour cells may cause immunosuppression reviewed by schat 2004 however tumour-induced immunosuppression is directly the consequence of a clinical disease and will not be discussed heremdv vaccine strains can also cause immunosuppression friedman et al 1992 showed that vaccination with sb-1 a serotype 2 mdv strain together with herpesvirus of turkeys hvt or cvi988 a serotype 1 vaccine strain caused a significant decrease in b lymphocyte activation and antibody production after in vitro stimulation with salmonella typhimurium or bovine serum albumin bsa inoculation respectively e coli-caused mortality was increased in vaccinated chicks independently of the mdv vaccine used when challenged at 11 or 14 days post-vaccination but only occurred in chicks vaccinated with cvi988 when these were challenged at 21 days post-vaccination islam et al 2002 also reported that hvt did not cause increased mortality when chickens were challenged with e coli at 28 days post-vaccination although between 3 and 10 days hvt caused a significant decrease in b and t lymphocyte numbers vaccination with cvi988 also precipitated lesions when chicks were challenged with c baileyi 4 days post-vaccination see section coccidia-induced immunosuppression the importance of vaccine-induced immunosuppression is not clear in commercial flocks and is far less important than the protection against md challenge the possibility that in ovo vaccination with hvt might induce tolerance was investigated by zhang and sharma 2003 inoculation between 0 and 14 days of embryonation-induced tolerance to hvt but not to bsa in contrast vaccination at 18 days of embryonation which is the approximate time for in ovo vaccination did not induce tolerance to hvtalv and rev belong to the retroviridae alv are classified as exogenous or endogenous or subgroup e viruses and the former are further divided in subgroups a b c d and j subgroups ad are associated with infection of leghorn type chickens but subgroups c and d are of little practical importance for the poultry industry alv-j was first described during the late 1980s and is mostly associated with meat-type birds alv and rev can also be divided into defective viruses and non-defective nd or helper viruses the defective viruses have often acquired cellular onc genes and cause a rapid onset of tumours and death these viruses have little importance for immunosuppression due to the rapid mortality the nd viruses can also cause tumours but the transformation occurs through activation of cellular onc genes by the viral ltrrev and exogenous alv can be transmitted congenitally or horizontally chicks hatched from congenitally-infected eggs are tolerant and unable to produce vn antibodies to the virus these chickens will be viraemic antibody negative va- and are likely to develop tumours or in the case of rev tumours andor runting and stunting horizontal transmission during or shortly after hatching can also result in tolerance this risk is enhanced in chicks when subgroup e or glycoprotein gp85 of subgroup e is expressed during embryonal development smith et al 1991 or after ibdv infection at 1 day or 6 weeks of age ibdv infection decreased the frequency of vn antibody-positive chickens and increased virus shedding and viraemia levels significantly although these effects were dependent on the genetic background of the birds in contrast infection with rev at 1 day of age or mdv at 2 weeks of age had no significant impact on alv shedding viraemia and antibody development fadly et al 1985 the induction of tolerance after congenital infection is virus specific and is not a general inability to produce antibodies against other pathogens than alv or rev for example chickens congenitally infected with a specific strain of alv-a were able to produce antibodies to other subgroup a strains meyers 1976 and influenza virus but were partly tolerant to alv-b meyers and dougherty 1971the importance of alv as an immunosuppressive virus is not clear and probably depends on the subgroup fadly et al 1982 reported that congenital infection with rav-1 a subgroup a virus did not suppress antibody responses mitogen stimulation or the phytohaemagglutinin pha skin test even in birds developing tumours rup et al 1982 also reported that subgroup a viruses did not affect mitogen responsiveness of spleen lymphocytes likewise several groups have shown that alv-j infection does not affect cell-mediated and humoral immune responses to a significant degree however most assays for immune responses and resistance to other diseases were marginally lower in alv-j infected than in control chickens stedman et al 2001 landman et al 2002 spackman et al 2003 suggesting but not proving that immunosuppression may be associated with alv-j infectionin contrast to alv-a and -j subgroup b viruses have been linked to suppression of cmi responses in ovo infection with mav-2o resulted in severe damage to lymphoid organs suppressed antibody responses and mitogenic responsiveness hirota et al 1980 rup et al 1982 and cummins and smith 1987 showed that mav-2o caused a temporary dysfunction of macrophages suppressing the responses of spleen cells to mitogens the depressed responses were present as early as 3 days pi and lasted until 21 days pi macrophage dysfunction reduced the ability to clear bacteria such as listeria monocytogenes cummins et al 1988 a second subgroup b virus avian erythroblastosis virus an acute transforming defective virus and its associated helper virus also suppressed t cell responses to mitogens but in this case the suppression was directly related to t cells and not macrophages rao et al 1990rev infections have frequently been linked to depressed humoral and cmi responses at least theoretically this could have important practical consequences because rev infection has often been linked to the use of contaminated md vaccines koyama et al 1976
jackson et al 1977 fowlpox viruses fpv can carry replication competent rev genomes which may be expressed in vivo diallo et al 1998 potentially causing immunosuppression rev infection decreased antibody responses to hvt mdv and ndv eg von blow 1977 yoshida et al 1981 in contrast fadly et al 1985 and witter et al 1979 1981 found only decreased primary antibody responses to srbc and brucella abortus and no effect on mdv antibodies although protective immunity to md was decreased and alv infection levels were increased in a commercial line embryo inoculation with the t strain but not with the cornell c strain cs strain impaired also the secondary immune responses to srbc and brucella abortus the effect of rev infection on mdv was questioned by buscaglia et al 1989 because rev infection did not impair the establishment of mdv latency or reactivation from latency these authors suggested that rev may actually reduce the pool of susceptible cells for mdv replication which would be compatible with the rev-associated atrophy of the lymphoid organs witter et al 1981 the lymphoid atrophy is strain specific and is caused by a combination of env and gag genes filardo et al 1994the effects of rev infection on cell-mediated immunity have been studied by several groups mostly using mitogen stimulation assays eg witter et al 1979 walker et al 1983 buscaglia et al 1989 the immunosuppressive effects were linked to the development of suppressor cells by rup et al 1982 1979 unfortunately there are no recent reports characterizing these cells or their mode of action the importance of this type of cell-mediated suppression needs to be further analyzed especially in view of the development of rev-specific cd8 ctl starting at 6 days pi with nd rev lillehoj et al 1988 weinstock et al 1989
dohms and metz 1991 indicated that the mechanisms of stress-induced immunosuppression were poorly understood especially in birds the common pathway for stressors involves the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal hpa axis and results in the release of glucocorticoids which are immunosuppressive for many species including chickens treatment of chickens with corticosterone or related glucocorticoids results in lymphopenia and atrophy of the lymphoid organs pruett 2001 suggested that the interactions between glucocorticoids and the immune system are more complex and depending on the duration of the stress can enhance or suppress or have no effect on immunological variables in mammalian species measuring several immunological parameters el-lethey et al 2003 compared the effects of treating chickens with corticosteroids with the effects of lack of foraging materials interestingly antibody titres against srbc and tetanus toxoid were decreased after both treatments but antibodies to human serum albumin were not influenced by either treatment in addition cmi responses such as cutaneous response to pha and delayed-type hypersensitivity dth responses to mycobacterium antigen were decreased with both treatments it is also noteworthy that the lack of foraging materials did not enhance plasma corticosterone levels significantly in conclusion stress may result in immunosuppression but the actual mechanisms remain elusivevirus replication in lymphoid cells is the major cause of cell death for ibdv ciav reovirus mdv and to some degree rev in most of these infections apoptosis is the cause of cell death although necrotic lesions have been reported for mdv witter and schat 2003 the induction of apoptosis by vp5 and vp2 of ibdv was mentioned before but it is not clear how these proteins actually interact with the apoptotic pathway liu and vakharia 2006 showed that ibdv infection in vitro activates effector caspase 3 and the initiation caspase 9 as well as nfb resulting in apoptosis late in the infective cycle these authors suggested that nfb may be activated through the accumulation of reactive oxygen species as has been shown for reovirus-induced apoptosisciav provides another example for viral induction of apoptosis noteborn 2004 vp3 or apoptin is the major viral protein inducing apoptosis although vp2 may also be a minor cause of apoptosis early after transfection of msb-1 cells with a vp3-expressing plasmid vp3 is present in the cytoplasm and nucleus as fine granular structures at the time that cells become apoptotic vp3 forms discrete nuclear structures the carboxy terminus is positively charged and based on work with deletion mutants it is suggested that the positive charge is important for the interaction with the nuclear dna noteborn 2004 suggested that this may lead to alterations in the supercoiled organization of the cellular dna causing apoptosis or alternatively that vp3 acts a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in the apoptotic processalthough mdv induces apoptosis little is known about the viral proteins and mechanisms involved in the induction of apoptosis thus far no proteins preventing or inducing apoptosis have been found in mdv although kingham et al 2001 identified in the related hvt an orf coding for a protein with significant similarity to the putative quail anti-apoptotic gene nr-13 ross 1999 speculated that the phosphorylated polypeptide pp38 was responsible for apoptosis in mdv however li et al 2006 showed that induction of pp38 expression under control of an inducible promoter did not induce apoptosis in the quail cell line qt35thus far there are few studies describing quantitative changes in cytokine production as a consequence of virus infections in chickens it is not clear how many of the changes are actually related to immunosuppression rather than changes associated with the induction of immune responses it is clear from the work by jarosinski et al 2005 using vv mdv strains that strong proinflammatory responses may cause pathology this observation has important consequences for genetic selection for md resistance because the resistant n2a line had a very strong proinflammatory response causing neurological disease with significantly higher levels of cytokine and no production in the brain than in susceptible p2a chickens additional studies on cytokine deregulation leading to immunosuppression are urgently needed using real-time rt-pcr assays and preferably elisa to examine the impact on transcription and actual production of cytokinesone of the common immunosuppressive effects described for mdv reovirus ibdv and rev infections is the generation of suppressor macrophages these cells suppress t lymphocyte blastogenesis using mitogen responses and are frequently detected between approximately 3 and 15 days pi removal of these cells restores the responsiveness of the t cells eg lee et al 1978 rup et al 1979 pertile et al 1995 interestingly this immunosuppression has been linked to no production by macrophages no is a highly versatile molecule with immunosuppressive as well as anti-tumour anti-bacterial and antiviral activity no can influence gene expression probably through the nfb pathway and at high levels can be part of proinflammatory pathology reviewed by bruckdorfer 2005as we have learnt more about the molecular interactions between viruses and their hosts it has become apparent that most if not all viruses have to employ immunoevasion mechanisms to survive even the innate immune responses of the host those viruses with a persistent lifestyle also have to deploy a spectrum of subtle refined mechanisms to survive in the face of potential acquired immune responses the factors involved in immunoevasion were most easily identified in the large dna viruses poxviruses and herpesviruses with the exception of the molluscipoxviruses which have no direct relatives in birds but which have some similarities with the avian poxviruses poxviruses cause acute infections and so their immunoevasion mechanisms only need to counter or are only capable of countering the innate immune responses and possibly delay the acquired responses the herpesviruses are able to become latent a state that requires the expression of very few genes they do however appear to be able to prevent the induction of acquired responses even though the immune system is regularly open to stimulation by episodic localized reactivation of latent virus the recognition that large complicated viruses needed to evolve specific mechanisms to counter innate immune responses arguably drove the suspicion that the smaller simple viruses often with an rna genome must have evolved equivalent mechanisms to survive the same pressures there are now several examples particularly in the paramyxoviruses of small accessory proteins of rna viruses or of multifaceted proteins playing a role in immunoevasion particularly in suppressing the type-i ifn pathway the relative dearth of reagents available for many aspects of avian biology means that detailed study of the mode of action of many of the immunoevasion mechanisms of avian viruses remains woefully behind that of mammalian viruses indeed many of the mechanisms remain presumptive but the situation should improve with the recent derivation of the draft chicken genome sequence recognition of the importance of avian viruses as emerging zoonotic agents for instance west nile virus and h5n1 avian influenza virus aiv is also likely to drive much more work in this area we will consider immunoevasion mechanisms both known and postulated of avian herpesviruses poxviruses orthomyxoviruses paramyxoviruses and reoviruses as well as reviewing prospects for future work on avian adenoviruses and coronaviruses orthomyxoviruses and paramyxovirusesstudy of the biology of mdv teaches us that it uses at least two strategies of immunoevasion though no specific mechanisms have as yet been attributed to these observations morimura et al 1997 showed that mdv infection downregulates transcription of cd8 hunt et al 2001 reported that mhc class i expression was downregulated in two cell lines mdv-infected ou2 cells and in mdv-transformed msb-1 cells treated with 5-bromo-2deoxyuridine most likely through a block in the transport of the mhc molecules to the cell surface morgan et al 2001a using microarray analysis found that mdv upregulated mhc class i but this is likely to be ifn driven a mechanism that may favour survival of mdv in its latent state is promotion of the survival of mdv-transformed tumour cells whether this is achieved directly by enhanced expression of chicken cd30 previously identified as the av37 antigen burgess et al 2004 or by the downregulation of cd28 seen in cells over-expressing cd30 burgess and davison 2002 is not clear nor is the actual viral mechanism of achieving these perturbations in cell surface marker expressionthe herpesviruses have proved a rich hunting ground for those seeking the mediators of immunoevasion hereafter referred to as immunomodulators and the avian herpesviruses such as mdv prove no exception the most interesting immunomodulator found in mdv is the il-8 mimic vil-8 identified initially by its sequence homology with host il-8 more informatively referred by its synonym eotaxin il-8 is a chemokine capable of attracting eosinophils deletion of vil-8 cortes and cardona 2004 cui et al 2005 or exon 1 of vil-8 jarosinski and schat 2007 from the rb-1b strain of mdv resulted in a lower frequency of birds with tumours and smaller less invasive tumours this suggests that vil-8 affects virus replication rather than tumorigenesis the possibility of immunomodulatory functions for vil-8 cannot be eliminated but the discovery that it can also be expressed as a fusion protein with the mdv oncoprotein meq presents the likelihood of a more complicated situation anobile et al 2006the avian poxviruses comprise one genus the avipoxvirus genus of the chordopoxvirinae subfamily the other seven genera comprise only mammalian poxviruses recent phylogenetic studies based on only a couple of conserved genes reveal that the avipoxviruses show considerable diversity equivalent to that observed between the capripoxvirus suipoxvirus yatapoxvirus and leporipoxvirus genera of the mammalian poxviruses they appear to form three major clusters or clades of related viruses one broadly related to fpv one to canarypox virus cnpv and the other comprising the psittacine poxviruses jarmin et al 2006 various phylogenetic studies have indicated that the mammalian poxvirus most closely related to the avipoxviruses is the human molluscum contagiosum virus with which avipoxviruses share many common features of molecular biology including key aspects of gene complement and organization as well as aspects of pathogenesisthe avipoxviruses have some of the largest dna viral genomes up to more than 300 kbp and encoding up to 300 genes the complete genome sequences of pathogenic and attenuated vaccine strains of fpv afonso et al 2000 laidlaw and skinner 2004 and of a pathogenic strain of cnpv have been determined tulman et al 2004 avipoxviruses cause diseases ranging in severity and mortality from relatively mild cutaneous infections eg fowlpox in chickens through the more severe diphtheritic infections also seen in some cases of fowlpox to disseminated systemic or pneumonia-like infections with high mortality such as in cnpv infections the nature of the infection is probably related to host-virus adaptation in which immunoevasion mechanisms and especially immunomodulators play an important role the less severe infections probably reflect long-standing adaptations of virus and host whereas the more severe infections probably reflect more recent introductions of viruses to novel hoststhe derivation of the first sequences brought with it the surprise that fpv encoded no obvious candidates for modulators of the type i ifn or ifn- pathways nor of the antiviral effectors which these pathways induce tulman et al 2000 2004 laidlaw and skinner 2004 this was in contrast to the mammalian poxviruses which encode dsrna binding proteins eg e3 of vaccinia virus mimics of eif2 the substrate for activated dsrna-dependent protein kinase pkr eg vaccinia virus k3 and secreted soluble binding proteins for ifn-i and ifn- however fpv and cnpv appear to encode mimics of tgf- and cnpv encodes an il-10-like protein assuming they act as agonists both of these candidate immunomodulators are predicted to downgrade the hosts inflammatory responses by stimulation of t regulator cells thereby protecting the virus-infected celltwo groups independently predicted that two different fpv genes fpv073 and fpv214 would encode candidate il-18 binding proteins tulman et al 2000 laidlaw and skinner 2004 only one of the predicted genes fpv214 encoded a protein with a conserved il-18 binding motif and interestingly a knockout of this gene in a recombinant fpv expressing ibdv vp2 resulted in an enhanced cmi response against ibdv when chickens vaccinated with the recombinant were challenged with ibdv the enhancement was comparable to but less dramatic than the enhancement observed when the vp2 recombinant fpv co-expressed chicken il18 whether fpv214 was intact or not eldaghayes et al 2008the avipoxviruses also encode multiple chemokine-like molecules eg fpv060 fpv061 fpv116 and fpv121 these appear to be secreted although as yet no biochemical activity has yet been attributed to any of them partly due to the lack of identified chicken chemokine and chemokine receptor reagents jeshtadi et al 2005 it is therefore unclear whether they will behave as agonists or antagonists and whether they will target bona fide chemokine receptors or similar receptors for other host ligands avipoxviruses also encode serpentine molecules with seven transmembrane segments resembling g-protein-coupled receptors these proteins such as fpv021 fpv027 and fpv206 are candidate chemokine receptors tulman et al 2000 whether they actually bind host chemokines or other host ligands and whether they are signaling-competent or merely decoy receptors remains to be tested when chicken chemokine reagents become available
although no gene encoding ifn--binding protein was predicted from the sequence a binding protein was identified biochemically by its interaction with recombinant tagged ifn- it proved to be the product of fpv016 puehler et al 2003 type i ifn-binding proteins are not predicted and it remains to be seen if alternative approaches will identify genes encoding such proteins the lack of obvious mechanisms for evasion of the type i ifn responses is intriguing particularly as we have evidence that fpv is resistant to recombinant chicken type i ifn at a concentration over 1000-fold higher than is required to inhibit vaccinia virus strain mva pollitt 1997 m skinner unpublished datathe avipoxvirus genomes encode many as yet unassigned proteins which might function in immunoevasion for instance one feature that distinguishes avipoxviruses from mammalian poxviruses is that the former encode several families of related proteins most notable is the family of proteins containing multiple ankyrin repeats these repeats are found in many types of host proteins and their presence normally denotes a proteinprotein interaction up to 30 proteins of this family are encoded by the avipoxviruses  we have no idea of their targets but presume they are likely to be host proteins and that some at least will probably play a role in immunoevasionviruses of the orthomyxoviridae family are enveloped viruses enclosing eight segments of negative strand rna the best known are members of the influenzavirus a genus mostly as a consequence of their role in human pandemics as is now widely appreciated since the emergence of the h5n1 strain influenza a viruses are primarily an infection of birds originating in waterfowl and readily passing to a wide range of wild and domestic birdsit was using influenza virus infection that ifn was discovered in 1957 lindenmann et al 1957 subsequently it was one of the first viruses for which a resistance mechanism to ifn activation of host protein p58 was elucidated lee et al 1990 since 1997 and the emergence of the highly pathogenic h5n1 aiv capable of causing high mortality in humans ns1 has been identified as the major viral ifn-resistance protein garcia-sastre et al 1998 hatada et al 1999 bergmann et al 2000 talon et al 2000 moreover a determinant of virulence of h5n1 d92e has been located on ns1 seo et al 2004 these studies have been performed in the context of mammalian ifn responses this being appropriate because of the clinical threat and also practical because the avian ifn response is not fully understood and there is a lack of avian reagentsperhaps because of the lack of biochemical assays and reagents one of the few direct studies of the interaction between aiv and avian ifn was performed with live virus marcus et al 2005 the study concluded that there was considerable heterogeneity within and between virus populations in their ability to induce and resist avian ifn i the heterogeneity was ascribed to the presence in the population of subpopulations that had packaged multiple genome segments it was presumed that those particles which had packaged multiple segments encoding ifn resistance proteins displayed higher resistance although this characteristic was not necessarily inherited such heterogeneity illustrates one of the potential complications of using live-recombinant influenza viruses to dissect out the role of particular molecular determinants of ifn resistancestudies with the mammalian system have revealed that ns1 is a very complex multifunctional protein it has at least three different major roles i binding dsrna to block the ifn response ii inhibiting host gene expression by preventing mrna splicing and nuclear export and iii enhancing viral mrna translation all of these roles merit further investigation in mammalian and avian hostsresistance of influenza virus influenza a virus unless otherwise specified to ifn was initially believed to be primarily due to activation of a cellular inhibitor p58ipk of pkr lee et al 1990 the mechanism of activation is still not known another mode of action involved the ubiquitin-like host protein isg15 which is one of the most predominant proteins induced by type i ifn bazzigher et al 1992 influenza b virus induces isg15 strongly but a specific region of the influenza b virus ns1 protein ns1b which includes part of its effector domain blocks the ability of isg15 to become covalently linked to its target proteins by inhibiting its ube1l-mediated activation the influenza a virus ns1 protein does not bind isg15 but inhibits its synthesis yuan and krug 2001 subsequently however ns1 was shown to play a major role in resistance to ifn specifically ns1 mutants were able to replicate only in ifn-defective cell lines garcia-sastre et al 1998 ns1 normally 230 amino acids long in influenza a virus is encoded by virus rna segment 8 the amino terminus 73 residues of ns1 which dimerizes wang and krug 1996 is capable of binding dsrna hatada and fukuda 1992 albeit at relatively low affinity yuan and krug 2001 thereby preventing activation of the dsrna-dependent protein kinase pkr lu et al 1995 ns1 also binds polyadenylated rna inhibiting nuclear export of mrnas qiu and krug 1994 and a stem bulge in u6 snrna inhibiting pre-mrna splicing in vitro and in vivo qiu et al 1995 both of these activities can down-regulate expression of cellular genes it can also prevent ifn production both by binding to irf-3 blocking its kinase-mediated activation talon et al 2000 and by blocking nfb activation wang et al 2000 although expression of ns1 alone was reported to induce apoptosis in mdck and hela cells schultz-cherry et al 2001 in the context of a viral infection of mammalian or avian cells its ifn-regulatory activity makes it anti-apoptotic zhirnov et al 2002 ns1 selectively enhances translation of viral but not cellular mrnas by binding eif4gi pabp1 and the 5 utrs of vmrnas aragon et al 2000 burgui et al 2003 it is interesting that the region of ns1 aa 81-131 binding eif4gi spans the location of the known virulence mutation aa 92 and that the region of pabp1 to which ns1 binds is not conserved evolutionarily the c terminus or effector domain downregulates formation and export of cellular mrnas by binding to the 30 kda subunit of cpsf and to pabii nemeroff et al 1998 chen and krug 1999 2000 the dsrna-binding activity of ns1 can be abrogated by mutating 2 basic residues r38 and k41 to a in mdck cells virus thus mutated donelan et al 2003 failed to inhibit ifn- and replicated to lower titres on passage a better replicating virus emerged with an s42g mutation that did not improve dsrna binding but which had intermediate virulence in micethe paramyxoviridae family of negative sense rna viruses which includes measles virus has two well-known avian members ndv member of the avulavirus genus and turkey rhinotracheitis virus or avian metapneumovirus member of the metapneumovirus genusthere has recently been considerable study of the mechanism by which paramyxoviruses modulate ifn i demonstrating the importance of the v proteins in blocking ifn induction and signalling horvath 2004 these proteins are expressed following rna editing of the mrna that encodes p protein due to the lack of reagents for the avian ifn i system this work has barely extended to avian paramyxoviruses the likely role of the ndv v protein has however been demonstrated using genetically modified viruses park et al 2003a thus mutant viruses defective for v protein expression v ndv replicate poorly in embryonated eggs and chicken embryo fibroblasts this defect can be complemented by transfection of a plasmid expressing cdna encoding the v protein into v ndv-infected cells park et al 2003b or by insertion of the influenza virus ns1 gene into the v ndv the ns1 gene allows the modified ndv to replicate better in human cells than does the parental ndv suggesting the ndv v protein is more effective in modulating the chicken ifn system than the mammalian ifn system unlike influenza ns1 which modulates both systems effectively these differences are likely to be important for the host range specificities of the two viruses ifn-sensitive ndv can also be rescued by transfection of a plasmid expressing cdna encoding ndv v protein park et al 2003b although all examined v proteins of mammalian paramyxoviruses appear to be involved in modulating the mammalian ifn response the actual detailed mechanism by which they do so varies from virus to virus elucidation of the mode of action of the ndv v protein will therefore require the availability of a full panoply of reagents specific for the avian ifn i systemit is clear that dsrna is a powerful inducer of the antiviral type i ifn system although the positive-strand rna viruses and even poxviruses generate some dsrna during their replication and transcription the dsrna viruses must be able to prevent recognition of their dsrna genome by the cell this is probably largely achieved by ensuring that the genome is never exposed outside of the capsid within the cytoplasm however the avian reoviruses in common with mammalian reoviruses appear to encode a dsrna-binding protein a that can mask dsrna from cellular dsrna binding proteins such as the dsrna-dependent protein kinase pkr thus a functions like poxvirus e3 and can actually replace e3 in vaccinia virus gonzalez-lopez et al 2003immunosuppression as a consequence of subclinical virus infections is a common occurrence with important consequences for the poultry industry thus far most studies describe the effects on immune responses without addressing the mechanistic aspects of the immunosuppression which is the consequence of the lack of reagents and appropriate techniques however during the last few years and especially since the chicken genome has been sequenced research has started to focus on the interactions between virus infection and the effects on the deregulation of the immune responses it is expected that rapid progress will be made in the next 510 years in this area of researchthere has also been a burgeoning interest in the mechanisms by which viruses evade or modulate the innate resistance mechanisms of the host in particular the ifn-i system this interest has so far had little impact on the study of avian viruses because of the lack of essential reagents the recent derivation of the draft chicken genome sequence has opened up easier access to such reagents and it is likely that the coming years will see a rapid increase in the number of studies and hence our knowledge of the intricacies of avian virus-host systems recent developments allowing manipulation of the large and complicated genome of ibv casais et al 2001 a coronavirus like the sars virus may also help identify additional viral immunomodulators and hopefully elucidate their mode of action casais et al 2005 hodgson et al 2006 such technology has been available for some time for avian adenoviruses but the divergence between mammalian and avian adenoviruses has made it difficult to predict candidate immunomodulators hopefully reannotation of the genome which identified three putative surface glycoproteins with immunoglobulin-like folds will be useful for further analysis washietl and eisenhaber 2003 that this type of study is likely to elucidate new paradigms which may even be relevant beyond the avian host is illustrated by the relative dearth in avian herpesviruses and poxviruses of obvious immunomodulators of the type observed in their mammalian cousins the emergence of west nile virus and of h5n1 aiv as threats to wild birds farmed poultry mammalian livestock and companion animals and to humans may lead to provision of resources needed to understand the complexity of the interactions of these and other viruses with their avian hosts hopefully as a consequence we will be better equipped to control and treat or possibly even eradicate such virusesregulated mrna translation is a powerful posttranscriptional means to control gene expression spatially and temporally in eukaryotes in addition to fundamental roles in cell growth and proliferation development learning memory and synaptic plasticity translational control plays a major role in host stress responses including pathogenic infection and defenses by enabling rapid responses in surroundings that abound with microbes indeed the role of translation in infection and host immunity to viruses is aptly illustrated in crop plant species where all known recessive resistance genes encode translation initiation factors truniger and aranda 2009 with respect to infection and immune defenses host translation is regulated primarily at the initiation and elongation steps figure 1

reported after infection with listeria monocytogenes chlamydia trachomatis or yersinia pseudotuberculosis all intracellular bacteria shrestha et al 2012 cells unable to phosphorylate eif2 were more susceptible to bacterial invasion illustrating a role for eif2 phosphorylation in activating nf-b and proinflammatory cytokine production in the case of yersinia the bacterial yopj protein impairs eif2 phosphorylation by an unknown mechanism hinting that bacteria and viruses both counteract host defenses that operate through eif2 shrestha et al 2012not all viruses prevent eif2 phosphorylation while many rna viruses like vesicular stomatitis virus vsv and encephalomyocarditis virus emcv are exquisitely ifn sensitive others use uncommon alternative translation initiation strategies that do not require eif2-mediated met-trnai loading insect viruses like cricket paralysis virus crpv and plautia stali intestine virus represent the most extreme examples and contain an ires that directly recruits 40s subunits without needing any initiation factors bypassing trnai loading altogether wilson et al 2000 spahn et al 2004 pfingsten et al 2010 sindbis virus however uses an alternative cellular factor distinct from eif2 eif2d to recruit met-trnai to the p site of 40s-mrna complexes in a gtp-independent manner and subsequently initiates translation of the viral subgenomic 26s mrna in the presence of phosphorylated eif2 ventoso et al 2006 dmitriev et al 2010 skabkin et al 2010 while the hepatitis c virus hcv ires also initiates translation in an eif2-independent manner elegant studies with an in vitro reconstituted system showed that eif2d is required to recruit met-trnai to 40s-mrna complexes whereas studies in cultured cells implicated a different eif2-independent factor called eif2a dmitriev et al 2010 skabkin et al 2010 kim et al 2011in some cases chronic pathogen infection engenders persistent unresolved er stress exposure of cells to lps a pamp produced by gram-negative bacteria that activates tlr4 signaling stimulates proinflammatory cytokine and antimicrobial protein production causing er stress woo et al 2009 perk which is activated by er stress and phosphorylates eif2 suppresses global translation but promotes the translation of a subset of cellular mrnas harboring upstream orfs uorfs this mechanism is based on the property of eukaryotic ribosomes to infrequently reinitiate translation and on the time they transit through the 5 utr to reacquire an active tc before encountering the next aug hinnebusch 2011 one such uorf-containing mrna encodes the transcription factor atf4 which in turn induces the transcription factors atf-3 and chop cebp homologous protein while transient chop induction has a salubrious effect on cells sustained production is harmful and causes apoptosis during er stress macrophage tlr4 signaling stimulates eif2b gef activity which enables continued synthesis of essential proteins without activating atf4 and chop woo et al 2012 similarly activation of er stress pathways may also be important for mycobacterium tuberculosis survival in macrophages seimon et al 2010 lim et al 2011 in contrast sustained eif2 phosphorylation can have severe pathogenic consequences bacterial components including lps cytolysins and intracellular-acting toxins all induce er stress zhang et al 2006 wolfson et al 2008 pillich et al 2012 misfolded prion protein prpsc accumulation during prion replication triggers the unfolded protein response upr resulting in eif2 phosphorylation and global protein synthesis suppression followed by synaptic failure and neurodegeneration in mice moreno et al 2012 importantly prevention of phosphorylated eif2 accumulation rescued synaptic failure and neuronal loss suggesting that newly described perk inhibitors may have efficacy for ameliorating prion diseases like alzheimers disease axten et al 2012in addition to the direct role in host defense played by initiation factors like eif2 that control translation production of cellular innate immune effectors is subject to translation control notably eif4f and its regulators control translation of mrnas encoding innate immune effectors through multiple independent signaling pathways that probably act synergistically to regulate different components of the host innate response one arm of this response involves mtor signaling which in addition to regulating translation in response to metabolic status and physiological stress also controls type i ifn production cao et al 2008 colina et al 2008 rna virus replication vsv influenza sindbis is markedly suppressed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts mefs lacking the mtorc1 substrates 4e-bp1 and 4e-bp2 both of which repress cap-dependent mrna translation colina et al 2008 moreover plasmacytoid dendritic cells pdcs the main type i ifn producers in response to virus infection that were derived from 4e-bp12-deficient mice produced more ifn in response to infection in addition mice lacking 4e-bp12 were resistant to a lethal vsv challenge the molecular mechanism underlying these findings is the upregulation of irf-7 interferon regulatory factor-7 a transcription factor mrna translation in 4e-bp12-deficient mefs leading to higher basal type i ifn production colina et al 2008 mtorc1 and its upstream regulator tsc12 also regulate inflammatory mediators in response to bacterial stimulation of mononuclear phagocytes by l monocytogenes as mtorc1 activation limits inflammation by blocking nf-b and enhancing stat3 weichhart et al 2008 consistent with this inhibition of mtorc1 by rapamycin protects mice from a lethal l monocytogenes infection weichhart et al 2008while the mtorc1 substrates 4e-bp12 regulate translation by controlling eif4e binding to eif4g phosphorylation of the cap-binding protein eif4e on s209 by the eif4g-associated kinase mnk1 independently controls translation of the mrna encoding the nf-b inhibitor ib mefs from knockin mice in which the wild-type eif4e gene was replaced with an s209a allele produced more type i ifn and were less susceptible to infection with a variety of rna emcv vsv sindbis and dna viruses vaccinia herpes simplex virus hsv herdy et al 2012 these dna viruses produce capped polyadenylated mrnas that rely on eif4f and promote eif4f assembly in infected cells walsh and mohr 2006 walsh et al 2008 they also stimulate eif4e phosphorylation which can be viewed as a viral strategy to antagonize nf-b activation importantly not all viruses stimulate eif4e phosphorylation in adenovirus and influenza virus-infected cells unphosphorylated eif4e accumulates feigenblum and schneider 1993 cuesta et al 2000 these viruses use other strategies to counter host innate defenses including suppressing host protein synthesis and preventing eif2 phosphorylation while eif2 phosphorylation globally inhibits translation regulated eif4e phosphorylation contributes to antiviral host defense by selectively controlling translation of ib mrna encoding a critical suppressor of the innate antiviral response herdy et al 2012ifn signaling through specific cell surface receptors also activates the aktmtor pathway and stimulates phosphorylation of downstream effectors including 4e-bp1 p70s6k and pdcd4 which control translation of ifn-induced mrnas alain et al 2010 cao et al 2008 kroczynska et al 2012 likewise activation of mek-erk mapk signaling by ifn stimulates the eif4g-associated eif4e kinase mnk1 which in turn promotes eif4e phosphorylation and has mrna-specific effects on translation joshi et al 2009 furic et al 2010type i ifn is also important for host defense against parasite infections such as leishmaniasis bogdan et al 2004 although little is known regarding how protozoan parasite infection affects host translation leishmania promotes survival within macrophage by downregulating host protein synthesis this requires a key leishmania virulence gene the surface glycoprotein gp63 joshi et al 2002 in addition to cleaving and thereby activating host phosphatases gomez et al 2009 gp63 also causes cleavage of mtor the catalytic kinase component of both mtorc1 and mtorc2 jaramillo et al 2011 this activates the 4e-bp12 translation repressors and promotes leishmania survival within macrophages importantly 4e-bp12-deficient mice are less susceptible to cutaneous leishmaniasis in part due to their constitutive type i ifn response which leads to increased inos levels and nitric oxide production thus repression of host cap-dependent mrna translation by l major probably limits the synthesis of host antimicrobial and host defense proteins thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of leishmaniasis jaramillo et al 2011 in an analogous manner inhibition of mtorc1 with rapamycin enhances the replication of poliovirus and emcv beretta et al 1996changes in ongoing host protein synthesis alert the host to dangerous microbes helping distinguish innocuous commensals from pathogens in an infection model using the nematode c elegans which normally feeds on nonpathogenic e coli ingestion of a virulent p aeruginosa strain causes a lethal intestinal infection that requires some of the same virulence factors needed in mammals tan et al 1999 the virulence of p aeruginosa is due in part to exotoxin a toxa which adp-ribosylates eef2 to inhibit host translation mcewan et al 2012 indeed host sensing of the resulting translation inhibition leads to the activation of the cellular zip-2irg-1 pathway which induces production of host defense factors including transporters and udp-glucuronosyltrasferases that remedy toxin damage by pumping it out or inactivating it estes et al 2010 importantly inhibition of translation provides the sensor that alerts the host to the pathogens presence dunbar et al 2012 this in turn activates translation of a select set of host mrnas and requires a region of the zip-2 5 utr that contains several small uorfs while uorfs are important for stress-induced responses including amino acid sensing in yeast and the upr their effects on translation typically involve eif2 phosphorylation described earlier how uorfs might stimulate translation in which eef2 is made limiting by toxa requires further study nevertheless translation is a core cellular process monitored intracellularly in real time to mount a potent innate response against a pathogensimilarly infection of drosophila with virulent strains of p entomophila a bacterial pathogen that disrupts gut homeostasis and is lethal at high does induces protective immune and repair pathways at the transcriptional level chakrabarti et al 2012 however ros accumulation in the gut activates both gcn2 which phosphorylates eif2 and amp-activated protein kinase ampk which inhibits mtorc1 via activating tsc-gap and phosphorylating the mtorc1 raptor subunit this was not observed in flies infected with an avirulent strain or nonlethal bacteria while the precise mechanism of gcn2 and ampk activation remains unresolved excessive stress pathway activation by pathogenic bacteria can severely restrict the host response to infection by impairing cellular protein synthesis importantly gcn2-depletion by rna interference rnai or chemical inhibitors of ampk allowed gut repair and limited pathogenesis in infected animals ampk hypomorphic flies were also relatively resistant to infectionfinally secretion of five effector proteins by virulent l pneumophila also decreased global host translation in macrophages fontana et al 2011 the lgt123 genes encode related glucosyltransferases that modify eef1a sidi encodes a protein that binds to eef1a and eef1 and sidl is toxic to mammalian cells and inhibits translation in vitro by an unknown mechanism the resulting suppression of ongoing host mrna translation depletes ib and activates nf-b responsive genes many of which encode innate immune effectors how these mrnas are translated in l pneumophila-infected macrophage while global translation is suppressed is not clear nevertheless global suppression of host mrna translation triggers a potent innate response and allows the host to distinguish pathogenic from nonpathogenic strainscoincidental collateral cellular damage during bacterial infection also impacts the host translation machinery pathogen-induced membrane damage resulting from shigella or salmonella epithelia cell infection depletes intracellular amino acids starving for amino acids suppresses mtorc1 activity and induces autophagy by inhibiting the rag gtpases which are regulated by amino acid availability reside on lysosomal membranes and dock mtorc1 to its activator rheb reviewed in laplante and sabatini 2012 a full-blown general amino acid starvation response follows evidenced by activation of the eif2 kinase gcn2 tattoli et al 2012 this is accompanied by an integrated stress response initiated by atf-4 mrna translation which is stimulated upon eif2 phosphorylation and in turn activates transcription of a second transcription factor atf-3 which promotes expression of stress responsive genes tattoli et al 2012 shigella itself remains camouflaged from host autophagic defenses due to secreted bacterial effectors in salmonella-infected cells mtorc1 activity is initially inhibited and amino acid starvation results due to pathogen-induced membrane damage however mtor is progressively relocalized from the surface of lysosomal membranes to salmonella cytoplasmic-containing vacuoles scvs this coincides with restoration of normal amino acid levels and reduced gcn2 activation tattoli et al 2012 thus salmonella escapes autophagy by redistributing mtorc1 to scvs and ensuring that this host kinase remains active in a related strategy to maintain activated mtorc1 the kinase and its activator rheb are redistributed to a perinuclear location in a dynein-dependent manner by human cytomegalovirus hcmv clippinger and alwine 2012inhibition of host translation is not limited to protozoa and bacteria that have their own translation machinery many viruses also impair cellular protein synthesis typically referred to as host shutoff and this plays a significant role in pathogenesis walsh et al 2012 while suppression of bulk host protein synthesis in cells infected with bacterial pathogens can activate translation of select cellular mrnas important for host defense as described earlier a more-severe inhibition of host translation resulting from the concerted action of multiple pathogen-encoded effectors can typically facilitate replication of numerous viruses walsh et al 2012 besides reducing overall host mrna complexity and allowing viral mrnas to compete for limiting initiation factors and ribosomes it severely restricts the ability of the host to translate mrnas encoding inflammatory cytokines hla class i and class ii molecules required for antigen presentation or proteins with antiviral activity including those specified by interferon-stimulated genes isgs indeed antiviral immune response gene expression is selectively elevated in cells deficient for the decapping enzyme dcp2 which impairs mrna turnover li et al 2012 the resulting sustained type i ifn production renders these cells more refractory to virus infectionwhile many viruses induce host shutoff different underlying molecular mechanisms prevail that are presumably tailored to the biological needs of each pathogen the simplest involves inactivating host translation factors by direct proteolysis as seen in picornavirus-infected cells reviewed in walsh et al 2012 by cleaving eif4g or interfering with eif4f assembly by promoting 4e-bp hypophosphorylation some picornaviruses poliovirus coxsakievirus rhinovirus suppress cap-dependent translation the major means whereby host proteins are produced the related picornavirus emcv induces nuclear accumulation of the cap-binding protein eif4e groppo et al 2011 and enterovirus 73 stimulates the production of mir141 which reduces eif4e levels and promotes the switch from cap-dependent to cap-independent mrna translation ho et al 2011 a newly identified x-orf within genomic rna segment 3 of influenza a virus generated by ribosomal frameshifting contains an endonuclease domain and is required for global host shutoff via an unknown mechanism that may involve accelerated mrna decay jagger et al 2012 in the absence of x the magnitude of host response to infection notably inflammatory apoptotic and t-lymphocyte signaling were all elevated finally the nsp1 protein encoded by sars coronavirus suppresses host type i ifn production by 1 binding to and inactivating 40s ribosome subunits and 2 promoting selective degradation of host but not viral mrnas kamitani et al 2009 huang et al 2011a common means by which complex dna viruses suppress host mrna translation is via interfering with mrna metabolism splicing and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking reviewed in walsh and mohr 2011 this can be supplemented by global increase of mrna turnover through virus-encoded decapping or endonuclease functions that effectively subvert rate-limiting steps in the host mrna quality-control pathway feng et al 2005 parrish et al 2007 2009 kronstad and glaunsinger 2012 gaglia et al 2012 while viral mrnas are not spared in this process their sheer abundance allows them to engage the translational machinery mrna turnover also allows viruses to adjust their gene expression profile as their developmental replicative cycle progresses read and frenkel 1983 parrish and moss 2006 importantly hsv mutants deficient in their ability to promote mrna turnover are attenuated and sensitive to interferon pasieka et al 2008 murphy et al 2003 finally host shutoff can impact a viruss ability to establish long-term latent infections murine gamma herpesvirus mhv68 mutants unable to induce host shutoff replicate to near-wt levels in the lung during the acute infection phase but fail to traffic to the lymph system and establish latency in splenocytes at reduced levels richner et al 2011 while more work is needed to understand how host shutoff contributes to latency establishment failure to suppress host response genes during acute infection could play a contributing roleunlike many viruses hcmv does not suppress ongoing host protein synthesis in productively infected cells stinski 1977 this renders translation of viral mrnas difficult as they must compete with host mrnas in a surprising twist cmv induces its host to make more translation factors raising the intracellular concentration of eif4e eif4g eif2 and pabp isler et al 2005 perez et al 2011 importantly the increase in pabp abundance is required to stimulate assembly of the cap-recognition complex eif4f failure to increase pabp reduces viral replication and spread virus-induced new pabp synthesis is translationally controlled by the hcmv ul38 mtorc1 activator mckinney et al 2012 thus because hcmv does not induce host cell shutoff it exploits host mrna translation to support its productive replication this comes at a potential huge liability however as indiscriminate translation of host mrnas may also interfere with viral productive growth whether or not the virus is capable of globally controlling which host mrnas engage ribosomes and are translated and how these contribute to viral replication remain to be determinedwhile viruses stimulate mrna degradation to antagonize the host mrna turnover directed by the cellular interferon-induced 25-oligoadenylate synthetase oas-rnase l system effectively limits virus replication in response to the virus dsrna pamp oas generates oligoadenylate oa chains with a distinct 25 linkage that activate the latent ribonuclease rnase l sadler and williams 2008 viral and cellular mrna cleavage inhibits protein synthesis and generates more short rnas that amplify the type i ifn response via other pattern recognition receptors rigi and mda5 malathi et al 2007 many dsrna bps that prevent pkr activation also inhibit oas in a unique strategy the murine hepatitis virus ns2 gene encodes a phosphodiesterase that cleaves 25-oa and reduces its intracellular concentration to limit the potent oas activator while the ns2-deficient virus was not pathogenic in wt mice its virulence was restored in rnase l-deficient mice illustrating the importance of host defenses that target mrna decay in coronavirus pathogenesis zhao et al 2012viral infection diverts the subcellular compartmentalization of mrnas into discrete structures called stress granules sgs these granules are dynamic aggregates detected when translation initiation is impaired and are comprised of nontranslating mrnas several cellular mrna binding proteins pabp tia-1 tiar and g3bp 40s ribosome subunits and a subset of initiation factors including eif4e eif4g eif4a eif3 and eif2 decker and parker 2012 thus sgs contain stalled aggregated translation initiation complexes and may be an intermediary repository between mrnas destined for polysomes and active translation and those slated for mrna decay in p bodies many viruses impair sg formation viral factors that promote mrna decay deplete sg rna components whereas those that suppress eif2 phosphorylation limit stalled initiation complex accumulation white and lloyd 2012 the g3bp stress granule subunit is directly cleaved by the poliovirus 2a proteinase white et al 2007 piotrowska et al 2010 other viruses however stimulate sg assembly white and lloyd 2012 while these findings are largely descriptive and more work is required to understand sg function changes to these dynamic structures may represent another strategy whereby viruses manipulate cytoplasmic mrna organization to control host translation indeed cycles of sg assemblydisassembly have been observed in hcv-infected cells ruggieri et al 2012 manipulation of sg dynamics by opposing actions of pkr and protein phosphatase 1 acting on eif2 may prevent sustained translational repression and be a conserved response to viral infection that can be exploited for persistence ruggieri et al 2012 bacterial infection can likewise induce sg formation as the amino acid depletion gcn2 activation and eif2 phosphorylation triggered by shigella or salmonella results in tia-1-containing cytoplasmic sgs tattoli et al 2012the translational machinery is the major source of peptide antigens recognized as self or nonself by producing proteins that are processed into peptides and presented for adaptive immune surveillance in association with mhc class i on the host cell surface not only are these peptides encoded by conventional orfs that begin with methionine they are also encoded by alternate reading frames some of which do not begin with a canonical aug start codon or lie in 5 or 3 utrs distinct from the major protein encoding orf starck and shastri 2011 indeed introduction of a frameshift mutation after codon 4 of an influenza virus np transgene prevents synthesis of the full-length protein antigen without substantial effects on antigen presentation to ctls fetten et al 1991 peptides for mhc class i antigen presentation derived from alternative orfs have been termed defective ribosomal products or drips as they are distinct from peptides resulting from normal turnover of full-length proteins yewdell 2011 drips are rapidly synthesized and have short half-lives helping to explain the swiftness with which peptides derived from stable viral proteins can be presented by cell surface mhc molecules how drips are produced is only beginning to be understood importantly translation initiation at alternate orfs that commence with cug does not require eif2 and instead requires one of the trnaleu isoforms capable of initiating protein synthesis at cug starck et al 2012 while most antigenic peptides are derived from the standard reading frame of proteins some antigenic peptide production can take place from orfs commencing with cug when eif2 is inactivated in conclusion alternative orfs in mrnas and the mode with which their translation is controlled contribute to regulate the adaptive immune responsethe host translational machinery also provides opportunities for microbes to avoid adaptive immune surveillance herpesviruses use a strategy termed latency to persist indefinitely in specialized host cell types the neurotrophic alpha herpesvirus hsv avoids producing proteins during latency wilson and mohr 2012 instead a non-protein-coding latency-associated transcript lat accumulates and is processed into micrornas micrornas mirs act posttranscriptionally either by inhibiting translation or promoting mrna decay to repress gene expression by binding cognate sites typically located within 3 utrs of mrna targets fabian and sonenberg 2012 presumably these virus-encoded mirs act as buffers preventing translation of lytic mrnas that may spontaneously accumulate below a critical threshold in latently infected neurons skalsky and cullen 2010 while the virus influences ganglia gene expression in latently infected mice kramer et al 2003 more work is needed to determine how virus-encoded mirs affect neuronal mrna translation studies on related beta and gamma herpesviruses however have shown that virus-encoded mirs can indeed influence host gene expression gottwein et al 2011 riley et al 2012 skalsky et al 2012 jurak et al 2012sustained pi3k-akt signaling is required to maintain the hsv latent state in a neuron cell culture model of latency hinting at virus-neuron interactions fundamental to latency camarena et al 2010 persistent mtorc1 activation is required to inactivate the 4e-bp translation repressor and maintain latency while environmental cues like hypoxia which suppresses protein synthesis by inhibiting mtorc1 activation trigger reactivation kobayashi et al 2012 this suggests that latency in neurons requires active signaling that controls cap-dependent mrna translation having these signals integrated through mtorc1 allows the virus to change its lifecycle in response to fundamental indicators of cell homeostasis including neurotrophic factor support energy levels amino acid sufficiency and oxygen levels in a neuron cell-autonomous manner while it clearly involves changes to ongoing host mrna translation it differs from the global inhibition in response to pseudomonas exotoxin as discussed above and highlights the more subtle changes resulting from altering the population of mrnas that are translated in a cap-dependent manner on polyribosomes remarkably transient changes in mtor signaling can be sensed locally in axons and transmitted to latent viral genomes resident in nuclei offering a glimpse of how axons receive signals from the periphery and transmit them long distances to latent viral genomes in distant ganglia kobayashi et al 2012unlike alpha herpesviruses that colonize nondividing cells the gamma herpesviruses epstein-barr virus ebv and kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus kshv establish life-long latency in b cells and encode functions to ensure persistence of their genomes within a dividing cell compartment speck and ganem 2010 ebv ebna1 is important in maintaining the viral minichromosome during latency in b cells and is a prime target for ctl recognition to counter the hosts capacity to sample ebna1-derived antigens and antigens encoded by orfs other than the primary orf on a given mrna the ebna1 glyala repeat gar region suppresses translation in cis in this manner gar reduces the amount of not only the full-length antigen but also any translation products derived from that mrna and thereby decreases their likelihood of being presented yin et al 2003 an unstable mrna secondary structure resulting from a purine bias within the ebna1 mrna gar-coding sequences is thought to account for the reduced translational efficiency illustrating how viral mrna structure impacts immune surveillance tellam et al 2008 the kshv lana protein plays a similar role in viral episome maintenance and also contains a segment that inhibits translation in cis however lanas ability to inhibit translation in cis can be separated from its impact on antigen presentation kwun et al 2011 further work is required to resolve these questionsmany cellular mrnas that control innate inflammatory responses and host defenses are subject to mir regulation enabling cells to balance their response to pathogenic microbes with an additional layer of control oconnell et al 2012 infection with viruses bacteria and protozoa perturb the host mir-ome in some cases infection with pathogenic bacteria potentiates innate responses as l monocytogenes and m bovis bacillus calmette-gurin bcg decrease levels of mir29 which represses ifn mrna expression in nk cd4 and cd8 t cells ma et al 2011 alternatively m leprae-infected monocytes were found to upregulate hsa-mir-21 allowing the pathogen to inhibit antimicrobial peptide expression liu et al 2012 in response to the invasive intracellular bacteria salmonella downregulation of the let-7 mir family derepresses the production of il-10 which attenuates proinflammatory cytokines and prevents excessive immune activation schulte et al 2011 likewise pamps sensed by the host can differentially regulate mir expression growth of a pseudomonas syringae mutant defective in type iii secretion which elicits a pamp-triggered response but cannot suppress it is partially restored in arabidopsis mutants deficient in sirna or mir accumulation navarro et al 2008 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs bacterial lps induces mir21 expression which in turn decreases the abundance of pdcd4 an inhibitor of eif4a figure 2 by depleting pdcd4 il-10 mrna translation is stimulated limiting excessive immune activation sheedy et al 2010 even more striking tlr-4-dependent induction of mir-146a which dampens levels of the essential tlr-signaling molecule irak1 is triggered in neonates by pamps when the intestinal mucosa transitions from a sterile protected site to an environmentally exposed permanently colonized surface chassin et al 2010 this facilitates protective innate immune tolerance in the neonate intestine to counter rnai-mediated host defenses the turnip crinkle virus tcv capsid the p38 protein physically interacts with arabidopsis ago1 to suppress rna silencing azevedo et al 2010 it recognizes ago1 by mimicking host gw repeat proteins which bind ago and promote gene silencing p38 mutant viruses abrogate tcv virulence which is partially restored in arabidopsis ago1 hypomorphic strains similarly abrogation of mir biogenesis by gut-specific depletion of the mir processing component dicer rendered mice more susceptible to infection with helminthes indicating a role of mirs in intestinal homeostasis and mucosal immunity biton et al 2011 apicomplexan parasites including p falciparum p vivax c parvum and t gondii also change the host mir-ome hakimi and cannella 2011 finally while the poxvirus-encoded poly a polymerase polyadenylates the 3 end of cellular mirs and stimulates their degradation endogenous sirnas and mirs modified with a terminal 2o-methyl group persisted consistent with a role for this rna modification in host defense backes et al 2012besides influencing the cellular mir-ome some viruses encode mirs that target both virus and host genes hcmv establishes latency in monocyte-macrophage precursors when it initiates lytic replication hcmv subverts antigen presentation on the cell surface via multiple strategies while most involve manipulating mhc class i peptide loading one in particular relies on mir regulation of erap1 a host amino peptidase required for mhc class i-presented peptide maturation kim et al 2011 by targeting erap1 with the virus mir us4-1 hcmv suppresses the cd8 t cell response in a distinctive manner involving translational regulation that does not involve antigenic protein production and instead relies on a small non-protein-coding mir several herpesviruses hcmv ebv and kshv also produce mirs that repress expression of micb a stress-induced host cell ligand of the nk cell activating receptor nkg2d nk ligand to escape nk cell recognition and killing stern-ginossar et al 2007 nachmani et al 2009 polyomaviruses jc and bk encode a mir that targets ulbp3 a different stress-induced nkg2d ligand for similar purposes bauman et al 2011 viral infection can likewise suppress cellular mir biogenesis as ad va rna impairs dicer function reviewed in skalsky and cullen 2010 using a more-specific method mcmv and herpesvirus saimiri hvs downregulate the host antiviral mir27 via a virus-encoded transcript whereas mcmv utilizes a viral mrna m169 that binds the host mir and promotes its degradation libri et al 2012 hvs relies on a small viral noncoding rna cazalla et al 2010while little is known regarding how fungal infection influences host translation parallels have been drawn between intracellular fungi that escape phagosomes and bacteria bliska and casadevall 2009 exposure of a murine macrophpage cell line to c albicans decreased abundance of a host eif3 subunit and the appearance of an acidic modified form of eef2 consistent with eef2 phosphorylation martnez-solano et al 2006 transcriptional profiling of drosophila cells after candida infection revealed that the fly 4e-bp transcript was among those upregulated and 4e-bp-deficient flies were approximately 50 less resistant to infection than controls levitin et al 2007 furthermore rnai screens for host factors important for c neoformans intracellular growth in drosophila cells identified a potential role for the mtorc1 regulators rheb and tsc together with host autophagy genes qin et al 2011 finally commensal fungi can be detected via the c-type lectin receptor dectin-1 a host pattern recognition receptor important for inducing innate immune responses to fungi and dectin-1-deficient mice are more susceptible to colitis iliev et al 2012 perhaps pathogenic fungi may like bacteria be sensed by their hosts as a consequence of their ability to suppress ongoing host translation further investigation and experimental validation in human cells is required to test this hypothesisinfection with a diverse assortment of pathogenic microbes impacts ongoing protein synthesis in the host this is not limited to viruses which are known to commandeer the host protein synthesis machinery but holds true for many bacteria protozoa and perhaps fungi indeed innate defense functions performed by host proteins allow host organisms to deftly respond to microbial infection changes in metabolic status and environmental or physiologic stress while control of which mrnas and orfs are translated shapes innate and adaptive immune response the underlying basis for these distinctions remains unknown although it probably relies on recognition of mrna structural and sequence determinants interference with host mrna translation likewise provides a powerful indicator of host cell distress by integrating signals from intracellular and extracellular cues through key regulatory circuits the host translation machinery can alter initiation and elongation rates on select mrnas and discrete mrna subpopulations or suppress global translation through modification of discrete factors thus eif2 and its inducible regulatory kinases one of which is an isg function as innate immune sentinels suppressing global translation in infected cells in response to different metabolic physiologic or environmental stresses while concomitantly activating translation of host defense mrnas that contain uorfs translation initiation and elongation are controlled for mrnas that encode innate immune effectors by tsc and mtorc1 which integrate fundamental indicators of cell homeostasis including the availability of energy nutrients oxygen and growthtrophic factors and coordinate translational output in response to map kinase signaling eif4e phosphorylation by mnk prevents induction of nf-b-responsive genes by stimulating translation of ib mrna indeed the extent to which translational control circuits are interwoven into vital cell signaling pathway that monitor fundamental indicators of metabolic and environmental stress makes them ideal sensors to detect pathogen-induced changes or collateral damage in addition changes to ongoing host mrna translation can be harnessed to distinguish harmful organisms from commensals and play a role in determining how persistent infections are maintained through the life of an organism importantly cellular responses to stimulate translation of host defense-related mrnas are balanced by microbial strategies designed to blunt them these include global mechanisms to enhance host mrna turnover and alter mrnp compartmentalization more selective strategies also operate to subvert signaling to the translational machinery and suppress translation of host defense-related mrnas limit microbial antigen production in persistently infected cells or selectively silence discrete transcripts via mirs the impact of microbe-induced changes to ongoing host protein synthesis on pathogenesis and the diversity of microbial countermeasures that suppress translation of host defense-related mrnas illustrates how host mrna translation helps effectively shape infection and immunityrespiratory viruses represent an enormous worldwide health burden they are a common cause of respiratory tract infections which are the third leading cause of death worldwide and the most deadly communicable diseases current options to prevent or clear respiratory virus infections are limited and have notable shortcomings for example the effectiveness of vaccination against seasonal influenza a virus iav usually hovers around 50601 and there is often a 6month delay between strain identification and vaccine production2 there is currently no vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus rsv few antiviral drugs are presently approved for treating respiratory virus infections and most are iav neuraminidase inhibitors3 for individuals suffering from the chronic airway diseases asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd respiratory virus infections can cause debilitating and potentially deadly exacerbations in addition to acute disease frequent and severe respiratory viral infections in youth have been implicated in detrimental airway remodeling and in the development of chronic diseases asthma and copd in adulthood4 thus there is a current unmet need to develop new antivirals to treat respiratory virus infectionsthe majority of respiratory viruses are rna viruses5 which initially infect epithelial cells of nasal passages and airways these viruses primarily infect with a minimal infectious dose then utilize host cell machinery to replicate and produce new virions that then infect other cells eventually causing epithelial cell death and airway remodeling efficient amplification including virus release and infection of new cells is obligatory for virus survival and disease pathogenesis to subvert this process host cells encode several interferon ifninducible antiviral factors that constitute a potent battery of innate immune defense these antiviral factors interfere with various steps in the viral replication pathway to aid in clearance6 a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of how host antiviral factors function could potentially be exploited to develop new treatments to limit disease caused by respiratory virusesthis essay will focus on the function of one particularly prolific host antiviral factor called bone marrow stromal antigen 2 bst2 also known as tetherin or cd317 we will examine whether bst2 could be targeted to inhibit the replication of respiratory viruses and aid in their clearance bst2 has demonstrated broadspectrum antiviral activity against numerous enveloped viruses7 and in response most viruses have evolved functions to antagonize bst2 bst2 has not been shown to restrict nonenveloped viruses thus our discussion will focus on common enveloped respiratory viruses that cause disease in humans5 8 eg iav rsv parainfluenza virus piv metapneumovirus mpv coronaviruses cov and mouse models sendai virus sev but we will not discuss common nonenveloped respiratory viruses eg rhinovirus rv enterovirus 68 ev68 we will review what is known regarding the regulation of bst2 expression the structure and function of bst2 the mechanism of bst2 antiviral function modes of bst2 antagonism by viral proteins bst2mediated and modulated signaling and other immunological and cellular functions of bst2 paying special attention to the settings of airway epithelial cells and respiratory virusesin order to most optimally inhibit respiratory virus replication bst2 would need to be expressed in epithelial cells of the airway and mucosal surfaces a number of signaling pathways have been demonstrated to induce expression of bst2 the promoter region contains consensus sites for the transcription factors stat3 irf1 and isgf19 accordingly interferons ifns from all three classes ie ifn    3 and  induce the expression of bst2 in numerous cell types10 11 in nave mice bst2 expression appears to be limited to plasmacytoid dendritic cells but is upregulated on most cell types by interferons that are induced and secreted in response to viral infection10 however upregulation is not limited to ifn signaling as a number of ifnindependent stimulants have also been reported for example il27 is a potent inducer12 and tlr3 and tlr8 stimulation induce bst2 expression in the absence of ifn13 in contrast despite the apparent presence of an irf1 binding site in the bst2 promoter region tnf has little impact on bst2 expression levels10 14 expression is downmodulated by tgf15
because the response to ifni is generally conserved in all cells16 bst2 expression should increase in the airway as part of the antiviral response however there have been differing observations as to whether or not bst2 expression is induced in airway epithelial cells in cultured primary mouse airway epithelial cells and mouse airway cell lines la4 bst2 expression is induced by ifn but only modestly increases 24 h after iav infection17 in contrast we have observed increased bst2 expression in vivo in mouse airway epithelial cells following both sev and iav infection unpublished data and bst2 expression is upregulated in human airway cell lines a549 ncih196 ncih358 following viral infection18 19 20 and ifni production19 21 overall these observations suggest bst2 is expressed in airway and mucosal epithelia in response to viral infectionthe antiviral function of bst2 was first reported in 2008 when it was demonstrated that it inhibited the release of hiv1 viral particles that were deficient in the viral membrane protein vpu22 bst2 inhibits viral replication by preventing release of viral progeny from infected cells leading to their subsequent internalization and degradation23 since then bst2 has been shown to potently inhibit several enveloped viruses that bud from the plasma membrane7 due to this pressure most viruses have developed antagonist strategies to block bst2 function because of this the bst2 viral tethering function has typically been demonstrated in assays using mutant viruses deficient in bst2antagonizing proteins such as vpudeficient hiv1 or viruslike particles vlps these types of studies have shown that bst2 restricts the budding of vlps or mutant viruses from the following families retroviruses alpha beta delta lenti and spuma24 25 arenaviruses lassa and machupo26 27 herpesviruses kshv28 filoviruses ebola and marburg24 27 rhabdoviruses vesicular stomatitis29 paramyxoviruses nipah26 and flaviviruses hepatitis c30 bst2 has been shown to effectively inhibit budding of some intact infectious viruses including lassa and machupo arenaviruses26 and vesicular stomatitis rhabdovirus29 but does not restrict other infectious viruses such as ebola marburg cowpox or rift valley fever bunyavirus26
these observations demonstrate that bst2 inhibits the budding of a broad spectrum of enveloped viruses and suggest that it might inhibit release of enveloped respiratory viruses from infected epithelial cells more recent studies have investigated the potential of bst2 to restrict budding of respiratory viruses table 1 for iav results appear to be dependent on virus strain and cell type used some groups have reported that bst2 does not restrict iav release17 19 31 while others report that bst2 does inhibit release of iav vlps18 32 33 and partially restricts infectious virus20 21 34 these observations appear to be dependent on iavencoded bst2 antagonists the identity and effectiveness of which may be strain dependent discussed in section 6 bst2 also partially restricts the human pathogens piv235 hcov229e36 and sars37 and this restriction is enhanced by deletion of viral antagonists it also restricts animal model respiratory virus sev38 but interestingly does not seem to inhibit prrsv39 thus bst2 appears to restrict a number of enveloped respiratory viruses in vitro and this ability is hindered by encoded viral antagonists discussed in section 6the structural organization of bst2 is highly unique among mammalian proteins it is a type ii transmembrane protein consisting of a short nterminal cytoplasmic tail ct a single transmembrane region tm an ectodomain ed and a second membrane anchor a cterminal glycosylphosphotidylinositol gpi figure 1a sequence analysis suggests this dualanchor topology is only found in one other protein in the human genome a special form of the prion protein40 these structural features are important for the antiviral function of bst2 deletion of either one of the membrane anchors tm or gpi ablates the ability of bst2 to restrict viral budding22 41 42 in addition to being a membrane anchor required for viral tethering the gpianchor is required for cellular trafficking as bst2 is sequestered in the er of cells that have defects in the gpibiosynthesis pathway42 the gpianchor enriches bst2 to lipid rafts to enhance its antiviral activity since this is a preferred site of budding for many enveloped viruses40 mature bst2 recycles between the plasma membrane endosomes and transgolgi network tgn40 43 despite localization to lipid rafts bst2 is internalized via clathrindependent endocytosis mediated by an evolutionarily conserved yxy motif in the ct which recruits the adaptor ap243
the bst2 ectodomain has numerous structural features required for optimal antiviral function figure 1a the ectodomain spans the two membrane anchors forming a coiledcoil parallel dimer containing three interdimer disulfides and resembles a molecular rope spanning roughly 150170 44 45 46 the ectodomain coiledcoil is unique in that it contains conserved patterns of residues at the dimer interface that destabilize the packing causing the ectodomain to act less like a rigid rod and more like a flexible rope in solution which likely aids its ability to adjust to the dynamics of virus assembly at the plasma membrane44 45 47 the ectodomain also contains two conserved nlinked glycosylation sites figure 1a which appear to be required for proper vesicular transport and possibly folding of bst2 but are not required for antiviral activity42 although isolated bst2 ectodomains form parallel homodimers the transmembrane regions of bst2 also form parallel dimers in lipid environments and likely aid the formation of the parallel dimer48 collectively these structural features serve to inhibit viral budding from the plasma membranethe bulk of evidence in the literature suggests that bst2 restricts enveloped virus release by directly bridging the host and viral membranes through simultaneous inclusion of the two opposing membrane anchors figure 1b42 49 cryoem and cryoet studies have shown budding viruses and vlps anchored to cells by short tethers containing bst222 47 49 50 two orientations for viral tethering are possible figure 1b however insertion of the gpianchor into the viral membrane is favored three to fivefold51 this orientation would optimize the ability of the nterminal ct to interact with the cytoskeleton which likely aids in bst2 clustering at the host membrane bst2 accumulates at hiv budding sites where it clusters at around four to seven molecules per site52 mutations to the bst2 ectodomain prevent clustering and render it unable to restrict the release of vlps53 this orientation and clustering also likely enhances the ability of bst2 to form signaling complexes which will be discussed in section 71crystallographic and cryoem studies suggest a second potential mechanism for bst2mediated inhibition of viral budding analysis of the crystal structure of mouse bst2 revealed a dimerof dimers assembly that resembled those formed by bar domains figure 1c44 bar domains are helical bundles that dimerize to form crescentshaped structures that can bind to and stabilize curved membranes that form during membrane trafficking and budding events54 clustering bst2 could form such assemblies which could be stabilized on the cytosolic side by the bardomain protein rich2 which binds bst2 ct using a cterminal domain55 such assemblies could stabilize tubulating membranes and prevent viral scission figure 1d interestingly cryoem studies of hivinfected cells have observed some tethers that span at least 500  much longer than a single bst2 ectodomain47 hence lending further support to this potential assemblybst2 is highly efficient at trapping a wide variety of enveloped viruses consequently most viruses have developed countermeasures to evade bst2 antiviral function these viral antagonists impair bst2 by a number of different mechanisms including removal from or prevention of trafficking to the cell surface and targeting of bst2 for proteosomal degradation7 56 for example hiv1 encodes vpu a small membrane protein that interacts with bst2 via transmembrane regions41 57 58 vpu then facilitates recruitment of ubiquitin ligases and ap1 to enable targeting of bst2 for endolysosomal degradation59 60 kshv uses a similar strategy encoding the protein k5 that is itself an e3 ring ubiquitin ligase that recognizes the bst2 ct thus enabling ubiquitination of bst2 and subsequent degradation28 61 siv nef protein directs removal from the cell surface by binding the bst2 ct and linking it to the endocytic adaptor ap2 to remove bst2 from the plasma membrane62 hiv2 env protein interacts with the bst2 ectodomain and likewise facilitates bst2 internalization by again via ap2 via a gyxx internalization motif in the hiv2 env cytoplasmic tail63 ebola envelope glycoprotein gp also interacts with the bst2 ectodomain however this interaction appears to be independent of protein sequence also requires the gp transmembrane domain and does not lead to significant surface removal of bst264 thus viruses have developed a myriad of methods to inhibit bst2 antiviral function and are facilitated by interactions involving various structural features of the proteinthe theme of viruses encoding bst2 antagonists extends to respiratory viruses figure 2 as mentioned earlier iav release appears to be partially restricted by bst2 in a straindependent manner20 these differences appear to be mostly due to variations in the sequence of the encoded neuraminidase20 21 32 33 neuraminidase has been the most widely reported iavencoded bst2 antagonist but little known about its mechanism of action despite this lack of information differences of a single amino acid have been reported to switch a restricted iav vlp to one not inhibited by bst218 interactions appear to be mediated between the ectodomains of the two proteins however this interaction does not appear to promote surface removal of bst2 a more recent study suggests the iav m2 channel protein is a bst2 antagonist34 in contrast to neuraminidase this interaction promotes surface removal of bst2 ending in proteasomal degradation in addition iav encodes the general ifni antagonist ns1 which can broadly inhibit expression of isgs ns1 may partially inhibit bst2 via this broadly targeted strategy31 32 piv2 encodes the v protein which targets bst2 for surface removal but does not appear to catalyze proteasomal destruction of bst235 piv2v may also prevent viralmediated induction of bst265 sarscov encodes orf7a which binds bst2 via interaction of their ectodomains37 this interaction appears to inhibit maturation of bst2 glycosylation which prevents surface expression infection of cells with hcov229e promotes surface removal of bst2 but the mechanism and viral protein involved are unknown36 sev infection promotes proteasomal degradation of bst2 this degradation appears to be mediated by the fusion f and hemagluttaninneuraminidase hn proteins in concert although further mechanistic details are unknown38 in summary respiratory viruses have also evolved countermeasures to inhibit bst2 viral tethering demonstrating evolutionary pressure to evade this potent viral restriction factorbst2 is known to have roles in inflammatory signaling in addition to its function as a viral tethering protein bst2 also acts as an innate immune viral sensor that signals and triggers activation of nfb to elicit production of inflammatory cytokines that alert neighboring cells extending its protection abilities to adjacent cells by inducing production of antiviral proteins clustering of bst2 captured in budding virions initiates assembly of a signaling pathway that causes nfb activation66 67 this clustering creates the formation of a specialized signaling motif called a hemitam including residues y6 and y8 in the bst2 ct which recruit srcfamily kinases and become phosphorylated figure 3 the phosphorylation specifically recruits the kinase syk which then assembles a signaling complex composed of adaptors traf2 and traf6 as well as tak1 and culminates in downstream activation of nfb68 bst2 is coupled to the actin cytoskeleton via interaction with the bar and rhogap containing protein rich2 which binds the bst2 ct mutations that inhibit this interaction prevent or reduce phosphorylation of bst2 and subsequent downstream nfb activation68 69 thus it appears that preconcentration of bst2 on the cell surface is required for efficient clustering by viruses this signaling can induce expression of inflammatory and antiviral signaling cytokines ifn cxcl10 and il668 virusencoded bst2 antagonists have varying effects on bst2mediated activation of nfb which appears to be linked to the ability to direct degradation of bst2 hiv1 vpu which targets bst2 for surface removal and destruction also prevents bst2mediated activation of nfb67 70 however ebola gp and hiv2 env which engage bst2 to inhibit its viral tethering ability but do not direct its degradation do not inhibit this signaling ability of bst271 the impact of antagonists encoded by respiratory viruses on bst2mediated nfb activation has not been investigatedbst2 has also been implicated in inhibitory signaling in plasmacytoid dendritic cells pdcs thereby dampening inflammatory signaling in this capacity it serves as a ligand for the inhibitory receptor ilt7 which is exclusively expressed on pdcs figure 3 circulating pdcs produce ifni in response to virusderived tlr79 stimulation which then initiates the antiviral state in infected and surrounding cells including upregulation of bst2 expression the bst2 expressed on infected and neighboring cells can then engage ilt7 on the surface of pdcs which signals through fcri to shut down production of ifni in a negativefeedback manner to prevent overstimulation72 hiv1 vpu appears to exploit this mechanism by specifically targeting bst2 clustered to viral budding sites for destruction and enriching distribution of bst2 outside of the viral budding site thus enhancing the probability of bst2ilt7 interaction to suppress pdc antiviral response73 this interaction has also been suggested to occur in cis between ilt7 and bst2 both expressed on the surface of pdcs possibly to prevent premature maturation14
bst2 can also suppress virusinduced interferon production by altering innate immune signaling it was recently reported that bst2 can direct the degradation of the rigilike receptor mavs to dampen ifni production74 in this scenario bst2 engages mavs and recruits the ubiquitin e3 ligase march8 which directs k27linked polyub chains to k7 of mavs this polyubiquitination then engages ndp52 leading to autophagic degradation figure 3 this function highlights the need for tight regulation of ifni production to initiate proper antiviral immune response while avoiding development of autoimmune disordersin addition to these roles in signaling pathways bst2 may also play a role in mediating intercellular signaling by tethering exosomes75 exosomes are small secreted extracellular vesicles that carry cargo such as growth factor cytokines and nutrients between cells bst2 can trap exosomes on the surface of parent cells thereby controlling whether exosomes are involved in short or longrange communication by cellsnearly all enveloped viruses investigated to date encode an antagonist that at least partially blocks bst2 ability to prevent virus release in theory inhibiting these antagonists most specifically by disrupting interaction with bst2 would allow bst2 to exert its function at the cell surface and trap virion release this concept has been actualized at least experimentally for hiv1 bst2 antiviral function against hiv1 and how it is antagonized by vpu has been investigated comprehensively this understanding has allowed the design of unique membranetargeted peptides76 as well as highthroughput assays which have identified compounds that prevent vpumediated surface downregulation of bst277 these small molecules inhibit hiv1 release and suppress replication78 similar pursuits could be engaged for respiratory viruses however a similar level of comprehensive knowledge would need to be obtainedthe identity of bst2 antagonists encoded by various respiratory viruses as well as their mechanism of action is poorly understood the action of bst2 against some established eg rsv and emerging respiratory pathogens eg metapneumovirus bocavirus has not been investigated additionally it is unknown whether bst2 exerts inhibitory effects toward any nonenveloped viruses within this class rhinovirus and enterovirus68 are prominent respiratory pathogens causing severe acute disease and triggering asthma exacerbations for others that have been studied table 1 few details are known about how the putative antagonists engage bst2 or their mechanism of action in fact the only virus for which structural details of antagonist action have been elucidated is hiv1 vpu58 59 detailed mechanistic and structural studies of bst2 antagonist action and their interactions with bst2 are required to design inhibitors or develop screens to discover them in addition mechanistic studies should be carried out in airway epithelial cell lines and verified in primary airway epithelial cells and animal models treatments would be virusspecific as current knowledge indicates that each respiratory virus employs a unique antagonist mechanismit is now understood that bst2 plays a role in innate immune and downstream inflammatory signaling viral clustering of bst2 initiates a signaling cascade that results in nfb activation and production of cytokines involved in inflammatory and antiviral responses figure 3 additionally bst2 serves as a ligand for ilt7 that dampens production of antiviral ifni third bst2 can dampen innate immune signaling through mavs inhibition of some of these aspects may be needed to create the optimal tuning of antiviral versus antiinflammatory response in the airwayalthough some mechanistic details are known for each of the three pathways detailed structural and biophysical information regarding bst2 interactions in these events have not been reported eg bst2 engagement of rich2 which is central to nfb activation bst2 binding ilt7 to signal for downregulation of ifn production such details are required to develop methods to block or enhance these interactions in addition it is currently unknown whether bst2 antagonists encoded by respiratory viruses alter any of these signaling pathwaysbst2 needs to be on the cell surface in order to restrict virus release and suppress further infection its expression is mostly controlled by interferon signaling however induction of bst2 has also been reported in the absence of ifn13 this suggests that multiple transcription factors maybe be able to regulate bst2 expression and implies that pharmacological induction independent of the pleiotropic effects of ifn is likely possiblelongterm bst2 overexpression has been implicated in the growth and progression of some cancers79 so methods to enhance bst2 surface expression should be approached with caution however it is unclear whether enhanced surface expression over a short term would be a significant riskin this essay we present the first comprehensive review of bst2 antiviral function and signaling with respect to respiratory viruses emerging evidence indicates that bst2 can restrict budding and replication of important respiratory viruses which is counteracted by encoded viral antagonists detailed structural biophysical and cellular immunologic studies utilizing airway cells are now needed to develop a mechanistic understanding of how respiratory viruses antagonize bst2 antiviral function and potentially immunologic signaling this understanding could lead to the development of novel therapies that exploit bst2 function to enhance recovery from respiratory virus infectionsbst2 bone marrow stromal antigen 2 copd chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cryoem cryoelectron microscopy

syndrome coronavirus sev sendai virus vlp viruslike particlethe authors declare no conflict of interestporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv is the most severe enemy of porcine health and wellbeing the highly mutable enveloped rna virus was discovered nearly 30 years ago but while extensive research has been carried out and many vaccines have been developed there is still no reproducible immunological intervention that develops a broadly protective immune response against virulent prrsv prrs disease was first described on farms in north carolina in the usa at the end of the 1980s outbreaks were marked by reproductive losses post-weaning pneumonia and increased mortality in growing pigs initial efforts to identify an etiological agent responsible for the new disease syndrome were unsuccessful leading to the disease being temporarily designated mystery swine disease msd in north america kochs postulates for msd were fulfilled in 1991 with a previously unidentified rna virus discovered in europe named lelystad virus 12 the discovery was quickly followed by isolation of the virus initially referred to as swine infertility and respiratory syndrome virus or sirs virus in north america 3 the name prrsv was introduced in 1992 and encompasses prrsv-1 genotypes first isolated in europe and prrsv-2 genotypes first isolated in north america 45 today both virus types are globally distributed with prrsv-1 viruses predominantly in europe and prrsv-2 viruses largely in north america asia and south america 6 recent discovery of multiple arteriviral nucleotide sequences in nonhuman primates has led to a reclassification of prrsv as two distinct viruses prrsv-1 and prrsv-2 7 here we use the generic prrsv to refer broadly to both viruses when evidence indicates that are equivalent and the specific prrsv-1 and prrsv-2 is used when a distinction is desired the reasoning is based on the many similarities of the two viruses in fine details of genome structure and organization transcriptional strategy host preference clinical signs of disease and anti-viral immunity 7891011 in particular chimeric prrsv consisting of prrsv-1 open reading frames orfs 25 in a background of prrsv-2 are fully viable showing as well that the molecular signals for transcription and translation are preserved 12prrsv has a positive-sense single-stranded rna genome of approximately 15 kb designated to the arteriviridae family the virus encodes at least 10 functional orfs orf1a and 1b encode two large polyproteins which are cleaved into 14 non-structural proteins 13 there are eight known structural proteins encoded by orf2a orf2b orf37 and orf5a 141516 prrsv is one of the most rapidly mutating rna viruses known with considerable genetic variation within both prrsv-1 and prrsv-2 based on orf5 phylogenetic analysis 1017 this impressive genetic diversity makes the development of a broadly protective immune response to vaccination difficult to achieve after infection the virus can endure and replicate in the host depending on immune status and prrsv strain for a period of at least 150 days 18 therefore contrary to being labeled repeatedly as a persistent pathogen animals are capable of eventually clearing prrsv however the components of the immune system responsible for the development of sterilizing immunity are not completely understood or have yet to be discovered here we will discuss several aspects of prrsv antigen-specific and protective immunity which have yet to be elucidated while focusing on potential areas of further investigation readers interested in additional reviews of prrsv literature related to immunity are directed to the following articles 1119 prrsv infects cells of the macrophagemonocyte lineage including dendritic cells 20212223 permissive cells express cluster of differentiation cd163 a hemoglobin-haptoglobin scavenger which is the necessary receptor for prrsv infection and replication 242526 macrophages and dendritic cells are common members of the mononuclear phagocyte system that plays a varied and important role in many aspects of tissue remodeling development immunity and immunopathology 27 classically designated as part of the innate immune system these leukocytes are critical for the development of a productive adaptive immune response macrophages and particularly dendritic cells take up and present antigen to t cells and b cells thus initiating an adaptive immune response against the presented antigen 2829 if a pathogen is able to infect and destroy manipulate or maintain itself within macrophages or dendritic cells it then has the potential to modulate the immune response into a favorable situation for its own replication and survival therefore many pathogens employ strategies for macrophage infection as a way to make the host more amenable to infection recent research into mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb has shown that after phagocytosis the bacterium arrests phagosome maturation and intra-phagosome lipolysis resulting in mtb survival and an increased supply of nutrients for growth 3031 human immunodeficiency virus hiv infects macrophages to establish reservoirs within the host for the chronic stage of the disease when cd4 t cells are largely depleted and neutralizing antibodies may be present 323334 leishmania major is a protozoan which infects phagocytes to subvert the immune system the parasite expresses glycoprotein gp63 a multifaceted surface-expressed pathogenicity factor that is responsible for preventing antigen presentation and killing by natural killer nk cells 353637 indeed there are many more examples of burdensome pathogens which target phagocytic cells especially macrophages and dendritic cells in an attempt to gain a foothold within the immune system and allow for unchecked survival and replication 383940 prrsv is one of these pathogensthe ability of prrsv to subvert the immune system has not been investigated as extensively as more prominent pathogens of humans such as hiv prrsv has been shown to inhibit the production or the downstream effects of type 1 interferons particularly interferon ifn- on intracellular signaling 4142434445464748 interestingly multiple prrsv proteins nonstructural protein nsp 1 nsp2 nsp4 nsp5 nsp11 and nucleocapsid have been reported to possess interferon inhibiting abilities in addition a number of in vivo experiments have reproduced earlier in vitro findings showing that interferon- is inhibited during the early stages of prrsv infection 474950 while the impact of type 1 interferon suppression is likely to create a favorable environment for the virus to replicate and survive in phagocytic cells it is still unclear what effect if any suppression of type 1 interferon activity has on the adaptive immune response to infection 51 future investigations could clarify the relative contributions of viral proteins on modulation of interferon production and their impacts on viral growth survival and the subsequent development of the adaptive immune response apart from interfering with interferon expression prrsv has also displayed the in vitro ability to subvert the immune system by spreading from cell to cell recent work has uncovered the ability of the virus to spread infectious viral rna several replicases and certain structural proteins between cells via intercellular nanotubules 5253 while this activity theoretically allows for prrsv to avoid neutralizing antibodies the presence and significance of this mechanism in prrsv pathogenesis has yet to be fully elucidated future studies are needed to determine if this process operates in naturally permissive macrophages and dendritic cells if it can be interrupted for example by intracellular antibodies and what effect it might have on viral propagation 5455vaccines depend upon innate immune stimulation to promote effective adaptive immune response to antigen resulting in production of antibodies and cytotoxic t cell responses the ability of a pathogen to successfully infect and replicate within innate immune cells makes the development of a protective immune response more difficult as a result the generation of effective vaccines against pathogens that target immune cells is fraught with challenges extensive variation in viral genetics primary immune responses and cross-protection indicates that much remains to be learned about cellular pathogenesis in order to arrive at better immunological solutions immunosuppression refers to suppression of the immune system and its ability to fight infection hiv and infectious bursal disease virus are examples of viral infections that destroy entire lymphoid cell populations that ablate or disable adaptive immune responses lymphoproliferative cancers block cellular differentiation and deprive the body of mature effector lymphocytes thus causing immunosuppression in a different manner prrsv does neither infection does not lead to severe lymphoid depletion or ablation and it does not interfere profoundly with lymphocyte differentiation or maturation leukocyte perturbations in lymphoid tissues are associated with prrsv infection suggesting that adaptive immunity might be weakened though not destroyed 565758596061 the immune system also maintains peripheral tolerance to self and commensal bacteria through immunosuppressive mechanisms that include regulatory t cells tregs characterized as cd4cd25forkhead box p3 foxp3 t lymphocytes 62 treg suppressive properties were discovered when thymectomized or treg-depleted mice succumbed to autoimmune reactions 6364 tregs suppress effector and effector memory t cell proliferation by cytokine deprivation leading to polyclonal apoptosis and by suppression of antigen presenting cells by cytotoxic t lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 ctla-4 and other mechanisms 62 studies in prrsv infections give an ambiguous picture about the role of tregs prrsv-2 strains are reported to induce a strong treg response which included transforming growth factor tgf-1 secretion in vitro as well as in vivo 6566 other studies did not show treg responses to infection with either prrsv-1 or prrsv-2 6768 interleukin-10 il-10 an immunosuppressive cytokine expressed by various cell types including tregs was induced by prrsv-2 vaccination in weaned pigs in one study but was not induced in weaned or adult pigs in another study 69 additional in vitro and in vivo studies reported il-10 mrna transcription and cytokine production after prrsv infection 707172 however kinetic analysis in serum of viremic pigs of various ages showed that elevated il-10 levels were primarily a function of age and were not associated with infection status 69 the only exception was in weaned pigs infected with a virulent virus in which a transient increase was associated with viral pathogenesis 69 on balance the immunological evidence for prrsv inducing a state of immunosuppression does not appear to be compelling secondary infections following prrs disease outbreak in swine herds suggesting a reduced ability to fight infection is an alternative indicator of immunosuppression an early study showed concurrent pulmonary bacterial infections in 58 of 221 prrs cases 73 however the study did not determine if bacterial infections were present before the prrs outbreaks the immunosuppression question also was addressed in more controlled settings using dual infection models with prrsv and various bacterial species a summary of published literature in 2003 showed no predisposition to bacterial disease in 8 of 15 coinfection models three ambiguous outcomes and four cases in which severity of disease was increased 74 more recent studies found a positive association between prrsv infection and replication of porcine circovirus 2 pcv2 or swine influenza virus 7576it is possible that bacterial infections in swine herds increase following prrs outbreaks due an increased burden of viral infection on host resilience to pathogen burden subclinical viral and bacterial infections are common with pcv2 salmonella enterica haemophilus parasuis various mycoplasma species leptospira and escherichia coli being examples control of infection is maintained by a combination of immune resistance to microbial replication and tissue tolerance to damage in a coinfection model of influenza virus and legionella pneumophila it was clearly demonstrated that l pneumophila infection was subclinical in healthy mice but was lethal in the presence of influenza virus 77 overwhelming disease was due to loss of tissue resilience since the bacterial load was unchanged 77 this model might account for mortalities observed in experimental swine following prrsv exposure 78 given the variable results of prrsv coinfection models in swine and an alternative mechanism for increased disease in prrsv-infected herds generalized immunosuppression does not appear to be a key feature of prrsv pathogenesisprrsv like many viruses has developed countermeasures to host immune responses that enable it to survive and replicate for extended periods of time before the infection is resolved prrsv modulation of intracellular antiviral defense mechanisms has been reviewed extensively 79 the effects of prrsv infection on adaptive immune response ie antigen-specific t cell b cell and antibody responses are less well characterized the antiviral response of t cells to prrsv examined primarily by the ifn enzyme-linked immunospot elispot appears to develop slowly over a period of weeks and is not associated with changes in viral loads in blood or in infected lung and lymphoid tissues 8081 peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc from young weaned pigs show limited ifn responses even when stimulated by phytohemagluttinin which might account for the low anti-prrsv responsiveness after re-stimulation in vitro 69 however pbmc from growing pigs and mature sows which showed higher levels of ifn sensitivity still showed limited responsiveness 69 these findings indicate that prrsv may interfere with specific cell-mediated immunity but more direct evidence is needed for a fuller understandingby contrast the interaction of prrsv with pigs does not appear to retard or attenuate the development of humoral immunity or b cell differentiation induction of antibody responses to prrsv proteins both structural and non-structural occurred in the same time frame as antibody responses to keyhole limpet hemocyanin klh an irrelevant protein antigen 51 the antibody response to klh was also the same in the presence or absence of prrsv infection 51 similarly prrsv infection did not inhibit cellular or humoral immune protection in response to pseudorabies virus vaccination 82 thus the adaptive b cell response is not delayed or suppressed by prrsv an extended viremia and prolonged survival in lymphoid tissues is characteristic of prrsv infection these features show that prrsv has mechanisms of immune avoidance that are not present in viruses such as influenza virus and foot and mouth disease virus in which sterilizing immunity is achieved within 1014 days it appears from the findings of field observations and experimental investigations that some type of prrsv-specific t cell interference is present whereas specific b cell inhibition or a generalized state of immunosuppression are not immunological hallmarks of prrsv infectionthe antibody response to prrsv typically dominates discussions of prrsv immunity as neutralizing antibodies are the crucial component of immune-mediated protection against most viral infections 8384 as a result shortly after the identification of prrsv as the causative agent of mystery swine disease there was a strong push to identify the presence and dynamic response of neutralizing antibodies against prrsv and then to characterize their specificity for prrsv variants early work suggested that neutralizing antibodies against homologous prrsv could be found as early as 911 days after inoculation 85 however this was likely the non-affinity matured immunoglobulin igm response as anti-swine igm ablated the previously observed neutralizing activity subsequent research showed that the high affinity neutralizing igg response detected at around 2842 days post-inoculation is specific for the inoculating virus with partial neutralizing activity against heterologous viruses 8687888990 following the identification of prrsv neutralizing antibodies the effectiveness of immunoglobulins in protecting against infection was evaluated with passive transfer studies these experiments displayed the effectiveness of neutralizing antibodies at preventing clinical infection and disease against homologous challenge 9192 however these studies also showed that immune protection can be quite limited especially between prrsv-1 and prrsv-2 93 within prrsv-1 or prrsv-2 protection against homologous inoculation is consistently solid whereas protection against heterologous challenge is variable for unclear reasons 939495 however genetic similarity based primarily on orf5 sequence comparisons shows no relationship with degree of protection 96 these results appeared to explain the potential field problem in which vaccinated or live virus inoculated animals become infected with a variant prrsv genetically different enough from the inoculating strain to evade the immune system propagate and then cause disease hence ever since the mutability antigenic variability and resultant immunological elusiveness of prrsv were first appreciated a broadly neutralizing antibody response to prrsv has been coveted by immunologists and practitioners 97 recent research shows that there are animals capable of developing a broadly neutralizing antibody response to genetically disparate viruses 998 however this immune capability has only been found in a proportion of animals in groups of similar genetics age sex and exposure history 9 the seemingly random ability of some animals to develop broadly neutralizing antibodies suggests that the inherent variation of the adaptive immune response may play a role in conferring broadly neutralizing capabilities to certain animals investigations into this ability are needed at the lymphocyte level and while the obvious target is the b cell t cells cannot be overlooked as the induction of a humoral immune response requires antigen-specific t cell driven help 99100 therefore animals able to develop a strong neutralizing antibody response would require both b cells and t cells that are capable of recognizing neutralizing epitopes the conditions needed to achieve cross-neutralizing antibody production are not known but may involve multiple exposures to the same or different virus isolates sows with high titered broadly neutralizing antibodies were found in herds with multiple exposures to virulent field viruses 9 in an experimental study cross-neutralization was reported in animals exposed first to a prrsv vaccine strain followed by homologous or heterologous virus challenge 86 however the majority of data analyzed were below the neutralization assay cutoff duration of viremia up to 42 days was linked with increased breadth of neutralizing antibodies following a single viral infection 101 however since cross-neutralization activity and titer data were not presented it was not possible to further interpret the results the animals were not subsequently challenged so it is not known if the cross-neutralizing activity in serum was predictive of protection other studies showed that significant neutralizing antibody responses are not commonly observed during viremic infection of young pigs as well as in adult sows 69102103104 recently vaccinology research in hiv has shown that sequential immunizations tailored for specific stages of the immune response may be useful for inducing broadly neutralizing antibodies 105106107 the approach is based on the finding that early immune responses to hiv resulted in neutralizing antibodies against the circulating virus which quickly led to immune escape of the virus and the ineffectiveness of generated antibodies the antibody-resistant virus then stimulated a secondary antibody response which again selected for antibody resistant virus this virus-antibody hide and seek continued eventually resulting in the selection of several neutralization targets of the virus as well as the generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies 108109110 cloning of the antibodies showed that somatic mutations are generally necessary for antibody neutralizing capabilities against hiv-1 111112 these findings have shown that the b cell response of the host adapts in the germinal center as the virus evolves suggesting that tailored sequential immunization could lead to the development of a broadly neutralizing antibody response 113 the consistent generation of a broadly neutralizing antibody response to prrsv on the herd level has evaded the swine health industry since the emergence of prrsv there are multiple proposed mechanisms by which prrsv may evade or inhibit the development or the effectiveness of a neutralizing antibody response such as glycan shielding of envelope glycoprotein gp3 or gp5 114115 the existence of decoy epitopes in gp5 116 lymphocyte dysregulation 79 and inhibition of the innate immune response 117 comprehension of defense mechanisms employed by prrsv makes the development of a broadly neutralizing immune response appear to be a daunting task however as previously shown some animals are capable of developing such a response simply the key to adapting the immune phenomenon of some animals to a vaccine capable of inducing broadly protective immunity in many animals lies in identifying conserved epitopes on surface proteins which are necessary for infection while the purported targets of neutralization have been extensively discussed in recent reviews it is worth noting that several epitopes on the membrane m protein gp5 gp2 gp3 and gp4 have been shown or implicated to harbor neutralizing activity 114116118119120121122123124 however knocking out only cd163 in the pig is sufficient to render animals non-susceptible to prrsv infection and replication 2425125 it is proposed that following endocytosis cd163 associates with the virus within the endosome resulting in uncoating of the virus and the release of the viral genome into the cellular cytoplasm 126 since cd163 is necessary for viral infection and replication the logical next step is to identify the conserved regions of viral surface proteins most likely the minor glycoproteins gp2 gp3 and gp4 that interact with cd163 124127 traditionally the non-neutralizing antibody response to prrsv has been considered useful only for its ability to identify if an animal had been exposed and seroconverted to virus indeed there are many structural and non-structural proteins of prrsv which make this possible through their ability to induce a robust humoral immune response 1580102 however recent research on other pathogens has shown that non-neutralizing antibodies may play a much larger role in immunity than was previously appreciated 128129130131 alternative antibody functions such as antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity adcc antibody-dependent complement-mediated cytotoxicity cdc and antibody-dependent complement-mediated virolysis may be important in the clearance of virus and virally infected cells from an animal to our knowledge there are only two published papers investigating non-neutralizing antibody functions in the context of prrsv infection 59132 both of these in vitro studies utilized a prrsv-1 virus and failed to find an effect of adcc and cdc on infected cells however experiments focused on prrsv-2 viruses with extended time points beyond 12 h are warranted a more extensive review of non-neutralizing antibody functions can be found in the cited review 133 plasma cells are terminally differentiated b cells responsible for making antibodies apart from the immature plasmablast two types of plasma cells have been defined in the mouse and human 145146 short-lived plasma cells quickly boost antibody titers while long-lived plasma cells maintain circulating antibody titers in the face of continual antibody degradation mulupuri et al identified prrsv-specific plasma cells in several secondary lymphoid organs such as the spleen tonsil sternal lymph node and inguinal lymph node 51 interestingly no prrsv-specific or klh-specific plasma cells were found in the bone marrow of immune pigs 51 this was surprising as the bone marrow has been long considered as the reservoir for long-lived plasma cells in both mice and humans 147148149 it then begs the question do pigs have long-lived plasma cells and if so where do they reside mulupuri et al found prrsv and klh specific plasma cells in secondary lymphoid organs 120 days after inoculation 51 however these cells may not be long lived as the prolonged viremia of prrsv may result in a somewhat continuous stimulation of memory b cells resulting in the appearance of this plasma cell population in secondary lymphoid organs it seems unlikely that pigs do not have long lived plasma cells as the half-life of porcine antibodies in serum is on average approximately nine days 150151 therefore without long lived plasma cells pigs would quickly lose humoral protection as antibody titers waned the identification of the anatomic location as well as the understanding of mechanisms for inducing a strong long lived plasma cell response may be important for future vaccine design as well as comprehending hostpathogen interactions interestingly even though neutralizing antibodies have historically garnered the majority of attention in prrsv immunology it is well-known that pigs readily control infection in the absence of neutralizing antibodies furthermore viremia is reported in the presence of neutralizing antibodies 152153 therefore there must be other facets of the immune system which effectively function to control infection and eliminate prrsv from the host while some of this activity may be attributed to non-neutralizing functions of antibodies the t cell response to infection demands further investigation a recent prrs immunity review summarized previous research on functional t cell subsets and prrsv epitope targets as well as gaps in t cell immunity 11 here we provide context for the understanding of novel results that have not been comprehensively reviewedearly research on the t cell response to prrsv identified a large transient decrease in the cd4cd8 t cell ratio early usually within the first week in the course of infection 154 the change in this ratio could have been due to a temporary loss of cd4 cells through apoptosis or to an increase in cd8 cells due to antigen-specific proliferation 154 the importance of these findings for clearance of prrsv or protection from infection were not known at the time and other explanations such as fluxes in cell populations between spleen other lymphoid tissues and blood could not be discounted experiments to address the helper t cell type 1helper t cell type 2 th1th2 paradigm in the pig showed that prrsv induced a strong th1 response as expected identified in vivo by an increased expression of th1-specification factor tbx21t-bet in cd4 cells 155 however the finding is at odds with previously reports indicating that prrsv infection results in the production of il-10 a cytokine classically associated with a th2 phenotype similarly monocyte-derived dendritic cells mo-dcs infected with prrsv down regulate swine leukocyte antigen sla-i sla-ii cd40 and cd80 as well as promote il-10 secretion over il-12 secretion 156 delineation of the th1th2 response to prrsv elucidation of th1th2-specific cytokine markers in swine as well as identifying associated cytokine responses of dendritic cells within secondary lymphoid organs where t cell proliferation and differentiation is most likely to occur would help to resolve these outstanding questions 157 the th17 cell has classically been identified in mouse and human as playing an important role in extracellular bacterial immunity through the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines il-17a il-17f and il-22 158159 il-17 producing th17 cells are known to exist in the pig 160 the importance of this t cell subset in the context of prrsv infection has recently been investigated a strain of chinese highly pathogenic prrsv hp-prrsv appeared to suppress th17 cells in the peripheral blood and lungs of pigs resulting in an increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections 56 remarkably the effect was prrsv strain-specific as a non-hp prrsv strain failed to elicit the same response future research into the t cell response to prrsv especially with t cell tetramers and functional elispots will be essential for the characterization of both cd4 and cd8 antigen specific t cells understanding how antigen-specific t cells interact with both infected and uninfected antigen presenting macrophages and dendritic cells will be helpful for advancing the field of prrsv immunitythe natural killer cell is an innate lymphoid cell which can have a profound impact on adaptive immunity but is also able to induce an early and rapid innate response against pathogens through a variety of mechanisms nk cells produce cytokines such as ifn show cytotoxic activity against infected cells not expressing mhci can induce dendritic cell maturation and effect the destruction of infected cells in adcc 161 however nk cells may deploy even more extensive and important functions in porcine immunity than are currently realized an early clue that nk cells were involved in innate responses to prrsv was a sharp peak in serum ifn shortly after infection 162 the acute response was attributed to nk cells as the result was deemed too early for a t cell response and suggested that decreased viral burdens in the lung prior to humoral or t cell responses could be due to the function of nk cells however it is known that porcine macrophages are also capable of producing ifn in the presence of prrsv infection 163164 furthermore prrsv appears to suppress the nk cell response without significantly affecting nk cell numbers 165166167168 the cause of this suppression has yet to be determined although viral proteins rather than soluble factors from cells may be responsible 59 potential roles of additional nk cell functions such as adcc in prrsv immunity are poorly understood 133 prrsv has tormented the health and wellbeing of swine worldwide since its discovery in the late 1980s unfortunately after almost 30 years of research into the porcine immune response to prrsv there is still no effective means for inducing a broadly protective immune response at the herd level the reasons for this failure are not completely known but presumably include mechanisms by which the virus subverts the immune system the ability of the virus to rapidly mutate while not losing fitness challenges the host immune system to keep pace at the same time infection of macrophages a key player in immunoregulation challenges both innate and adaptive immune cell mobilization as well as induction of a coordinated response that is needed for effective control and elimination of the virus fortunately foundational advances in the understanding of viral pathogenesis and immunity are enabling more informative investigations the identification of cd163 as the necessary and sufficient receptor for infection supports the implications of broadly neutralizing antibodies that a conserved target is present on all prrsv understanding how prrsv surface glycoproteins interact with cd163 should lead to the identification of conserved epitopes which are necessary for infection if as appears to be the case there is only one conserved way into the cell then there must be a conserved viral sequence or structure which enables viral entry furthermore the knowledge that pigs eventually develop sterilizing immunity if given enough time supports the concept that conserved epitopes exist on the virus therefore the study of mature animals which have cleared the virus may provide the key to understanding how the immune system eventually gets the upper hand on the virus and cures infection even with seminal advances in several aspects of the study of prrsv there remains much to be understood and clarified currently the published literature presents conflicting views on many aspects of prrsv adaptive immunity especially related to t and b cell responses and the production or inhibition of cytokines in the face of infection the continued development of antigen-specific reagents of high sensitivity and specificity is needed for understanding how the host responds to prrsv infection furthermore it is important that future prrsv studies focus on the relevant host animal the conventional pig while the study of this outbred animal species is perhaps challenging at times it affords the ability to study the hostpathogen interaction in the only species in which the virus naturally interacts additionally knowledge gained about the immunology of conventional pigs will accelerate immunological elucidation of other pigpathogen interactionsin conclusion prrsv continues to be the most burdensome pathogen of pigs worldwide due to its propensity for immune evasion and manipulation however the continued study of the porcine immune response to infection with improved reagents and methods will illuminate those aspects of the hostpathogen interaction that are now hidden it is through these discoveries that the complex question that is prrsv will finally be answeredvirus detection in extra-solar system locales depends on the presence of life intelligence detection in extra-solar system locales depends on the presence of life or on the presence of machines can these be detected what is the extent of contamination with biological and junked material of the prior pristine extra-terrestrial environments in our solar system have all the planets asteroids and planetesimals to which spacecraft were sent already damaged and contaminated the entire program of life detection in our solar system with biological toxic and junk contamination in case terrestrial and extra-terrestrial biologies were similar can biological hybrids form that are more pathogenic or toxic compared to either parental progenitor is this a danger even if they are dissimilar will this admonition endure with spacecraft having departed from our solar system the highest level of biosafety biocontainment level bsl-4 is used for the deadliest of known terrestrial viruses such as ebola virus the severe problem of extraterrestrial contamination by terrestrial microbes and vice versa the reverse possibility requires careful and detailed examination analysis and technological improvement assessment of many constraints requires that intelligent machines sent to investigate life beyond the solar system should have preeminent capabilities including artificial intelligence ai quantum computers qc robotics self-replication and repair nanotechnology and von neumanns universal constructor it is counter-productive to foster human exploration of life beyond the solar system current human financial and technological conditions all considered this chapter briefly provides synopses of diverse background and significant advances for virologylife detection elsewhere within and beyond the solar system1the goldilocks or through the looking glass paradigm assumes usually that universally all life embodies the same or similar terrestrial processes this terrestrial-centric view of life is limited in scope the complete chemistry of all the natural elements metals and non-metals is unknown and the predictive abilities of quantum chemistry are thus far unable to solve such salient issues that face us while extraterrestrial exploration continueshumans have been anthropomorphic ethnocentric and earth-centric for millennia as far back in time that we know of this led to widespread provincial limited unscientific deficiencies to grasp intelligence and life in the universe however many ancient greek and modern scientists and technologists opposed such views as investigations commence of locales outside our terrestrial and solar system environments we need to re-examine fundamental assumptions hypotheses and directions key concerns in such explorations include unnecessary human life endangerment global wastefulness improvidence duplicative financial cost and huge irresponsible toxic accumulation of terrestrial and space junk this chapter contends that unrelenting development of ai qc and intelligent robotics for extraterrestrial exploration will remove human risk and endangerment from the equation as well as reduce global costs 14wandel epitomizes the view that there is an inimitable abundance of life in the universe this is based on threadbare evidence if at all the drake equation is applied the biosignature paradigm for the presence of life is applied and the conclusion drawn the assumption is as usual that goldilocks planets are the harbingers of life and percentages calculated to purportedly demonstrate the anticipation as to just how life must be so abundant 14this returns to a chapter theme that if there were any life elsewhere in the universe the problem of contact must be faced in regard to human health and safety based on virology biology and intelligence estimates therefrom moreover there have already been proposals as to human measures of extraterrestrial intelligence base on feats of engineering accomplishments dyson proposed that sufficiently advanced civilizations could build spheres around their suns to provide greater energy capture needed for advanced technological progress  a stage of civilization technological development kardashev further proposed stages of development that proceed from the dyson sphere capability to the ability to move planets and then finally to civilizations that could modify the structure of space-time itself to suit their needs however nothing of the sort has been detected as yet 6 7 11 14the absence of life detection based on the goldilocks paradigm could be the result of no existence of life in the first place out there or it may be rarer than thought in addition intelligent life may survive some time prior to extinguishing itself possibly intelligent life that does survive may then rapidly hide itself in this regard several thousands of years of human history demonstrates the folly of displayed ostentatious resources readily discerned by others compared to less displayed wealth and existencethucydides in his history of the peloponnesian war2 describes how athens was able to initially grow and flourish developing civilization and resources because it was founded in an arid area that most other civilizations and cultures avoided 15 similarly civilizations that hope to survive the unidentified dangers of the universe may know how to hide strategically from potential dangers and risks and thus to actually avoid goldilocks zonesvarious forms of life may have wide range cyclic durations from transitory evanescence to long-term endurance the time scales and examination methods used are critical and fundamental investigators could miss important clues as to the existence of such living systems depending on the intervals flexibility and adaptability of how and when analyses were to be accomplished a few demonstrative exemplars followpossibly investigators could miss cicada-like organisms that hide away for lengthy interludes in northeastern america for example distinctive cicada species have 13- and 17-year synchronous life-cycles these two separate periodicities generally do not overlap geographically however where there is geographical overlap 221-year cycles occur 16 17at the other end of the life cycle temporal spectrum extra-solar system investigators could miss organisms that appear randomly temporally and geographically and very briefly for example species of mayfly adults live near fresh watersheds in england and have brief lifespans that vary from 5 minutes to 14 days their eggs are found in river beds and the next stage of development nymphs are found in proximity on river water plants subsequently two separate additional adult stages develop on other riverside plants 18 consequently if the investigators happened to look at night or with inappropriate durations or miss any of the precise locales such explorers might not detect such mayflies moreover even if they did detect various separate components of as yet unknown to them life cycles would they be able link the various mayfly developmental and maturational stages to then amalgamate the information into mayfly life cyclesundoubtedly sequenced dna genome phylogenies would divulge a lot however we cannot dubiously assume per chance that extra-solar system explorers will find living systems that utilize dna some other types of genetics inheritance or propagatory systems may be used that have other means of genetics or memory required as to how organisms reproduce or propagate panoplies of temporal range location and multiplicity of stages are thus important considerations investigators must address intelligent robotics ai and qcs are exceedingly applicable to conceive plan and address what needs to be constructed and assembled for successful and efficient extra-solar system investigations much work is currently being accomplished and the paradigm shift from utilization of humans to utilization of ai will accelerate the understanding and implementation of what needs to be done in preparation for such explorations additionally large intelligent mechanical inventive systems necessitate development which will implement obligatory changes upon arrival at extra-solar system target locales clearly ai will outperform humans and human intelligence 19 20space exploration requires analysis of the conditions of physical and biological contamination including inanimate such as dust grains and particles and animate such as organisms of various sizes exploration of the moon commenced some 50 years ago in 1969 1971 and 1972 six apollo missions 11 12 14 15 16 and 17 landed on the moon and exhibited problems with lunar dust contamination of personnel clothing space suits and space vehicle cabins ubiquitous dangerous and deleterious effects of lunar dust were included in ten categories inhalation and irritation vision obscuration false instrument readings dust coating and contamination astronaut space suit surfaces loss of traction thermal control problems abrasion clogging of mechanisms and ball-bearing and seal failures there were no effective procedures available to diminish the most serious problems of abrasion clogging and weakened heat rejection the authors concluded that prior studies of these problems had been insufficient so that additional studies will be needed prior to returning to the moon and similarly prior to exploring mars if that is done 21st century ultra-sterile futuristic bsl-4 methods to prevent material and biological contamination should be used 2529the complexity of detecting extra-solar system viruses and associated life is further heightened in consideration of incursion and clash with life that is potentially deleterious or hostile towards humans and their vehicles ai and other derivatives of our machines and technologies tribulations arising may be intentional or unintentional such warnings are exemplified using the following example of an unanticipated grim and dangerous lethal terrestrial virus for which there is as yet no fully efficacious cure ebolathis example is a huge international public health problem ebola epidemics are unanticipated sporadic and have high mortality based on phylogenetic studies it appears that ebola evolved in africa for at least 1200 years prior to its discovery ebola virus disease was discovered in 1976 in the sudan and also occurred in the same year in democratic republic of the congo drc3 ebola outbreaks and epidemics occurred in drc in 1977 sudan 1979 philippines in 1989 gabon 1994 cote divoire in 1994 gabon 1995 drc 1995 gabon 1996 and 1997 uganda 2000 gabon 2001 and 2002 drc 2001 2002 and 2003 sudan 2004 drc 2005 and 2007 uganda 2007 drc 2008 spain 2010 uganda 2011 and 2012 drc 2012 and a huge outbreak in west africa liberia guinea in 2013 human ebola virus infections were also detected in lagos ghana and sierra leone fruit bats are the reservoir for ebola virus virus infected bats have been found in the drc gabon lagos nigeria and ghana moreover satellite telemetry is used to track bat migrations direct exposure to fruit bats can result in ebola virus infection in addition ebola virus has been identified in several animals including great apes such as chimpanzees ebola virus laboratory clinical and epidemiological studies are continuing due the devastating impact of this largely unanticipated disease 3032at the start of the last few ebola outbreaks and epidemics however international organizations the nih and cdc were well prepared and promptly mustered the indispensable organizational professional skill complex technology and rapid response required for the situations that unfolded biohazard suits were available for emergency teams and bsl-4 laboratories were already equipped and prepared to receive specimens for optical and electron microscopy as well as for various virologic immunological biochemical and molecular analyses procedures for the proper transport of bsl-4-level specimens via commercial public airlines were in place and immediately utilized in fact there are 50 known bsl-4 laboratories world-wide so the planet has a high degree of improved preparedness for various types of biological contamination problems indeed the current 2019 ebola epidemic in the democratic republic of the congo is considered now at its worst and still spreading 29 3338 national and international space programs should coordinate with us and international biological microbiological and virologic organizations including nih cdc and who these biomedical organizations are highly skilled expert and accomplished they are well-rehearsed and prepared for preventing and dealing with viral including biological and material contamination and are expert in carefully controlled statistical analysis of experimental-design limitations as well as augmented predictive capabilities such cooperative planning will reduce unnecessary duplication and financial waste 39such considerations including the panoply and plethora of emerging virus infections in recent decades cast great doubts on the dubious optimism shown by many astronomers and exobiologists that exoplanetary microorganisms are unlikely to cause damage to humans this is counter to extensive evidence that viruses cross species barriers 40 moreover whether microorganisms and viruses have arisen on goldilocks4 or on non-goldilocks exoplanetary environments it is counter-productive and damaging to credibility when avowed that the potential infectious pathogenicity and lethality of exoplanetary microorganisms and viruses if they exist are shrugged asidethere is a plethora of viruses that have their origin in species other than where they are initially discovered the following examples of such viruses their original host and original species jump-time are as follows measles virus cattle and monkeys since the origin of homo sapiens smallpox virus other primates and camels more than 10000 years ago influenza virus water birds pigs horses more than 5000 years ago canine parvovirus cpv cats and feline carnivores since 1970s hiv-1 and hiv-2 old world primates chimpanzees early 20th century sars corona virus bats since 1970s dengue virus old world primates less than 500 years ago nipah virus fruit bats continuously marburg and ebola viruses bats continuously myxoma virus rabbits since 1950s hendra virus fruit bats continuously and canine influenza virus horses 21st century 41remarkably more recent studies among 19 virus families demonstrate that host-switching is universal among the viruses studied including hepadnaviridae polyomaviridae poxviridae papillomaviridae adenoviridae caliciviridae coronaviridae potyviridae herpesviridae paramyxoviridae parvoviridae togaviridae retroviridae flaviviridae bunyaviridae orthomyxoviridae reoviridae picornaviridae and rhaboviridae 42where and when were organic compounds first synthesized how did they accumulate and how were they disbursed possibly there are multiple developmental phases resulting in the origin of life from abiotic biomolecular synthesis and organelle formation required for living systems in addition was there a slow or rapid process during which living systems arose and assembled be that as it may the key issue raised is a contrast between the problem of how life arose on the earth vs its arising on asteroids and comets and in these cases infalling onto the earth temperatures of ejection are important in understanding the temperatures rocks were exposed to prior to reaching earth for example rocks on the earth from mars could have been exposed to ejection temperatures of 400 c additional studies indicate a higher temperature when asteroids collide expelling chondrites the ranges of temperature maximum of 18501900 k and 1720 gpa for pressure peak were attained 4346however infall temperatures for rocks reaching the earth could reach more than a thousand degrees k for example jenniskens et al found that cometary debris and asteroids that traverse the earths atmosphere are exposed to atmospheric temperature range of 29006000 k traveling at 1961 kmsec and 760014000 k traveling at 7185 kmsec however depending on whether such events occur in a predominantly co2 or o2 atmosphere influences the results as the ejecta are expelled from the infall rocks they cool the further away they travel organic molecules could then be synthesized in a predominantly co2 atmosphere compared to an o2 atmosphere where c would react to produce co and co2 47chyba and sagan hypothesized 48 that the early earth prior to 35 gyr ago had several equivalent sources of organic molecules impact shock- uv radiation- electrical discharge-propelled synthesis and infall from extraterrestrial objects however questions can be raised as to the actual quantification of each putative source the accuracy of measurements the degree of solar nebula opacity to uv radiation influence and types of radioactivity the strength and destructiveness of the solar wind during the course of these events the reaction-rate and chemistry of isotope effects of deuterium in the aqueous environment and the relative distributions of infall from chondrites comets and other solar system debrisimmanuel kant in the 18th century in 1755 first proposed that the solar system condensed from gases and particles in this theory he relies on the concept of the atom derived from lucretius in combination with the application of newtons laws of gravitation leading to processes of condensation 49 the work of immanuel kant set the stage for subsequent inferences to be based on planetary evolutionary phenomena leading to the origin of lifethe evolution of carbon-containing molecules is of subsequent relevance in terms of possibly detecting goldilocks-zone hypothesized earth-like life as advanced in the 20th century the analyses of the murchison and many other carbonaceous chondrites have been typical study foci however the question as to the survival of organic prebiological compounds continues to be a prime question in studies related to the origin of life in the solar system as well for example carbonaceous chondrites have been sources of amino acids purines and perhaps some pyrimidines do they reflect conditions related to the origin of life or synthesis during transit to the earths surface 5053 first were compounds continually produced during the early history of the solar system eg during the first gyr and then second various conditions would degrade and destroy these compounds eg heat impacts radiation radioactivity ultraviolet light cosmic rays and solar wind olivine basalt was returned from the lunar regolith to the cornell university space center planetary laboratory ithaca ny and was pulverized and then mixed with amino acids these mixtures were subjected to lunar surface proton irradiation temperature and high vacuum and resulted in complete amino acid destruction in entirety in 5-cm mixture columns the half-life of the amino acids was calculated at 4000 years 54conditions would be different at various times and durations on asteroids chondrites proto-planetoids planetesimals earth other planets satellites and comets thus one may ask the crucial question did pre-biotic biochemistry occur and evolve on planets such as earth mars and venus at various times in their histories or did this occur on a solar system-wide panorama early in the solar system history however if it were solar system-wide then did this occur in two phases for the venus earth and mars first as the planetary material precursors and compounds accreted then when some planetary critical mass was attained resulting in volcanism and melting consequent concomitant destruction of biological compounds ensued next was it only after some level of cooling that there was in situ synthesis of protobiologicals on the earth and venus and mars as well as raining down of such molecules as described by chyba and sagan in1974 48is life then a product of individually rare events such as on planets alone or as a result of solar system-wide events that contributed increased probabilities of biomolecular assembly and biogenesis as time goes by with additional well-controlled studies this paradox should be resolved be that as it may loeb proposed that because at a redshift of 100137 because the cosmic background temperature was 273373 k thus a widespread goldilocks universe organic molecules could have formed and perhaps life originated though at that early stage of development of the expansion of the universe only 1017 million years of age 55 using this slant there could have been very early widespread origins of life over several million years prior to the further cooling and evolution of the universe towards what we observe today this overall vantage is also proposed by gibson 56the thermodynamics involved in ribosome evolution and multiple linkages among proteins and nucleic acids may be involved in the energetics imposing evolutionary constraints in selection at the molecular intracellular level especially during the epoch when the terrestrial atmosphere changed from a uv-penetrating atmosphere with no oxygen to one with little uv and an abundance of oxygen5 the complexity of the origin of ribosomes involving proteins and rnas may have taken place at an early stage of life when rna genetics predominated prior to the proliferation of dna genetics termed the rna world 5762briefly subsequent evolution of life including ribosomes and cell organelles point to endosymbiont evolutionary processes eukaryotes with mitochondria plastids chloroplasts and mitotic apparatus appeared due to the fusion of several separate endosymbiont prokaryote groups accordingly note then that at some stages of evolution some prokaryote nucleated cells interacted with mitochondrial symbionts and others with both mitochondrial and plastid endosymbionts the endosymbiont origin hypotheses were originated by mereschkowsky in 1905 and championed by margulis since 1967 6367extra-solar system life searches utilize panels of sophisticated experiments available to establish the presence of many types of chemical reactions pre- and post-origin of life depending on the states of development where exploratory vehicles land of under-rated importance there should be improved biocontainment procedures in place to avoid upsetting and perturbing the evolution of life in such environments as technology improves and further exploratory vehicles are sent the danger of biocontamination becomes even greater each exploratory vehicle should have a probability value p-value attached - which should be lower than some crucial value that should be determined with appropriate scientific investigation many control experiments are required to fully investigate such potential contamination outcomes the degrees of complexity involved additionally require ai and qc to accomplish such difficult and multifaceted tasks without destroying such environments such issues are obviously important in extra-terrestrial goldilocks zone environmentsbesides the many apparatuses and characteristics of life mentioned it is also recognized that analysis of organization symmetries energetics and thermodynamics are crucial components in the analysis of life this way early recognized by schrodinger life as we know demonstrates several biochemical cycles including nitrogen carbon oxygen and sulfur cycles as well as electron flow cycles in organelles including mitochondria and chloroplasts for energy production many electron-chain oxidation cycles are based on sulfur or oxygen molecular biosynthesis- and degradation-coupled cycles are additionally often cited including nitrogen fixation urea cycle glycolysis krebs cycle and photosynthesis demonstrating extreme plasticity and adaptability terrestrial life has infiltrated wide varieties of inhospitable extreme environments nonetheless of temperature earth atmosphere and water however all considered in the goldilocks zone 6874life demonstrates increased order and lowered entropy the gibbs equation is fundamental in such calculationsdocumentclass12ptminimal

open system it supplies energy for this to occur as well as an increase in disorder and increased entropy to offset lifes demands on energetics indeed according to some cosmologies entropy is increasing in the universe second law of thermodynamics 68 78 79 thermodynamics and kinetics of chemistry in space exploration is productive as exemplified for enceladus 80 an additional example of living thermodynamics is the gibbs-donnan equilibrium effect 81 technology needs to be developed to detect such thermodynamic effects due to the presence of life prior to taking samples for analysis thereby potentially harming and destroying what is under examination the application of difficult and sophisticated methods including fractal multifractal and thermodynamic approaches would require some time to develop and optimize 8289 anthropomorphism not intended in terms of intelligence scanning for the extraterrestrial equivalent of neurons from an external vantage is a daunting task robotics ai and qc would surely require development in order to do such difficult and complex tasksunanticipated and counter-intuitive properties of replication occur in terrestrial life which are being comprehensively assessed as indicated for example by studies of prions and prion-like proteins on the one hand prion proteins are produced from coding dna exons on the other hand infectious prions can induce malformation of correctly folded proteins into misfolded neuropathological prions this transformation is associated with a variety of human and animal diseases that have been carefully and scientifically studied since the early 20th century moreover many proteins have prion-like sequences and may additionally participate in various disease processes unanticipated amyloid fibril fatal associated involvement in alzheimers disease may involve synergistic action with prions further relevant to astrovirology there is negligible immune response to prion disease itself transmissible encephalopathies in the natural setting if anything incipient immune reactions promote replication and spread of prion disease 28 9094 thus exovirology portends unanticipated elevated health risks for human exploration should life and viruses be discovered elsewherebiomedical scientists recognize and widely discuss our incomplete understanding of the human genome the salient feature of the incomplete information is that remarkably 98 of the human genome does not code for proteins therefore the human genome is appropriately under close scrutiny using cutting edge contemporary molecular analytic technologies these studies lead towards individualized medicine and are being done through extensive institutional organizational skills coupled with critical peer review 87 88 90 95102 abiogenesis may depend on how water interacts with other environmental variables it should be noted however that although there is little evidence that such conditions intrinsically produce life besides the single example of the earth such zones are certainly environments to where terrestrial life could relocate as an additional example in the field along such lines using the anthropomorphic insular approach a probability equation is postulated to calculate probabilities for life on earth 103however an earlier bayesian approach came to the conclusion that despite the existence of life on the earth it is an extremely unlikely event 104 from this it may be inferred that the focus on the goldilocks zone in this restricted search for life may not be the most productive approach to take detection may fail for many other life-formsthe possibility of material exchange among planets is used to enhance the probability of abiogenesis 105 there is a range of histories and types of planetary systems under which such exchanges could occur histories of migrating planets and their roving excreta further tone the clarification of planetary surface properties to be included in the framework of exploration of extra-solar systems 106108there have been five commonly acknowledged terrestrial extinctions of life to date on the earth across the last 560 million years my the mass extinction names and approximate dates are late-ordovician 440 my ago late-devonian 370350 my ago end-permian 250 my ago end-triassic 199 my ago and end-cretaceous 65 my ago how such cataclysmic events terminate life is under study for loss of life a trigger mechanism is separated conceptually from a kill mechanism trigger mechanisms are whatever events eg asteroids cause or initiate kill mechanisms an interesting example though subtle is a kill mechanism proposed when atmospheric partial pressure pco2 levels of 560 ppmv are associated with an oceanic toxic ph of 79 this level can be reached both from below and from above 109subsequent to each extinction event the fundamental building blocks and biochemistry of life persisted as some organisms survived and continued to evolve each time a question posed is to what extent intelligent life evolved prior to or after each extinction event however the consensus appears to be that highest intelligence was attained after the fifth extinction with the rise of mammals primates and humans what about extinction events in our scientific exploration of extra-solar system life our explorations necessitate including methods to ascertain whether extinction events have taken place if our arrival is in the midst of such an event and whether our arrival itself may cause such events dealing with questions of contamination is crucial the footprint impacts of our exploration and arrival elsewhere should be explored scientificallythe carbon- nitrogen- oxygen- and sulfur-based life positioned on dna rna proteins and the rules of terrestrial molecular biology may not comprise life elsewhere detecting organic molecules in exo-environments may relate to other forms of life that we simply have not yet imagined even among some terrestrial life forms for example silicon enters into metabolism radiolarians silici-sponges and diatoms secrete silica 109 life detection elsewhere should include diverse unanticipated scenariosthat life as we know it arises on goldilocks habitable zones relies on the assumption that terrestrial-like environments are the primary harbingers of life 103 it should be noted that although there is little evidence that such conditions intrinsically produce life besides the single example of the earth though such zones are certainly environments to where terrestrial life could move an equation was postulated to calculate probabilities for life on earth the possibility of material exchange among planets was used to enhance the probability of abiogenesis however a bayesian approach came to the conclusion that despite the existence of life on the earth it remains an extremely unlikely event moreover it should be noted that earlier speculations considered that life resembling known terrestrial biochemistry was unlikely 9 11 68 104 105 from this one may infer that the focus on the goldilocks zone conditions in the search for life is an excessively restrictive approachvon neumann established in the last century the feasibility of machine replication and error detection and correction central is the concept of the universal constructor of von neumanns 111 112 taking this to the next stage of ai qc and intelligent robotics it appears we are embarking on a new age of life made of various metals semi-conductors plastics and other syntheticsrobotics and ai are burgeoning fields in extra-solar system exploration such work is proceeding at an accelerated pace for example robotic self-supervised learning was accomplished in the laboratory environment to assist independent robot performance in the space exploration environment 113 this is indicative of progress to fully function and independent robotics that can carry out all functions required ultimately for extra-solar system explorationai and machine learning computation approaches related to medicine and id were used to develop a more advanced search engine-decision support system of biomedical ontologies than hitherto accomplished this system utilized infectious disease and antibiotics information for diagnosis classification this system is for use by id physicians and care-givers this is especially useful when extrapolation of exceedingly complex situations is required when there is missing data and when nonetheless decisions require being made 114lasers have numerous uses including communications optical transponders precision clocks pathfinding orbital dynamics altimetry laser propulsion in space navigation attitude control construction precision alignment structural control in space power generation and distribution resource location including 3d-sensing materials science planetary satellite asteroid cometary interior structure and geology regolith and ice surface mapping and of course fulfilling measurement requirements due to special and general relativity further development will be essential for exo-solar system interplanetary exploration 115 116 such development is perfect for robotics ai and qcsvery recently a closer realization of the use of lasers in communications and life-detection has been proposed stellar gravitational lensing as described in albert einsteins theory of general relativity was used to recommend an inter-solar system means of communication this is shown to be feasible using an equivalent to a 1 watt 1 nm channel laser light in juxtaposition between stars such as the sun and alpha-centauri possibly more advanced civilizations may communicate with each other using even more advanced related technology 117 this is hardly unreasonable considering how recently we commenced developing our current technologiesgiven the numbers of calculations and complexity of interactions that would be required for life to start let alone the detection of intelligent life the use of artificial intelligence ai as well as quantum computers qc are anticipated to make the calculations and carry out the modeling required to estimate various possibilities alternatives and exigencies 87 88 118121 scientific development will be greatly accelerated by the development of independent robotics ai and qc moreover the sophistication of roving laboratories in planetary and other environments will be greatly enhanced with the use of ai and qc improvements qcs will have to be enhanced so that they operate at several ambient temperatures utilizing materials that do not require cooling to close to zero degrees kelvin these are monumental tasksto date 750000 asteroids and comets have been detected however an unanticipated novel object 1i2017 u1 was observed during several nights in october 2017 which twice transited the plane of the solar system traveling at anomalously high velocity in an unusual orbit 1i2017 u1 is the first object recognized as an extra-solar system visitor it was suggested that due to various complex calculations such interstellar visitors have been missed previously however it could not be traveled to by direct means 1i2017 u1 was initially identified as probably an asteroid but not a comet it traversed our solar system with a jolt from the sun that assisted its hyperbolic exit it was oblong shaped with axes that were 200 by 20 meters spectroscopic analysis indicated it had a red color coated with damaged or degraded organic molecules of some kind and possibly hollow perhaps with or without trapped internal ice it was also reported that unfortunately we did not have any rockets prepared which could reach the object and place a probe on it to plot its path as it exited the solar system beyond visual range could laser technology have been used to extend the tracking range 122124currently analysis continues for the 4 days of observational data produced from this extra-solar system object it is most recently considered to have a spotty red color or graded red color scheme the analysis of this color issue also involves concluding that it has a tumble rate that influences the apparent color analysis moreover 1i2017 u1 may have been involved in a collision in the distant past perhaps the cause of its expulsion from the solar system from which it originated 125 analysis of the object for signs or signatures of life remain indefinite loeb in 2018 126 proposed an artificial extraterrestrial interstellar origin for 1i2017 u1 of further interest is the proposal of a few stars originally calculated to within 2 pc of 1i2017 u1 as possible prior sources with ranges of distance and travel times of 06 pc at 1 mya and 16 pc at 38 mya 127 however it is as yet not anticipated which star previously to that or originally may have given rise to 1i2017 u1 how old is it could it be an intergalactic as well as an interstellar messengersupporting the notion that interstellar traveling objects have entered our solar system siraj and loeb in 2019 proposed a 045 m size meteorite 2014-01-08 170534 utc with an unbounded hyperbolic orbit and asymptotic extra-solar system velocity of 438 kmsec 60 kmsec away from the velocity of the local standard of rest lsr is of interstellar origin in addition they estimate that there are eight such interstellar objects that have fallen on the earth 128the development of the europa lander mission report of 2016 demonstrates evolution in approach towards such ends with a wide scope in scientific planning and organization 129 130 the 264-page technical report and 734-page planned budget report are very wide-ranging convey detailed planning expectations when probes arrive as well as the sophistication required to get there these are early steps towards exploration within the solar system however the 19 billion requested for work 20182022 may not be ratified and realistically the deadline may be shifted towards the late 2020swhat has been the cost for the work done by the us space exploration agency nasa according to wikipedia the nasa budget from 1958 to 2020 is estimated 1188919000000 in comparison the nih budget from 1938 to 2018 is estimated 737016000000 the nih budget expended across 80 years is approximately 62 of the nasa budget consumed across 62 years nih-supported researchers received 90 nobel prizes across 78 years 19392017 131133criteria and standards of materialparticle contamination have been published for example related to the european space agency esa 134 135 however the implementation enforcement and monitoring quality control followed by peer review publications is not yet implemented globally moreover this entails manufacturing assembly and launch stages and there is no systematic program globally in this regard in addition since there is a variety of components and procedures internationally without international monitoring publication and quality control more needs to be done clearly where only materials and particles are monitored biological including potential microbial contamination are not addressed although some procedures used could be toxic to microorganisms it does not mean that living microorganisms are not present as well furthermore this cannot be taken to mean that the biological fragments and components of life are absent experiments controls and simulations are continually required followed by public reports and expert peer reviewthere are many sources of contamination by biological and microbiological organisms materials by-products waste and detritus the international space station currently and in its prior stages of development are prime examples nasa points out that such issues need discussion and practice 136sidestepping the all-inclusive question of the probability of more than a single origin of life event within and outside the solar system is the possibility that microscopic life once it has originated could spread throughout any galaxy including our milky way for example upto 1 cm size meteorites originating on a planet such as the earth which has microbial life could be ejected and more than one could reach exoplanets at least 20 light years ly distance upon terrestrial ejection such meteorites could reach comets if the microorganisms remained alive on such ejecta coupled with comets and other interstellar travelers then the entire galaxy could be accessible along similar lines the authors state that if life originated for example 1010 ten billion years ago anyplace in the milky way then by 46 billion years ago life forms could have reached the earth 137there have been heated arguments in contemporary times relating to the panspermia hypothesis of svante arrhenius by many scientist including wickramasinghe and hoyle it should be noted that in ancient times anaxagoras born 510 bce first proposed that life came from elsewhere and arrhenius in more recent times proposed this in 1903 138141ginsburg and colleagues succinctly summarized ideas and models related to panspermia with the pervasive presumption of the goldilocks paradigm in addition they assert the possibility of terrestrial ejecta traversing the solar system as well as milky way a central canonical issue for panspermia furthermore they include viruses in their discussions suttle and others had previously point out that there are approximately 1030 viruses currently in the earths oceans and that viruses have a huge impact globally  that they exhibit the widest genetic diversity on earth cause mortality affect phytoplankton one of the bases of the ecosystem and food chain on the planet and drive geochemical cycles gonzalez recently pointed out in a more restricted sense that although arrhenius original canonical panspermia hypothesis in unlikely what he terms as lithopanspermia of microorganisms that are endolithic and evolve in the same solar system have increased positive consideration in addition terrestrial endolithic life shows unanticipated propensities to survive in caves and other hostile environments 106 107 142146however as inviting as these proposals are in regards to panspermia for the single known origin of life on the earth no evidence except for organic compounds and goldilocks environments are provided in support moreover and most damaging is the hard experimental evidence that amino acids will not survive the solar wind to a depth of 5 cm of regolith let alone the high temperature susceptibilities of biological components and organelles found in any biochemistry and biology textbooks 54the dangers of contamination as a direct result of human exploration has been pointed out and discussed for some time  especially in regards to contamination of the moon and mars in addition it is keenly indicated that samples returned to earth then inevitably will contain such contamination and thus distort any subsequent analyses 147 148 moreover depending upon the ability of microbial life to replicate which it has shown even on the earth to have great capabilities to survive extreme environments such replication could result in further evolution of such life to then become more toxic and pathogenic this is an additional stipulation unexplored as yetthe obverse issue of contamination is whether terrestrial environments could be harmed by toxic and disease-causing reverse contamination  ie derived from outside the earth 149 these authors conclude that there is very little reason to be concerned and provide a list of reasons why this is of very low probability to occur in the future the authors thus ignore the lessons taught by all the hundreds of millions of human and animal mortalities and morbidities that have occurred due to microorganisms including viruses throughout the last few thousand years of known history on the earth cf other chapters in this book as well as references 40 49 most of the epidemics and pandemics were unanticipated occurred due to lack of understanding of the biology and epidemiology of infectious diseases as well as lack of understanding of basic molecular biology and biochemistry this is of course an ongoing process and emphasizes the need for greater caution than is the normbefore the grave issue of whether there is life on mars or not is decided proposals are being made to terraform mars and for example increase the martial surface temperature to bring it more into the goldilocks zone 150 ie more fit for human habitation clearly this will degrade the problem from being feasible with scientific difficultly to impossible and a great opportunity for such study will be lost that is to say if it has not already been lost due to the various objects that have been propelled to mars it is important to note that methods for prevention of microbial contamination were in a lower lack of expertise when the first landers were placed on mars even upto contemporary times as mentioned although there are many cogent proposals for improved microbial disinfection there is a lack of organization and standardization that demonstrates lack of clarity and purpose in this regard  since the inception of martian exploration - to prevent terrestrial microbial infection and biological waste on marsthere is a concern in addition to the conundrum as to whether panspermia has occurred among stars and solar systems within galaxies synthetic panspermia in addition to the accidental spread of viral and bacterial contamination of goldilocks potential habitats as previously discussed there is the possibility of intentional seeding of life with synthetic organisms synthetic biology the first such steps have been taken by synthesis of microorganism genomes and their use in the assembly of bacteriasynthetic biology has appeared as a promising field for research into the nature of what is alive health and financial dynamics a few key stepping stones are the complete synthesis of several microorganism genomes poliovirus cdna by cello et al in 2002 phix174 bacteriophage dna by smith et al 2003 sars coronavirus genome by becker et al in 2008 and the complete synthesis of the mycoplasma genitalium genome in 2008 the assembly of a bacterial cell with synthesis of its genome by venter and colleagues was completed in 2010 hutchison synthesized a minimal bacterial genome in 2016 improvements in dna synthesis techniques assist continued work  difficulties encountered include production of longer than 1 kb synthons their assembly into larger structures the presence of dna sequences that are toxic to the host organism sequences that have increased secondary structures and repetitive sequences 151153as part of studies in evolutionary biology as synthetic biology advances organisms may be produced that have evolutionary potential adult stem cells and pluripotent cells are used to assist in organ repair in various medical situations a major hypothesis being researched is whether there are universal stem cells in the adult that exhibit a sufficiently elevated degree of plasticity circulate throughout the blood stream able to enter various organs and then perform their functions 154 155additionally it should be noted that possibly the ability to produce stem cells must have occurred early in evolution prior to the divergence within the eukaryote kingdom since both plants and animals have stem cells however some plants tested can be produced from adult isolated single cells this is of interest because both plants and animals were exposed to darwinian evolution 154156in application to panspermia and the origin of life as genetic and biological engineering progress a point may be reached whereby cells astrobiology stem cells are produced which have the capacity for evolution into various unknown and unanticipated life-forms under controlled laboratory conditions or when released into astrobiological goldilocks environmental conditions such astrobiology stem cells could be included as von neumann universal astrobiological constructor living machines 111 112ethical considerations are needed for all the topics covered by this chapter as in any scientific field this is essential in order to better understand the ethical imperatives of past current and future space exploration and its impact on the earth solar system and galactic astrobiology ethics in science is a well-developed field today and is being applied in the above contexts as well in addition the question of sustainability in connection with ethical analysis and understanding are also proposed 12 13 157159neutrinos are fundamental particles lepton fermions that are distinguished in what are termed actually three flavors electron muon and tau neutrinos they are produced in stars nuclear reactors particle accelerators radioactivity and in nuclear bomb explosions once created through what is termed the weak force w and z0 bosons although much lighter compared to all the other known particles neutrinos crisscross the universe rarely interacting with matter however they can metamorphose into each other in transit called oscillations and have internal clocks governing them when to do so be that as it may at the big bang apparently though a special fourth neutrino was produced that is different from the electron muon and tau neutrinos and has been navigating the universe for 14 billion years since the big bang 160168 all in all the universe is bathed in several generations and epochs of neutrinos and they are currently being mapped and characterized with a high level

				begindocument nuiuijnuj enddocumentiuijjwhere i represent the three neutrino flavors uij is the unitary matrix and j is the three putative neutrino masses which are currently under investigationit has been proposed originally by pasachoff and colleagues in 1979 that neutrino production by advanced civilizations may someday be detected when our own technologies may advance sufficiently strikingly stancil et al were able to demonstrate communication using detectors aimed at terrestrial-produced neutrinos 117 169174in fine ettore majorana proposed new types of fundamental particles that revolutionized unanticipated concepts of what matter composes the universe and thereby influenced how we may approach the problems of astrobiology and astrovirology in the known universe8 175178this chapter attempts to encompass and tackle a large problem in astrovirology and astrobiology there is a huge anthropomorphic prejudice that although life is unlikely the just-right goldilocks terrestrial conditions mean that the just-right balance of minerals and basic small molecules inevitably result in life as we know it throughout our solar system galaxy and the rest of the universe moreover when such conditions on planets such as ours may not be quite right for the origin of life it is popularly opined that asteroids and comets magically produce life or at the very least the important if not crucial components of terrestrial life so that life then blooms when their fragments cruise the solar system stars and galaxies and plummet onto appropriately bedecked planets and moons be that as it may it is agreed that life shapes the milieu in which viruses evolve and vice versaon the one hand we need to understand how viruses and life originated and evolved on the earth and indeed great progress has been made on the other hand we should not assume it is safe to collide with similar or different forms of life as we and or our machines travel elsewhere the identification of goldilocks zone worlds does not self-evidently support the assumption of life but is indicative rather of our possible ability to live on such worlds hopefully without damaging them space agencies and their governments have been well aware of the problems of biological contamination from earth of extraterrestrial places to be visited and explored improved priorities and regulation were set 179 180although such priorities were promulgated repeatedly the responsible officials apparently over-all ignored the forewarnings and difficulties pointed out and contamination has resulted within a few decades of sloppy and premature exploration severely annihilating our current and future ability to explore and possibly detect life under the correct pristine scientific conditions that our solar system had provided during some 5 billion years of its prior evolution examples of problems already in progress include innumerable artificial satellites orbit the earth many have been sent to orbit mars the moon and other planets asteroids and comets etc and many probes have crashed or landed on mars the moon as well as other objects and several have been propelled out of the solar system consequently these need to be fully catalogued and inventoried to ascertain more fully the extent of the contamination by terrestrial microorganisms and materials that contaminated these probes this microbial contamination problem is being addressed from a peer review and public perspective and should be corrected before further exacerbations of the problems are continued 181 182clearly if life were to exist on mars it could be deleterious and pathogenic for any terrestrial life especially if the goldilocks approach to life in our solar system were correct in addition some martian and terrestrial organisms could produce new life forms by synergistic symbiotic interactions as well as inter-breeding depending on their biochemistries which could then be pathogenic and have unanticipated stark effects surely as one surveys the history of terrestrial catastrophic epidemics and pandemics most were unanticipated and should be lessons not to under-rate the aggressiveness of many life-forms thus in summary pathogenicity to any terrestrial life could result from martian organisms terrestrial organisms that were conveyed to mars and pathogenicity could result in the martian and terrestrial contexts including new organisms that interbred in the obverse terrestrial life could be inimical to martian life this applies to all such exoplanetary explorationsfinally to obtain an enhanced perspective of the magnitude and difficulty of the biocontainment problem please refer to the chapter in this book by logue et al which addresses the issue of terrestrial biocontainment at the highest level bsl-4  for the most pathogenic terrestrial known viruses 29raw and minimally processed fruits and vegetables are typically sold to the consumer in a readytouse or ready toeat form these products do not generally contain preservatives or antimicrobial agents and rarely undergo any heat processing prior to consumption for many years raw fruits and vegetables have been implicated as vehicles for transmission of infectious microorganisms although fresh produce can support the growth andor survival of many pathogenic bacteria there is little published information on the stability of human pathogenic viruses on these food products viruses cannot grow in or on foods but may sometimes be present on fresh produce as a result of faecal contamination this contamination can arise at source in the growth and harvesting area from contact with polluted water and inadequately or untreated sewage sludge used for irrigation and fertilization alternatively fruits or vegetables handled by an infected person might become contaminated with virus and transmit infection the most frequently reported foodborne viral infections are viral gastroenteritis and hepatitis a both have been associated with the consumption of fresh fruit or vegetablesin recent years it has been recognized that viruses are an important cause of foodborne disease unlike bacteria viruses do not grow or multiply in or on foods but foods may become contaminated with human viruses and transmit infection there are many groups of viruses which could contaminate food items but the major foodborne viral pathogens are those that infect via the gastrointestinal tract such as the gastroenteritis viruses and hepatitis a virus it is these viruses that are the main subject of this reviewviruses that infect via the gastrointestinal tract are excreted in faeces and may also be present in vomit foods become contaminated either directly by infected people or through sewage pollution those enteric viruses which are commonly associated with foodborne outbreaks either cannot be cultured in the laboratory or can only be cultured with difficulty hence information and experimental studies on survival and recovery of viruses from foods often relates to other virus types that are readily cultured some of these viruses may be good models for important foodborne viral pathogens but others may have widely differing characteristics enteroviruses such as coxsackieviruses and vaccine strains of poliovirus have been used particularly they infect via the gastrointestinal tract occur in the environment as a result of sewage contamination and are relatively stable however there are very few published reports of foodborne outbreaks of illness caused by enterovirusesthere is the potential for contamination with other virus groups such as respiratory viruses although transmission to humans through foods has not been recognized infrequently endogenous contamination of meat and milk can occur with viruses such as tickborne encephalitis such zoonotic infections have been reviewed by sattar and tetro 2001 and need not be considered in this reviewthis group of viruses infects all age groups there is a variable incubation period of 1260 h which is thought to be dosedependent it occurs all year round although in temperate climates most infections occur over the winter months these viruses are responsible for both sporadic cases of gastroenteritis in the community and for outbreaks in schools hospitals old peoples homes hotels and cruise ships the national iid study indicated that viruses are the most common cause of iid in the community with nlv the most frequently reported organism wheeler et al 1999 food standards agency 2000 from 1992 to 1997 nlvs accounted for onethird of all gastroenteritis outbreaks reported to the phls communicable disease surveillance centre cdsc and the number of outbreaks of nlv gastroenteritis exceeded the number of outbreaks of salmonellosis unlike the salmonellosis outbreaks however only 6 of the nlv outbreaks were known to be food or waterborne appleton 2000 the virus is extremely infectious and secondary cases are a characteristic feature of foodborne outbreaks therefore it is not always possible to determine whether illness is acquired from a foodborne source or by persontoperson transmission see table 1 this accounts partly for underrecognition of the extent of foodborne transmission of these viruses in a review of nlv srsv infection in england and wales between 1990 and 1995 by the phls direct foodborne transmission could be ascertained in only 14 of outbreaks dedman et al 1998there have been reports of outbreaks where nlvs have been epidemiologically associated with various items of fresh produce such as washed salads lieb 1985 lo et al 1994 imported frozen raspberries ponka et al 1999 coleslaw currier 1996 green salads griffin et al 1982 fresh cut fruits herwaldt et al 1994 and potato salad patterson et al 1997the virus was discovered in 1972 by electron microscopy kapikian et al 1972 fig 1 the first virus originated from the town of norwalk in the united states and became the prototype of the group the name small roundstructured virus srsv which describes the morphology of the virus particle caul and appleton 1982 appleton 2000 was used in the united kingdom and elsewhere until recently it has now been agreed informally by virologists working with this group to adopt the name norwalklike virus for the present so as to bring some conformity to the nomenclature of these viruses however formal names have not yet been agreed by the international committee on virus nomenclature the nlvs form a complex group of viruses they have formally been classified with the caliciviridae and are often referred to as human caliciviruses they are split into two broad genogroups most viruses in these two groups have the typical morphology of a 3035 nm diameter particle with an amorphous surface and ragged outline as originally described for the srsv group caul and appleton 1982 within the caliciviridae there is a second genus of human gastroenteritis viruses provisionally named sapporolike viruses slvs the slvs have the morphology of classical caliciviruses and are genomically distinct from the nlvs green et al 2000 on sequencing some strains with classical calicivirus morphology fall into the nlv genus there are suggestions that the epidemiology of slvs differs from nlvs in that slvs mainly cause infections of young children it is not clear whether slvs are of significance in foodborne infections and more studies are needed to clarify their role genotypic analysis is being used increasingly to investigate the epidemiology of these two groups of viruses fankhauser et al 1998 maguire et al 1999 hale et al 2000 hedlund et al 2000 koopmans et al 2000 there are several serotypes of human caliciviruses which correspond broadly with the genotypic groups most studies have been carried out with nlvs and indicate that immunity is complex and shortlived matsui and greenberg 2000 volunteer studies have shown that people can be infected repeatedly with the same virus strain parrino et al 1977 johnson et al 1990rotaviruses mainly infect young children sattar et al 2001 it is estimated that they cause one million deaths a year in children under 5 years of age mostly in developing countries in developed countries deaths are relatively rare but rotavirus gastroenteritis is the most frequent reason for admission of young children to hospital rotaviruses consistently account for around 80 of all gastroenteritis viruses reported to cdsc although this figure is probably biased by reports of hospitalized children rather than the occurrence in the community where nlvs are of greater significance foodborne and particularly waterborne spread are probably a significant route of transmission in developing countries but in developed countries reports are rare table 1the astroviruses form a morphologically distinct group of viruses and are named from the five or sixpoint star seen by electron microscopy on the surface of some particles astroviruses have mainly been associated with illness in young children often under 1 year of age reports of astrovirus infection in older children and adults are infrequent although outbreaks have been reported in the elderly this may reflect testing policy detection normally relies on electron microscopy which is insensitive and often not performed on sporadic samples from adults the use of more sensitive molecular detection methods is required to assess the incidence and epidemiology of these viruses astroviruses have been seen in some adults following the consumption of shellfish or contaminated water but these incidents appear to be comparatively rare kurtz and lee 1987 kurtz 1994 table 1the most characteristic symptom of hepatitis a is jaundice but milder symptoms of nausea and general malaise without jaundice are common patients may feel unwell for several weeks but recovery is complete deaths are rare some infections particularly in children may be asymptomatic like viral gastroenteritis transmission is by the faecaloral route but the primary site of viral replication is the liver virus excretion may commence up to a week before symptoms are apparent making control difficultthe epidemiology of foodborne hepatitis a is essentially similar to that of viral gastroenteritis food and waterborne outbreaks have been recognized for over 40 years but are infrequently reported epidemiological evidence to link hepatitis infection to food and water sources is sparse because of the long incubation period between 1992 and 1997 228 outbreaks occurring in england and wales were reported to cdsc but only one of these was known to be foodborne that outbreak was associated with shellfish from 1992 to 1999 cdsc received 19 747 laboratoryconfirmed reports of cases of hepatitis a the source of most of these infections was unknown and just 155 were recorded as foodborne in the united states the centers for disease control and prevention cdc placed hepatitis a as the sixth leading cause of foodborne disease from 1988 to 1992 centers for disease control and prevention 1996outbreaks associated with fresh produce particularly soft fruits and salads have been reported from several countries iceberg lettuce rosenblum et al 1990 strawberries niu et al 1992 diced tomatoes williams et al 1995 and salad items pebody et al 1998 have all been implicated a recent outbreak of hepatitis a in the united states was associated with consumption of food items containing frozen strawberries imported from mexico anon 1997 cliver 1997 in the united kingdom outbreaks have been traced to frozen raspberries there was evidence that the raspberries in these outbreaks were contaminated by infected fruitpickers noah 1981 reid and robinson 1987 ramsay and upton 1989there is only one serotype of hepatitis a following infection immunity is lifelong an effective vaccine is available currently it is used for persons at high risk such as travellers department of health et al 1996 food packagers and food handlers in the united kingdom have not been associated with hav transmission sufficiently often to justify routine immunization except in outbreaks the incidence of hepatitis a in developed countries has fallen in recent years and hence a susceptible population has built up as endemic infection declines it is possible that an increase in foodborne outbreaks will be seen the yearround global distribution of fruit and vegetable products poses a risk of infection particularly when these products are imported from countries with a high incidence of hepatitis ahepatitis e has been associated with large waterborne outbreaks in some developing countries notably in asia africa and central america foodborne transmission has been suggested but not proved conclusively illness appears more severe than hepatitis a particularly in pregnant women where a death rate of 1733 has been observed cromeans et al 2001 the primary source of infection appears to be contaminated water rather than persontoperson spread secondary persontoperson transmission is estimated at only 078 cromeans et al 2001 cases in the united kingdom are reported infrequently and are mainly imported from endemic areas with the worldwide distribution of foods vigilance should be maintainedviruses are very small microorganisms and basically comprise a nucleic acid core of either dna or rna surrounded by a protein coat they require living cells in order to replicate and generally have a very restricted host range viruses do not multiply in foods or water or in or on any other environmental sample however viruses can survive outside living cells and remain infectiousenteric viruses are hardy and survive well in the environment these viruses survive on inanimate surfaces on hands and in dried faecal suspensions green et al 1998a barrymurphy et al 2000 bidawid et al 2000 sattar et al 2000 lingering outbreaks have occurred in hospitals in residential homes and on cruise ships probably as a result of environmental contamination nlvs have been detected by pcr in environmental swabs from hospital lockers and hotel carpets supposedly cleaned after incidents of vomiting green et al 1998a the viruses survive just as well on kitchen surfaces and food preparation areas in one reported outbreak a kitchen worker vomited into a sink the following day the sink which had been cleaned with a chlorinebased disinfectant was used for washing salad and an outbreak of gastroenteritis associated with nlvs ensued patterson et al 1997enteric viruses are acid stable and so are able to survive in the gastrointestinal tract it is likely that they will survive food processes designed to produce the low ph that inhibits bacterial spoilage organisms eg pickling in vinegar and fermentation processes that produce foods such as yoghurt both nlvs and hepatitis a virus retain activity after exposure to acidity levels below ph 3 dolin et al 1972 scholtz et al 1989most viruses remain infectious after refrigeration and freezing frozen foods that have not received further cooking have been implicated in a number of incidents of viral gastroenteritis and hepatitis a noah 1981 reid and robinson 1987 ramsay and upton 1989 niu et al 1992 gastroenteritis viruses and hepatitis a virus are inactivated by conventional cooking processes but retain their infectivity after heating to 60c for 30 min dolin et al 1972 parry and mortimer 1984 fleming et al 1985 millard et al 1987 slomka and appleton 1998 it is uncertain whether they would be inactivated completely in some pasteurization processesnlvs cannot be cultured in the laboratory and until recently detection relied on the use of electron microscopy this technique is fairly insensitive and requires a minimum of 106 virus particles per ml of sample it has been used widely for detection of virus in faecal samples from patients but cannot be used for looking for the lower concentration of virus particles present in contaminated food water and environmental samples sequencing of the genome of the norwalk virus has led to the development of pcr assays with greatly enhanced sensitivity for virus detection ando et al 2000 however there is great genomic diversity among the nlvs and one set pcr primers will not detect all strains norcott et al 1994 pcr assays are being used for the examination of food samples particularly shellfish but far more complex nucleic acid extraction techniques are required than when working with clinical specimens from patients atmar et al 1993 green et al 1998b there are also greater problems with naturally occurring inhibitors to the pcr reaction in these types of samples nlvs have been detected in samples of raspberries associated with an outbreak of gastroenteritis in quebec sequence analysis demonstrated that the strain of nlv identified in the raspberries was identical to that found in the patients gaulin et al 1999 expression of recombinant virus capsids in yeast and insect cells is allowing the development of elisabased diagnostic assays but reagents are not widely available and so far the tests only detect a very limited number of nlv strains jiang et al 2000 further development and more widespread use of elisa tests will greatly facilitate the detection of nlvs in clinical samples although such tests may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect virus in food samples at the present time pcr and elisa assays for nlvs are only available in specialist laboratories and are not used for the routine testing of food samples commercial test kits are not yet availablerotavirus and astrovirus can both be grown in cell cultures in the laboratory however it is unreliable and timeconsuming for isolation from primary specimens and is not normally used rotavirus is frequently detected using commercial elisa or latex agglutination tests and pcr assays are available rotavirus has been detected in lettuce hernandez et al 1997 and shellfish samples but it is not clear if these were of human origin electron microscopy is still the most usual method for the detection of astroviruses although pcr assays are used in a few laboratoriesdiagnosis of hepatitis a infection in patients is by detection of specific igm antibody since virus excretion has largely ceased by the time illness becomes apparent the virus can be cultured in the laboratory but this is a long and unreliable procedure in one outbreak at a summer camp in the united states virus was isolated from the drinking water supply but this took 21 weeks pcr assays have been developed and have been used for detecting virus in water shellfish and other food and environmental samples due to the long incubation period of hepatitis a food items are not usually available for testing even if suspected as the source of illness in particular minimally processed fruits and vegetables have a short shelf lifethere have been a few experimental studies to investigate seeding and recovery of viruses from fresh produce transfer of hepatitis a virus to lettuce leaves has been investigated bidawid et al 2000 sattar et al 2000 rotavirus and poliovirus were recovered from the surface of vegetables in a method described by badawy et al 1985b average recovery rates of 80 and 65 respectively were obtained from lettuce however recovery of rotavirus from nonleafy vegetables was lower averaging 44 ward et al 1982 also recovered poliovirus and adenovirus from vegetable surfaces obtaining mean efficiencies of approximately 5558 there is a need to develop more effective quantitative methods in order to assess the survival of viruses on fresh produce and to determine the decontamination efficiencies of current commercial washing systems for fruit and vegetablesfruits and vegetables may become contaminated with viruses in two ways first they may be contaminated in their growing area before harvest by coming into contact with inadequately treated sewage or sewage polluted water secondly contamination can arise during processing storage distribution or final preparation either directly from infected people or by contact with a contaminated environment in most outbreaks of foodborne viral disease involving fresh produce it is not known whether contamination took place before during or after harvestguidelines issued by the world health organization state that fruits and vegetables to be eaten raw should not be fertilized with sewage or irrigated with contaminated water beuchat 1998 sewage sludge is sometimes applied to agricultural land with the benefit that useful plant nutrients and organic matter are recycled to the soil however the uk government is proposing more stringent controls for harvesting vegetables from land where conventionally processed sewage sludge is applied adas 2000 the transmission of viruses is thought to be mainly by surface contamination there are relatively few reported studies on the possible uptake of viruses within damaged plant tissues during primary growth studies with poliovirus report that virus can infiltrate into the roots and body of plants from the soil oron et al 1995 but there is no evidence of illness from this source viruses from sewage do not bind readily with soil particles and can enter groundwaters leading to contamination of water sourcesthe viruses causing gastroenteritis and hepatitis a appear to be extremely infectious in very low doses large numbers of virus particles can be excreted in the faeces from an infected person levels of the order of 1061011 infective units per gram have been estimated feachem et al 1983 poor personal hygiene is therefore a major route through which viruses can directly reach foods virus can be transferred from faecally contaminated fingers to foods or to work surfaces and door handles there is a significant risk of contamination from field workers who do not have adequate onsite toilet and handwashing facilities even when these facilities are put in place the workers need to be supervised in such a way as to ensure that the facilities are used cliver 1994 in an outbreak of hepatitis a associated with frozen raspberries infection was confirmed in a fruit picker on the farm where the raspberries were cultivated ramsay and upton 1989 a number of outbreaks have also been linked to contamination of fresh produce from the vomitus of infected food handlers caul et al 1988 it has been suggested that between 20 and 30 million virus particles are liberated during vomiting reid et al 1988 caul 1994 as well as direct transmission aerosols produced by vomiting can contaminate exposed food or surfaces with subsequent transfer to foodshuman enteric viruses will potentially be present in any type of water contaminated by human faecal material and by sewage the department of environment transport and regions detr jointly with uk water industry research limited and the environment agency recently commissioned four reviews on enteroviruses these covered the source sellwood et al 1999 and survival irving and morris 1999 in the environment and their fate through sewage treatment processes merrett and weatherley 1999 mounting evidence suggests that viruses can survive long enough and in high enough numbers to cause human diseases through direct contact with polluted water or contaminated foods nasser 1994 bosch 1995 irving and morris 1999 concluded that a thorough and valid assessment of the occurrence and significance of viruses in natural waters is hampered by lack of reliable information they suggested that this is due to inefficient analytical techniques and because different analytical methods have been used so that comparisons on survival data between different studies cannot be made however it does appear that different types of viruses are inactivated at different rates under identical conditions and therefore no single microorganism can be expected to be an indicator for all virusestemperature is an important factor with low temperatures favouring viral survival in natural waters raphael et al 1985 found no significant drop in rotavirus titre after 64 days at 4c in raw water treated tap water or filtered water however a 99 drop in titre was observed after 10 days at 20c astrovirus survival has been demonstrated in drinking water after 90 days at 4c abad et al 1997b nasser et al 1993 concluded that hepatitis a virus and poliovirus could survive in wastewater and groundwater for 90 days or more at 10c  hepatitis a virus and poliovirus were shown to survive in excess of one year in mineral water stored at 4c biziagos et al 1988 hepatitis a virus can survive in fresh or salt water for up to a year sobsey et al 1988evidence suggests that adsorption of viruses to particulate matter and sediments confers substantial protection against inactivating influences salinity and ph do not appear to have a significant direct effect on virus survival under conditions normally found in natural waters but may have indirect effects by modifying interaction of viruses with particulates there is some evidence that solar radiation promotes inactivation of viruses but the effects have not been extensively studieddevelopment of pcrbased assays has allowed the detection of nlvs in both river water and seawater sellwood et al 2000 wynjones et al 2000 in 1997 an outbreak of nlv gastroenteritis occurred among canoeists and was associated with river water at a water sports centre gray et al 1997 when hepatitis a virus was detected in lettuce from costa rica it was suggested that the possible source of contamination was the discharge of untreated sewage into river water used to irrigate crops which is common practice in some less welldeveloped countries hernandez et al 1997 in another outbreak of hepatitis a traced to commercially distributed lettuce or tomatoes it was hypothesized that contamination may have occurred in the fields from dirty water used for growing or irrigation or possibly from the use of night soil although this was difficult to prove rosenblum et al 1990enteric viruses may contaminate soil through the land disposal of sewage sludge and dirty irrigation water a number of research studies have investigated the survival of human pathogenic viruses in soils with conflicting results survival appears to depend on a number of different variables particularly the growing season soil temperature rainfall soil type and composition for example viable poliovirus was recovered from sprayirrigated soil after 96 days during the winter season sullivan and tierney 1976 tierney et al 1977 this compared to a maximum survival period of only 11 days during the summer which suggested the higher temperature and solar radiation levels in the warmer seasons accelerated viral inactivation the possibility also exists that viruses may be mechanically transmitted to fruits and vegetables during harvest sadovski et al 1978 noted the persistence of inoculated poliovirus in drip irrigation pipes and soil moderate environmental conditions and alluvialtype soil which restricts water infiltration enhanced viral recoveries in the upper soil layers oron et al 1995 found that relatively high soil temperature 30c and a low moisture content hindered poliovirus survival wet soil conditions are frequently associated with low soil temperature gerba 1983 reported that a large proportion of outbreaks of waterborne disease in the unite states resulted from contaminated groundwater climate the nature of the soil and the nature of the resident microflora determine virus survival and retention within soil particles both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions are thought to contribute towards virus adsorption and are controlled by the characteristics of the soilsome investigations have focused on the survival of viruses on inanimate environmental surfaces such as stainless steel glass and plastics abad et al 1994 observed that a range of enteric viruses including hepatitis a virus and rotavirus persisted for extended periods greater than 30 days on several types of porous and nonporous surfaces greater virus survival was noted at 4c than at 20c the effect of relative humidity on survival of hepatitis a virus on nonporous surfaces has been investigated bidawid et al 2000 sattar et al 2000 at 5c relative humidity had little effect on survival time but at 20c survival was longest when relative humidity was low it is apparent from the lingering outbreaks that have occurred on cruise ships that nlvs survive well on environmental surfaces nlvs have been detected in swabs of lockers in hospital outbreaks and from hotel carpets green et al 1998a barrymurphy et al 2000 a disinfectant formulation is considered to be effective if it is capable of inducing a 1000fold 999 or greater reduction in the virus titre lloydevans et al 1986 springthorpe et al 1986 experimental studies have shown that a free chlorine level of 5000 ppm reduced the infectivity titre by more than 999 on stainlesssteel disks contaminated with the enteric viruses coxsackievirus b3 and hepatitis a virus and the respiratory viruses adenovirus type 5 parainfluenza virus type 3 and coronavirus 229e sattar et al 1989 mbithi et al 1990 the virucidal action of sodium hypochlorite 1250 ppm at ph 956 was also tested against hepatitis a virus human rotavirus and a bacteroides fragilis bacteriophage dried on polystyrene abad et al 1997a overall a less than 1000fold titre reduction was achieved for all the viruses examined chlorine is a common disinfectant used by many fresh produce processors to wash fruits and vegetables beuchat 1998 seymour 1999 however chlorine levels greater than 200 ppm are thought to cause adverse discoloration bleaching and off flavours in the finished product hurst and schuler 1992survival times for some enteric viruses have been determined on a range of different fruit and vegetable commodities it is difficult to draw conclusions from the different studies since experimental conditions and methods varied however most of these studies report viability in excess of the product shelf life konowalchuk and speirs 1974 established no significant loss in coxsackievirus b5 titre when contaminated lettuce was stored for 16 d under moist conditions at 4c but some inactivation took place during storage under dry conditions they hypothesized that under conditions of low or no moisture the aqueous part of the virus inoculum evaporated leaving the virus exposed to air andor salts celery lettuce and carrots stored at 4c supported the survival of a range of enteric viruses for up to 8 days konowalchuk and speirs 1975a
badawy et al 1985a indicated that rotavirus sa11 a simian rotavirus that can be cultured survived on lettuce radishes and carrots for up to 30 days at 4c viral inactivation at room temperature 25c was significantly greater than at 4c however viable rotavirus sa11 was still detected on lettuce after 25 days they concluded that the rough or irregular surfaces present on lettuce might offer some additional protection for virus particles indeed protected segments of plants such as the roots closed leaves and internal fruit parts may offer favourable conditions that increase survival time up to 60 days smith 1982 viable poliovirus was recovered from effluent sprayirrigated lettuce and radishes 23 days after inoculation tierney and sullivan 1976 tierney et al 1977 sadovski et al 1978 isolated polioviruses from cucumbers grown in effluentirrigated soil for a full 8 days after inoculation oron et al 1995 investigated the transmission of poliovirus from subsurface dripirrigated soil to tomato plant leaves and tomato fruits virus was not detected in the tomato fruits however a number of leaf samples were positive for poliovirus even though the virus was injected 10 cm below the surface of the soil this result suggests that poliovirus can penetrate into plant tissue through the root system the lack of viable poliovirus in the tomato fruits may be due to the presence of antiviral substances as witnessed by other authorschilled storage temperatures 28c typically retard respiration senescence product browning moisture loss and microbial growth in minimally processed fruits and vegetables but may contribute to the survival and transmission of viruses to the human host
konowalchuk and speirs 1975b 1976 described the potent antiviral properties of different fruit extracts at neutral ph particularly strawberry they found significant differences in viral recovery on strawberries cherries and peaches held in a humid atmosphere at 4c recoveries of coxsackievirus and echovirus were also greater than those of poliovirus and reovirus although the authors did not offer an explanation for this result most of the aqueous fruit extracts and infusions demonstrated notable antiviral properties although the active compounds were not isolated these agents could be phenolic in nature in grapes these chemicals are thought to be located primarily in the skin konowalchuk and speirs 1977 fruits and vegetables are known to contain a vast array of antimicrobial substances particularly organic acids phenolic and sulphur compounds and small polypeptide proteins despite this outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis and hepatitis a have been associated with fruits and fruit juices in the absence of formal studies it could be inferred that the gastroenteritis and hepatitis a viruses are relatively resistant to these virucidal chemicalsin view of the increasing use of readytoeat vegetables sold in modified atmosphere packaging map the survival of hepatitis a virus on lettuce in map stored at room temperature and 4c has been investigated bidawid et al 2000 survival at 4c was the same in map as under normal conditions of packaging at room temperature viral survival was slightly better in map containing higher carbon dioxide levels it was suggested that enhanced virus survival might be due to inhibition of ethylene by carbon dioxide resulting in reduced physiological spoilage of vegetables such as lettuce and possibly less toxic effects on the virus studies have indicated that indigenous microflora in the water environment are deleterious to survival of enteric viruses raphael et al 1985 these findings highlight the importance of avoiding contamination of food items before packaging in map sattar et al 2000
bardell 1997 studied the survival of herpes simplex virus type 1 suspended in saliva on the skin of tomatoes and the upper surface of lettuce although storage times of only 1 h were studied temperature was shown to have a significant effect on virus titre there was no loss of virus infectivity titre at 2c compared to a 2log reduction at room temperature 2224c although not an enteric virus and not a virus that comes to mind as a possible foodborne infection herpes viruses could invade through the mucous membranes of the mouthnumerous authors have reported on the efficacy of disinfectants for the inactivation of readily culturable human viruses using standard suspension tests but data for gastroenteritis viruses and hepatitis a virus are lacking the authors of this review were unable to find any data on the effectiveness of disinfectants and processing aids for the decontamination of enteric viruses on fruits and vegetablesthe most commonly used sanitizers and processing aids for cleaning fruits and vegetables are chlorine chlorine dioxide organic acids and surfactants while ozone is receiving renewed interest the mechanism of action of these disinfectants on viruses and their interaction with plant materials is poorly understood and there are conflicting reports on their efficacy there are no positive lists of permitted processing aids in the united kingdom or european community although an inventory has been produced by the codex alimentarius commission codex alimentarius general requirements volume 1 a 2nd edition 1995 faowho isbn 9251037620 directive 988ec of the european parliament contains a list of biocidal products which have been approved and authorized for use council regulation eec no 209291 highlights the food additives processing aids and other substances permitted for the organic production of agricultural products the use of chlorine for the treatment of organically grown fruits and vegetables has recently been banned in the united kingdom and the fresh produce industry is currently trying to find viable and effective alternativeschlorine is the most widely used disinfectant for washing fresh produce because it is relatively cheap easy to use and exhibits rapid microbiological action in aqueous solution elphick 1998 the food and drug administration fda in the united states permits the use of chlorine as a disinfectant in wash spray and flume waters in the raw fruit and vegetable industry garret 1992 however in certain ec countries chlorine is not permitted as a wash water additive disinfectants such as chlorine and ozone have a strong affinity for organic matter and are used up rapidly in wash tanks containing dirty produce therefore for any washing system it is important to monitor and control the level of disinfectant at all times to ensure that it is optimal it is also imperative to maintain chlorine disinfectants within a suitable ph range boyette et al 1993 chlorinebased disinfectants are usually considered to be the most effective against enteric viruses however nlvs and hepatitis a virus appear to be relatively resistant to chlorine grabow et al 1983 peterson et al 1983 keswick et al 1985 nlvs are inactivated by 10 mg chlorine l1 which is the concentration used to treat a water supply after a contamination incident in the united states a level of 5 mg chlorine l1 with a contact time of 1 min is recommended for inactivation of hepatitis a virus in recent studies doultree et al 1999 feline calicivirus was shown to be surprisingly resistant to chlorine requiring 1000 mg l1 freshly reconstituted granular hypochlorite for complete inactivation clearly there is a need for further studies on disinfection of these persistent organismschlorine dioxide is not as susceptible to ph changes or the presence of organic matter as chlorine simons and sanguansri 1997 chlorine dioxide is unstable must be generated onsite and can be explosive when concentrated the oxidizing power of chlorine dioxide is reported to be about 25 times that of chlorine beuchat 1998 however zhang and farber 1996 found no significant difference in decontamination efficiency between chlorine and chlorine dioxide several authors have reported the sensitivity of a range of animal viruses to chlorine dioxide harakeh 1987 chen and vaughn 1990 although there is no information for nlvs and hepatitis a virusorganic acids can occur naturally in many fruits and vegetables and may retard the growth of some microorganisms and prevent the growth of others beuchat 1998 most of these acids behave primarily as fungistatic agents while others are more effective at inhibiting bacterial growth these include acetic citric succinic malic tartaric benzoic propanoic and sorbic acids due to recent changes in legislation washes and sprays containing organic acids are becoming more popular for the processing of organically grown fruits and vegetables a number of products are now commercially available however scholtz et al 1989 found that hepatitis a virus remained infectious for 90 min at ph 1 nlvs and hepatitis a virus survive exposure to acidity levels below ph 3 while rotavirus is inactivated below ph 3 and above ph 10 dolin et al 1972 palmer et al 1977 weiss and clark 1987 scholtz et al 1989 viruses that infect via the gastrointestinal tract are acid stable since they have to survive the harsh low ph environment of the stomach organic acids are therefore unlikely to have a significant effect on the viability of hepatitis a virus and nlvs during the typically short contact times used for washing fruits and vegetables seymour 1999several authors have reported the action of surfactants wetting agents in combination with disinfectants adams et al 1989 zhang and farber 1996 however these agents may reduce the antimicrobial effect of chlorine disinfectants and adversely affect product quality adams et al 1989ozone is lethal to a wide variety of microorganisms including enteric viruses finch and fairbairn 1991 it is a potent oxidizing agent is very reactive and unstable leaves no residues in water and naturally decomposes into ordinary oxygen this absence of toxicity is one of its major advantages over chlorine disinfectants ozone has recently been approved as a disinfectant for food applications in the united states graham 1997 and industry suppliers are working to develop appropriate systems for fresh produce washing ozone is unstable cannot be stored and must therefore be generated onsite however due to perceived safety problems and a lack of information on the efficacy of ozone this technology has not yet been readily taken up in europe although ozone can be used safely it can cause irritation of the eyes headache dryness of the throat and coughing at exposure levels in the range of 0110 ppm boisrobert et al 1998 the occupational safety and health administration osha has set the permissible exposure limit of workers to ozone at 01 ppm if ozone is to be used in aqueous or gaseous form it is essential that the air is monitored for ozone and that suitable control measures are in place to remove itthe control of foodborne viral infection was considered in the report of the advisory committee on the microbiological safety of food 1998 sewage pollution is a major factor in the contamination of food and water this is particularly pertinent to fruits and vegetables that will not be cooked before consumption untreated or inadequately treated sewage discharged into natural waters can cause contamination of crops sewage sludge is applied to agricultural land with the benefit that useful plant nutrients are recycled to the soil in april 2000 the agricultural development and advisory service adas uk published the safe sludge matrix adas 2000 this document gives clear guidance on the minimum acceptable level of treatment for any sewage sludge applied to agricultural land and provides a framework to ensure microbiological safety as from 31 december 1999 application of all untreated sludge on agricultural land used to grow food crops has been prohibited in the united kingdom use on all agricultural land will be prohibited from the end of 2001 untreated sludge is produced by either the primary settlement or secondary biological stages of sewage treatment further processing may be undertaken to produce treated sludge resulting in improved stability and a reduction in health hazards and odour problems maff 1998 currently treated sludge may be applied to land used for salad crops but harvesting is not permitted for 30 months vegetables cannot be harvested for 12 months a 10month harvest interval is required if enhanced treated sludge is used all applications must comply with the sludge use in agriculture regulations 1989 and detr code of practice 1986 these controls may help to reduce the risks of microbiological contamination of fruits and vegetables in the uk but still do not address the potential problem of imported produce from countries with different standards for organic fertilisers or irrigation waterthe other major source of contamination is from infected people handling food people with symptoms should be excluded from food handling however foodhandlers with only very minimal symptoms have been implicated in transmission of viral gastroenteritis current recommendations state that foodhandlers should be allowed to return to work 48 h after symptoms have ceased phls 1993 these recommendations appear to work satisfactorily but were based on the rapid decrease in virus excretion observed by electron microscopy using more sensitive pcr assays nlvs can be detected for longer periods than electron microscopy and in some instances for up to a week after onset of symptoms it is not clear if people shedding virus detectable by pcr are infectious but recommendations on how long to exclude people from foodhandling need to be kept under review the main period of excretion for hepatitis a virus is before symptoms become apparent and therefore control is difficult the wearing of disposable gloves is recommended if foods are to be manipulated by hand but this does not prevent transfer of viruses to gloves by touching contaminated surfacesif vomiting occurs virus may be spread over a wide area in aerosol droplets uncovered food that is not to receive cooking should be discarded the environment should be thoroughly cleaned including work surfaces sinks and door handles recent studies by the phls demonstrated the presence of virus on surfaces and materials that had been cleaned by recommended decontamination methods this suggests that the current recommendations for the removal of nlvs from contaminated surfaces are inadequate barrymurphy et al 2000
cliver 1995 advised thorough cooking of viruscontaminated foods however readytoeat fruits and vegetables are unlikely to withstand such harsh treatment and may show deleterious changes in sensory quality larkin 1981 suggested a wash at 80c for 2 min to ensure the microbiological safety of fresh produce he concluded that this heat treatment does not affect the appearance and taste of most fruits and vegetables provided the food is eaten within 24 h however the majority of minimally processed fruits and vegetables require a shelf life in excess of 1 day and therefore this heating step is not applicablemeticulous attention to good food handling practices and education is essential there should be provision of adequate toilet and handwashing facilities not only in the catering and retail industry but also for farm workersthere is an effective vaccine for hepatitis a and it has been suggested that food handlers should be vaccinated cliver 1997 epidemiological data currently suggest that foodhandlers in the united kingdom do not pose a significantly greater risk of transmitting hepatitis a infection than other people and use of vaccine in this group may not be costeffective no vaccines have been developed for nlvs but research studies with nlv recombinant capsid antigens offer the potential for future development of vaccines there are challenges however in designing effective vaccines in that first there are multiple types of nlvs and secondly the mechanisms for inducing immunity to these agents is poorly understood estes et al 2000fresh produce contributes to the transmission of viral infections there is a lack of information on the survival of viruses on fresh produce related to shelf life and types of packaging information is also lacking on the efficiency of current washing and decontamination processes for the removal of viruses studies are therefore required to provide this information for nlvs and hepatitis a virus in particular there is a need for information on rotaviruses and astroviruses both these viruses have been implicated in foodborne and waterborne outbreaks in the united kingdom although only very infrequently the role and extent of food or waterborne transmission needs to be more clearly defined for both these virusesthe infectivity of nlvs and hepatitis a virus is difficult to study in the laboratory nlvs cannot be cultured in vitro and culture techniques for hepatitis a virus are timeconsuming other viruses that can be cultured readily have been used as models for these pathogens in a number of studies although only the use of specific human pathogenic viruses will give clear and unequivocal data on survival inactivation and removal this is not always safe and practical model systems using similar nonpathogenic human or mammalian viruses may be the most satisfactory alternative for example feline calicivirus has been used as a model system for nlvs in assessing the efficacy of commercially available disinfectants doultree et al 1999 feline calicivirus was also used as a model for nlvs in another study on the heat treatment of shellfish slomka and appleton 1998 this organism would appear to be a good candidate for virus studies on fresh produce in order to undertake studies on the survival and removal of viruses there is a need to develop better methods for inoculation and recovery of virus from a range of fresh produce itemsthere have been recent suggestions that faecal coliforms on fresh produce may be an indicator of the probable presence of enteric viruses however several authors have found no significant correlation keswick et al 1982 le guyader et al 1993 despite the shortcomings of indicator organisms such as bacteriophages there is a need for a safe and convenient model that can be used to help the food industry to assess and optimize new treatment processes this is not intended as an indicator to monitor food samples directly other studies have shown that the behaviour and survival of bacteriophages mimic human viruses more closely than bacteria and would be suitable for such purposes the optimization of washing and decontamination processes to remove viruses from fruits and vegetables will ultimately contribute to the overall safety of these food productsthe authors acknowledge the financial support of the food standards agency for the production of this paper project bo2014emerging infectious diseases affecting humans wildlife and agriculture are often the result of a pathogen jumping from its original host into a novel host species this can take the form of spillover events that result in dead end infections or short stuttering transmission chains or a host shift with successful infection and sustained transmission in the new host box 1 host shifts have resulted in multiple human pandemics such as hiv from chimps 1 and the h1n1 spanish flu from birds 2 which have both killed tens of millions of people other important human pathogens have originated from other host species including plasmodium falciparum
3 sars coronavirus 4 hendra and nipah viruses 5 and the measles virus 6 past host shifts can be detected when the phylogenies of hosts and their pathogens are different phylogenetic incongruencebox 1 this is very common with a survey of the published literature finding 93 of studies comparing host and pathogen phylogenies showed evidence of host shifts 7 and there are relatively few cases where the pathogen phylogeny mirrors that of its host completely 8here we examine the evolutionary factors that affect a pathogens ability to infect a novel host and then discuss how the ability of a pathogen to adapt to be transmitted efficiently by a novel host can allow its long-term persistence following a host shift selection will favour mutations that allow a pathogen to a enter a host cell with greater efficiency and b fine tune or optimise their fitness in the new host for example by better utilising cellular machinery enhancing immune avoidance optimising virulence and maximising transmission potential our focus is on viruses owing to a wealth of recent studies and because rna viruses are the most likely group of pathogens to jump between hosts possibly because of their ability to rapidly adapt to new hosts 912 while we focus on genetics in this review behaviour and ecological processes are clearly a hugely important factor in determining whether a novel host is exposed to a novel pathogen and whether onward transmission occurs 10 1315the susceptibility of potential hosts varies enormously and an important predictor of susceptibility is how closely related a novel host is to a pathogens natural host figure 1a this phylogenetic distance effect has been repeatedly found using experimental cross infections in all major pathogen groups including studies of fruit flies and viruses 16 plants and fungi 17 18 beetles and spiroplasma bacteria 19 insects and wolbachia
20 and fruit flies and nematodes 21 this is presumably because close relatives of the natural host offer a similar environment to that which the pathogen is adapted to this is likely to be especially important for pathogens because of the myriad of molecular interactions pathogens have with their hosts to infect cells utilise resources and avoid or suppress the host immune responsereconstructions of host shifts in nature have confirmed that pathogens are more likely to shift between closely related species by reconstructing the phylogeny of rabies viruses isolated from various species of bat in north america it has been possible to look at the patterns of cross species transmission in the wild the rate of cross species transmission was greatest for closely related species 22 whether looking at spillover events recent infections that might not persist long-term or host shifts that successfully became established 13 similarly viruses and other parasites of mammals are most likely to be shared by more closely related hosts 10 23 24 25 26 additionally the phylogenies of hantaviruses and their rodent and insectivore hosts show evidence for host switching with data suggestive of preferential shifts between closely related species 27 however within these examples there are cases of pathogens transferring successfully over great phylogenetic distances 28 29closely related species may also have similar levels of susceptibility regardless of their distance from the pathogens natural host figure 1b 16 which we call the phylogenetic clade effect such effects could be due to certain host clades having lost or gained immune or cellular components that affect susceptibility to a given pathogen 30 this may mean that the host phylogeny is a patchwork of clades with varying levels of susceptibility with clades of susceptible hosts scattered across the tree sometimes in taxa distantly related to the pathogens natural host this has been demonstrated in experimental cross infections of fruit flies and sigma viruses 16 where after accounting for distance from the viruses natural hosts the effect of the host phylogeny explained almost all of the remaining variation in viral load if this pattern is common it may explain cases where viruses and other pathogens recurrently shift between distantly related taxa such as transmission of influenza viruses among birds pigs and humans 2 or human to bovid transmission of staphylococcus aureus
31 although host ecology likely also plays a role in these instancesthe strength of these effects of the host phylogeny varies between pathogen groups with rna viruses and pathogens that already have a broad host range being particularly prone to jumping between distantly related species 10 12 32at the molecular level the availability of suitable cell surface receptors to allow viruses to enter cells may be a cause of phylogenetic effects on host shifts for example the ability of an avian influenza virus to infect a host is initially at least partly determined by the presence and within-host distribution of 23-linked host sialic acid sa receptors 33some pathogens may already be pre-adapted to a novel host but specific mutations are often required to enhance a pathogens fitness in the new host if it is to establish successfully a diversity of traits may change to adapt the pathogen to its new host such as the efficiency of replication and avoidance or suppression of host immunity but the binding of host cell receptors is commonly especially importantin bacteriophage viruses of bacteria mutations that enhance a virus ability to bind to host cells are important in determining a virus ability to infect a host one mechanism is spontaneous mutations which typically change host range by altering amino acid sequences in host-binding proteins including tail fibres and capsid proteins 34 35 similarly experimentally evolved phage selected to infect previously resistant bacterial genotypes or different bacterial lineages also acquire mutations in genes encoding host-binding proteins 3638in vertebrates the importance of receptors is supported by an analysis of 64 human viruses which found that those with the broadest host range used receptors whose amino acid sequences are the most conserved 39 furthermore changes in the ability to bind host cells can also be essential for host shifts by viruses of vertebrates this is the case for the influenza virus which binds to sialic acid receptors of which there are two basic types sa-23- and sa-26-gal-terminated saccharides 33 avian influenza viruses bind sa-23 receptors in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of birds conversely human seasonal influenza viruses predominantly bind to sa-26 receptors in the upper respiratory tract of humans however humans possess sa-23-sialic acid receptors in the lower respiratory tract though it is relatively difficult for influenza viruses to get into and out of the lower respiratory tract avian influenza viruses do occasionally infect humans such infections typically result in severe disease with little or no secondary transmission successful adaptation to humans requires mutations to the sa receptor binding site in the hemagglutinin gene that allow the virus to utilise sa-26 receptors and thus increase the potential for efficient transmission between humans 33 a related example of the importance of changes in receptor binding is the switch of parvoviruses from cats to dogs which was due to two mutations in the viral capsid gene that allow it to bind the canine transferrin receptor 40if pathogens need to adapt for a host shift to be successful then the risk of a host shift will depend on the likelihood that the necessary set of mutations can accumulate in the newly infected host table 1 if specific new mutations are essential for survival in a novel host high mutation rates may be especially advantageous 41 accordingly the high mutation rate of rna viruses may explain why they host shift more frequently than other pathogens 12 however most mutations will be deleterious or lethal 42 43 so the chances of a host shift will be maximised at an intermediate mutation rate 41 44 although it has been shown in a plant virus that the fraction of mutations that are deleterious can be reduced in a novel host 45 how close the mutation rate of different pathogen groups is to this optimum for host shifting is unclear so it is uncertain whether high mutation rates can explain why rna viruses frequently jump between speciesthe probability of a host shift will also depend on the number of mutations required to adapt to novel hosts at one extreme a single mutation allowed venezuelan equine encephalitis virus to replicate efficiently in horses when it switched from rodents in the early 1990s 46 similarly single mutations can underlie the expansion of the host range of rna phages 47 in contrast five amino acid changes are predicted to be required for some avian ah5n1 influenza viruses to acquire the ability to be transmitted between ferrets 48 if multiple mutations are required to successfully host shift their availability can impose a constraint on host range evolution this is illustrated by experiments on a dna phage of pseudomonas fluorescens
36 the phage rapidly evolved to infect certain host genotypes but never adapted to others the successful shifts were associated with one to three mutations in genes affecting host binding whilst more mutations were required to infect the other hosts these could be acquired through a process of coevolution see belowif multiple mutations are required then the number of ways that the mutations might be fixed is important are mutations adaptive in all genetic backgrounds or does fitness epistasis require that they fix simultaneously or in a particular order there have been several outbreaks of chikungunya virus linked to the virus shifting from being predominantly vectored by the mosquito aedes aegypti to aedes albopictus a single amino acid change adapts the virus to the new vector 49 but despite a albopictus being common in asia this mutation did not occur for 60 years and when it did it was in a chikungunya virus lineage of african origin here the host shift mutation had no effect in the genetic background of the asian strains due to an epistatic interaction with a single amino acid difference elsewhere in the genome 49the likelihood that the mutations required to adapt to a novel host occur will also depend on the size of the mutational target in the pathogenthe number of different potential changes in the pathogen genome that adapt it to the new host in some viruses it is common to see the same parallel mutations occurring each time a virus adapts to a particular host species 50 51 suggesting there may be limited molecular solutions to infecting a new host species ie the more parallel changes observed the smaller the mutational target this may act as a significant constraint on host shifts by reducing the supply of adaptive mutationsthe size of the mutational target has been most studied in phage where host adaptation can be highly parallel such that the same mutations become fixed in independent replicate populations 51 52 the importance of these mutations is illustrated by experiments that rewind the evolutionary tape by adapting host-shifted phages back onto the ancestral host and observe reversion mutations restoring the sequence back to the ancestral state 38 when 40 host range mutants of phi6 phage were isolated it was found that there were 17 unique mutations underlying this shift 35 furthermore it was estimated that 56 different mutations in the phage genome have the potential to adapt it to the novel host 35 therefore despite some parallelism in this case the size of the mutational target is significant but the possible number of combinations is large so genetic constraints on this host shift are relatively weakparallel evolution at the molecular level is also common in experiments using viruses of eukaryotes figure 2a when vesicular stomatitis virus is evolved in human or dog cells parallel mutations tend to occur within the same cell type 50 similarly in plants experimental evolution of tobacco etch potyvirus on four host species found that parallel mutations only occurred when viruses were passaged in the same host species 53 a number of other studies in plants have found parallel mutations occurring often after only a few passages on the novel host 5457 experimental studies finding parallel mutations often enforce transmission and so bypass the critical barrier of successful transmission in the new host therefore looking at the mutations that occur in chains of natural transmission is an important future direction as for example the size of the mutational target may be different for cell entry compared to transmission 58host shifts into humans have also involved parallel mutations figure 2b in hiv-1 codon 30 of the gag gene has independently undergone the same change in all three human lineages of the virus that transferred from chimps 1 this change increases viral replication rate in human cells 59 and when a chimp was infected with hiv-1 it reverted to the residue seen in sivcpz 59 similarly five parallel mutations have been observed in two independent epidemics of sars coronavirus following the shift from palm civets to humans 60parallel phenotypic changes may sometimes have different solutions at the molecular level this has occurred in different hiv lineages that shifted into humans from other primates figure 2c hiv-1 group m which is responsible for the global pandemic arose following a host shift by the chimpanzee virus sivcpz 1 in both human and chimp cells a restriction factor called tetherin can prevent the release of viral particles from infected cells 61 in chimps the sivcpz protein nef has anti-tetherin activity but this is ineffective in humans due to a deletion in the cytoplasmic tail of tetherin that is targeted by nef instead in hiv-1 group m the vpu protein has evolved to perform the same function 61 this was paralleled in hiv-2 which originates from sooty mangabeys figure 2c the sooty mangabey virus also uses nef as a tetherin antagonist and again this is ineffective in humans but in this case the function has been acquired by the env protein hiv-2 lacks the vpu protein 61in cases where mutational targets are small and multiple mutations are required several factors may help overcome mutational constraint and allow host shifts to occur for example the ability of avian influenza to establish infections in the eyes and lower respiratory tract of humans 33 may give time and sufficient population size for the mutations that facilitate efficient human-to-human transmission to arise in laboratory studies of interactions between dna phage and bacteria it has been found that reciprocal coevolution allows phage to build up broad host ranges through the stepwise accumulation of multiple mutations in genes associated with host binding 36 additionally pathogens may circulate in host populations at low levels before becoming a detectable outbreak and this may provide time for the pathogen to evolve adaptations to optimise its fitness in the novel host 62adapting to a new host may have deleterious effects on other pathogen traits and such trade-offs may reduce the chances of a host shift occurring a possible example of this is seen in the shift of hiv-1 from chimpanzees to humans hiv-1 group m and hiv-1 group n have independently shifted from chimpanzees to humans 1 and in both cases the vpu protein has evolved to antagonise the restriction factor tetherin see above vpu also binds and degrades cd4 receptors in siv to aid the release of viral particles 63 but this function has been lost in group n viruses possibly as a pleiotropic consequence of the protein gaining anti-tetherin activity 64 it has been speculated that this may explain why hiv group n has remained a rare pathogen in africa while hiv group mwhere the ability to degrade cd4 was retainedhas become a pandemic 64a common trade-off of adapting to novel hosts is that performance on the original host is reduced for example host range mutations in the p3 protein of the rna phage phi6 generally reduce growth on the ancestral host although rare cost-free mutations do exist 35 65 observations of similar effects in other phage suggest that this may be a general property of phage host range expansion 38 66 similar patterns have been observed following virus adaptation to different cell culture types 67 68 plant species 54 55 and animal species 69 for example in a host switch of parvoviruses from cats to dogs the virus responsible for the initial outbreak in dogs cpv-2 lost the ability to infect cats although this was later regained 40once a pathogen has infected a new host the long-term success of the host shift can be independent of reduced performance in the original host if the pathogen does not require transmission to and from the original host for survival however trade-offs between performance in the two hosts can prevent adaptation to a new host if the pathogen is transmitted back to the original host at a high rate for example a vector borne pathogen may be unlikely to shift from a common mosquito species to a rare one as it will normally end up back in the original mosquito vector in contrast directly transmitted pathogens like influenza may be able to establish a continuous transmission chain in the new host so reduced performance on the original host is not importantanother important trade-off in the novel host may be between virulence the harm a pathogen does to a host and the transmission potential of the pathogen a number of theoretical and empirical studies have demonstrated that an intermediate level of virulence is often optimal to maximise transmission 7074 however following a host shift a pathogen may produce maladaptive levels of virulence as the novel hostparasite association has not been under direct selection for example when the myxoma virus from south american sylvilagus rabbits was transferred to european rabbits oryctolagus cuniculus initial case mortality rates were as high as 998 in australia the rapid mortality is thought to have reduced the window of time that rabbits were able to transmit the virus and as a consequence virulence rapidly dropped to case mortality rates of 90 due to the spread of attenuated virus strains 75 76 there appear to be large mutational targets to evolve changes in virulence in the myxoma virus a dna virus with a large 162 kb genome with no mutations common to specific virulence grades 77 failure to evolve lower levels of virulence may explain the stuttering chains of transmission seen in some spillover events 78 79 however it is difficult to disentangle whether the low rates of transmission are due to maladaptive levels of virulence or from human interventionone aim of studying host shifts is to predict future disease emergence but it is unclear whether this will ever be possible with an accuracy that makes it practically useful 80 while we have rules of thumb as to which groups of pathogens are most likely to host shift and which donor species they are likely to come from 32 there will always be exceptions this means that predicting disease emergence by fine scale surveillance of potential donor species and the individuals they are most likely to infect is a hugely difficult task 81 the observation that specific mutations are often required in host shifts has led to studies looking at whether these mutations can be predicted in advance for h5n1 avian influenza viruses mammalian transmissible forms have been evolved in laboratory settings and identified mutations may be markers for potential epidemics 8284 however even in this exceptionally well-studied case predictive power remains low and highly system specificwhile we increasingly understand the genetic details that underlie host shifts there are still important questions unanswered the literature is overwhelmingly skewed towards viruses but do bacterial and eukaryotic parasites have similar properties under what conditions do trade-offs between performance on the original and new host prevent host shifts from happening do the mutations involved in host shifts originate as de novo mutations in the new host or come from standing variation in the original host what determines the size of the mutational target and does this depend on what the barrier to a host shift is for example mutational targets seem to be small for relatively simple traits like changes in receptor use but may be larger for complex traits like virulence and transmissibilityone little-explored consequence of host shifts is how they affect the distribution of pathogens across host species 85 the number and type of pathogens infecting a host is partly a result of past acquisitions following host shifts box 2 and new theory is showing how our understanding of host shifts can allow us to understand the composition of pathogen communities 24 86 but these ideas remain largely untestedfinding tractable methods to monitor emerging diseases presents a significant challenge for the future studying the genetics of host shifts has the potential to uncover the evolutionary processes that pathogens undergo when they find themselves in a novel host and may allow us to begin to address this challengein december 2019 chinese authorities released the first official information to the world about the spreading of the human coronavirus in their country as a community disease 123 till 15th may 2020 more than 46 million people are infected with more than 038 million death cases reported worldwide by who 45 in frequent cases the covid-19 disease develops serious symptoms to older adults and those having medical pre-conditions such as cardiovascular diseases cvds diabetes chronic respiratory diseases copds cerebrovascular disease and cancer 6 most people infected with sars-cov-2 are experiencing no or just mild to moderate respiratory symptoms and recover without special treatment the covid-19 disease causes primary symptoms such as fever tiredness dry cough shortness of breath together with other secondary symptoms such as a runny nose sore throat aches and pains diarrhea and nausea in its victims after two to fourteen days of contact in a minority of patients it causes severe pneumonia that can lead to death with comorbidity sars-cov-2 has a high resemblance to the virus in the body of bats 962 identical termed as batcov ratg13 and pangolin 1267 but its origin is still a mystery once exposed to the environment through a droplet from an infected person it can last from a few minutes to several hours up to a few days depending on the type of surfaces if a person touches their nose or eyes or pulls it out of their breath there is a possibility of getting infected studies show that it can stay in the air for up to three hours 8 on a copper ring up to four hours a full day on cardboard and on plastic and stainless steel it can last up to 23 days 9 in the high phase of the epidemic outbreak each infected person can infect in average around 35 other persons 6the genome of sars-cov-2 is ribonucleic acid rna 610 because of such genomic pattern broad diversity and recurrent recombination of the coronavirus species it changes its nature frequently with a mutation to cope up with a new environment for survival 610 a preliminary study has estimated the reproductive number or transmission rate r0 of covid-19 to be between 13 and 35 compared to an r0 of seasonal influenza flu and sars of 13 and 20 respectively if r0  1 then there is a chance of an epidemic development else it disappears slowly 411each year an estimated 290000 to 650000 people corresponding to 795 to 1781 per day die globally due to impacts from flu viruses sars was another coronavirus that began from beijing china and spread to 29 countries in between november 2002 to july 2003 afflicting 8096 people and resulting in 774 fatalities with a fatality rate of 96 4611 on 30th january 2020 the case number of the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 outpaced sars another category of coronavirus mers decimated 858 people out of the 2494 infected with a fatality rate of 35 in 2012 6 covid-19 outnumbered the fatality rates caused by the other coronavirus categories such as sars 12 and mers 13 and forced who to broadcast a global emergency on 30th january 2020 as proclaimed by who on 27th january 2020 the median age of covid-19 cases diagnosed outside of china was 45 years ranging from 2 to 74 years with 71 male incidents according to chinas national health commission nhc 80 died victims were over the age of sixty years old and 75 of them had pre-existing health conditions such as cvds and diabetes according to the us center for disease control and prevention at least 20 of affected people become so sick that they have to be hospitalized even though they are between the ages of 2044 and two-thirds of them are admitted to the intensive care unit icu the rapid growth of covid-19 across

quarantined earlier therefore diminishing the chance of spread men et al 20 researched the incubation period of covid-19 with a machine learning ml approach and their result showed that the incubation distribution of covid-19 did not follow general incubation distributions such as lognormal weibull and gamma distributions they estimated that the mean and median of covid-19 incubation were 584 and 50 days respectively via bootstrap and proposed monte carlo simulations they also noticed that the incubation period of the groups with age  40 years and age  40 years exhibited a statistically significant variation the initial group had more extended incubation period and more significant variance than the later the study further indicated that separate quarantine time should be employed to

approaches are a powerful tool for helping public health planning and policymaking our research aims to perform statistical analysis on available covid-19 related datasets available in ourworldindataorg 5 and newly created dataset to find a set of probable risk factors associated with the spreading of covid-19 and we have identified it as a research gap once correlation analysis was accomplished we explored univariate lstm models for timeseries forecasting on total cases and deaths lstm is an artificial recurrent neural network rnn architecture and used in the field of deep learning therefore in this research we followed deep learning-based approach in addition we proposed an algorithm to prove our assumed hypothesis that that social isolation or social distancing might restrict the spreading of the covid-19the global scientific community is looking for three possible solutions such as virus enzyme inhibitors 3839 plasma therapy 40 and vaccination to give a counter fight against covid-19 according to the who director general the safest and fastest method of corona treatment is patient identification separation examination and treatment who has specified a standard on its official website where guidelines are specified formally to slow down and prevent its further transmission worldometersorg 11 ourworldindataorg 5 and who 4 are updating situation

utilized for the data processing in section 4 we discuss our findings the paper is concluded in section 5 clinical trials chemical compounds genetic analysis political arguments and economic analysis related to covid-19 are beyond the scope of this papercovid-19 has created significant health and economic slowdown in many countries since january 2020 due to global and local lockdown to encourage social distance it has infected more than 46 million people so far with more than 038 million death and more than 17 million recoveries reported until 15th may 2020 45 it attacked not only developed nations but also developing ones regardless of the socioeconomic condition age and gender discrimination covid-19 is highly contagious and transmissible from human to human with an incubation period of up to 24 days 6who officials initially considered sars-cov-2 as non-airborne but a recent study has discovered that it can survive in air staying suspended as aerosol depending on factors such as heat and humidity 41 therefore the infection mediums can be classified as contact direct or indirect droplet spray in short-range transmission and aerosol in long-range transmission airborne transmission 41 according to the center for disease control and prevention cdc a social distance of about 18 m is necessary to avoid large droplets of virus-laden mucus 42 but some experts suggest that 18 m distance is not enough 43 due to possible air current table 1 pollution caused by nitrogen dioxide no2 can be one of the most critical contributors to increase the fatality rate caused by covid-19 44 recent studies found the existence of sars-cov-2 in sewage water 45 and non-potable water 46 scientists are exploring how humidity temperature and ultraviolet lighting alters the virus as well as how long it can survive on different surfaces some studies have revealed that relative humidity affects all infectious virus droplets independent of their source and location 41 and gravity and airflow cause the most virus droplets to float to the ground the temperature along with humidity affects the properties of viral surface proteins and lipid membrane 41 according to the same study humidity between 50 to 80 is the best for low stability in sars-cov-2 41 according to the studies 95354 the sars-cov-2 can exist on different objects and surfaces as follows a half of the samples from the soles of the icu medical staff shoes tested positive b surface contamination computer mouse trash cans sickbed handrails doorknobs c equipment exercise equipment medical equipment including spirometer pulse oximeter and nasal cannula personal computers ipads and reading glasses and d surfaces cellular phones remote controls toilets room floors bedside tables and bed rails and window ledges according to the epidemiologists the fatality rate of covid-19 can change as sars-cov-2 can mutate who claimed that social distancing is the only way to slow down covid-19 transmission and that is the reason many countries are locked down and people are asked to stay at home the concept of social distancing is not to eradicate the covid-19 but to slow down its transmission hence declining the pressure on the health care systems and economy and in this manner reduce the fatality rate it might infect around 90 of the global population if no mitigation measures are taken soon as estimated by a leading statistical modeling group at imperial college london icl 55 covid-19 took 67 days for its initial 01 million cases then it took just 3 days to reach from 04 million to 05 million cases as depicted in figure 2 the icl team analyzed that if proactive measures such as social distancing rigorous testing and isolation of diseased people are taken with proper planning when fatality rate of each infected country is 02100000 victimsweek then the outcome might reduce wide-reaching deaths to 19 million studies found that italy hit the 02 threshold on 2nd3rd march the united kingdom on march 17 and the united states on march 22 45 usa spain italy france germany uk turkey iran china russia brazil belgium canada netherlands switzerland portugal and india are top 17 countries according to the total covid-19 cases reported till 22 april 2020 45 as depicted in figure 3 and figure 4 respectivelyin this study we used two types of datasetsa real datasets available in ourworldindataorg

two statistical approacheshypothesis testing and correlation analysis hypothesis testing is a statistical method that is used in achieving statistical decisions using trial data the critical parameter of hypothesis testing is the null hypothesis h0 that tells there is nothing different or unique about the data on the contrary the alternative hypothesis ha directly contradicts h0 the confidence factor or value of significance  is used to decide whether to accept or reject an h0 the value of  is usually kept as 005 or 5 as 100 accuracy is impossible to achieve whether to accept or reject an

algorithm 1 importance of social distancing by flattening the curve of afflicted population over specific days  step 1 initialize necessary parameters as follows to create a simulated town infected with covid-19       days  100lockdown days      population  200000population of the town      spreadfactor  025covid-19 transmission rate 0  f  5       daystorecover  10maximum recovery days from covid-19      initalafflictedpeople  5initial infected people of the town with covid-19  step 2 initialize a data frame town for the simulated town with the following four features       id  rangepopulation id  0- population       infected  false
      recoveryday  none      recovered  false
  step 3 initialize the initial cases initialcases with initalafflictedpeople variable     update corresponding infected feature as true and
     update recoveryday feature with daystorecover variable  step 4 initialize the initial active cases activecases with initallyafflicted variable and     initial recovered cases recovery with 0  step 5      for day  1 to days do          step 51 mark the people of town data frame who have recovered on current day
              - update the feature recoveryday as true and infected feature as false
              if they have crossed daystorecover else ignore
          step 52 calculate the number of people who are afflicted today with spreadfactor              - calculate number of people infected in the town data frame based on
              feature infected  true              -multiply the count of total infected people with spreadfactor to
              calculate total possible cases of infected people on current day          step 53 forget people who were already infected in cases of current day          step 54 mark the new cases as afflicted and their recovery day by updating
              activecases and recovery lists of the town data frame  step 6 repeat the step 5 for spreadfactor  025 to 50 and plot every distribution graph of activecases over days
note
we plotted distribution graph of active cases over days for the following set of f values 025 05 075 10 20 30 40 50 with the initialized parameters at step 1the algorithm was implemented with simulateddata2the worst-case time complexity of the algorithm is on2 where n  problem size
the correlation analysis of the simulated data simulateddata1 is depicted in figure 6 the resultant correlation heatmap of simulated data is a well-accepted data visualization method among machine learning communities and it illustrates the magnitude of a phenomenon as color in two dimensions here the variation in color is the value of correlation factor r which is giving understandable visual cues about how the phenomenon is clustered or varies over space the code of the color is changing according to the values of r from a weak correlation to the strong correlation the color bar beside the correlation matrix is signifying that color change following r values where 1  r  1 as described in section 33 we excluded the feature country from correlation study the correlation study was conducted to investigate how infected cases and death are related to external temperature sunshine and precipitation correlation factor r  06 represents a strong correlation according to table 5 in this study we represented the relation between total population p cases c and death d with the following functions f c  fp and d  fc where p  0 c  0 d  0 and p c d are natural numbers n hence d  ffpgenerally dcdt  0 dddt  0 and dpdt  0 where t is the time and t  0let p is the total infected population where p plet c  fp is a function defined on an interval a a  h where a is the initial infected population h is the newly infected population a h  p a  0 and h  p therefore the instantaneous rate of change of c at a is its derivative 
falimh0fahfahhence for small change in h fa approximates to f a  h  f ah subsequently it can be derived that 
dcdt  dpdt  0the correlation analysis as depicted in figure 6 is exhibiting that covid-19 does not have any dependency on external temperature sunshine and precipitation it is genuinely a community disease death is highly correlated r  08 to the number of cases rather than the weather external temperature sunshine and precipitation as depicted in figure 7 we performed exponential regression analysis to plot increase in death y-axis with an increase in the number of cases x-axis as depicted in figure 7 and the obtained equation of an approximated exponential curve is y  e595734475e00  e125996126e-05x
the total cases are highly related r  07 to the population as depicted in figure 6 if the number of populations increases the number of new deaths also increases due to the high correlation value of r as depicted in figure 6 therefore social distancing or social isolation is one of the primary keys to stop its spreading countries with high population density such as bangladesh singapore pakistan and india have a high chance of getting afflicted by covid-19 very drastically until controlled from the beginning hence social isolation lockdown social distancing are significant in this regard to stop the spreading of covid-19 at the community level that is why many countries have been locked down and people are being asked to stay at home it might have a chance to slow down the spread of the covid-19 by flattening the curve of afflicted population over days and relaxing pressure on the healthcare system it is one of the essential measures to restrict the fatality rate of covid-19 besides the decision of lockdown ordinary people should understand its importance as the human coronavirus is highly contagiouswe hypothesized that social isolation or social distancing might restrict the spreading of the human coronavirus as it may slow down the spread factor f to prove the assumed hypothesis we proposed an algorithm in section 38 after executing the algorithm with simulated data simulateddata2 we plotted different distribution graphs of active cases y-axis over the number of lockdown days x-axis for the following set of spread factor f values 025 05 075 10 20 30 40 50 as depicted in figure 8 the spread factor f with the lowest value of 025 has produced a nice gaussian distribution in figure 8 with increasing spread factor f active cases are growing high as compared to lockdown period as described in table 9 if the average load of active cases goes high in short span of days as described in table 9 the healthcare sector may collapse to cope up and unable to provide adequate treatment to infected patients therefore the recovery rate may become very low and death rate may increase the figures figure 8 are illustrating that social isolation or social distancing has a significant impact on flattening the curve of afflicted population over days to alleviate sudden pressure on the existing capacity of the healthcare system india implemented its first lockdown on 23 march 2020 to 13 april 2020 21 days and the second lockdown until 3 may 2020 the trend of total reported cases has been compared between four asian countries such as india singapore iran and turkey till 22 april 2020 as depicted in figure 9 the trend is showing that successful lockdown might have a chance to slow down the spreading of the human coronavirus in india and singapore as per the study at john hopkins university the human coronavirus growth rate in india is declining consistently by flattening the curve of case doubling due to the first phase of lockdown 14 we downloaded four types of timeseries data from ourworldindataorg as followsa the total number of cases b total deaths c new confirmed cases and d new deaths we performed hypothesis testing on the timeseries data to check whether they are stationary or not following table 5 the result is described in table 10 we analyzed the performance of six lstm models as described in section 34 on the following two datasetsa the total number of cases and b total deaths available in ourworldindataorg to forecast probable total infected cases and death in advance the designed models can be used to forecast total infected cases and total deaths of any selected countries individually available in ourworldindataorg we processed data from 1 january 2020 to 22 april 2020 as described in section 35 total 97 of the data utilized to train the models and the remaining 3 data used for testing total 110 future predictions the performance of the models we executed training and testing of individual models for 5 times then took the average of corresponding performance metrics and predicted values the average performance results of different lstm models are described in table 11 and table 12 respectively and corresponding model calibrations are depicted in figure 10 and figure 11 respectively according to the result no single model is 100 accurate and they tend to either over-forecast or lower forecast the vanilla stacked and bidirectional lstm models performed better than multilayer lstm models in this study we focused only on the general trend of data and that might be the reason to over-forecast the forecasting may help us to be aware of upcoming unwanted situations and take necessary actions in advance to mitigate itfor verification we trained our vanilla stacked and bidirectional lstm models with indian dataset available in ourworldindataorg from 1 january 2020 to 23 march 2020 the focus was to forecast an approximate total number of cases after 21 days starting 23 march 2020 as the first lock-down period of india ended on 13 april 2020 we executed individual models for 5 times then took the average of total predicted cases once forecasting was completed we verified whether lock-down social distancingsocial isolation had any impact on lowering the spread of the human coronavirus the result showed that without lock-down india could cross 02 million of total corona cases on 14 april 2020 therefore it supports our assumed hypothesis that social isolationsocial distancing is one of the main criteria to fight against covid-19the statistical correlation study proved that covid-19 does not depend on external weather factors such as external temperature sunshine and precipitation it depends on the population and its density mostly therefore it is considered as a community disease this research verified our assumed hypothesis that social isolationsocial distancing might restrict the spreading of the human coronavirus by diminishing its spread factor the forecasting of probable new corona cases and death count with proposed lstm models in this study may help to take necessary actions in advance to control the upcoming undesirable health crisis sars-cov-2 can infect people of all ages but people who have pre-existing medical conditions such as copd cvds diabetes hypertension cerebrovascular disease and cancer are more susceptible to become severely sick with the viral infection complete data related to different health factors age sex health history of covid-19 infected patients are still not available in public to conduct more detailed research in the future the accuracy of the lstm forecasting can be improved after considering additional needed parameters rather than relying on univariate trend of timeseries data ehealth with information and communication technologies ict 65 may open a new direction in covid-19 research and remote patient monitoring after collecting necessary health and wellness data through standard sensors questionnaires and followed by train a decision support system dss for tailored recommendation generationsince december 2019 coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 has rapidly spread across the globe and become the top issue affecting millions of people around the world although most of the patients of coronavirus disease2019 covid19 show mild symptoms and can recover on their own about 20 of the patients develop severe symptoms common symptoms include fever cough shortness of breath as well as other flulike symptoms sore throat chills fatigue etc patients with severe illness tend to have severe pneumonia sometimes acute respiratory distress which could lead to multiple organ failures and death the hospital stay can be weeks for such patients

 there is no proven cure or antiviral drugs available yetthe influenza virus typically binds to the sialic acid receptors on the surface of epithelial cells in the upper respiratory tracks and the upper divisions of bronchi
5
 in very severe and often fatal cases of influenza the infection will spread to the lower lungs
6
 
7
 similarly the sarscov2 virus binds to the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors on the surface epithelial cells
8
 these cells with ace2 expression are hence vulnerable to virus attack and are called target cells in mathematical models the density of the target cells has been found to vary significantly in different regions of the respiratory tracks with the highest in the lungs followed by the nose and lastly the tracheabronchi tissues

11
 as such pneumonia is relatively common among covid19 patientsthe incubation time for influenza is typically 48 hours or less
12
 the eclipse phase is reported to be around 6 hours with viral load peaks around 2 to 3 days postinfection dpi
5
 the infection typically resolves in 3 to 5 days in typical influenza patients the adaptive immune responses airs including pathogenspecific antibodies abs and cd8 cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctl are first observed around 5 dpi peaking around 7 dpi
13
 the mean incubation period for covid19 patients is estimated to be 6 days with a range distribution of 13 days

15
 the median time from symptoms to discharge from the hospital was about 22 days whereas the median time to death was 18 days

 among this study of 191 patients the shortest observed duration of viral shedding among survivors was 8 days whereas the longest was 37 days among 29 patients who received the antiviral drug lopinavirritonavir and were discharged the median time from illness onset to initiation of antiviral treatment was 14 days and the median duration of viral shedding was 22 days the median duration of viral shedding was 19 days in patients with severe disease status and 24 days in patients with critical disease status the median time from illness onset to dyspnea was similar in survivors and nonsurvivors with a median duration of dyspnea of 13 days for survivors the much longer incubation time duration of viral shedding and time it takes from disease onset to discharge in covid19 patients are critical in our modeling study which puts a strong constraint on what the model outputs should look likein this paper we used mathematical modeling to investigate the dynamics of the viral infectionreplication inside a human host in particular the influenza and the sarscov2 virus as well as the interactions of target cells with the innate and airs our model suggests that most of the differences between the two types of infections can potentially be attributed to the timing mismatch between the two immune responses more specifically influenza is a very acute infection all vulnerable cells are completely depleted and viruses are more or less cleared by the innate immune response before the adaptive immune response air which has a transient nature reaches a significant level the arrival of air may seem futile but it helps to completely clear the remaining viruses on the other hand the peak level of the air of the covid19 patients is more likely to come before the number of infected cells reaches its peak due to the slower disease progression outlined above as such the air helps to eliminate more viruses in the rapid growth phase and slow down the infection and depletion of vulnerable epithelial cells in the lungs of covid19 patients a strong air in this case may be bad for the patients as the disease progression is extended longer while a weaker air can be beneficial for the patients due to the rapid depletion of the target cells one recent observation puzzling for many is the apparent resurgence of the disease for some cured patients based on our theory and modeling this phenomenon can be explained by that of a strong interaction of innate and airs in a host which can sometimes create double peaks in viral load separated by weeks in the second part of our study we applied our modeling to the current bedside treatment regimen antiviral drugs and immunosuppressive drugs have been evaluated as potential treatments for highrisk patients we proposed an immunesuppressing treatment based on the leanings of our modeling study which is to apply immunosuppressive drugs during the early phase of infection to reduce the airs to a level low enough not to interfere with the innate immune response once the vulnerable cells are depleted the drug should be removed to let the air run its course to clear the remaining virus this new approach can potentially lead to fast and complete recovery this counterintuitive approach aims to mimic the excellent job human immune systems have done with the influenza infection further studies on immune responses of covid19 patients and validation of our core assumptions and theory are needed before this can be applied in real patients situationsmathematical models have been developed to understand the dynamics of viral infections

 most of them fall into the category of the target celllimited model with some variations the simplest version includes three species uninfected susceptible target cells t which in our case is the surface epithelial cells with ace2 receptors located at the respiratory tracks including lungs nasal and tracheabronchial tissues infected virusproducing cells i and the virus particles v they can be described by the following set of differential equations
1dtdtdt0dtkavtdidtkavtidvdtpicv
detailed descriptions and definitions of the parameters are shown in table 1 notice that uninfected target cells t are produced and die at the same rate d this ensures that without infection the number of target cells remains the same the density of target cells t0a is different for different tissues and we specifically included the effective surface area here so that the constants except t0 and a remain the same for different parts of the respiratory tracks of the same patient these constants can be different for different patients by the interaction of virus v with uninfected target cells t at a constant infectivity rate k the target cells become infected cells i which in turn produce virus v with production rate p due to viral cytopathicity immune elimination andor apoptosis infected cells i die at a rate  the virus is cleared at rate c from the cells by mechanisms such as immune elimination this set of equations essentially describes the innate immune response of the host tt is a dimensionless variable describing the time t in units of  tracking how many cycles of replications the virus has gone through since the inoculation while  is the average cycle time for virus reproduction including the eclipse and burst phase the reason for us to use t instead of the familiar time variable t is to simplify numerical simulation as well as making the constants more intuitively understandablethe ability of a virus to grow the infection or to be cleared is determined by the basic reproductive ratio r
rkptacr0tt0
where r represents the number of infected cells newly generated by one infected cell with r
 1 the infection grows while with r
 1 infected cells decrease and the virus is cleared out
21

here it is important to note that t is a variable when the target cells are depleted t goes down and so does r this is a very simple yet critically important concept for understanding the virus clearance complete depletion of the target cells namely t0 leads to r0 hence achieving the best virus clearing ability r0 is the native r at t0 when the target cells are not depleted at all it should be pointed out that with the innate immunity alone the equations 1 always lead to a stable equilibrium which is achieved when the elimination of infected cells is equal to the regeneration of the target cells at any given time this is why the air is so important without which the host may not be able to completely clear all virus particlesmultiple studies have suggested that both the innate and airs are important in modeling virus infections
22

24
 to account for the air and the dynamic interactions among multiple players target epithelial cells virus cd8 ctls and antibodies we used the equations employed by miao et al
25
 with minor modifications shown as equations 2 table 2 described the new parameters introduced in equations 2
2dtdtdt0dtkavtdidtkavtkeetidvdtpickggtkmmtv
in their experiment the authors found that the viral load peaked at 2 to 3 dpi the level of cd8 cells and igm data shows a very narrow peak at about 8 days dpi while the level of igg antibody shows a relatively broad peak lasting well over 50 days we seek to mimic these temporal profiles using et as an example
etettc2wrttcetettcwfttc
with such a profile we can choose the peak position tc and the rising and falling width wr and wf in our simulation to see the effects of these parameters on the viral infection dynamics our main assumption is that the air is a short term effect which assumes that the virus is successfully cleared timely and the patient survived as such it is not our goal to develop a detailed model for airs but rather to understand the necessary conditions that are needed for a successful outcome for the patients other components like iga cd4 t cells and a number of other components of the air could also play important roles here
13
 although we have used the three components of cd8 and antibodies of igm and igg as a representation of the air our conclusions are more general this is because the conclusions are based on the overall effect of the air rather than the details of how each component of air works if we change the number of air components to 2 or 4 as long as they have a similar transient profile the conclusions should remain the sameto analyze the effect of antiviral drugs that either block infection k andor production of viral particles p the target celllimited model is modified as follows
3dtdtdt0dt1kkavtdidt1kkavtidvdt1ppicv with 0kp1
26
 here kp0 describes no antiviral drug effect while kp1 refers to a drug that is 100 effective with the action of the drug the reproduction number r is revised as follows
rkp1kt1pac1k1pr0tt0
finally we want to add another component to describe the effect of a drug that suppresses the innate immune response for reasons that will be discussed in the section of treatments by immunosuppressive drugs equations 1 2 and 3 are changed to the following
4dtdtdt0dt1kkavtdidt1kkavt1keetidvdt1ppi1cckggtkmmtv with 0c1 here c0 describes no effect of immunesuppressing drugs while c1 refers to complete suppressionmathematical models of influenza infections have been studied extensively

 our interest is to use it as a starting point before we embark on more challenging work on sarscov2 infections we have carefully evaluated the parameter values tabulated by beauchemin et al
5
 and decided to use the values shown in table 3the choice of the parameters is based on crosschecking multiple sources and testing many simulation runs with variations of parameters to ensure that the output agrees with what is known about influenza infections it is not our intent to fit the model to any specific set of data but rather to be able to reproduce the general features of the influenza infections the result is shown at figure 1 with these parameters the infected cell count peaks at 245 dpi viral load peaks at 298 dpi and and the r0 is about 47  which describes an exponential growth rate shown in appendix is 234 as we should expect the target cells are depleted shortly following the peak of the infected cells after which the virus count decays exponentiallythe situation with regard to the decay portion is more complicated and the consideration of the air is warranted if one is to understand it beyond 6 dpi table 4 shows the parameters for the three components we considered in equations 2these values are chosen so that the temporal profiles resemble what was presented by miao et al
25
 the choice of the peak time is based on beauchemin et al
5
 we should clarify that the temporal profiles are not completely the same as in reference
25
 as some other literature has shown broader profiles

 we have done sensitivity analysis by doing multiple simulations and find that as long as the width is not too narrow the results are not sensitive to the width or shape of the peak on the other hand the location of the peak time is very important for the complete clearing of the virus the result is shown in figure 2in figure 2 we included the same graph for virus count without the air as shown in figure 1 except with a longer time scale from this point on in all of the figures we show the virus counts only as the infected cells counts always follow the same pattern as the virus counts except with a small time shift at about 30 dpi the virus count goes to a small number and then gradually climbs up this tail is caused by the cell regeneration as the newly generated epithelial cells provide the target cells for the viral infection to stay on at a relatively low level eventually reaching equilibrium at a later time as long as the native r0 is greater than 1 this pattern is the universal behavior of the equations 1 namely a rapid exponential rise followed by an exponential decay then eventually reaching an equilibrium at a low level of infection changing parameters in table 3 will change the time scale the peaktrough levels and locations of virus count etc but the general pattern is the same when the air is included the virus clears out much faster by day 15 the virus is completely gone mathematically virus and infected cells count never actually go to zero however we know that the infected cell count has to be an integer therefore when this number is below 1 one can safely consider it gameover for the virus in our modeling we set this cutoff to be 02 infected cell to be conservativethe temporal profile of the three components of the air are also shown in figure 2 so that the readers can see their peak positions as compared to the actual virus counts over time after the air becomes active the decay of virus count becomes much faster we also tried to vary the parameters around what is listed in table 3 in the case of the influenza virus if the peak time of the air is adjusted only under some extreme conditions eg reducing the air activity level to below 008 or raising the r0 to above 90 and keeping the air activity to 02 or lower one can make the tail end of the viral load survive and potentially thrive in other words this ability to completely and swiftly clear the influenza virus is common across a broad spectrum of parameters which means that most people can successfully clear influenza infections quickly and completely this has a lot to do with the acute nature of the influenza infection namely the peak viral load is at 2 to 3 dpi and the target cells are completely depleted before 3 dpi much before the air reaches its peak level which is at around 8 dpi with few new cells generated it takes only a very low level of air to completely clear the remaining virus we reason that the acute nature and an appropriately timed adaptive immunity is key to completely eradicate all influenza virus the fact that the adaptive immunity works so well with the innate immunity can probably be traced back to the long history of human evolution and its constant battles with acute virus infections as our immune system against viral infection is so optimized against acute viral infections such as influenza it may have some limitations against other infections by slowprogressing viruses such as the coronavirus sarscov2due to the lack of experimental data the discussions below are based on our best assumptions and observations when shifting gears from the influenza virus to the novel corona virus the most important difference we noticed is the difference in the pace of infection progression multiple reports suggested that the viral counts of sarscov2 do not reach a peak until 2 to 3 weeks postinoculation

 here we will make a bold assumption that if without the air the peak time is around 8 to 14 days if not more as most of the severe cases result in pneumonia and the lungs are significantly larger than the nose t0 is estimated to be higher by a factor of 104 table 5 lists the only two parameters that are changed from tables 3 and 4 together with the three dependent variables as outputs from the model here we aimed to have a peak time for infected cells at around 12 dpi if considering the effect of innate immune response only together with a 104 times increase of t0 these constraints essentially limited our choice for the only other variable to a very narrow range the result is shown in figure 3as we can see in figure 3 the curve of virus count for an innate immune response only no air is similar to that of influenza infections except with a longer time scale with air the peak of the viral count is shifted from 1202 to 1633 dpi and the decay becomes much slower indicating much slower recovery we have also shown the three components of the air on the same graph which peak at 8 to 10 dpi once the air is activated the steep rise of virus count is slowed and the maximum viral load is reduced by a factor of 33 another point we noticed is that the target cells are not depleted completely with about 65 being the lowest this explains why the decay is slower when compared to the innateonly scenario which has complete depletion of target cells not shown in the graph what does this mean for the severity of the disease we hypothesize that the air is not helping in the case of covid19 due to a longer duration of virus activityfrom a mathematical standpoint there is a huge advantage to quickly deplete all target cells namely fast and complete elimination of the virus in reality one critical question that remains is what are the target cells and whether elimination of all target cells poses a critical risk for patients we hereby make the assumption that the target cells are mainly epithelial cells with ace2 expression and the complete elimination of these cells is not in itself causing failure of lung function in patients rather the extended duration of viral activity may have led to hyperactive immune responses at a later stage which eventually leads to tissue damage and potentially ards our assumption is based on the observation that only about 2 to 4 of the epithelial cells have ace2 receptors

 giving us hope that the loss of these cells is not going to cause a major loss of air exchange capability another indication is that a large number of patients with ct scans showing groundglass opacity do not necessarily have severe covid19 symptoms

 in influenza infections most of the patients experience total depletion of target cells and recover without any consequencesour initial choice of air activity of 03 is purely artificial at this point so we want to explore the effect of different levels of air activity the result is shown in figure 4as we can see with the air activity level of 0204 the virus count reaches a high level and then the growth is slowed with the activation of the air at around 8 dpi after the effect of the air wanes the virus count continues its ascent reaching its peak at a later date at a higher air activity level we start to see an apparent drop in virus count after the onset of air reaching a trough then rising to its peak at a much later day overall an increase in the air activity tends to increase the duration of viral activity extensively in this case this is because early activation of the air helps to reduce infection and depletion of target cells before it reaches a peak level which saves a large number of uninfected target cells for later infection when the effect of the air wanes the virus takes control again when the effective r rises above 1 whether the virus count grows or drops during the peak air activity is dependent on how strong the air effect is and whether the effective reproductive ratio r at the time is greater or less than 1 this situation resembles a rampant forest fire if the fire is left alone when all the trees are burnt out the fire loses its fuel and dies out quickly trying to fight the fire halfheartedly before that can only result in partial control of the fire once the fire fighting stops the fire resumes in vengeance until all trees are burnt out we believe that this is the reason why a lot of severe patients cannot leave hospital beds and eventually develop ards and multiple organ failure the examples in figure 4 with the air activity level greater or equal to 08 offers a ready explanation for some perplexing clinical observations that some patients can appear to be recovered but have the virus level resurges at a later timewhats even more interesting is when we shift the day that the air activity peaks as shown in figure 5to show the air effect on viral replication in a more pronounced fashion we fix the air activity level at 05 and vary the day of its peak time from 6 to 14 dpi the virus peak time without the air is at 12 dpi as we can see if the air peaks before 12 dpi its effect is to lower the maximum viral load somewhat but extend the duration of viral activity quite substantially on the other hand if the air peaks after 12 dpi it helps to clear out the remainder of the viral load more efficiently as shown by a sharper decay of virus this ensures a quick and complete clearance of the virus resembling the scenario of influenza infections with additional simulations we have found that if the air peak is after the viral peak a higher level of air activity always helps to clear the virus faster contrarily if the air peaks before the viral peak higher air activity can increase the duration of viral activity we also found that if the air level is low enough for example below 01 its effect becomes negligible and the virus replication and clearing process is dictated by the innate immune response alone as discussed earlier the consequences of extended duration of viral activity may be detrimental to the patients which include a prolonged disease process increase of the patients risk in secondary infections tissueorgan damage caused by an overactive immune system and potential virus spreading to other parts of the bodythese dramatic effects due to the air timing is mainly caused by two factors the presence of a large number of uninfected target cells and the air as a transient effect a shortterm antiviral activity during the exponential growth of the virus will always slow down the growth of the virus and infection leaving more target cells as a source for continued infections later this result is very general and does not depend on the source of antiviral activity as we can see later with the analysis of antiviral drugsin essence our modeling aims to explore potential means to manage the covid19 infections so that it can be similar to influenza infections when the virus can be quickly and completely cleared the air should be transient similar to the influenza infections our modeling then establishes that one of the requirements is that the peak of air needs to come after the peak of infected cells or equivalently the peak of viral load this can be viewed as a necessary condition for fast and complete clearing of virus to achieve rapid clearing of the virus it is also desirable to have the target cells more or less completely depleted in reality when the virus cannot be cleared timely it is likely that the air will also be extended longer so the conclusions from our modeling related to the later stage development may need to be modifiedwhen searching for a cure for covid19 patients an effective antiviral drug is highly anticipated so we decided to model the effect of the antiviral drug on the corona virus infection we started our base case with a peak of the air at 8 dpi and air activity level of 03 as shown before from equations 3 the expression for r is revised as follows
5r1k1pr0tt0 here r0 is the native reproductive ratio tt0 is the percentage of the target cells that are not depleted the first two brackets show the effect of the antiviral drugs on the reproductive ratio r which shows that the drug has an equivalent effect regardless of whether it is acting on k or p next we tried to simulate the effect of an antiviral drug with 50 efficacy on k namely k05 taken for 15 days consecutively taking this drug for a longer time does not necessarily make it more beneficial in this particular scenario as a comparison the base scenario is also included with a native r0 of 703 and air activity of 03 peaking at 8 dpi the base scenario is shown as a blue line in figure 6 when the drug is applied the effective r is reduced to 352 according to the formula above not considering the effect of target cell depletionsimilar to the air effects shown in figure 5 figure 6 shows that additional druginduced antiviral activity has a pronounced effect on the duration of viral activity within the host for the three scenarios when the antiviral drug is started on 5 dpi 10 dpi or 15 dpi during the 15 days when the antiviral drug is effective the virus growth rate is reduced after the drug is removed the virus either resumes its growth or remains at a plateau in all three scenarios the duration of virus activity is extended substantially which can lead to detrimental consequences for the patients on the other hand if the drug is started 18 or 23 dpi after the peak of infected cells the effect of the antiviral drug is to speed up the virus clearing which is beneficial for the patient in figure 6 the depletion of target cells is also shown for the scenario of the drug started at 18 dpi as we can see the depletion is not complete 12 target cells remain which explains why the decay is slow even with the additional drug activitythe situation is very different if the antiviral drug efficacy is raised to 90 namely k09 when the drug is applied the effective r becomes 07 which leads to virus clearance we ran the same set of scenarios as above and the results are shown in figure 7 the blue line again shows the base scenario with no drug applied if the drug is applied early as shown for the scenario with a start date of 5 dpi the infection can be stopped completely before it makes any real progress when the drug is started at 10 or 15 dpi double peaks of viral count are observed the reason is that when the drug is stopped r jumps back to 7 so that virus resumes its rapid growth until the target cells are depleted causing a second peak in virus count therefore if the drug is stopped before the virus is cleared out completely the infection will resurge this is similar to what we have seen in figure 4 with the transient antiviral activity of strong air except the peaktroughpeak curve is smoother there when the drug is applied after the viral peak is reached it has a small but positive effect of faster recovery similar to the scenario shown in figure 6 the level of target cell depletion is also shown for the scenario of the drug started at 15 dpi at the first peak of viral load less than 30 of the target cells are depleted by the infection this is why a second exponential growth starts after the drug is removed to avoid this kind of unwanted effect the antiviral drug needs to be maintained until the virus is completely cleared in the appendix we showed the relationship between the duration the drug needs to be administered and the time the drug is started the simple rule of thumb is that the later the drug is started the longer it is required to be applied to ensure complete clearing of the virusit is interesting to note that immunoglobulin has been widely used to treat covid19 patients in china in a way injection of immunoglobulin can be modeled similarly as antiviral drugs assuming that it is able to deliver some antiviral function it will be interesting to know if some researchers have compiled data to correlate the efficacy of this treatment with the timing of the injections our theory predicts that if the immunoglobulin is used early on it will most likely delay the depletion of target cells so the duration of the disease will be extended for the patients hence with poor prognosis on the other hand if it is applied after the peak of infected cells it should be helpful to some extentin summary for an antiviral drug to be useful the drug needs to be effective enough so that the effective reproductive ratio r falls below 1 see equation 5 for the factors affecting r under such a condition it is desirable to apply it early on and must be maintained until the viral load is completely cleared in the appendix we provide an estimate for the duration of the regimen when a drug cannot meet this criterion applying it before the target cells are fully depleted is typically not beneficial to the patient and likely will make things worse for the patients this should have some significant implications for drug companies when they design the clinical trials at this point as we do not know much about the potential level of the air r0 and the efficacy of the antiviral drug it is difficult to identify a riskfree way of applying the antiviral drug a prudent approach is to measure the viral loads frequently postdrug administration if the viral load does not drop rapidly shortly after it may indicate that the effective r is not below 1 and the drug should be stopped if the drug is known to be effective but not effective enough to cause r to go below 1 it might still be useful to apply it after a large percentage of the target cells have been depleted as a safety measure it may be desirable to continue the regimen for a few more days after the viral load drops below the detection limit to ensure complete clearancecurrently there is already a class of drugs called immunosuppressive drugs drugs to suppress airs a large body of research has been done on the effects of the drugs on different parts of immune response
27
 
28
 the goal of investigating immunosuppressive drugs is to explore their possible applications in covid19 disease managementimmunosuppressants such as corticosteroids have been applied to sars and covid19 patients with positive results
29
 
30
 from the previous discussions we propose a potential treatment plan by applying immunosuppressive drugs as soon as an infection is detected in the lungs and remove the drug as soon as the target cells are fully depleted this approach is simple and only requires the immunosuppressive drugs to be able to reduce the air activity to a level low enough not to interfere with the innate immunity from the discussions around figure 4 this approach should clear out the virus quickly if the air activity level is below 01 if the drug effect is not removed quickly and the air does not rise after the drug is removed the patients may not be able to completely clear the residue level of the virus we projected that a short regimen of antiviral drugs 3 to 5 days after the peak of virus counts may help to completely clear the remaining low level of virus load the purpose of the antiviral drug regimen is to mimic the effect of the air in patients with influenza infectionsif the drug effect can be removed immediately after the peak infection so that the air level increases after the drug is removed we then have a situation that the air peaks after the target cells are depleted the discussions around figure 5 established that with this scenario the virus can always be cleared completely regardless of the level of the air with this approach the novel coronavirus infections are essentially reduced to influenzalike infections in adults except with slower disease progressionone possible concern with our proposed approach is that the immunosuppressive drugs may inevitably have some limited side effects on the innate immune response in addition to the intended effect on the air this is considered by equations 4 which gives us the following see appendix
6rr01k1p1c1tt0trlnt0i01k1pr0c1c1c2
from the above it is clear that the effect on c is to raise r and reduce tr on the other hand if the drug also has some effect on the infection of target cells and the production of virus particles by infected cells due to its immunesuppressing nature the effect should be negative kp which also raises r and reduces tr the effect of reducing tr is beneficial for the patients as it reduces the duration of viral activity in the host on the other hand an increasing r tends to increase the maximum virus count at the peak which may or may not have a significant effect on the patients as the virus are quickly cleared outto address this possible concern we did some simulations with the following the immunosuppressive drug is assumed to have either a 50 or 90 effect on  the drug with 50 effect on  is applied from 1 dpi up to 12 dpi while the second drug is applied from 1 dpi up to 10 dpi the choice to apply the drug from 1 dpi is merely to simplify our simulation and may not be necessary as our main goal is to suppress the air the air peak day is assumed to be the same as the base scenario at 8 dpi and the air activity level is reduced to 01 the same base scenario without drug is also shown as the blue line in figure 8 with both scenarios we observed a big reduction of the duration of viral activity not only the date of viral peak is moved from 16 to 11 dpi but the decay from the peak is also much faster this rapid decay is beneficial for the patients as well and its due to the complete depletion of the target cells the overall virus replication curve with the immunosuppressive drug resembles closely the curve for adult influenza infections shown in figure 2 except with a longer time scale when compared to the base scenario with air the blue line in figure 8 we find that the maximum viral load is increased by a factor of 3647 however if we compare it to the base scenario of innate response alone without air the maximum viral load varies by less than 15 in summary we think that the benefit of shortening the disease duration outweighs the cost of increased viral load for a short periodwe see multiple potential advantages of this novel approach there are a number of wellstudied fdaapproved drug candidates to choose from animal models can help to define the range for the main parameters quickly finally as long as the drug is applied for enough days so that the suppression of the air is beyond the peak of virus load this approach always resulted in a quick clearance of the virus removing the drug in time should enable the air to be fully stimulated so the patient most likely can have antibodybased immunity for the virus in the near future as in the case of patients recovered from influenza infections in our discussion so far we have assumed that the drug effect is immediate namely the drug effect shows up immediately after its application and the effect goes away immediately after the drug is removed this is clearly not realistic so one of the key considerations when selecting the right immunosuppressive drugs is its pharmacokinetics a drug with short elimination and absorption half time is more desirable considering the timesensitive nature of the effect in a recent study by wang et al
29
 the authors reviewed the effect of a lowdose and shortterm application of corticosteroid to covid19 patients at an early stage and found some clear benefits of for the patients as compared to the patients without the treatment including the shortening the disease course this is consistent with our findings in their study the drug corticosteroid was applied for 11 days or more which according to our theory might be a little too long for optimal results considering its half time of 12 to 36 daysprevious studies have investigated the rna expression of ace2 in 72 human tissues
9
 two more recent studies have shown that the percentage of epithelial cells with ace2 receptors in bronchial is much lower than in turbinate and lung tissues 02 vs 23

 considering the difference in surface area between the lungs and the nasal cavity
31
 
32
 
33
 we arrived at a rough estimate of 104 as the ratio of target cells in these two organs a quick simulation using the much lower t0 suggests that the peak of infected cells is changed from 12 to 8 dpi in the nose with the innate immune response alone if infection is localized at the nasal cavity only it is then much more likely for the peak of the air to come after the peak of infected cells in this case most likely the infection will resolve itself just like influenza infections except the disease may take a few more days this may explain why a lot of people do not develop severe symptoms or remain asymptomatic if the infection is localized in the nasal area without reaching and propagating in the lungs if our analysis can be verified clinically methods and techniques for example antiviral nasal sprays to enhance tracheabronchial tubes as a barrier to stop the spread of the virus from upper respiratory tracks to the lungs can be effective in reducing the percentage of patients with pneumoniaanother important parameter we have not discussed is the cell regeneration rate d of the epithelial cells in table 3 we have listed it as 29  104 which corresponds to 103 day1 for d this is based on a study by rawlins and hogan
34
 on the halflife of epithelial cells in the mouse lung this parameter if it is higher will make the depletion of the target cells more difficult this is because as the target cells are depleted new target cells are generated the higher the regeneration rate the more new target cells are available for viruses to infect and stay alive our simulation results remain essentially the same if this parameter is lower or increased by no more than a factor of 20 beyond that depletion of the target cells becomes substantially more difficult to achieve thereby clearing the virus also becomes harder to accomplish could this be the reason for the observed higher severity rate among older patients we reason that this is not likely as the cell regeneration rate should be higher for younger patients while older people are known to have more difficulty repairing lung damage

in this article we have applied the target celllimited model to study the novel corona virus infections mostly in human lungs through comparison between sarscov2 and influenza viruses and by analyzing the interactions among various players target cells innate and airs and different types of drugs we propose that the main reason for the higher probability of severe symptoms prolonged hospital stays and even fatal outcomes for covid19 patients

3
 may be that the peak of infected cells and virus counts often comes after the peak of the air in these patients this mismatch of timing and the resulted interference with innate immunity by adaptive immunity leads to incomplete depletion of the target cells thus providing uninfected target cells for continued infection prolonged infection can induce overactive immune responses secondary complications and sometimes fatal outcomeswe also discussed the prospects of antiviral drugs and immunosuppressive drugs in combating covid19 infections our proposal to apply immunosuppressive drugs at an early stage to reduce the interference from adaptive immunity so that the innate immunity and the depletion of target cells can together achieve fast elimination of the virus seems to be unconventional however it is particularly interesting to note that as we were working on our mathematical modeling the recent study by wang et al
29
 demonstrated that an early stage lowdose and shortterm application of corticosteroid treatment in patients with severe covid19 pneumonia was beneficial and essentially validated our findings we envision that new insights from our analysis and modeling will encourage more work in this directionthe authors declare that there are no conflict of interestsmicroorganisms spreading and consequent infection propagation is a serious concern worldwide yet there are still very few guidelines or legislation for infection propagation control in public spaces the exception is made for healthcare facilities with the existence of few guidelines and orientations for infection prevention and control nevertheless hospital acquired infection hai remains a tremendous problem one of the main causes for the high number of hai reported by the world health organization who is related to the ability of the microorganisms to survive for long periods in hostile environments such as dry surfaces 1 2rooms occupied with infected patients often have their surfaces contaminated with pathogens leading to the contamination of hands and gloves of medical staff and consequent transfer of these microorganisms to patients or onto other surfaces this cross-contamination mechanism has already been recognized and lead to the implementation of hygiene procedures for hands when contacting with patients still it is more likely for a patient to get an infection when staying in a room previously occupied by an infected patient thus infected patients are the primary source of surface and material contamination visitors andor asymptomatic carriers also contribute to the spread of microorganisms especially in situations where there is an apparent sense of safety 3 as said before there are guidelines for surface cleaning and disinfection in hospitals however those recommendations are not sufficient to solve such a problem and the incorrect following of the disinfection instructions can even cause greater contamination problems 4this review considered english-language articles retrieved from pubmed database literature searches bibliographies from published articles and infection-control books and chapters in a total of 205 references published between 2000 and 2018 considering the following criteria the most recent studies performed on microbiological analysis on different surfaces reporting samplings performed on food contact surfaces public spaces and hospital surfaces where microorganisms occur naturally for the antimicrobial and self-cleaning surfaces studies the most recent and relevant works developed on surface modification or functionalization were selected and two main types of surfaces were considered for this review - anti-adhesive surfaces and antimicrobial surfaces along with their subtypes finally products already commercially available with enough reliable manufacturers information about the product and its adequacy to the topics discussed in this review were also includedit is estimated that each year in the united states alone 94 million episodes of foodborne illness occur resulting nearly 56000 hospitalizations and over 1300 deaths the microorganisms most commonly associated with this phenomenon are norovirus salmonella spp clostridium perfringens and campylobacter
7food contamination can result from several factors and occur at different points of the preparation process from farming to the moment of consuming food goes through several steps where contamination by microorganisms can occur temperature and storage conditions are important factors to prevent food spoilage however there are other factors that can cause microbiological contamination 8food-contact surfaces contamination can cause food contamination with pathogens during processing or packaging bacteria are naturally present in plants and animals and it is easy for them to attach to a food contact surface during handling due to adhesion mechanisms bacteria can remain on the surfaces and contaminate other foods 9 chopping boards knifes and preparation tables are just some of the food preparation instruments found contaminated with bacteria 10saad et al 11 evaluated hygiene conditions on food preparation facilities by analysing food-contact surfaces and the results were quite adverse suggesting fecal contamination coliform bacteria were found in dining tables 58 food trays 33 cooking pots 33 and kitchen faucets 8 in addition e coli was identified in some cooking potsin this study surfaces with a count of total mesophilic aerobes of 10 cfucm2 or 1 cfucm2 for e coli and coliforms were considered to fail hygiene criteria according to the commission of the european communities guidelines 12 for hygiene conditions in fresh meat processing facilitiesalthough most countries have guidelines about hygiene measures and good practice on food processing facilities not always the cleaning procedures are sufficient to prevent microorganisms propagation 4 most of the times the cleaning cloths used in cleaning can become contaminated if soaked with disinfectants in the wrong dilution common fault in food handling facilities contributing to microorganisms spread to previously uncontaminated surfaces 13in the food industry the occurrence of biofilm formation is also a common event due to inefficient cleaning and disinfection the remaining microorganisms can survive on the surfaces especially if food residues remain this will promote the development and multiplication of bacteria with consequent biofilm formation that is extremely hard to eliminate becoming even more difficult to disinfect the surface 14schools and day-care centers are hot spots of infection spreading lack of hygiene habits common among very young children is one of the main causes of contamination between kids leading to the contamination of other children staff parents or people in the community either by direct contact or by contaminating surfaces15ibfelt et al 16 evaluated the presence of bacteria and viruses in day-care centers in denmark and different surfaces from toilets kitchens and playrooms were analyzed the results proved contamination by several bacteria and virus despite the main bacteria present were non-pathogenic several surfaces revealed the presence of coliform and nasopharyngeal bacteria respiratory viruses were mainly present on toys but also on pillows and playroom tables gastrointestinal viruses although less prevalent were found in some surfaces mainly on playroom pillows and toilet surfacesa study by jerkovi-mujki et al 17 analyzed potential contamination in 60 public telephones and the results showed high presence of microorganisms on the surfaces staphylococcus epidermidis 733 and bacillus subtilis 40 were the most common bacteria identified however more species were isolatedmukherjee et al 18 evaluated the presence of microorganisms on different surfaces of a fitness center the samples were collected from skin-contact surfaces as floor mats and exercise instruments regularly shared by many people in total 63 species were identified with the presence of some pathogenic or potential pathogenic bacteria like salmonella staphylococcus or klebsiella staphylococci were present in the majority of the surfaces being one the most prevalent species namely s aureus s epidermidis and staphyloccocus saprophyticuskandel et al 19 developed a study with stupefying results they compared microbiological contamination of toilet surfaces with buttons on hospital elevators and the buttons showed higher colonization 61 than the toilets 43 the most common bacteria on both surfaces were staphylococcus and streptococcus however other bacterial species were founded as wells as fungiotter and french 6 studied the presence of microorganisms in hand-touch surface in public transport system the samples were collected from several surfaces in trains stations and buses of london the presence of bacteria was confirmed and most sites presented a median bacterial concentration of 12 cfu cm2 even though there are no guidelines for acceptable values for bacterias presence on surfaces of public spaces this value is higher than the recommended for food-processing surfaces 12 and hospital hand-contact surfaces 20 21it has been recognized that hospitals contaminated surfaces and medical equipment contribute to the contamination of patients and medical staff 3 5 several factors contribute to this occurrence but the mains reason is associated with the high prevalence of microorganisms in healthcare facilitiespathogens with the ability to cause high rates of infection come from different sources such as patients endogenous flora 4060 hands of medical staff and assistants 2040 antibiotic-driven changes in patients flora 2025 and other including contamination of the environment 20 22carling et al 23 24 have shown that in some cases less than 50 of hospital surfaces can be considered clean after terminal disinfection procedures however for specific surfaces the rate can be even more alarming with less than 30 of bedpan cleaners bathroom hand-holds light switches and doorknobs being cleaned 25 contact between hands and gloves of medical staff with contaminated surfaces leads to pathogens spreading to other surfaces and people 5 particularly if they are immunocompromised patients the risk of developing an infection is very high 26stiefel et al 27 found out that the level of contamination of gloves on medical staff after contact with patients skin sites was actually quite similar 40 vs 45 to the level of contamination after contacting with surfaces on methicillin- resistant staphylocococcus aureus mrsa carriers rooms suggesting that environmental surfaces may pose serious risksan identical study from guerrero et al 28 found similar results for c difficile contamination proving that the risk of hand contamination after contact with patients skin was the same than when contacting with rooms highly-touched surfaces 50 vs 50this issue is also related to the compliance of hospital workers on performing disinfection protocols a recent study from stahmeyer et al 29 showed that only 42 of healthcare workers washed their hands before contact with a patient and 50 washed their hands after contact with the patient also this study found out that 943 of healthcare workers hand hygiene procedure lasted less than 15 s average 76 s when the recommendations is that it should last around 30 sanother study evaluating disinfection compliance by healthcare workers showed that only 26 of the enquired radiologists affirmed to disinfect their workstation daily 24 admitted never to have disinfected their workstation and 100 said to have never received any recommendation on how to perform the disinfection 30several studies have proved that surfaces in rooms of patients infected with important pathogens are frequently contaminated and that a person admitted to a room previously occupied by an infected patient has an increased likelihood of developing colonization or infection with that pathogen 25 31a study performed in portugal by geadas farias et al 32 revealed hospital surfaces contamination with different microorganisms mostly pseudomonas and staphylococcus several surfaces were contaminated but some of those with higher microbiological presence were surfaces associated with water distribution system as sinks taps showers and drainsviana et al 33 performed an analysis on hospital mattresses and resistant bacteria were found on about 50 of the evaluated mattresses a baumannii was the main species found being present in 731 of the mattresses but also other pathogens were collected as k pneumoniae and p aeruginosa this study also identified the microorganisms found on mattresses and showed that in 54 of the cases the microorganisms were not related to the current patient admitted in the room but to the previous one concluding that even after cleaning microorganisms still remain on the mattresses being a possible source of contamination to other patientsdespite most studies evaluating the effectiveness of room disinfection have focused on some specific surfaces considered dirty sink toilets etc all spots must be considered since contamination can be present on unsuspected surfaces 34 actually white et al 35 found out in an hospital that microbiologically the sinks and floors were cleaner than hand touch sites as chairs beds and cardiac monitors buttonsshek et al 36 developed a study where hospital curtains of burn and plastic surgery units were microbiologically tested the results proved a considerable presence of bacteria on the curtains even multi resistant bacteria as mrsalevin et al 37 found that in situations of poor infection control practices it is possible for patients to become a source for unresolved contamination of portable radiographic equipment with pathogenic bacteria namely resistant bacterialestari et al 38 performed a similar study but evaluating ecg lead wires and among the 451 lead wires analyzed only 2 were non-contaminated with some type of microorganism coagulase negative staphylococci and aerobic spore forming bacteria two important types of pathogens were present in 96 and 71 of the wires respectively the ineffective cleaning associated with the ability of microorganisms to survive on surfaces under hostile conditions for long periods of time is a serious cause of pathogens spreading to people and to other surfaces 31the presence of biofilms the substances used in the cleaning process and the method and frequency of cleaning all interfere in the grade to which microorganisms resist to the cleaning and disinfection procedures badly executed cleaning procedures may bring bigger problems than not cleaning at all the transmission of microorganisms from a contaminated surface to a clean one can occur if the cleaning method is not correct also most detergents do not have antimicrobial activity they only act in the microorganisms removal leading to the contamination of the cleaning cloths with viable microorganisms and its consequent spread to non-contaminated surfaces 39the frequency of cleaning is also an important factor since surfaces such as toilets sinks and other known as dirty surfaces tend be cleaned frequently 40 however other surfaces thought safe but still highly touched are often neglected being poorly cleaned for example according to the practical guidelines for infection control in health care facilities
41 mattresses without plastic covers must be steam cleaned if contaminated with body fluids however if body fluid contamination does not occur the mattresses are not so often cleaned allowing microorganisms to accumulate with time and use as proved by viana et al 33 also geadas farias et al 32 have found that surfaces usually not considered dirty but highly touched as light switches or nursing trays were contaminated with several microorganismsa very recent study by johani et al 42 revealed the presence of biofilms in many surfaces of intensive care units despite regular disinfection procedures several highly touched surfaces were analyzed and in 70 the presence of biofilm was proved by scanning electron microscopyin many situations the lack of adequate training of the environmental cleaning services or of the medical staff ultimately promotes the use of inappropriate detergents or germicides promoting the survival of microorganisms on the surfaces even after cleaning 43among the most used disinfectants are substances based on hypochlorite alcohols aldehydes phenols and quaternary ammonium compounds 44 however not all of these substances are efficient against some specific types of microorganisms namely spore forming pathogens like c difficile
45 some disinfectants may cause resistance on the microorganisms if not used within specific parameters 46there are several guidelines 41 47 48 for infection control that suggest cleaning and disinfection methodologies to be applied in healthcare facilities these guidelines not only suggest how to disinfect medical equipment but also how to clean environmental surfaces as floors furniture or toilet seats however different guidelines present different opinions on the frequency of cleaning or advisable disinfectantsdetergents for each situation since there is no standardization for the methods and cleaning agents to be usedin addition there is a lack of guidelines suggesting effective standardized methods to assess environmental cleaning visual evaluation is still the most used method to determine a surface cleanness however even if a surface is apparently clean it can contain a high microbial load 49according to the commission of the european communities 12 guidelines for hygiene conditions in fresh meat processing facilities food-contact surfaces with 10 cfucm2 for total viable count and 1 cfucm2 for enterobacteriaceae are considered unacceptablethere are no established limit values for microorganisms on surfaces for public spaces and there is poor control on cleaning performance as depicted in section 22 surfaces in these places are often contaminated showing values higher than those allowed on healthcare facilities 255 cfuscm2 more regulation should be made to assess the cleaning and disinfection efficacy and compliance on such places namely on spaces with more susceptible people as schools day-care centers or elderly homes more guidelines about how to clean and how often would be a good option as well as a higher microbiological assessment on surfaces that is rarely or never done in public spacesfor healthcare facilities there is some controversy about the acceptable number of microorganisms on surfaces since there are no established thresholds only tentative suggestions from researchersfor some authors clean hand-contact surfaces in hospitals must have less than 5 cfuscm2 with an increased risk of infection for values above that 20 other researchers have proposed the maximum value of 25 cfuscm2 as the limit level of contamination in clean hospital surfaces 21 50for some specific microorganisms considered indicator organisms the limit value must be even lower the presence of such microorganisms for example s aureus c difficile vancomycin-resistant enterococci or acinetobacter spp is considered indicative of the need for cleaning even at levels of 1 cfuscm2
20 some reference limit-values either from governmental entities or from research studies are listed in table 2
the limit of 1 cfuscm2 for indicator microorganisms makes sense since it has been shown that an infectious dose of 1 cfuscm2 was sufficient to cause c difficile infection on mice 45 also it was observed that very low doses of norovirus have the capacity to cause infection 51 these results show that microbiological contamination on surfaces poses a real risk of infection since the environmental infectious dose can be very low for some microorganismsthere is still the need for reaching a consensus and creating general guidelines for healthcare facilities establishing clear limit values and implementing frequent microbiological assessment protocols are some of the steps that should be in the horizonthere are several ways to produce materials with anti-fouling properties acting at the level of surface modification with chemical structures functional groups exhibited by the materials surface interact with those in the microorganism cells determining the kinetics of microbial adhesionfor instance surfaces highly negatively charged ie polyanionic surfaces have the ability to repulse the bacteria with polyanionic glycocalice most of gram-positive bacteria through electrostatic interactions however gram-negative bacteria have policationic glycocalices so this surface modification mechanism is only effective against some bacterial species and sometimes only against specific strain types 69zwitterionic materials such as carboxybetaine sulfobetaine and phosphobetaine also have anti-fouling properties zwitterionic polymers have an equal number of anionic and cationic groups present in their repeating unit this fact gives these polymers ultra-hydrophilicity and consequently great hydration ability 70 71 studies concerning surface modification with zwitterionic polymers have proved to be a promising strategy to reduce microorganisms adhesion 72 73 very recently a study using a tyramine-conjugated sulfobetaine polymer grafted on polyurethane showed a great reduction in s aureus adhesion to the surface 74coating with polymeric brushes can also prevent microorganisms adhesion apart from avoiding direct contact between microorganisms and the surfaces the polymers used for brushes are usually hydrophilic so water will be attracted into the brush forming a repellent layer in aqueous environment proteins and microorganisms encountering the brush surface will be repelled by steric hindrance due to the water bound in the brush and the elasticity of the polymer chains 75 polyethylene oxide peo and polyethylene glycol peg are two examples of polymers used to produce hydrophilic brush coatings on biomaterials in a recent study by hadjesfandiari et al 76 it was proved that peo brushes covalently immobilized reduced 98 the adhesion of staphylococci and e coli to a surfaceapart from the chemistry also topography of a surface can be structured to increase anti-adhesive properties as an attempt to find efficient alternatives over more classic antimicrobials micronanostructured materials present themselves as possible solutions recently have been done an attempt to elucidate if alterations on micro or nanotopography of a surface could influence colonization and consequent contamination an example of structure modification is the application of superficial nanostructures nanoparticles nanofibers or nanotubes reducing the area available for microorganisms to attach 77 78 79as said previously mimicking the topography of anti-adhesive surfaces innately present in nature is an innovative way to obtain new self-disinfecting surfacesmany plants have special surface properties namely wettability for instance lotus leaves have micropapillae structures covered by nanostructures with fine branch-like shape these structures along with epicuticular needle-shaped wax tubes that cover them give the lotus leaf a superhydrophobic surface and consequently antifouling properties water droplets roll down the lotus leaf due to its great hydrophobicity dragging out any possible particles present and maintaining its surface clean 80other example of nature that inspired anti-adhesive surfaces coating is sharkskin sharks have a special scale micropattern which consist of a rectangular base embedded in the skin with tiny spines on the surface the ribbed texture of these scales is responsible for the self-cleaning anti-biofouling hydrophobic and drag reducing properties of shark skin 81 82 such properties have made of sharkskin one of the most mimicked surfaces not only in research environment but in industrial area toosharklet af sharklet technologies alachua fl usa is a company that uses shark skin topography in different surfaces in order to avoid bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation 83 84 a study comparing sharklet micropattern surfaces with regular surfaces in a clinical simulated scenario proved that shark skin microtopography reduced the number of attached bacteria by about 5 fold 85some materials have intrinsic antimicrobial properties they do not need antimicrobial loading to exert its activity since the material by itself has the natural ability to eliminate microorganisms among the most known natural materials with antimicrobial properties are metals as silver copper or zinc and polymers like chitosan 68for many metals with antimicrobial properties it is the ionic form that presents higher bactericidal activity and not the elemental metal silver and copper are good examples of thatsilver has been used in medical field for many centuries due to its antimicrobial properties its bactericidal mechanism is based on the binding of silver atoms with thiol sh and disulfide ss groups present in the proteins of bacterial cell membranes leading to its disruption and eventual cell death 87 silver has been used for many applications on medical field especially when added in the form of silver sulfadiazine to creams or wound dressings 88 several wound dressing containing silver are available on market however not always they comply the expectations cavanagh et al 89 analyzed 6 different silver dressings on market and only two of them showed bactericidal activity against s aureus apart from that silver dressing may be related with increased serum silver levels with an associated decrease on white blood cells 90 this leads us to conclude that the delivery system of the antimicrobial is very important a delivery mechanism that acts by contact without leaching silver ions to the surrounding areas or tissues would be good strategy to achieve antimicrobial action without compromise the safety of the productmore recently silver nanoparticles have been greatly studied and used to produce potential antimicrobial materials such as catheters and surgery sutures 91 92 however for biomaterials implanted inside the organism there are some possible risks associated with releasing of silver ions causing local toxicity and possible accumulation in organs 93 silver may also have different ranges of efficacy according to the class of bacteria gram-positive bacterias cell walls do not have an outer membrane as gram-negative bacteria do but they have several layers of peptidoglycans making their cell wall thicker 94 this along with their negative charge results in the trapping of silver ions positively charged preventing their entrance into the bacteria 95agc glass ags glass uk ltd rugby great britain developed an antibacterial glass by incorporating silver ions inside the glass the company claims that this glass eliminates 99 of bacteria and prevents fungi proliferation which they demonstrated in the three bacterial and two fungi strains evaluated 96surfacine development company tyngsborough ma usa is another company that developed a silver coating surfacine that can be applied in several materials from medical devices to food preparations and packaging industry or water distribution systems this coating showed good antimicrobial activity against several bacteria fungi and yeast 97other company purethread technologies inc cary nc usa has developed purethread a system that embeds silver salts into textile fibers obtaining antimicrobial textiles according to the company this system does not weaken or disappears during washing and kills 999 of microorganisms after four hours of contact with the fabric 98 a scientific paper about a study involving hospital curtains incorporating the antimicrobial textile developed by this company proved that those curtains take more time to be contaminated for the first time when compared to regular curtains 99similarly to silver copper has been used for many centuries as an antimicrobial agent especially for water treatment and transportation copper was also very used in the nautical field to prevent adhesion and growth of organisms in hulls of ships 100 the bactericide mechanism of copper is related to the release of copper ions that cause damage in the bacterial envelop and consequent leakage of the cell content and influx of copper ions into the bacteria this will generate toxic radicals causing oxidative damage to cellular components and dna degradation 101more recently copper came up as an alternative for preventing hospital acquired infections through its application in hospital surfaces and medical equipment 102 a study by souli et al 103 performed on a hospital intensive care unit compared two rooms one with copper coated equipment beds side table intravenous pole stands etc and the other with regular equipment the copper coated equipment room presented a reduced percentage of colonized surfaces 556 compared to the regular compartment 725 this study showed both reductions in colonization by gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and in total bioburden 29 vs 76 cfu100 cm2sifri et al 60 also developed a study where a section of an acute care unit was equipped with copper impregnated materials hard surfaces and textiles-patients gowns sinks bed rails tray tables sheets and blankets the results were quite promising with copper equipped section presenting patients infection reductions of 83 when caused by c difficile and 68 when caused by multi drug resistant organisms comparing to a non-modified section in the same hospital unit two companies that collaborate with each other cupron medical textiles cupron inc richmond va usa and cupron enhanced eos surfaces eos surfaces norfolk va usa provided the copper impregnated materials used for this study the product developed is a hard-antimicrobial surface impregnated with copper that continuously kills 999 of harmful bacteria in two hours according to its specifications according to the company this surface is effective against s aureus enterobacter aerogenes mrsa e coli and p aeruginosa
104in materials incorporation process the antimicrobial substances are added to the ingredients during the phase of production to obtain a homogeneous mixture of the bulk material with the antimicrobial this system allows antimicrobial activity throughout the bulk material even in deeper layers and not only on the surface this allows the material to retain its antimicrobial activity even when worn out 118 119in a very recent study ferreira et al 120 used levofloxacin to load a bone cement achieving good results against s aureus not only on its planktonic form but also on biofilm that was quite positive since this bacterial strain is greatly associated with biofilm formation on bone implantsciprofloxacin incorporation on textile fibers by electrospinning was tested by li et al 79 this strategy aimed to produce a bandage to prevent wound infection and the results in vivo rats animal model were quite positive for e coli and s aureusin han et al 121 study they incorporated quaternary ammonium methacrylates in dental adhesives to prevent caries by avoiding the accumulation of bacteria and biofilm formation on teeth testing the presence of three staphyloccocal species staphylococcus mutans staphylococcus gordonii and staphylococcus sanguinis and the results showed a decreased biofilm formation for the adhesives containing the quaternary ammonium methacrylatesnanoparticles containing quaternary ammonium polyethylenimine were tested in a study about endodontic sealers by barros et al 118 the results were quite positive for enterococcus faecalis with the endodontic sealers showing good antimicrobial activitythe amp ll-37 was incorporated by cassin et al 122 in a membrane of collagen and hyaluronic acid for the production of anti-infective films to cover injured tissuesantimicrobial coatings can be obtained either by adsorption of the antimicrobial substance by covalently binding it to the material or by immobilizing it using self-assembled monolayers this strategy can be an advantage for some substances that are too toxic to be used as bulk material but that immobilized in small amounts as surface coatings can exert their antimicrobial activity without the toxicity drawback 116 123the coatings can also be divided according to their mechanism of action they can deliver the antimicrobial substance by leaching releasing it to the surrounding area or direct contact with the surface where the coating is immobilizedsome coatings release substances with antibacterial properties that will interact with microorganisms acting away from the bulk this leaching mechanism has the advantage of a larger perimeter of action around the surface where it is immobilized it is important though that this release into the surrounding area is controlled to avoid toxic effects by excess of substance 124coatings can also attach certain antimicrobial molecules to the materials surface several coatings can be classified as contact biocides since they use non-leachable substances that kill by contact with the bacteria and with no need to be released from the surface this strategy is very interesting for both the self-sterilizing effect and the long-lasting activity acting just through a direct contact with bacteria without consuming itself releasing from the surface without need 117 125alt et al 126 realized a study where coating of rifampicin and fosfomycin was applied to prosthesis showing good efficacy against s aureus even the methicillin resistant strain on a rabbit animal model neut et al 127 performed a similar study using a gentamicin-releasing coating that was able to prevent staphylococci growth on a prosthetic hip surface for at least 60 hours showing promising resultsin a work by iyamba et al 106 quaternary ammonium compounds hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide and hexadecylbetainate chloride were immobilized on medical catheters reducing s aureus adhesion to its surface zanini et al 128 also developed a work in which quaternary ammonium silanes were used to coat polyurethane catheters the results were promising with this coating proving its antimicrobial activity against e coli bacteriain a recent study casciaro et al 111 successfully covalently immobilized frog skin derived amp on contact lenses this strategy not only reduced the adhesion of p aeruginosa a species highly associated with contact lenses associated keratitis but it also proved to be non-toxic to mammalian cells and it did not compromise the lenses physical propertiesamps have also been immobilized on nanoparticles as loading strategy ma et al 112 immobilized the amp hhc-36 on titanium oxide tio2 nanotubes by physical adsorption with the nanotubes acting as nanocarriers for peptides delivery they obtained an antimicrobial and anti-fouling surface showing a reduction in s aureus adhesion and great antimicrobial activity 99 activity braun et al 129 immobilized the human peptide ll-37 on porous silica nanoparticles achieving an antimicrobial delivery systemall the studies presented above prove the good potential of modified surfaces to be applied on infection control in different scenarios still some aspects must be taken into account and more studies are still needed most studies evaluating the antimicrobialanti-adhesive activity potential of engineered surfaces do not take into account realistic physiological environments this can affect the results since the hosts conditioning film may affect the surface in many different ways for example covering the surface creating a deterrent layer preventing the antimicrobial substance to leach or to contact directly with the microorganisms reducing its antimicrobial efficacy 130in addition the composition of the surface may determine which components of the conditioning film will adhere and that on its turn will influence other cells adhesion as bacteria felgueiras et al 123 showed that different concentrations of octadecyl acrylate c18 immobilized on polyurethane surfaces will affect the deposition of albumin and fibrinogen when the surface is in contact with human plasma that on its turn will affect microorganisms adhesion to the surface since albumin avoids bacteria adhesion and fibrinogen promotes it besides coatings with antimicrobial peptides can be degraded by some components of conditioning films such as proteases 131despite the pointed weaknesses there are already on the market some successful cases of such as biocote limited coventry united kingdom that developed an antimicrobial additive technology biocote that can be incorporated on textiles polymers ceramics and more these additives are based on different antimicrobial substances such as silver zinc or phenolic compounds chosen according to their application and support material 132sanitized ag burgdorf switzerland is another company that developed an antimicrobial additive that can be incorporated in polymers and textiles for different areas of application such as healthcare public transportation and food industry this additive technology sanitized uses different active ingredients as silver zinc pirithione silane quat or isothiazolinone that can be added on liquid form powder or paste according to specific production requirements of the final product 133photo-activated materials have been used in different technological fields namely in antimicrobial surfaces development the most studied material used in photo-activated surfaces production is tio2 tio2 has high photocatalytic properties and is highly used in cosmetics and skin care products since it is not absorbed by human skin 134 becoming a very interesting material for development of antimicrobial surfacesin fact its antimicrobial efficacy has already been proved against bacteria fungi protozoa and virus the main advantage of this strategy is that tio2 is not degraded so its activity can be maintained for long periods tio2 surfaces are only activated when irradiated by specific photon energy when this irradiation occurs reactions of photo-oxidation involving o2 and h2o take place on the surface with consequent formation of oxygen free radicals these free radicals will attack the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane of the microorganism by peroxidizing its lipids leading to leakage of cellular components and lately cell lysis 135 136recently adn et al 137 published a study where a water microfiltration system using photocatalytic membranes produced with tio2 and porous steel showed good inactivation for the retained bacteriain another study by joost et al 138 thin films with tio2 nanoparticles were illuminated with uv light and after 20 min of exposure no bacteria e coli had survived the analysis of bacterial cell membrane showed modifications in the chemical structure of unsaturated fatty acids and decomposition of saturated fatty acids faster than normal confirming the peroxidation of membrane lipidsin the market there are already some products for microorganism elimination based on tio2 photocatalytic action purehealth orion florence italy is a system developed by orion that coats walls and floors and is activated by special lamps of solar spectrum this system promises to eliminate virus and bacteria 139this review points out the great contribution of surfaces for infection spreading not only in healthcare facilities but also in other public spaces and food processing facilitiesthere is an urgent need to pay more attention to surface contamination in different spaces since there is still a lack of guidelines for microbiologic assessment and established safe thresholds for health care facilities in addition it is important to establish infection control procedures for public spaces namely schools since they often present high microbiological charges on surfaces posing a real risk for children whose immunological system is still developingboth on public spaces and on healthcare facilities it should be determined how to assess microbiologic presence on surfaces as well as how frequently this assessment should be made and which methods should be used to obtain a realistic analysis rather than performing visual assessments the implementation of standard acceptable limits of microorganisms on surfaces is also a key point for a better control of infection spreading standardized definition of which microorganisms can be considered indicator microorganisms should also be achievedthe existing guidelines for cleaning and disinfection methodologies in healthcare facilities should come to a consensus about the disinfectants to be used in each setting the frequency of cleaning and the methods to applythe implementation of self-disinfecting surfaces is a good strategy for infection control and this review presents some successful research already developed in this area these surfaces show clear advantages over the regular surfaces with traditional cleaning the state of continuous disinfection and the antimicrobial activity that permanently eliminates the microorganismsthere are still some issues to improve like the long-term efficacy of the antimicrobialanti-adhesive action or the high cost of implementation of these surfaces in large areasbiomaterials modified surfaces or new scientific products in general have to face some big challenges before they reach the market problems such as costs of manufacturability scalability on production intellectual property issues or regulatory aspects are just some of the main obstacles those products will have to overcome in order to be commercialized 140 some products even with great results on laboratory will fail when brought to larger scale due to their high cost of production making them commercially unattractive but looking at the numbers nosocomial bacteremia alone can cost a hospital over 1 million euros per year 141 and antibiotic resistance-associated infections may cost more than 900 million euros per year in european unionin fact the societal cost of infections due to the selected antibiotic-resistant bacteria were estimated at about eur 15 billion each year between hospital related costs and losses in productivity due to patients absence from work 142 therefore maybe it is worthy to invest on new technologies betting on infection prevention and control not only to avoid higher costs but also to avoid the harm and loss of human livesself-disinfecting surfaces are a step forward to the future of infection control policies more studies involving self-disinfecting surfaces should be performed in order to realize its full potential to improve infection control and safety strategies the reports on the application of these materials in healthcare facilities show promising results and there are already few companies supplying products with self-disinfecting properties showing that investment on prevention may be the best way to reduce the tremendous problem of infection spreadingthe authors declare no conflict of interestan antibody also called an immunoglobulin is a protective protein produced by the immune system in response to the presence of a foreign substance antigen such as a pathogen antibodies recognize and latch onto antigens in order to remove them from the body antibodies are proteins produced and secreted by b cells lymphocytes 17because a principal function of b lymphocytes is antibody production it is important to understand the salient features of these defense molecules and describe their different isotypes or classes antibodies are glycosylated protein molecules present on the surface of b cells surface immunoglobulins serving as antigen receptors bcr or are secreted into the extracellular space where they can bind and neutralize their target antigens 17 a single antibody molecule consists of four protein chains two heavy h chains and two light l chains linked to each other by disulfide bonds the n-terminus regions of the heavy and light chains which collectively make up the antigen-binding site are where the variability between one antibody molecule and another resides hence determining specificity an important feature is that each antibody recognizes a specific antigen a phenomenon called antibody specificity for example an antibody that recognizes the mumps virus cannot recognize the measles virus and can only recognize one particular binding site on the mumps virus there will likely be multiple antibodies to multiple different binding sites on an antigen such as a virus for example some antibodies to covid-19 will target binding sites on proteins in the outer shell while some may target nucleic acid binding sites but each will be specific and unique only when two different but similar viruses have identical structures will cross-reactivity occur for example if multiple strains of a coronavirus have maintained regions of nucleic acid that have not undergone mutation an antibody that targets that region in one may target the identical region in another conversely an antibody that recognizes the measles virus generally cannot recognize the mumps virusfive isotypes or classes of antibodies igm igd igg iga and ige exist and they are distinguished according to the c-terminus regions of the heavy chains which are constant and therefore do not participate in antigen binding instead these regions designated fc are important for the common effector functions of antibodies the means by which antibodies eliminate pathogens or alternatively cause tissue injury it should be noted that there are four subclasses or isotypes of igg antibodies igg1 igg2 igg3 and igg4 the distinction of which is beyond the scope of this discussion antibodies exert effector functions in three principal ways 17antibodies are found in plasma and in extracellular fluid antibodies have three primary functions1antibodies are secreted into the blood and mucosa where they bind to and inactivate foreign substances such as pathogens and toxins neutralization antibody neutralization is important for protection from viruses as it can prevent the virus from then being able to enter and infect cells it is also important in binding to bacterial toxins and is the primary mechanism for protection conferred by successful vaccination2antibodies facilitate phagocytosis of foreign substances by phagocytic cells opsonization antibody binding for example will not prevent bacterial replication rather in this setting the mechanism of enhanced protection through opsonization will increase phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils3the third function is antibody activation of the complement system to destroy pathogens through lysis and enhanced chemotaxis
after an infection the cells producing pathogen-specific antibodies multiply and increase proportionally as a result the body is protected from repeated infection this feature is called immunological memory one of the most significant features of the immune response is its ability to retain a memory of previous infections and this is also the principal behind the effectiveness of vaccinations this both protects individuals from reinfection and limits the spread of infection in a community immune memory can be very long-lasting immunological memory for the measles infection in adults decays so slowly it would take over 3000 years to decrease by half this therefore goes well beyond life-long protection for this particular antigen these robust durable changes are the reason that when we vaccinate the protection this produces delivers long-term benefits within an individual immune memory must be distributed throughout the body circulating antibodies travel in the blood reaching everywhere the circulation does including extracellular spaces and in secretions natural killer nk cells can remain on guard within tissues alert but not activated ready to attack rapidly if reinfection occurs nk cells are activated in response to macrophage-derived cytokines and they serve to contain viral infections while the adaptive immune response generates antigen-specific cytotoxic t cells that can clear the infection nk cells work to control viral infections by secreting interferon gamma and tnf while also stimulating nk cells nearby with such secretions and destroying physiologically challenged cells due to viral infection or malignancy through complex mechanisms outside the scope of this reviewfinally some infections have such a profound impact on a species that the imprint of individual pathogens can be seen in the tree of evolution if an infection is lethal only individuals who have genes that encode effective resistance will survive to produce the next generation thereby driving herd immunity through natural selection rather than vaccination or infection modern methods of analyzing inheritance have demonstrated how the co-evolution of host and infection has shaped the make-up of the immune system and the receptors it uses for recognizing and fighting pathogensigg is the most abundant antibody isotype in the blood plasma accounting for 70 to 75 of human immunoglobulins antibodies igg binds antigen and drives the recognition of antigen-antibody complexes by leukocytes and macrophages igg is transferred to the fetus through the placenta and protects the infant until its own immune system is functional igg is largely responsible for long term immunity after infection or vaccinationigm usually circulates in the blood accounting for about 10 of human immunoglobulins igm generally has a pentameric structure in which five basic y-shaped molecules are linked together b cells produce igm first in response to microbial infectionantigen invasion these are early phase immunoglobulins that will develop first during acute infection although igm has a lower affinity for antigens than igg it has higher avidity for antigens because of its pentameric structure igm by binding to the cell surface receptor also activates cell signaling pathwaysiga is abundant in serum nasal mucus saliva breast milk and intestinal fluid accounting for 10 to 15 of human immunoglobulins iga forms dimers ie two iga monomers joined togetherige is present in minute amounts accounting for no more than 0001 of human immunoglobulins its primary role is to protect against parasites in regions where parasitic infection is rare ige is primarily involved in allergyigd accounts for less than 1 of human immunoglobulins igd may be involved in the induction of antibody production in b cells but its exact function remains unknownmolecular test methods are considered the only reliable means of diagnosing an active case of covid-19 particularly early in the infection course and is the only means of determining if a patient is contagious to others by detecting the presence of viral genetic material in the nasal oral and respiratory tracts one can determine if a patient is actively shedding virus which can be spread to others these tests are perhaps of greatest utility early in the course of infection as they can confirm viral presence up to 2 days prior to the onset of symptoms given that antibodies may not be detectable until 6-7 days after symptom onset molecular tests can accelerate the diagnostic window by up to 9 days the duration of viral shedding can be highly variable and depend upon severity of symptoms length of illness and patient-specific immune response generally speaking viral shedding is undetectable 21 to 35 days after symptom onset or 3 to 5 days after a patient becomes asymptomatic at the end of the disease course viral load ultimately becomes undetectable and therefore a molecular test will not detect a prior infection even one that has recently resolved while point of care molecular tests for sars-cov-2 are becoming more widely available with faster result times all currently available tests require a laboratory analyzer platform which are generally in short supply and on back order for several months there remains a backlog of samples for molecular testing at many labs and public health officials have put in place strict guidelines requiring severe symptoms in order to qualify to receive a molecular testtherefore there is a clear role for antibody testing as an important tool in the diagnostic toolbox for covid-19 antibody testing can provide important insight to individuals about their functional immunity to the ongoing pandemic giving piece of mind and assisting with decisions about return to community activities and the workplace these tests also provide valuable information to public health officials about the spread of virus in different communities especially in light of the high reported numbers of asymptomatic cases furthermore while never a primary diagnostic tool antibody status can be used to aid the clinical diagnosis of suspected non-critical cases that present 7 days or more after the start of symptoms in these cases the use of simple cost effective point of care antibody cassette systems can offload the pressure on molecular testing throughput to make those resources more immediately available to the acutely ill and critical patientswith the rapid acceleration of the covid-19 pandemic there has been a rush to develop tests that can detect the presence of antibodies produced by the body in response to exposureinfection with the sars-cov-2 virus these testing methodologies rely on the antigen-antibody binding affinity described above the test principle relies on a recombinant antigen produced in the laboratory which is designed to mimic specific structures of the virus causing any antibodies present in whole blood or serum with a binding affinity to attach to the antigen the specificity of the test can be highly dependent upon the target antigen that is chosen as some viral structures can be highly conserved across broad families of virus and others can be highly derived and specific to a given strain therefore it is important to understand the cross reactivity to other viruses of the test being used so as to avoid misinterpretation of a false positive result that may be detecting an antigen from a similar virus yet not confer immunity to the sars-cov-2 virus these tests fall into two broad categories laboratory-based immunoassays which require a reader or analyzer to detect the reaction and cassette-based systems which can be read at the point of care through a change in color in an indicator region visible to the naked eyelaboratory-based immunoassays have several technical advantages when compared to cassette-based systems because they are read by sensitive laboratory instrumentation and a controlled aliquot is delivered to the test system they can be considered quantitative or semi-quantitative tests therefore they can determine how much of a given antibody titer level is present per unit volume of serum and when operating at the margins of detection their sensitivity and specificity can be higher than cassette-based systems however these systems have real disadvantages infrastructure costs requirements for venous puncture additional steps in sample processing time to obtain results and practical through put challenges are problematic and substantially increase cost per testcassette-based systems rely on a color change that is visible to the human eye and is more appropriate for use at the point of care with almost immediate results available to healthcare workers and patients cassette systems use the principle of lateral flow immunoassay or immunochromatography the cassette contains a shallow well into which approximately 10 to 15ul eg two small drops from a finger prick of whole blood serum or plasma are placed along with a small quantity of buffer specific to the test kit the blood and buffer are absorbed into a porous test strip which is impregnated with recombinant viral antigens doped with an indicator eg colloidal gold latex particles europium or quantum dots antibodies from the serum bind to antigens in the test strip and are wicked laterally along the length of the test strip in the indicator regions of the test kit anti-human antibodies which are immobilized in the test strip will bind to the antigen-antibody complex and hold them in the indicator region the colloidal gold or other colorant accumulates in the indicator region leading to a visible change in color along a narrow band of the wicking substrate there may be one or more indicator regions with anti-human antibodies that are specific to igm igg or other immunoglobulins all tests should also contain a control indicator line to confirm that the test sample has appropriately wicked along the length of the assay and antigens in the test kit remain viable therefore confirming a valid test procedure figure 1
 this entire process from finger-stick to result occurs in less than 15 minutesthese points of care test cassettes are intended to be read as a binary outcome presenceabsence for each antibody indicator region while the degree of color change may be an indicator of the quantity of antibody present in a sample variability between antibody concentrations in whole blood plasma and serum along with a buffer that is added in drops make it unreliable to attempt interpretation of color change intensity with most currently available technology kits that use fluorescent indicators can provide semiquantitative results with a hand-held or tabletop reader and appropriate sample preparation techniques but cannot be read by eye the advantages of lateral flow immunoassay kits are that they can be produced at low cost and in large quantities they can be used point of care with finger-stick whole blood samples require low human and facility resource utilization and can provide very rapid test results  while a patient remains on site this makes lateral flow immunoassay cassettes an ideal choice for population level sampling and workforce sampling for small and large employers as discussed further belowsince most test kits contain indicator lines for both igm and igg antibodies there are several different combinations and corresponding interpretations of results that may occur results themselves should always be interpreted in accordance with the package insert and instructions for use with the specific test kit being utilized but the following discussion is helpful in linking the binary results of the typical antibody test to clinical meaning and making informed recommendations for patients and the workforce as discussed earlier igm antibodies are produced in the short term after infection while igg are produced in a more delayed timescale the use of both is advantageous 18 19 20 in a recent study of 535 plasma samples taken from 173 patients with sars-cov-2 the median seroconversion time for total antibody ab igm and then igg were day-11 day-12 and day-14 separately the presence of antibodies was 40 among patients within 1-week since onset and rapidly increased to 1000 ab 943 igm and 798 igg 15 days after onset in contrast rna detectability decreased from 667 in samples collected before day-7 to 455 during day 15-39 combining rna and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for covid-19 p0001 even in early phase of 1-week since onset p0007 moreover a higher titer of ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification p0006 consistent with the understanding that more symptomatic patients are likely to have higher antibody responses and higher inflammatory markers on average using the sars coronavirus as an example igm antibodies generally rise above the detectable threshold for these point of care tests in approximately 5 to 7 days after the initial onset of symptoms assuming a patient does develop symptoms after infection the igm then remains above the detection threshold for 14 to 21 days from symptom onset about midway through the rise and fall of igm production around day 14 post-symptom onset igg will rise above detection levels igg production will generally continue to rise for 28 to 35 post symptom onset peaking around or after clinical recovery igg typically has a long half-life and will remain above detectable thresholds for months or even years after the resolution of infectionthe clinical level of functional immunity imparted by sars-cov-2 igg antibodies and their critical concentration cutoffs have not been determined for this virus therefore recommendations must be based on similar viruses and knowledge of the immune system ultimately this information will be available and quantitative tests will be valuable in determining immunity titers months and years after covid-19 infection or vaccination once vaccines exist based on experience with other viruses if reinfection does occur with the same pathogen one would expect symptom severity and duration to be greatly reduced due to the inherent memory of the immune system further the hyperimmune response that leads to ards and which is associated with the high mortality rate of this virus would expect to be mitigated by the presence of a prior immune responsefor the interpretation of results in an effort to make meaningful recommendations on community behavior to test recipients there are several factors that must be considered1is subject symptomatic or asymptomatic at the time of antibody testing2if symptomatic how long since symptom onset3igm positive or negative4igg positive or negative
interpreting results when subject is asymptomatic at the time of testing
both igm and igg are negative

figure 1
 left image subjects immune system has not produced any antibodies to the target viral antigen and is not suspected of having covid-19 it is not likely the subject has had the infection in the past and the subject is not immune to getting the infection in the future this result does not rule out that the subject was recently exposed to the virus and is not yet producing antibodies a subject that was recently exposed to the virus could spread the disease even if this test is negative and they are asymptomatic as long as the virus is spreading in the community the subject should continue to practice social distancing or current guidelines to protect themselves and those around them if the subject does develop symptoms they should seek medical care and repeat testing based on future potential exposure or symptoms
igg is positive and igm is negative

figure 2

 the subjects immune system has produced longer acting antibodies to the target viral antigen subject likely had the infection several weeks ago even if no symptoms were present the subject has some degree of functional immunity to the virus depending upon the time that has passed since exposure it is unlikely that the subject is spreading virus a molecular test may be used to rule out viral shedding as discussed in greater detail in the next section
igm is positive and igg is negative

figure 3
 this test result indicates that the immune system is actively producing antibodies to a recent infection the subject should immediately isolate from healthy individuals and seek further medical advice if symptoms develop this subject can likely spread disease to others even when asymptomatic subject may remain symptom free experience minor symptoms or worsening symptoms as the disease course progresses subject should be vigilant and seek care appropriate to the symptoms they experience after at least 14 to 21 days the subject should consider repeat testing to confirm their igg antibody status has become positive and they are outside the expected window to shed virus before returning to normal activities if more rapid return to community activities is warranted eg for critical industry workers a molecular test should be performed to assess viral shedding status
both igm and igg are positive

figure 4
 subjects immune system is actively producing antibodies to an ongoing infection that likely began more than 14 days ago subject should immediate isolate from healthy individuals and seek further medical advice if symptoms develop subject is likely experiencing an asymptomatic disease course but may still be able to spread the disease to others consider repeat testing in 7 to 14 days to confirm igg only status before returning to normal activities if more rapid return to community activities is warranted eg for critical industry workers a molecular test should be performed to assess viral shedding statusinterpreting results when symptomatic at the time of testing
both igm and igg are negative subjects immune system has not produced any antibodies to the target viral antigen if it has been greater than 7 days since onset of fever or other symptoms the disease is unlikely to be covid-19 but a full panel test including covid-19 influenza and bacterial bronchitis could be performed if available and recommended based on history and symptoms if it has been less than 7 days since the onset of symptoms covid-19 cannot be ruled out with antibody testing alone subject should isolate from others and could repeat antibody testing at least 7 days after the onset of symptoms unless a molecular test was available for confirmation if symptoms are severe and covid-19 is suspected based on clinical signs a molecular test is indicated for the detection of viral genetic material in respiratory samples subject should not return to normal activities until sars-cov-2 infection is ruled out through alternate diagnoses molecular testing or repeat antibody testing or appropriate time has elapsed after symptom development to rule out ongoing viral shedding shedding can occur up to approximately 31 days from exposure
igg is positive and igm is negative subjects immune system has produced antibodies to the target viral antigen subject is likely in the later stages of the disease course but may still be contagious to others and capable of spreading the virus subject should remain isolated from disease negative population for at least 14 days to minimize the chance of spreading the virus if more rapid return to community activities is warranted eg for critical industry workers a molecular test should be performed to assess viral shedding status
igm is positive and igg is negative subjects immune system is actively producing antibodies to a recent infection with the target virus subject should immediately isolate from healthy individuals and seek medical care appropriate to the symptom severity they experience subject can spread the disease to others at this point in disease course after at least 14 to 21 days subject should consider repeat testing to determine igg status before returning to normal activities
both igm and igg are positive subjects immune system is actively producing antibodies to an ongoing infection that likely began more than 14 days ago subject should immediately isolate from healthy individuals and seek further medical care appropriate to the symptom severity they experience subject can likely still spread the disease to others consider repeat testing in 7 to 14 days to confirm igg only status before returning to normal activities if more rapid return to community activities is warranted eg for critical industry workers a molecular test should be performed to assess viral shedding statusas outlined above regardless of the testing methodology employed to detect antibodies these tests are not intended to be used a means to diagnose an active infection this is primarily because 1 there is a temporal lag between exposure to the virus and the development of antibodies by the immune system and 2 antibodies will persist long after the body has cleared an infection these tests are an excellent tool to be used in parallel with molecular testing patient history and clinical presentation in symptomatic patients or used in asymptomatic patients over a period of time to understand return to activity recommendations the temporal framework related to exposure onset of symptoms production of igm and igg symptom resolution and virus shedding throughout the course of disease have not been well quantified for sars-cov-2 specifically at this time most of the data and recommendations have been extrapolated from the studies done on the first sars outbreak in the early 21st century it is also important to understand that molecular testing is imperfect as well with up to 30 false negative rates in some series therefore when looking at the sensitivity and specificity of antibody testing one must be academic enough to recognize the inherent weaknesses of using such a test to evaluate another test it will be hard to know whether a positive antibody test in a patient with a negative molecular test means the former test is a false positive or the latter was a false negative physicians must truly diligence these products and be satisfied with the data as well as the track record of the company marketing it we expect a lot more information to be forthcoming in the peer-reviewed literature over the next 6 to 18 months which will improve the interpretation and utility of antibody testsa study in the wake of sars the similar coronavirus that triggered an epidemic in 2003 showed that survivors maintained neutralizing antibodies for two years on average with the number of antibodies declining thereafter other coronaviruses in circulation in the human species also lead to at least partial immunity for some period of time the immunity question has implications for whether covid-19 follows an annual cycle like seasonal influenza or becomes dormant for multiple years and then erupts again according to a recent publication in the journal science the authors noted that two other coronaviruses in circulation oc43 and hku1 which cause common colds result in about 45 weeks of immunity on average if the new virus follows that pattern it would probably create annual outbreaks they found 21 however generally speaking the sicker you become due to an infection and the robust immune system response to it the more robust the immunity provided therefore one might assume that those people who get the most ill have the longest and most effective immunity after a re-exposure to the same virus in a study by callow et al 22 people volunteered to have coronavirus 229e which also causes common cold symptoms inoculated up their nares ten became infected and eight developed cold symptoms one year later all but one of them returned to be re-infected again the majority were re-infected but those who had been ill before did not develop cold symptoms moreover the period during which the patients shed the virus and were potentially contagious was shorter the new virus sars-cov-2 is genetically similar to the first sars virus  hence the 2  but it affects people differently it is not as lethal as the original sars but is more easily spread ro is higher 23 many people who are infected do not develop symptoms at all and yet can potentially transmit the virus to othersa very recent report from china that has not yet been peer-reviewed found a wide range of antibodies among people with mild cases of the virus most strikingly younger people had fewer antibodies in the wake of the disease  and 30 percent of those sampled had low levels some individuals had no trace of antibodies that has raised the question of whether a person with a mild or asymptomatic infection but confirmed by the sensitive pcr test might still be susceptible to a second infection the neutralizing antibody titers were positively correlated with plasma crp levels but negatively correlated with the lymphocyte counts of patients at the time of admission indicating an association between degree of humoral response and cellular immune response however those with mild disease who do not develop high levels of antibodies may be at increased risk of re-infection but are not likely to get significant symptoms although the may be contagious therefore those without antibody production should likely be treated as if they never had the disease from a social distancing perspective even if they were proven to be positive with molecular testinglongitudinal serological studies are urgently needed to determine the extent and duration of immunity to sars-cov-2 it will undoubtedly take time for this data to become available despite the hyperbolic media coverage regarding antibody testing initially positive and then a week later somewhat negative physicians must continue to do what we have always done we must accept that data especially early data is rarely complete or perfect and we must utilize the existing body of knowledge to make evidence-based decisions we believe that there exists a real value in antibody testing when performed properly with quality devices and a good understanding of how to interpret the clinical meaning of the results such testing can help educate decisions regarding social distancing and the use of personal protective equipment and can help risk stratify essential work force members as physicians we know that there is no perfect test and it behooves us all to make certain that we utilize as many data points as possible while trying to safely recover from both this pandemic and the possible secondary spikes in covid-19 incidence that may appear prior to widespread vaccinationnone of the authors have any conflicts to reportproteinprotein interactions ppis are involved in the vast majority of biological processes fletcher and hamilton 2006 fry 2006 ryan and matthews 2005 toogood 2002 zinzalla and thurston 2009 nearly every important pathway in health and disease includes and is critically influenced by ppis fry 2006 in this context the specific and controlled modulation inhibition of ppis provides a promising avenue for rational drug design as revealed by recent progress in the design of inhibitory antibodies peptides and small molecules berg 2008 che et al 2006 fry 2006 pagliaro et al 2004 robinson 2009 sillerud and larson 2005 veselovsky and archakov 2007cell surface receptors are integral membrane proteins that translate extracellular information into intracellular signaling sequences and further into physiological cell response in the complex fundamental process called transmembrane signal transduction this process plays a crucial role in health and disease kadmiel and cidlowski 2013 rudd 2006 sabroe et al 2003 sigalov 2008a sigalov 2010g which makes therapeutic control of ppis involved in this process of both fundamental and clinical importance however until recently the lack of a mechanistic understanding of what ppis are actually taking place during transmembrane signal transduction has significantly impeded progress not only in fundamental studies in biology and life sciences but also in molecular target-driven drug discovery the result of this lack of understanding is that the most widely used therapeutic strategies of receptor modulation attempt to prevent binding of receptors to their cognate ligands using clinically relevant antibodies hansel kropshofer singer mitchell  george 2010 or soluble receptor domains bouchon et al 2001 molloy et al 2005 however these large protein entities possess severe disadvantages including a long and costly development process low activity per mass manufacturing difficulties unintended immune response side effects low organ and tissue penetration and a lack of oral bioavailability hansel et al 2010as integral membrane proteins cell surface receptors consist of three domains 1 extracellular ligand-binding domains that function to detect and bind external stimuli 2 transmembrane domains that function as anchors to the cell membrane and mediators of signal transduction and 3 cytoplasmic signaling domains that initiate an intracellular signal transduction cascades depending on whether extracellular and intracellular domains are located on the same or separate protein chains unrelated and functionally diverse cell receptors can be divided into two main structural families single-chain and multichain receptors srs and mrs respectively fig 1
 keegan and paul 1992 sigalov 2004 sigalov 2010c mrs most commonly represent immune receptors and are often referred to as multichain immune recognition receptors mirrs keegan and paul 1992 sigalov 2004 the signature feature of mirrs is the presence of one or more copies of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif itam regions reth 1989 or the yxxm motif wu cherwinski spies phillips  lanier 2000 in their cytoplasmic signaling domains upon receptor triggering tyrosine residues of the itamyxxm regions are phosphorylated in an early and obligatory event in the signaling cascadea general platform for receptor-mediated transmembrane signal transduction the signaling chain homooligomerization school platform sigalov 2004 sigalov 2006 sigalov 2008a sigalov 2008b sigalov 2008c sigalov 2010b sigalov 2010c uncovers for the first time the major mechanisms coupling recognition and signaling functions based on the unusual biophysical phenomenonthe ability of the intrinsically disordered cytoplasmic domains of mirr signaling subunits to form specific homodimers and higher homooligomers sigalov et al 2004 sigalov et al 2007 this platform was originally suggested for mirrs sigalov 2004 and thenas a general platform for transmembrane signaling mediated by mirrs and srs sigalov 2008a sigalov 2010c conceptually the school platform suggests that the similar architecture of the receptors dictates similar mechanisms of receptor triggering mechanistically according to the platform multivalent ligand binding outside the cell induces or tunes receptor oligomerization clustering which is then translated across the membrane into formation of competent signaling homooligomers in the cytoplasmic milieua force that drives transmembrane signaling and is necessary and sufficient to trigger receptor activation fig 1 this provides the similarity of the targets revealed at the level of specific ppisbiochemical processes that can be influenced and controlled for therapeutic purposes sigalov 2004 sigalov 2008a sigalov 2010b sigalov 2010caccording to the school platform sigalov 2004 sigalov 2010c upon binding to multivalent ligand intramembrane ppis between srs mediate dimerization oligomerization of srs to bring the receptors into close proximity and the correct interreceptor geometry to promote cytoplasmic homotypic ppis and thus triggers the receptor fig 1a interestingly rtks and some other srs such as members of the tumor necrosis factor tnf receptor superfamily chan 2007 chan et al 2000 can exist as preassembled dimers oligomers on the surface of resting cells in this scenario the platform suggests that binding to multivalent ligand leads to reorientation of receptors in these dimers oligomers to adopt the geometry competent to promote dimerization oligomerization of cytoplasmic signaling domains that trigger the receptor fig 1a indeed in rtk-mediated signaling multivalent ligand binding results in a conformational change in the receptor extracellular domain leading to the rotation of the whole receptor jiang and hunter 1999 moriki et al 2001 triggering of the neu rtk occurs only for a specific transmembrane dimer interface the rotation of which leads to periodic oscillations in kinase activity bell et al 2000 further confirming the necessity of the correct interreceptor orientation in the receptor dimers oligomers formed upon binding to multivalent ligand in addition the rotation of the rtk domain with respect to its transmembrane domain by inserting residues into the c-terminal transmembrane flanking region restores the rtk activity furthermore upon binding of the epidermal growth factor receptor egfr to its cognate ligand the egfr extracellular domain rotates and this rotation is transmitted to the receptor transmembrane domain moriki et al 2001 interreceptor orientation in receptor dimers plays a critical role in erythropoietin receptor-mediated transmembrane signaling livnah et al 1998 syed et al 1998 suggesting a tight coupling of the extracellular domain orientation to the cytoplasmic signaling events furthermore signal transduction via interleukin il-6 requires not only gp130 homodimerization but also the correct relative orientation of the gp130 cytoplasmic domains in a ligand-specific receptor dimer suggesting that subtle changes in the orientation of the receptor chains relative to each other might result in very different responses greiser stross heinrich behrmann  hermanns 2002 dimerization of the cytokine receptors by monoclonal antibodies is in most cases not enough to induce signal transduction autissier et al 1998 formation of homooligomers of fas cytoplasmic tails plays an important role in receptor triggering siegel et al 2004 similarly cytoplasmic domain-mediated dimerization of toll-like receptor-4 tlr-4 is necessary for tlr-4 triggering and to activate signaling cascades lee dunzendorfer  tobias 2004thus these and other studies of srs strongly support the general school platform concept and demonstrate that ligand-induced receptor dimerization is translated into protein dimerization in the cell membrane milieu and that the receptor dimer intramembrane interface contains the critical structural information that positions the receptor cytoplasmic signaling domains in a way competent for oligomerization and receptor triggering fig 1atransmembrane signaling mediated by mirrs can be roughly divided into four stages 1 recognition and binding of the receptor to its multivalent cognate ligand outside the cell 2 transmembrane transduction of this information to the cytoplasmic milieu 3 phosphorylation of the itam or yxxm tyrosine residues by protein tyrosine kinases followed by activation of specific intracellular signaling cascades and 4 activation of genes in the nucleus while the molecular mechanisms underlying the stages 1 3 and 4 are understood in significant detail the mechanisms by which the mirrs transduce recognition discrimination information via receptor transmembrane and juxtamembrane regions into intracellular biochemical events stage 2 have been a long-standing mystery it was also not clear how this putative mechanism could explain the intriguing ability of immune cells to discern and differentially respond to slightly different ligands in the immune defense ultimately the specific ppis involved in this process have remained largely unknown preventing the development of novel therapeutic approachesby uncovering a crucial physiological role of homotypic interactions between intrinsically disordered cytoplasmic domains of mirr signaling subunits sigalov 2011c sigalov et al 2004 sigalov et al 2007 the biophysically unique phenomenon that still remains a matter of debate whether it exists or not nourse  mittag 2014 sigalov 2016 uversky  dunker 2013 the school model suggests that formation of competent mirr signaling subunit oligomers is necessary and sufficient to trigger the receptor and induce downstream signaling cascades fig 1b sigalov 2004 sigalov 2005 sigalov 2006 sigalov 2008c sigalov 2010b this is consistent with the structural hypothesis of cross-phosphorylation ortega 1995 pribluda et al 1994 that assumes that the kinases responsible for catalyzing itam tyr residue phosphorylation exist associated with the receptors and that for steric reasons these kinases cannot phosphorylate tyrosine residues on itam-containing signaling chains of the same receptor complex in contrast in mirr dimers oligomers formed upon binding to their multivalent cognate ligands the kinases phosphorylate the tyrosines of a distinct receptor complex cross-phosphorylation or transphosphorylation thus triggering the receptor ortega 1995in unstimulated resting cells intramembrane ppis between transmembrane helices of recognition and signaling mirr subunits maintain receptor integrity and determine the relative positions of these subunits in the receptor complex angles distances etc thus dictating the overall geometry and topology of mirrs biassoni et al 2000 call et al 2002 daeron 1997 defranco et al 1994 kim et al 2003 klesney-tait et al 2006 moroi and jung 2004 sigalov 2004 sigalov 2005 sigalov 2008c the school platform suggests that mirr engagement by multivalent ligand or anti-mirr antibodies eg antibodies against cd3 and t cell receptor  tcr chains of tcr or anti-ig antibodies for b cell receptor leads to receptor dimerization oligomerization coupled with a multistep structural reorganization aiming to promote homotypic ppis between mirr signaling subunits in the cytoplasmic milieu that trigger the receptor and initiate downstream signaling cascades fig 1b according to the school model sufficiently close interreceptor proximity and correct relative orientation in mirr dimers oligomers as well as long enough duration of the mirrligand interaction and sufficient lifetime of an individual receptor in these mirr clusters all play important roles for productive mirr triggering as strongly supported by a growing body of evidence carreno et al 2006 holler et al 2001 holowka et al 2007 kiessling et al 2006 klemm et al 1998 metzger 2004 miura et al 2002 ortega et al 1988 posner et al 2002 puffer et al 2007 radaev and sun 2003 reth and wienands 1997 schweitzer-stenner et al 1997 tamir and cambier 1998 yamasaki et al 2004some mirrs such as tcr and major platelet collagen receptor glycoprotein vi gpvi can exist as preassembled oligomers on the surface of resting cells berlanga et al 2007 jung et al 2009 schamel et al 2005 in this scenario similarly to that of srs the school model suggests reorientation of mirrs in these dimers oligomers to adopt the geometry competent to promote homotypic ppis between cytoplasmic signaling domains that trigger the receptorin the immune defense the school mechanisms suggest that the diversity of the immune cell response is largely provided by the combinatorial nature of mirr-mediated signaling more specifically signal diversification may be achieved through different patterns of mirr signaling subunit oligomerization sigalov 2004 sigalov 2005 sigalov 2006 in combination with distinct activation signals provided by different mirr signaling modules jensen et al 1997 pike et al 2004 pitcher and van oers 2003 sanchez-mejorada and rosales 1998 andor different itams located on the same signaling module eg tcr chain chae et al 2004 thus according to the model the diversity of cell functional outcomes in response to stimulation by different ligands is increasing with the number of different signaling subunits that the mirr complex hasstructural consideration of transmembrane signaling mediated by a variety of functionally unrelated receptors expressed on various cells leads us to the important observation that recognition and signaling functions can be combined on one protein chain srs or separated between different protein chains mirrs fig 1 another observation is that while extracellular ligand recognition transmembrane and cytoplasmic signaling domains of srs are all well structured sigalov 2010c sigalov 2011a sigalov 2012b cytoplasmic domains of mirr signaling subunits are all intrinsically disordered ie these domains lack a well-defined ordered structure under physiological conditions in vitro in contrast to the well-structured mirr extracellular ligand recognition and transmembrane domains sigalov 2011a sigalov 2011c sigalov 2012b sigalov et al 2004 sigalov et al 2007 sigalov et al 2006 ultimately these observations raise two intriguing questions sigalov 2011a sigalov 2012a first why did nature separate recognition and signaling functions for mirrs thereby increasing the risk of malfunction and potential attack by pathogens and second why did nature select protein disorder for mirrs to translate recognition of distinct ligands into appropriate activation signals that would induce distinct specific functional outcomes fig 2
 answering the first question one can suggest that the modular assembly of mirrs brings multiple benefits the most important of which is the capability to diversify and vary signal transduction sigalov 2010c sigalov 2010d sigalov 2011b sigalov 2012a ultimately this provides the mechanistic basis for the diversity and variability of the immune response according to charles darwin diversity and variability are at the very core of evolutionary processes darwin 1861 one can conclude that nature takes the risks associated with separation of functions in mirrs in exchange for high potential for evolution of signal transduction fig 2 fig 3
 in the context of immune signaling this is of great importance in the development and evolution of the immune defense protein disorder contributes to the diversity and variability of signal transduction without compromising efficiency and specificity of signaling sigalov 2010c sigalov 2010d sigalov 2011b sigalov 2012a sigalov 2012b thus evolutionary and developmental benefits of immune signaling-related protein disorder outweigh attendant disadvantages which are largely compensated for by increasing the host defensethere exist two types of immune receptors the innate receptors the germ line-encoded receptors that detect a limited set of conserved antigens and the adaptive receptors the somatically generated antigen receptors of the t and b cells tcr and bcr respectively table 1
 from the evolutionary standpoint the adaptive immune response evolved long after the innate mechanisms of self-defense and provided significant added value in promoting survival cooper and alder 2006 kimbrell and beutler 2001 litman and cooper 2007 structurally the adaptive receptors belong to the mirr family with two bcr and four tcr signaling chains fig 3 in contrast the innate receptors belong to the sr family eg tlrs or represent mirrs that contain only one signaling chain eg triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells trems or natural killer cell receptors nk receptors fig 3 importantly functions of the itam modules including those located on different jensen et al 1997 pike et al 2004 pitcher and van oers 2003 sanchez-mejorada and rosales 1998 sigalov 2004 sigalov 2006 sigalov 2010c sigalov 2011a sigalov 2012b or the same eg three different itams on the  chain chae et al 2004 signaling chains and those located on the same chain are rather distinct instead of redundant this provides a molecular explanation for significantly higher diversity and variability of the adaptive response as compared to the innate response interestingly following this logic one can conclude that the extent of diversity and variability of nkp30-mediated signaling should be an intermediate between the innate eg tlrs and adaptive receptors fig 3 this is indeed consistent with the idea that nk cells represent an evolutionary bridge between innate and adaptive immunity sun  lanier 2009as biochemical processes that can be influenced and controlled archakov et al 2003 arkin and wells 2004 berg 2003 fletcher and hamilton 2007 pagliaro et al 2004 intramembrane ppis between mirr recognition and signaling subunits as well as homotypic interactions between cytoplasmic domains of mirr signaling subunits represent potential points of attack by pathogens in order to modulate the mirr-mediated signaling and thus to modulate the immune response sigalov 2009 sigalov 2010f sigalov 2012aexamples are viruses that in the billion-years-long struggle for their existence in order to establish a successful infection replicate and persist in the host have evolved numerous strategies to counter and evade host antiviral immune responses as well as to exploit them for productive viral replication several different viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus hiv cytomegalovirus cmv severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and human herpesvirus 6 that are pathogenic for humans uniformly target members of the mirr family including innate and adaptive receptors intriguingly these viruses use either a modular assembly of mirrs to disrupt receptor-mediated signaling or cytoplasmic protein disorder of mirrs to surprisingly augment cell activation as required for self-preservation cohen et al 2010 shen and sigalov 2016 sigalov 2007a sigalov 2008a sigalov 2009 sigalov 2010f sigalov 2012a the example of the coevolution of viruses and their hosts confirms that there is no evolution and development without risks although we cannot avoid these risks we can turn this lemon into lemonade and learn from nature how to efficiently target the immune system for therapeutic purposes kim and sigalov 2008 shen and sigalov 2016 sigalov 2010a sigalov 2010f this will be further illustrated in the next section on the example of intramembrane

design a novel ligand-independent trem-1 inhibitory peptide sequence gf9 and demonstrated that the gf9 peptide specifically blocks trem-1-mediated transmembrane signaling in vitro and in vivo utilizing two human nsclc xenograft nude mouse models h292 and a549 we demonstrated for the first time that blockade of trem-1 function using gf9 substantially decreases cytokine production in vitro

characterized by a marked infiltration of macrophages into the stromal compartment shih et al 2006 solinas et al 2009 in patients with pc macrophage infiltration begins during the preinvasive stage of

predictor of poor survival in pc patients groblewska et al 2007 interestingly m-csf blockade not only suppresses tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis kubota et al 2009 but also upregulates t cell checkpoint molecules including programmed cell death protein 1 pd-1 and cytotoxic t lymphocyte antigen-4 ctla-4 thereby overcoming limitations of pd-1 and ctla-4 antagonists to achieve regression in even well-established tumors zhu et al 2014 importantly continuous m-csf inhibition affects only pathological angiogenesis but not healthy vascular and lymphatic systems outside tumors kubota et al 2009 in contrast to blockade of vascular endothelial growth factor vegf interruption of m-csf inhibition does not promote rapid vascular regrowth kubota et al 2009 trem-1 activation is known to enhance release of most cytokines that are increased in patients with pc tjomsland et al 2011 yako et al 2016 and play a vital role in creating and sustaining inflammation in the tumor favorable microenvironment thus affecting patient survival these include monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mcp-1 tnf il-1 il-1 il-6 and m-csf lagler et al 2009 schenk et al 2007 sigalov 2014 collectively these findings suggest that a therapy that targets trem-1-mediated intratumoral inflammation angiogenesis and vascularization can represent a promising strategy for treating pcrecently we tested the

these school peptides resulted in a strong antitumor effect achieving an optimal-treatedcontrol tc value of 19 depending on the xenograft and formulation used and persisting even after treatment was halted the effect correlated significantly with increased survival reduced angiogenesis and suppressed tam infiltration the peptides were well tolerated when deployed in either free form or formulated into hdl-mimicking macrophage-targeted lipopeptide complexes further blockade of trem-1 significantly reduced serum levels of il-1 il-6 and m-csf but not vegf suggesting an m-csf-dependent inhibitory effect on angiogenesistaken together with our previous study sigalov 2014 these data suggest that school trem-1-specific peptide inhibitors have a cancer type independent therapeutically beneficial antitumor activity and can be potentially used as a stand-alone therapy or as a component of combinational therapy for pc nsclc and other solid tumorsstructurally tcr is a member of the mirr family and has  and  antigen-binding subunits tcr and tcr respectively that are bound by electrostatic intramembrane ppis with three signaling homo- and heterodimers  cd3 and cd3 fig 3 short synthetic peptides capable of inhibiting tcr-mediated cell activation in a ligand-independent manner are known since 1997 manolios et al 1997 when tcr-targeted inhibitory activity was first reported for a synthetic peptide corresponding to the sequence of the tcr transmembrane domain the so-called core peptide cp in the tcr complex this domain is known to interact with the transmembrane domains of cd3 and  call et al 2002 manolios et al 1990 later the tcr cp has been shown to reduce inflammation and inhibits the progression of experimental arthritis amon et al 2006 kurosaka et al 2007a in patients with ad psoriasis or lichen planus a daily topical application of this peptide over three consecutive days has been demonstrated to inhibit inflammation and ameliorate the disease equally as well as betamethasone enk and knop 2000 gollner et al 2000interestingly similar ligand-independent tcr inhibitory activity was later reported for hiv fusion peptide fp found in the n terminus of the hiv envelope glycoprotein 41 gp41 bloch et al 2007 quintana et al 2005 the patterns of inhibition of tcr-mediated cell activation exhibited by tcr cp and hiv gp41 fp were intriguingly similar both peptides inhibit antigenbut not anti-cd3-stimulated t cell activation quintana et al 2005 wang et al 2002b similar to tcr cp hiv gp41 fp was shown to reduce inflammation and ameliorate t cell-mediated autoimmune arthritis in animal models quintana et al 2005however despite extensive studies ali et al 2006 amon et al 2006 bloch et al 2007 collier et al 2006 kurosaka et al 2007b manolios et al 1997 quintana et al 2005 wang et al 2002a the mode of action of these clinically relevant peptides was enigmatic until the school model was first introduced and applied to this field sigalov 2004 sigalov 2006 sigalov 2007a according to the model sigalov 2004 sigalov 2005 sigalov 2006 sigalov 2010c sigalov 2010e tcr cp and hiv gp41 both compete with the tcr chain for binding to cd3 and  and disrupt the corresponding intramembrane ppis this results in disconnectionpredissociation of the affected signaling subunits from the remaining receptor complex and upon stimulation by multivalent antigen leads to inhibition of antigenbut not antibody-mediated tcr triggering and cell activation importantly tcr assembly and cell surface expression are not affected by treatment with tcr cp kurosaka bolte et al 2007 this finding as well as colocalization of tcr cp with tcr in the membrane of resting cells wang djordjevic bender et al 2002 directly prove the hypothesis about pre- rather than full dissociation state of the unstimulated tcr complex in the presence of tcr cp whereas upon stimulation the affected signaling subunits  and cd3 become physically disconnected from the remaining receptor complex it should be noted that the proposed school mechanism is the only mechanism consistent with all experimental and clinical data reported up to date for transmembrane peptides of tcr and other mirrs as well as for lipid andor sugar conjugates of these peptides ali et al 2005 ali et al 2002 amon et al 2006 amon et al 2008 bender et al 2004 collier et al 2006 enk and knop 2000 gerber et al 2005

sequence analysis of proven and predicted immunomodulatory sequences of viral fusion protein regions allowed not only to suggest the specific molecular mechanisms of inhibition of tcr-mediated cell activation by tcr cp and hiv gp41 fp sigalov 2007a sigalov 2008b sigalov 2009 but also to predict similar immunomodulatory activity for other viral fps such as sars-cov fp sigalov 2009 our recent study shen  sigalov 2016 provided compelling experimental in vivo evidence in support of this hypothesis as demonstrated a synthetic 11 amino acid-long peptide-derived from sars cov fp predicted using the school model to disrupt intramembrane ppis in the tcr complex was able to reduce inflammation in dba1j mice with cia and protect mice against bone and cartilage damage shen  sigalov 2016 formulation of the peptide into self-assembling macrophage-targeted lipopeptide nanoparticles that mimic native human hdls significantly increased peptide dosage efficacy shen  sigalov 2016 collectively these findings further confirm that viral immune evasion strategies evolved during the hostvirus coevolution can be transferred to therapeutic strategies that require similar functionalities eg in the treatment of autoimmune diseasestrem-1 expressed on macrophages is a promising target for the development of new rational therapies for autoimmune diseases including ra kuai et al 2009 in addition targeted delivery of antirheumatic drugs to macrophages is another highly desirable strategy for the treatment of ra because it would not only strike the cells that mediate or amplify most of the permanent tissue destruction but also spare other cells that do not affect joint damage garrood and pitzalis 2006 kinne et al 2007recently we demonstrated that a trem-1-specific inhibitory nonapeptide gf9 designed using the school model and capable of inhibiting trem-1-mediated macrophage activation in a ligand-independent manner suppresses release of proinflammatory cytokines and m-csf decreases inflammation and protects against bone and cartilage destruction in experimental arthritis shen  sigalov 2017 administration of gf9 reduced the plasma levels of m-csf tnf il-1 and il-6 shen  sigalov 2017 interestingly 31-mer peptides with sequences from gf9 and helices 4 ge31 and 6 ga31 of the major hdl protein apolipoprotein ai were able to perform three functions assist in the self-assembly of gae31-hdl target these particles to macrophages and block trem-1 signaling shen  sigalov 2017 similar to our cancer studies sigalov 2014 formulation of gf9 alone or as a part of ge31 and ga31 peptides into hdl significantly increased its therapeutic efficacy colocalization of gf9 with trem-1 in the macrophage membrane observed using confocal microscopy indicates that gf9 self-inserts into the cell membrane and disrupts intramembrane ppis between trem-1 and its signaling partner dap-12 further confirming the school mechanisms of action of this peptide shen  sigalov 2017 collectively these findings suggest that trem-1 inhibitory school sequences may be promising alternatives for the treatment of ra and possibly other trem-1-mediated autoimmune diseasesseptic

bassaris  skoutelis 2000 importantly in patients with sepsis trem-1 expression on macrophages is markedly increased gibot 2005 van bremen et al 2013 initial findings established trem-1 as an amplifier of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome associated with sepsis bouchon et al 2000 bouchon et al 2001 blockade of trem-1 in septic mice lowers expression levels of tnf- and il-6 and increases survival from 5 to 10 in control animals to 7080 in treated animals bouchon et al 2001 gibot et al 2007 wang et al 2012 taken together this suggests trem-1-mediated macrophage activation as a promising therapeutic target for this syndromehowever as discussed earlier the development of conventional inhibitors of trem-1 that attempt to block binding of trem-1 to its ligand bouchon et al 2001 gibot et al 2007 wang et al 2012 is significantly complicated by the unknown nature of trem-1 ligands and hence the increased risk of failure of these approaches in clinical development in this context trem-1-specific inhibitory school peptide sequences that employ ligand-independent mechanism of receptor inhibition represent a promising alternative to conventional approaches ligand-independent blockade of the trem-1 signaling pathway in mice with experimental lipopolysaccharide lps-induced septic shock using trem-1 inhibitory school peptide gf9 was shown to substantially suppress proinflammatory cytokine production and prolong survival of septic mice sigalov 2014 targeted delivery of gf9 to macrophages using self-assembling lipopeptide complexes significantly increased peptide half-life and therapeutic efficacy sigalov 2014 these data strongly support the hypothesis that ligand-independent modulation of trem-1 function using small synthetic peptides might

promising data suggest that targeting intramembrane ppis in the trem-1dap-12 receptor complex using trem-1-specific school peptide inhibitors represent a novel strategy to treat rnv diseases including ropthere is a growing interest in therapeutic targeting specific ppis involved in receptor-mediated transmembrane signal transduction and our improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this process can significantly contribute into the development of novel pharmacological approaches to a variety of diseasesexample is the school platform that by uncovering the molecular mechanisms of transmembrane signaling mediated by unrelated and functionally diversed surface receptors expressed on various cells revealed the specific ppis involved in receptor triggering as key points of therapeutic control importantly the school platform suggests that within the sr and mirr families the similar structural architecture of the receptors dictates similar mechanisms of receptor triggering this in turn suggests similarity of therapeutic targets in seemingly unrelated diseases which makes possible the development of global pharmacological approaches as well as the transfer of our clinical knowledge experience and therapeutic strategies between these diseases successful application of the school strategy to target in vivo intramembrane ppis involved in triggering of such unrelated receptors as tcr trem-1 and gpvi expressed on t cells macrophages and platelets respectively provided compelling evidence to support this hypothesis and resulted in the discovery of new drug candidates for a variety of diseases including cancer sepsis ra ad and retinopathyfurther the school platform significantly improved our understanding of the immunomodulatory activity of many human viruses it appears that different viruses use their fusogenic peptides not only to fuse their membranes to their target host cells but also to disarm the immune system using the school mechanisms of receptor inhibition and to escape the host immune response this gives an interesting example of how our advances in mechanistic understanding of the fundamental natural processes and their interactions can elucidate the billions years old strategies nature uses for combinatorial control and optimization at different scales from evolution to organismal functionthe evolutionary emergence of lymphocytes with diversified antigen receptors allows the immune system to recognize and respond to a myriad of unknown antigens however despite the enormous number of b cells and t cells in the naive compartment the frequency of b cells or t cells with any particular specificity is miniscule necessitating efficient mechanisms to acquire and present antigens to the responding lymphocytes 1 moreover b and t cells of the same specificity must find one another and interact in a cognate way in order to differentiate into effector cells 2 in order to accomplish these goals the immune system has evolved a system of secondary lymphoid organs 3secondary lymphoid organs such as spleen lymph nodes peyers patches and other mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues recruit naive b and t cells from the blood and sample antigens from local non-lymphoid organs and mucosal surfaces thereby allowing naive lymphocytes to efficiently peruse antigens from all the tissues of an entire organism without having to migrate through those tissues themselves 4 moreover secondary lymphoid organs are highly organized and contain architectural domains that facilitate sequential cellular interactions between antigen-presenting cells and lymphocytes and efficiently promote b and t cell activation selection and differentiation 1  ultimately increasing the efficiency of the immune responsemammals birds and bony fish have easily recognizable secondary lymphoid organs and tissues with some of the characteristics of secondary lymphoid organs are observed in the gut lamina propria of cartilaginous fish such as sharks 5 in fact the appearance of cell clusters containing two types of adaptive immune cells can be traced back to pharynx of the lamprey 6 a jawless vertebrate and one of the oldest organisms to have an adaptive immune system 7 thus most vertebrates have evolved some type of tissue that is specialized to promote interactions between various cells of the adaptive immune system other authors have recently reviewed the evolutionary aspects of lymphoid organs 5 therefore in this review we will focus only on the developmental and functional aspects of lymphoid tissues in the lungmost secondary lymphoid organs in mice and humans develop embryonically in the absence of microbial stimulation or foreign antigens 8 however the structure and function of some secondary lymphoid organs particularly those at mucosal surfaces is dramatically altered upon exposure to environmental antigens and commensal organisms 9 for example peyers patches in the small intestine dramatically increase in size and complexity following commensal colonization 10 11 similarly nasal-associated lymphoid tissue in rodents does not completely develop until after birth and this process is accelerated by microbial exposure 12 strikingly the appendix of rabbits is both a primary and secondary lymphoid tissue that is functionally dependent on microbial colonization 13 more importantly however some lymphoid tissues known as tertiary lymphoid tissues develop only after environmental exposure to microbes pathogens or inflammatory stimuli tertiary lymphoid tissues form in a wide variety of organs including pancreas 14 thyroid 15 thymus 16 salivary gland 17 18 brain 19 liver 20 kidney 21 and others 22 but in this review we will focus on tertiary lymphoid tissue that forms in the lung known as inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue or ibaltalthough the lungs of mice and humans normally lack organized lymphoid tissue areas of ibalt form in the lungs following some types of infection or inflammation 23 24 table 1 ibalt is a classic example of a tertiary lymphoid tissue since it does not develop in a pre-programed way and its occurrence size and number in the lung depends on the type and duration of antigenic exposure 25 26 areas of ibalt are observed in the lungs of mammals 2731 and birds 3234 and are likely found in all air-breathing vertebrates however ibalt is most well characterized in the lungs of rodents and humans here we will summarize below the results of studies from these speciesas the name indicates ibalt does not occur at random sites in the lungs but develops in close proximity to the basal side of the bronchial epithelium 35 often in the perivascular space of pulmonary blood vessels 36 37 the leukocytes comprising ibalt are arranged in two zones the b cell follicle and the t cell zone 37 in a way that resembles the organization of conventional secondary lymphoid organs the b cell follicles of ibalt contain tight clusters of igd follicular b cells grouped around a network of stromal cells known as follicular dendritic cells fdcs that express cd21 cxcl13 and lymphotoxin lt  receptor ltr 3841 figure 1b b cell follicles in reactive ibalt areas may contain large germinal centers 23 in which b cells are rapidly dividing in response to antigen these germinal centers will also contain activated cd4 t cells known as t follicular helper tfh cells 42 43 figure 1a the t cell zone of ibalt surrounds the b cell follicles and contains cd4 and cd8 t cells as well as conventional dendritic cells dcs 24 44 figure 1athe compartmentalization of b and t cell areas in ibalt requires specialized fibroblastic cells usually referred to as stromal cells stromal cells in the b cell follicle are primarily fdcs which express cxcl13 a chemokine that attracts cxcl13-expressing cells like b cells and tfh cells 42 45 46 stromal cells are also observed in the t cell zones of ibalt and are likely similar to the fibroblastic reticular cells frcs found in the t zones of conventional secondary lymphoid organs 47 48 these cells express chemokines like ccl19 and ccl21 4951 which attract naive t cells and activated dcs 45 52 53 t zone stromal cells also produce il-7 54 55 a cytokine important for the survival of naive lymphocytesin addition to the stromal cells that support the b and t cell areas ibalt often features high endothelial venules hevs 56 which are specialized blood vessels that express homing and adhesion molecules as well as chemokines that together recruit lymphocytes from the blood 57 hevs in ibalt are located just outside the b cell follicle in the t cell zone 56 although one might assume that ibalt is a mucosal lymphoid tissue based on its location in the lung the hevs of ibalt express peripheral lymph node addressin pnad like the hevs of peripheral lymph nodes 56 but do not express mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule madcam which is prominently expressed by mesenteric lymph nodes and peyers patches in the intestine 58 hevs in ibalt also express or display ccl21 56 which is likely important for the recruitment of naive lymphocytes from the bloodgiven that ibalt is located underneath the bronchial epithelium one might assume that it acquires antigens directly from the lumen of the airways via epithelial m cells although antigen-transporting m cells have been reported in the ibalt of some species 35 59 60 they are not consistently observed and many areas of ibalt do not have the classic structure of a mucosal lymphoid tissue with a dome epithelium overlaying the b cell follicle 61 it is not clear at this time whether this inconsistency in the structure of ibalt is due to differences in species the way in which ibalt is formed or the durationmagnitude of antigen exposure 62despite the lack of obvious m cells in many ibalt areas there are also lymphatic vessels that surround the b cell follicle and likely facilitate the uptake of antigens in the normal lung lymphatics originate from two distinct locations one set of lymphatics originate from the parenchyma and follows the pulmonary veins toward the draining lymph node and the other set originates around the connective tissue between the airways and veins and follows the airways toward the draining lymph node 63 new data show that additional lymphatic vessels are generated during lung inflammation surrounding the ibalt areas apparently by sprouting from the existing lymphatic network 64 given the placement of ibalt in the perivascular space next to large airways we expect that afferent lymphatics drain from the distal portions of the lung toward ibalt the best evidence for this model is the ability of ibalt to collect labeled dcs and particulates 23 64 65lymph nodes have both afferent and efferent lymphatics whereas most mucosal lymphoid tissues have only efferent lymphatics that connect to downstream lymph nodes and ultimately to the blood we assume that many of the lymphatics associated with ibalt are efferent lymphatics that allow cells within ibalt to re-enter the circulation in fact we expect that ibalt follows the conventional model of lymphoid recirculation in which naive b and t cells enter ibalt from the blood through pnad-expressing hevs and then exit ibalt via efferent lymphatic vessels 66 efferent lymphatic vessels would also allow activated effector and memory lymphocytes to exit ibalt and re-enter the circulation although the ability of efferent lymphatics to collect cells primed in ibalt and drain them to the downstream mediastinal lymph node has not been directly demonstrated recent data show that the presence of ibalt promotes more rapid responses in the draining ln 67 suggesting that ibalt is connected to downstream lymph nodes and can alter the trafficking of antigen-bearing dcs and primed lymphocytes importantly new data show that lymphatic endothelial cells in ibalt areas are more than just highways for leukocyte trafficking in addition to producing the chemoattractant ccl21 lymphatic endothelial cells also produce il-7 and contribute to the maintenance of memory t cells 68 thus the lymphatic vessels surrounding ibalt likely have multiple functionssecondary lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes and peyers patches form independently of antigenic or inflammatory stimuli in a highly ordered process that occurs during embryogenesis at very specific times 8 and reviewed in ref 69 once that developmental window is passed lymph nodes are no longer able to develop even if all the necessary cells and molecules are present 8 in contrast the development of ibalt requires an inflammatory or infectious stimulus in most species 25 26 7073 including rats 7477 mice 78 goats 79 chicken 33 and humans 29 73 80 and its development can be initiated throughout life in contrast pigs are reported to form ibalt in the lungs during fetal development 81 however it is unclear whether this observation reflects a species or developmental differencealthough the formation of ibalt is not restricted to a developmental window during embryogenesis it seems to form more easily in the neonatal period just after birth 78 82 for example ibalt is found in the lungs of healthy adult humans at a relatively low frequency 83 but is found with increasing frequencies in the lungs of children and infants 29 73 83 the incidence of ibalt increases dramatically in all age groups following infection 70 72 73 but is highest in the lungs of infected children and infants and most strikingly is a prominent feature in 100 of late-term fetuses miscarried as a result of amnionitis 29 which results from an in utero pulmonary infectionin part the increased frequency of ibalt in the lungs of neonates and infants might reflect the initial exposure of a naive individual to stimuli such as pulmonary pathogens microbial products and allergens 25 however the neonatal immune system also seems to favor the development of ibalt and other tertiary lymphoid tissues in mice living in controlled environments 78 82 84 for example the injection of cell suspensions from dissociated lymph nodes into the skin of neonatal mice leads to the formation of highly organized lymphoid tissues 84 whereas the injection of the same cells into adults does not 84 similarly the repeated intranasal administration of the microbial product lps to neonatal c57bl6 mice induces ibalt formation whereas repeated intranasal administration of lps to weanling or adult c57bl6 mice does not 78 82 in another example pulmonary infection of neonatal mice with cytomegalovirus cmv promotes the formation of nodular inflammatory foci nif whereas the pulmonary infection of adult mice with cmv does not 85 86 nifs are similar to ibalt in that they seem to support adaptive immune responses in the lung but nifs lack a b cell follicle and contain mostly a mix of cd8 t cells and dcs 85 at this point it is unclear whether balt and nif formation are products of two different types of immune responses or whether cmv diverts the immune response leading to nif formation as a byproduct and preventing balt formationinterestingly the preferential ability of neonates to form tertiary lymphoid tissues is less striking in balbc mice as the pulmonary administration of lps on a single day is sufficient to trigger ibalt formation in both neonatal and adult balbc mice 82 moreover other investigators have observed ibalt formation in adult mice following a variety of pulmonary challenges including infections 87 particulates 88 89 and allergens 90 thus the ability to trigger ibalt formation or nif formation at particular stages of development likely reflects the inflammatory environment at the time of challenge and the type and duration of the challengegiven that the structure of ibalt is similar to that of conventional secondary lymphoid organs it is not too surprising that the cytokines and chemokines as well as their receptors that are important for the development of secondary lymphoid organs are also important for the development of ibalt for example cxcl13 and its receptor cxcr5 are required for the formation and maintenance of b cell follicles in both secondary lymphoid organs 45 and in ibalt 56 similarly the ligands for ccr7 ccl19 and ccl21 are important for the organization of the t cell zone and for the recruitment of lymphocytes from the blood through hevs in both conventional lymphoid organs 45 and ibalt 56 moreover under steady state conditions the expression of cxcl13 ccl19 and ccl21 is controlled by lt signaling through its receptors ltr and tnfr1 in both lymph nodes 91 and ibalt 78 however during ibalt development the expression of cxcl13 and ccl19 is controlled by il-17 and possibly other inflammatory cytokines  independently of lt 78 although il-17 promotes the expression of cxcl13 ccl19 and other inflammatory chemokines during ibalt development once ibalt is formed and inflammation is resolved the expression of cxcl13 and ccl19 is maintained by lt signaling independently of il-17 78 thus lt and il-17 act at different times during ibalt development figure 2il-17 is also important for ibalt formation in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension 92 93 as might be expected the expression of lymphoid chemokines cxcl13 ccl19 and ccl21 in the ibalt areas of these patients correlated with the frequency of rort-expressing t cells presumably th17 cells 92 similarly the pulmonary administration of heat-killed pseudomonas aeruginosa hk-pa to mice promotes ibalt formation in an il-17-dependent fashion 94 interestingly in hk-pa-treated mice il-17 mediates the aggregation of b cells by cxcl12 rather than cxcl13 94 however il-17 is not always required for the formation of ibalt for example pulmonary infection of il-17-deficient mice with modified vaccinia virus ankara mva promotes the formation of a classic ibalt structure 94 despite the absence of il-17 lymphoid chemokines such as cxcl13 are still expressed possibly as a result of reduced treg activity 95 or complement-mediated neutrophil recruitment 96 as will be discussed later in this review thus there are multiple ways to recruit lymphocytes to the lung and organize them into ibalt-type structures nevertheless il-17 seems to be an important cytokine in the development of ectopic lymphoid tissues in multiple locations 19 97il-22 is also important for ibalt formation 18 98 although il-22 is most well known to act on epithelial cells in the lung and gut to trigger anti-microbial defenses and promote epithelial repair 99 the il-22 receptor is also expressed on stromal cells in the b cell follicle of ibalt 18 in addition the lps-induced development of ibalt is impaired in the absence of il-22 18 moreover the lymphoid domains of tuberculosis granulomas which resemble ibalt are also disrupted in the absence of il-22  the fdc network is smaller the b cell follicle is smaller and cxcl13 expression is reduced 98 100 il-22 is also important for the formation of other ectopic follicles as the overexpression of il-22 in the salivary gland strongly promotes the formation of ectopic follicles in that tissue 18 interestingly the il-22 receptor is also expressed by stromal cells and fdcs in other locations particularly following inflammation 101 however il-22 is not required for lymph node development or for the differentiation of stromal cells in lymph nodes 69 thus the requirement for il-22 also distinguishes the development of ibalt from the development of conventional lymphoid tissuesanother important difference in the development of lymph nodes and ibalt is the requirement for lymphoid tissue inducer lti cells lti cells are a subset of innate lymphoid cells ilcs that are dependent on the transcription factors rort and id2 and express cytokines like tnf lt il-22 and il-17 102 103 lti cells express cxcr5 and ccr7 and during embryogenesis home to developing lymph nodes 104 where they express lt and lt and through the actions of the ltr and tnfr1 promote the differentiation of local mesenchymal cells into mature fibroblastic stromal cells that form the scaffold of secondary lymphoid organs 38 105109 importantly lti cells are essential for the development of lymph nodes as mice lacking rort or id2 completely lack lymph nodes and peyers patches 102 110 111 given that lti cells express il-17 il-22 and lt one might expect that these cells would also be required for ibalt formation however mice lacking rort and id2 and therefore lacking lti cells generate fully formed ibalt structures in the lungs 78 thus lti cells are not required although they may be involved in the development of ibalt figure 2the differential requirement for lti cells in the development of ibalt and lymph nodes probably reflects the difference in when these tissues are formed conventional lymph nodes form during embryogenesis in the absence of antigen or inflammation in an environment that lacks mature b and t cells 8 in contrast ibalt forms after birth following exposure to antigenic and inflammatory stimuli that trigger the activation of mature lymphocytes given that the neonatal lung has mature t cells such as t cells and tfh cells that express tnf il-17 il-22 and lt 78 these cells may functionally replace lti cells for promoting ibalt development in postnatal micealthough il-17 promotes the expression of cxcl13 and cxcl12 which in turn recruit b cells and tfh cells this process may not entirely explain the role of il-17 in ibalt formation for example il-17 is most well known for promoting the expression of cxcl9 cxcl10 and cxcl11 112 113 as well as cytokines like g-csf that strongly attract inflammatory cells like neutrophils these chemokines and cytokines are also dramatically upregulated in an il-17-dependent manner following pulmonary lps exposure in neonates 78 in fact large numbers of neutrophils are recruited to the lungs of lps-exposed neonates and are required for ibalt formation 82 neutrophils are important for the production of april and il-21 which maintain b cell activation and survival and thereby help to promote ibalt formation 82 interestingly neonates are prone to granulocytosis 114 115 which may help to explain why the formation of ibalt occurs more easily in this age groupother studies also support the role of neurophils in the formatin of ibalt for example mice doubly deficient for the genes encoding the nqo1 and nqo2 proteins two neutrophil-expressed enzymes that limit ros generation spontaneously develop ibalt 116 nqo1nqo2mice have increased numbers of granulocytes in the peripheral blood and in the lungs have areas of ibalt with elevated numbers of neutrophils 116 however it is not clear from these studies whether the elevated production of reactive oxygen directly promotes ibalt or whether the elevated numbers of neutrophils in the lung perform some other function that promotes ibalt formationneutrophils may also play a role in the spontaneous formation of ibalt in serpine2-deficient se2 mice serpine2 is a protease inhibitor that inhibits proteases like thrombin trypsin urokinase plasminogen activator upa and plasmin but not elastase 117 118 these mice spontaneously develop ibalt in their lungs as early as 8 weeks after birth 119 the formation of ibalt in se2 mice is associated with the excessive expression of both inflammatory cxcl9 cxcl10 and cxcl11 and homeostatic cxcl12 cxcl19 and ccl19 chemokines as well as heightened thrombin activity 119 importantly the pulmonary administration of thrombin to the lungs of wt mice promotes an nfkb-dependent increase in chemokine expression from epithelial cells thrombin also activates protease-activated receptors pars on neutrophils and endothelial cells and promotes neutrophil chemotaxis 120 suggesting that neutrophils may play a role in this process given the role of proteases in copd a lung disease in which ibalt may contribute to pathology it is likely that protease-mediated processes will be an important contributing pathway in ibalt formationcd11c-expressing dcs are also important for the formation and the maintenance of ibalt for example mice depleted of cd11c-expressing cells rapidly lose existing areas of ibalt 94 121 and the depletion of cd11c-expressing cells following the pulmonary administration of lps to neonates prevents ibalt formation 78 conversely the pulmonary administration of bone marrow-derived dcs bmdcs promotes the formation of ibalt structures 121 cd11c-expressing dcs may promote ibalt formationmaintenance directly by providing lt 121 or indirectly by supporting the activation of t cells and b cells in addition depending on how they are activated dcs are potent sources of il-23 which acts on ilc3 cells 122 123 t cells 124 and even cd4 t cells 125 to promote their production of il-17 one caveat to the interpretation of these studies is that alveolar macrophages also express cd11c and will be deleted in cd11c-dtr mice moreover bmdcs are actually a mix of true dcs and macrophages 126 thus macrophages may play an important although poorly understood role in the development and maintenance of ibaltregulatory t cells tregs limit local immune responses and not surprisingly can restrain the formation of ibalt for example ccr7-deficient mice spontaneously form ibalt 127 in part because ccr7-deficient tregs are poorly recruited to the lymph node which prevents them from inhibiting effector t cell responses this process can be mimicked by the blockade of cd62l-dependent lymph node homing 127 however the interpretation of these studies is complicated does poor t cell homing to the lymph node lead to increased homing to the lung regardless of whether tregs are working properly does depletion of tregs or impairment of their activity promote autoimmunity and therefore local pulmonary inflammation and the development of ibalt there is also a connection between tregs and neutrophils as the selective depletion of foxp3 tregs in neonatal mice increases the number of neutrophils and promotes ibalt formation 82 whereas the targeted depletion of neutrophils significantly reduces the number and size of ibalt areas following intranasal lps administration thus tregs play an inhibitory role in ibalt development consistent with their immunosuppressive activitiesalthough the mechanisms that recruit leukocytes to the lung are clearly important in the formation of ibalt the resolution of pulmonary inflammation will also likely play a role in other words if leukocytes are recruited to a site faster than they can be cleared then they will build up over time and upon reaching a critical mass may spontaneously assemble into a lymphoid tissue like ibalt 128 in support of this idea the treatment of mice with the s1p1r agonist fty720 also promotes ibalt development possibly by retaining cells in the lungs 127 one mechanism for clearing cells from the lung is drainage via lymphatic vessels 64 which are concentrated surrounding ibalt areas 64 in fact infection of mice with mycoplasma pulmonis induces large areas of ibalt and increases the number and volume of intrapulmonary lymphatics 64 the increase in lymphatics is mediated by signaling through vegf-r2 and vegf-r3 however the simultaneous blockade of both receptors does not impede ibalt development 64 these data suggest that differentiation of lung lymphatics and vegf play a marginal role in the development of ibalt however the newly generated lymphatics surrounding ibalt areas are likely to be important in regulating pulmonary inflammation and edema in response to subsequent respiratory infectionsalthough the development of ibalt following exposure to microbes or microbial products provides information about normal physiological processes these types of experiments are complicated to interpret due to the wide array of pathways that may be triggered by infection to avoid this problem some investigators have used the reductionist approach of overexpressing individual cytokines in the lung in three separate reports all of them using an adenovirus expression system the forced overexpression of il-5 129 human il-6il16r 130 or the il-6 family member oncostatin m osm 131 in mouse lungs successfully generated ibalt structures interestingly these pro-inflammatory cytokines have the potential to activate b cells 129 131133 which we know are important for the production of lt and the differentiation of lung stromal cells into fdcs however the overexpression of osm and il-5 also promoted the accumulation of eosinophils in the lungs thus the local activation of eosinophils may functionally replace the role of neutrophils in these circumstances and provide cytokines reactive oxygen or proteases that facilitate the formation of ibaltthe formation of ibalt depends on pulmonary infection or inflammation and it seems that a wide variety of stimuli including bacteria viruses microbial products allergens and even tumors are capable of triggering this process figure 2 in most cases repetitive exposures lps allergens infectious agents viruses bacteria or long-lasting stimuli particulates are required suggesting that a transient inflammatory response is generally not sufficient to promote ibalt formation given the diverse nature of the stimuli capable of inducing ibalt formation it is difficult to find a single pathway that is common to all however the recruitment of granulocytes neutrophils or eosinophils does seem to be a prominent feature of most models importantly both neutrophils and eosinophils produce a variety of cytokines that help fdc differentiation tnf lt b cell activation april il-6 and promote the recruitment of more neutrophils il-23 g-csf or eosinophils eotaxin il-5 134 135 they also make proteases and reactive oxygen that likely trigger receptors or cause damage in a way that promotes the accumulation of activated lymphocytes 136138 these processes seem to be particularly active in neonates perhaps because neonates are prone to heightened neutrophilia 114 139 have a relatively high frequency of il-17-producing -t cells 140 or ilcs 103 and a relatively low frequency of tregs 141143additional neutrophil functions may also be important for ibalt formation or function for example during acute inflammation neutrophils die via fas-mediated apoptosis 144 and are subsequently cleared by macrophages 145 however neutrophils may also die in a way that leads to the production of neutrophil extracellular traps nets  a process called netosis 146 exposure of neutrophils to reactive-oxygen species as well as activation by lps ifn or cxcl8 can favor netosis over apoptosis 147 and lead to an increase in il-23 and il-17 148 which would favor ibalt formation a hallmark characteristic of nets is that neutrophil granule contents histones antimicrobial peptides neutrophil elastase and cytokines remain attached to the expulsed dna 147 moreover net production is associated with lung fibroblast differentiation 149 as well as the processing and bioactivation of il-33 by elastase 150 which triggers il-17f production by bronchial epithelial cells 151 once produced il-17 may become trapped on the nets 149 and further increase the neutrophil recruitment to the lungs and the differentiationactivation of lung stroma again leading to ibalt formation figure 2 this idea is consistent with data showing that nets contribute to the control of pulmonary infection with streptococcus suis in pigs and promote ibalt formation 152 153although ibalt development is triggered by inflammation it can be maintained for months in the absence of inflammation by homeostatic mechanisms 78 154 these mechanisms are the same as those that maintain the structure of conventional lymphoid tissues figure 1 for example once b cell follicles are formed b cells constitutively produce lt and tnf 41 which helps maintain the fdc network hevs and lymphatic vessels 41 in turn the stromal cells of the b and t cell zones make homeostatic cytokines like il-7 54 and homeostatic chemokines like cxcl12 cxcl13 ccl19 ccl20 and ccl21 91 all of which act to recruit lymphocytes direct their homing to the proper architectural domains promote their survival and maintain the expression of lt and tnf which support the stromal cells 91 thus once they are established lymphocytes and stromal cells reinforce each others survival and differentiation in the absence of inflammatory cytokines or chemokines of course in many chronic inflammatory conditions in the lung both the inflammatory and homeostatic mechanisms operate simultaneously which likely leads to continuous ibalt expansion and pathological outcomesmany of these same mechanisms are involved in the formation of tertiary lymphoid tissues in a variety of organs other than the lung for example tertiary lymphoid organs form in the brains of patients with multiple sclerosis 155 156 the local expression of homeostatic chemokines such as cxcl13 ccl19 and ccl21 correlates with the formation of these tissues 157 and soluble ltr can suppress their formation and ameliorate the symptoms of eae 156 moreover th17 cells are involved in the pathogenesis of eae and multiple sclerosis 158 and il-17 is involved in lymphoid neogenesis by promoting the expression of lymphoid chemokines 19 and for the differentiation of local stromal cells 159 thus some of the same inflammatory and homeostatic pathways are involved in the formation of ectopic lymphoid tissues in the lungs and the braintransgenic models also reveal similarities and differences between target organs in the formation of tertiary lymphoid tissues for example the pancreas develops tertiary lymphoid tissues particularly in the context of diabetes 14 160 cxcl13 is required for the organization of b cell follicles in the pancreas 161 162 whereas chemokines like ccl21 and ccl19 are involved in recruiting b and t cells to the site and cytokines like il-7 are important for their survival 49 163 164 again the lt and tnf signaling pathways are important for the maintenance of chemokine expression and the differentiation of stromal cells 164 165 but their contribution to inflammation and diabetes is different 166 interestingly mice that express a ccl21 transgene in the pancreas develop well-defined ectopic lymphoid tissues whereas mice expressing ccl21 in the skin do not 167 thus although there are clear commonalities in the pathways that promote ectopic lymphoid tissues in different organs some striking differences that can probably be attributed to the different types of cells present in each target organexposure to a particular inflammatory stimulus will also likely dictate what pathways are involved in ectopic lymphoid tissue formation for example dcs 15 168 ccl21 169 and the ltr 170 are required for the formation of ectopic follicles in the thyroid without a requirement for id2-dependent lti cells 15 however the over-expression of cxcl13 in the gut promotes the formation of isolated lymphoid follicles via the recruitment of il-22-expressing ilc3 cells 171 il-17 is also involved in the formation of ectopic follicles in the gut 172 suggesting that th17 responses to commensal organisms are likely driving the formation of tertiary lymphoid tissues in this location thus the local inflammatory milieu and resident cell types likely dictate organ-specific pathways that promote the formation of tertiary lymphoid tissues in each non-lymphoid organgiven that ibalt structurally resembles conventional secondary lymphoid organs one might assume that it performs similar functions ie promoting encounters between naive lymphocytes that are recruited from the blood and antigen-presenting cells that have migrated from the lumen of the airways however this hypothesis is difficult to demonstrate experimentally we and others have used lt-deficient mice which lack conventional secondary lymphoid organs 173 to show that immune responses to a variety of antigens can be initiated directly in the lung 23 174 175 for example lt-deficient mice generate nearly normal primary b and t cell responses to a pulmonary infection with influenza virus 23 174 similarly lt-deficient mice are capable of generating primary immune responses following pulmonary exposure to allergens 176 and mycobacterium tuberculosis 175 177 thus conventional secondary lymphoid organs are not necessary for generating immune responses to the pulmonary antigens and pathogens that have been testeddespite their ability to generate primary immune responses lt-deficient mice are not entirely immunocompetent in particular the dcs in lt-deficient mice have defects in survival and migration 178 in part due to poor expression of homeostatic chemokines as a result lt-deficient mice succumb to lower doses of influenza and fare worse than their normal counterparts even though they do make primary immune responses the generation of bone marrow chimeras in which wt bone marrow is transferred into lt-deficient mice circumvents the problems associated with lt deficiency but does not restore lymph nodes or peyers patches thus upon the removal of the spleen these mice lack all conventional secondary lymphoid organs and are known as spleen lymph node and peyers patch-deficient slp mice importantly slp mice generate primary immune responses to influenza without any delay 23 immune responses in slp mice are initiated in the lung in well-organized areas of ibalt moreover germinal center responses are observed in the lungs of slp mice and germinal enters can be observed in the b cell follicles of ibalt 69 155 179 in addition influenza-specific memory t cells are generated and maintained in slp mice as are long-lived antibody-secreting cells 180 most surprisingly influenza-infected slp mice fare better than wt mice even in the absence of conventional secondary lymphoid organs 23 this result is likely due to slightly reduced t cell responses in slp mice which leads to reduced production of inflammatory cytokines like tnf and il-6 both of which contribute to weight loss and morbidity thus ibalt areas in the lung are capable of generating primary immune responses maintaining memory cells and reducing morbidity and mortality associated with pulmonary infectionsonce ibalt is formed it is maintained in the lungs for months often in the absence of the original stimulus that triggered its formation 78 moreover once ibalt is formed it acts like any other lymphoid organ and can recruit naive b and t cells and support their activation in response to antigens that are unrelated to the antigens that triggered ibalt formation for instance ibalt generated in response to mycobacterium tuberculosis infection can recruit naive ova-specific cd4 t cells and support their activation upon subsequent pulmonary exposure to ova without contributions from conventional secondary lymphoid organs 175 177 moreover the transfer of dcs loaded with ova peptide to mice in which ibalt was induced following pulmonary infection with mva primes naive ova-specific cd8 t cells in the lung 23 65 together these data suggest that the specificity of naive t cell priming can be different from the antigenic stimulation that initially induced ibaltthe presence of ibalt in normal mice also has dramatic consequences on the resulting immune response and clinical outcomes for example mice that have ibalt induced by pulmonary instillation of protein nanoparticles clear virus more rapidly and lose less weight following influenza infection 67 181 in these mice the kinetics of influenza-specific cd4 t cells in the lymph node parallels that in the lung suggesting that they are being primed in both locations simultaneously 67 the presence of ibalt also provides a beneficial effect with sars-coronavirus and pneumovirus which are cleared more rapidly in mice with ibalt by an accelerated antibody response 181 similarly mice that have ibalt induced as a result of neonatal lps exposure lose less weight and clear pneumovirus faster than mice without ibalt 82 importantly the cd4 t cell response to pneumovirus is accelerated in mice with ibalt 82 suggesting that the presence of ibalt in the lung leads to faster more efficient pulmonary immune responses that promote rapid viral clearance and reduce morbidity after infection thus ibalt is beneficial in the context of respiratory virus infectionthe presence of ibalt is also protective in the context of bacterial infections for example intranasal vaccination with lps and recombinant porin b from francisella tulerensis induces highly organized ibalt structures 182 and confers improved survival and more efficient bacterial control upon challenge with the francisella tulerensis vaccine strain 182 similarly ibalt induced with nanoparticles confers protection against subsequent challenge with coxiella burnetii 181in addition to its role in resolving acute bacterial infections in the lung ibalt also helps control chronic pulmonary infection with mycobacteria tuberculosis mtb a hallmark of mtb infection is the formation of granulomas clusters of lymphocytes that surround mtb-infected macrophages and contain infection 183 granulomas exhibit many of the features of ibalt and b cell follicles containing germinal centers and fdcs are often observed in mtb granulomas in mice 87 184186 humans 187 and monkeys 186 188 monkeys with latent mtb infection maintain large well-organized areas of ibalt surrounding granulomas 186 whereas monkeys with active disease have fewer and less organized areas of ibalt thus the maintenance of good ibalt structures seems to be important for the control of mtb in fact the activity of ibalt is sufficient to prime mtb-specific ifn-producing cd4 t cells and control infection without contributions from conventional secondary lymphoid organs 175in fact chronic pulmonary infection with mtb progressively leads to ibalt development with progressive increases in the expression of both ccl19 and cxcl13 87 185 importantly the loss of these chemokines in cxcl13 mice or pltplt mice lacking both ccl19 and ccl21 leads to disrupted ibalt architecture and delayed granuloma formation 185 cxcl13 seems to be most important for generating proper granulomas and for recruiting cxcr5-expressing t cells to the lungs 185 whereas granuloma formation is relatively normal in pltplt mice but the th1 response is delayed 185 consistent with the poor immune response in these mice the titers of mtb are higher in the lungs of both cxcl13 mice and in pltplt mice and are even higher in the lungs of cxcl13 x pltplt micegiven that cxcl13 expression depends on il-17 during pulmonary inflammatory conditions it is not surprising that il-17 is important in immunity to mtb following vaccination 184 in fact intranasal vaccination of mice with mtb in combination with type ii heat labile enterotoxin elicits mtb-specific th17 cells 100 upon subsequent challenge with mtb the memory th17 cells elicit pulmonary expression of cxcl13 which recruits cxcr5-expressing t cells to the granuloma 100 186 consequently mtb-specific th1 cells activate macrophages and control infectionalthough ibalt seems consistently beneficial in the context of experimental models of infection children and young adults with chronic or recurrent pneumonia develop ibalt areas in their lungs that are associated with bronchiolar damage 189 indicating that ibalt may contribute to bronchial pathology moreover it is described in rabbits that collagens in the deeper layers of the bronchial wall are disrupted when ibalt is present 75 again supporting an association in pathologic context however the actual function of ibalt in these cases is difficult to assesspatients with chronic pulmonary diseases often develop areas of ibalt for example patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd develop areas of ibalt adjacent to their small airways 190 in fact the global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease gold has classified copd patients into five-stages based on airflow limitation 191 and there is a strong correlation between the patients in gold stages 3 and 4 severe and very severe with the percentage of ibalt follicles in the airway and lymphocyte infiltration compared to gold stages 1 and 2 mild and moderate patients 192 these studies also show a positive correlation between cxcl13 expression and lymphoid follicle density 192 suggesting that b cells accumulate in ibalt-like areas via a cxcl13-dependent mechanism interestingly b cells in the ibalt areas of copd patients may be capable of making their own cxcl13 190 however inflammatory chemokine receptors such as cxcr3 are also found on b cells of copd patients 193 suggesting a role of both inflammatory and homeostatic recruitment of b cells as suggested in other studies lt is also important for the formation of ibalt in the context of copd 194 195 cytokines like baff are also important for the activation or survival of b cells in copd lungs 196 b cells not only make antibodies but also activate macrophages in the context of copd 197 which contributes to disease pathology similarly langerin-expressing dcs are found surrounding ibalt areas in copd patients 198 199 and their numbers positively correlate with the severity of copd 199 200 consistent with these observations mouse models of chronic cigarette smoke-induced copd also identify ibalt areas in the lungs 89 and the numbers of ibalt areas are greater in mice exposed for longer periodsgiven that ibalt is associated with the most severe forms of copd 192 201 one could argue that ibalt contributes to pathology and is detrimental for the host conversely one could argue that the elevated inflammation and lung damage in patients with more severe copd promote ibalt formation consistent with this idea patients with copd often have elevated expression of thrombin in their airways 202 203 which is associated with pulmonary inflammation and damage 204 205 interestingly mice lacking the serine protease inhibitor serpine2 spontaneously develop chronic pulmonary inflammation and form ibalt-like structures in their lungs 119 thus pathways of damage and inflammation in chronic lung disease may promote ibalt finally patients with copd often develop bacterial infections in their lung which exacerbates disease 206 thus ibalt may form as a consequence of infection and based on studies in mice may actually be providing a benefit to the patient despite the severity of diseasethe development of ibalt is also associated with another chronic lung condition hypersensitivity pneumonitis hypersensitivity pneumonitis is caused by a chronic exposure to environmental organic dusts or molds resulting in immune-driven inflammation 207 often referred to as farmers lung hypersensitivity pneumonitis is typically the result of repeated exposure to a particular pulmonary antigen such as moldy hay thus ibalt structures in the lungs of hypersensitivity pneumonitis patients are often very reactive and contain enormous germinal centers 208 209given the dramatic enlargement of ibalt areas in an antigen-driven disease like hypersensitivity pneumonitis one might expect that patients with allergen-driven asthma would also develop extensive areas of ibalt in fact the appearance of ibalt-like structures isolated aggregations of lymphoid cells or ialc is observed in asthmatic patients and is greater in number and size compared to those in non-asthmatics 210 in addition the appearance of ibalt-like areas in asthmatics correlates with airway wall thickening and increases in eosinophil infiltration furthermore the progressive organization of ibalt positively correlates with the severity of asthma symptoms suggesting that ibalt may be responding to external antigens and exacerbating pulmonary pathology similarly patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis also develop ibalt areas some of which have allergen-specific ige-expressing b cells in the germinal centers 211 again suggesting an involvement of ibalt in pathology these observations can be mimicked in mice by sensitization and pulmonary challenge with ova which promotes the differentiation of ova-specific ige-secreting plasma cells in ibalt structures in the lungs and increases airway hyperresponsiveness 90 however the presence of ibalt does not always correlate with the development or progression of allergy or asthma as a study of cross-country skiers finds ibalt at a similar frequency in normal and asthmatic individuals independent of smoking status and does not correlate ibalt with either respiratory allergy or airway hyperresponsiveness 212 thus the causal relationship between ibalt and pulmonary allergies or asthma remains enigmaticwell-developed ibalt is also commonly found in patients with pulmonary complications of rheumatoid arthritis ra 208 these structures are highly reactive with polarized germinal centers that nearly fill the b cell follicles plasma cells secreting antibodies specific for citrullinated proteins are found surrounding the ibalt areas given that antibodies against citrullinated proteins are highly specific for ra 213 and are known to be pathologic 214 these data suggest that ibalt areas are contributing to autoimmune disease similar structures are observed in a subset of patients with pulmonary manifestations of sjogrens syndrome ss 208 ss is also an autoimmune disease that is characterized with an autoantibody production 215 interestingly the lungs of both ra and ss patients with pulmonary disease have extraordinary increases in the expression of the chemokines cxcl13 and cxcl12 216 which likely contribute to the recruitment of lymphocytes and the formation of ibalt areas in the lung comparable to what is observed in the salivary glands of ss patients 217 again these data suggest that ibalt contributes to the local production of autoantibodies and correlates with local pathologyimmune responses against transplanted organs are similar to autoimmune responses in that alloantigens like autoantigens persist forever  sometimes promoting the development of ectopic lymphoid tissues like ibalt 218 for instance ibalt is observed around small airways in a rat model of orthotopic lung transplantation 219 and given the local immune reactivity is thought to contribute to the rejection of the transplanted lungs similarly transplanted hearts and kidneys also develop ectopic lymphoid tissues that are associated with the production of antibodies directed against donor mhc-i molecules 220 interestingly treatment of heart allograft recipients with ltrig fusion protein abolished the formation of tertiary lymphoid tissues attenuated the autoantibody response and prevented graft rejection 221 suggesting again that local lymphoid tissues play a role in local immune reactivity however the long-term acceptance of lung allografts is also associated with the formation of ibalt 222 in this case the acceptance of the graft is dependent on the accumulation of foxp3 tregs that accumulate in ibalt areas thus the formation of ibalt can promote tolerance 222 as well as immune reactivity and understanding how it might perform these functions will be important for future studies to determinelocal immune reactivity and the formation of ectopic lymphoid tissues are also important for immunity against tumors 223 for example some patients with non-small-cell lung cancer nsclc develop lymphocyte clusters called tumor-induced balt ti-balt 224 which are associated with more favorable clinical outcomes presumably dcs within ti-balt present tumor-associated antigens to t cells and enhance the efficiency of the immune response in addition ilc3 that express natural cytotoxicity receptors ncrs accumulate in ti-balt and their frequency positively correlates with ti-balt formation and negatively correlates with tumor growth 225 thus in this context the presence of ibalt is associated with productive immunity rather than tolerancethere is little doubt that ibalt promotes productive immunity to a wide variety of infectious agents it also correlates with inflammatory lung diseases immunity against lung tumors and transplant rejection these data might suggest that the presence of ibalt leads to bigger and faster immune responses which would be good for immunity against infection and bad for autoimmunity and chronic inflammation however there are clear instances in which ibalt correlates with tolerance against allografts and may even reduce inflammation associated with inflammatory diseases like asthma thus the functions of ibalt are much more complex than initially thoughthow might ibalt accelerate immune responses and simultaneously suppress inflammatory responses one possible mechanism involves the formation of additional lymphatic vessels around the ibalt follicles 64 208 which by efficiently gathering pulmonary dcs might accelerate immune responses and concentrate the local inflammatory response in the areas of ibalt  away from the remainder of the lung parenchyma one can envision this process as sequestering antigens pathogens and cells in ibalt areas in order to control inflammation and pathology and also to efficiently eliminate or contain pathogens like mtb in fact static imaging shows that inhaled antigens and particulates such as diesel exhaust 88 or silica 226 accumulate in ibalt areas effectively sequestering them and potentially reducing their ability to trigger inflammationa similar mechanism may be acting in ccr7 mice which spontaneously develop ibalt in the context of rheumatoid lung disease 127 195 but are simultaneously protected from developing bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis 227 in addition mice that develop ibalt as a consequence of autoimmunity are also protected from bleomycin-induced fibrosis 228 one possible explanation for these results is that following bleomycin administration the ibalt areas rapidly sequester the drug or efficiently drain it out of the lung via lymphatics thereby reducing its ability to trigger a fibrotic responseone can extend this idea to antigens and allergens that are taken up by phagocytic cells in the lung the areas of ibalt may efficiently collect antigen-bearing dcs or macrophages via lymphatics or other mechanisms promoting their concentration in areas devoted to t and b cell priming and simultaneously depleting them from the rest of the lung in fact plasmacytoid dcs pdcs in patients with asthma and in patients with mild moderate copd are found concentrated in ibalt areas of the lung 229 where they may promote the local differentiation of tregs 230 231 in addition lymphatic vessels in ibalt provide a survival niche for memory cd4 t cells by providing il-7 interestingly lymphatic endothelial cells also produce cytokines like il-33 as well as chemokines like ccl21 68 all of which may contribute to trafficking activation and survival of lymphocytes these possibilities highlight the potential regulatory function of ibalt in the context of inflammatory diseasesthe delicate mucosal surface of the lung is constantly exposed to pathogens and environmental antigens but in most cases manages to generate immune responses that are sufficient to clear pathogens without causing undue damage the presence of ibalt clearly plays a role in this process by modulating local immune responses in a way that accelerates immunity to pathogens and in some cases ameliorating chronic inflammation one might argue that ibalt achieves both these effects by sequestering antigens and cells in small areas of lymphoid tissue in the lung however the factors that control the activity of ibalt are unclear and will undoubtedly be the focus of future studies once we understand the pathways that control the development and function of ibalt we may be able to target therapies that promote or inhibit these activities depending on the contextall authors listed have made substantial direct and intellectual contribution to the work and approved it for publicationthe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interestviruses including sars and influenza can change quickly thereby negating the efficacy of developed vaccines and targetted antiviral drugs
1
 consequently it is important to utilize any substance that can more widely limit viral effects often as in the case of covid19 there is little likelihood of developing a vaccine or antiviral within a year of the emergence of such a devastating infection utilizing or developing more generic antivirals is a significant challenge given that viruses can vary considerably as to the their effects including on the immune system for example a general antiviral requirement for influenza and covid19 would be for a treatment that limits the initial innate immuneassociated cytokine storm where evident while also acting to increase the efficacy of the adaptive immune response
2
 however for the ebola virus such initial dampening of the innate immune response is not so clinically relevant allowing for such variability in virus effects melatonin has emerged as a top candidate for protection against an array of different viruses including the coronavirus3 4 5 this would seem to arise from the close evolution of melatonin within the emerging mitochondria in the first singlecellular organsims allowing melatonin to be intimately associated with mitochondrial function and thereby with immune system regulation
6
 the interactions of our bacterialdriven coexistence with viruses have provided a war of the worlds from which plant and animal evolution have emerged and in which evolution has acted to tolerate and limit rather than annihilate melatonin is an important aspect of our interactions with virusesas data pertaining to the pathophysiology of covid19 have still to emerge the current article focusses primarily on the role of melatonergic pathway in the management of influenza viruses as well as highlighting its potential utility in supporting people at high risk of fatality from influenza viruses and covid19 at the time of writing data from china and italy indicate that the elderly are at far higher risk of covid19 linked mortality primarily as a consequence of ageingassociated conditions such as cardiovascular pulmonary and diabetic disorders as well as in immunecompromised conditions melatonin has clinical utility in all of these health conditions suggesting its utility in buffering against covid19 interactions with these medical conditions however the interactions of the melatonergic pathway with viruses may be more complex than ameliorative effects on ageingassociated preexisting medical conditions first the melatonergic pathway is reviewed and how this pathway may interact with the effects of the influenza covid19 and other viruses this has treatment implications as well as providing indications as to important future research on how an understanding of human physiological systems can provide treatment targets that regulate the impact of viral infections including influenza and covid19 driven pathophysiologythe circadian entrainment induced by pineal melatonin is strongly driven by melatonins upregulation of the circadian gene bmal1 which seems to mediate many of melatonins effects in mitochondria bmal1 inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase pdk leading to the disinhibition of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex pdc pdc drives the conversion of pyruvate to acetylcoenzyme a acetylcoa in mitochondria thereby increasing the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle oxidative phosphorylation oxphos and atp production acetylcoa is also a necessary cosubstrate for aanat and therefore allows pineal melatonin via the bmal1pdkpdc path to increase the activation of the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway for this to happen aanat needs to be stabilized by 1433 protein which is present within the mitochondrial matrix16 17 it has been proposed that aanat may also be stabilized by the mitochondrial ionic channel letm1 which has a 1433like motif in its cterminal within the mitochondrial matrix
18

the pineal melatoninmitochondrial melatonin path may be most important in immune cells although relevant in all cells subject to circadian regulation by pineal melatonin the daytime activation of immune cells is associated with glycolytic metabolism which pineal melatonin resets to oxphos thereby inducing more quiescent immune cell phenotyes it is by such processes that immune cells are dampened at night however in the presence of indicants of required immuneinflammatory activity at night proinflammatory cytokines can switch off pineal melatonin production thereby forming another branch of the immunepineal axis
19
 as such the circadian rhythm as driven by pineal melatonin is a powerful immune regulator with effects that can include the upregulation of the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway a decrease in pineal melatonin as often occurs in the elderly and in conditions associated with high susceptibility to severe viral infection can therefore have a significant impact on the mitochondrial metabolism and phenotype of immune cells as well as of other cell types including cns glial cells the suppression of pineal melatonin is proposed to increase the susceptibility to an array of medical conditions including cancers16 17 via the loss of this nighttime shift from glycolytic metabolism to oxphos such interactions of pineal melatonin with mitochondrial metabolism and the melatonergic pathway provide important points of impact by viral infectionsviruses can have quite distinct interactions with the host over the course of an infection making generalizations across different viruses impossible however some factors have been found to regulate the effects of many different viruses one such factor is the ahrthe ahr has a number of endogenous and exogenous ligands including 2378tetrachlorodibenzopdioxin tcdd commonly found in cigarette smoke polychlorinated biphenyl congener 126 pcb126 a common pollutant the novel pharmaceutical 21hindole3carbonylthiazole4carboxylic acid methyl ester ite and the endogenous ahr ligand 6formylindolo32bcarbazole ficz which is a tryptophan degradation product all of these ligands can modulate immune responses to viral infection20 21 however it is the activation of the ahr by kynurenine and kynurenic acid that more readily links the ahr to immune inflammatory activity as shown in figure 1 ahr activation by different ligands can result in some differential effects complicating the understanding of ahr activation the ahr is also differentially expressed over the circadian rhythm thereby linking the ahr to variations in the immune response over the circadian rhythm
22
 as noted ahr activation induces an increase in mitochondrial cyp1b1 thereby contributing to an elevated nasmelatonin ratio given proinflammatory cytokine induction of ahr ligands ahr activation is therefore an aspect of the cytokine storm that can follow viral infection thereby contributing to suppressed serotonin and melatonin availability whilst also having consequences for the regulation of the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway including the nasmelatonin ratioa number of studies show the ahr modulates the antiviral immune response including the prototypical coronavirus murine hepatitis virus
23
 these authors show that the ahr is an important mediator of how this coronavirus modulates the hosts immune response leading to the expression of several effector genes including tcddinducible polyadpribose polymerase tiparp which is required for maximal coronavirus replication this study also showed that the ahr modulates macrophage and dendritic cell responses including the levels of interleukin il1 il10 and tumor necrosis factor tnf
23
 other data show the different ahr ligands differentially modulate immunoglobulin igg and cd8 tcell responses to the influenza virus with the loss of cyp1 attenuating ahrdriven effects on virusdriven immune responses
20
 whether such ahrdriven effects are regulated by variations in the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway and nasmelatonin ratio requires investigation including as to the relevance of these ahrassociated pathways in covid19 infection overall the ahr may be an important link between the initial cytokine storm and alterations in mitochondrial and immune cell function including via alterations in the melatonergic pathwaythe influence of the circadian rhythm is also seen following influenza vaccination where the timing of vaccination and of sample collection modulates the bcell response measures especially in the elderly
24
 the host circadian rhythm is a significant regulator of the response to viral infection preclinical data show that irrespective of the viral burden survival following influenza viral infection is determined by the circadian influence on the patterning of the immune response
25
 the circadian gene bmal1 is a significant inhibitor of herpes simplex virus hsv1 and influenza viruses highlighting the role of circadian factors in the regulation of viral infections
26
 as the loss of the circadian rhythm can increase viral replication viruses can act to sabotage circadian regulation exemplified by hsv1 suppression of bmal1
26
 this overlaps to data in the lung where pulmonary airway epithelial cell bmal1 regulates the response to the influenza virus
27
 with the influenza virus also decreasing bmal1 thereby contributing to the circadian disruption induced by this virus
28
 such data highlight the circadian nature of host physiology including in many virusrelevant pathways upon which viruses act to promote their survival and proliferationas noted the effects of pineal melatonin include bmal1 induction which is a major driver of pineal melatonins influence on circadian rhythms with bmal1 acting to regulate mitochondrial metabolism the effects of melatonininduced bmal1 include the suppression of pdk and the disinhibition of pdc thereby increasing the conversion of pyruvate to acetylcoa for the tca cycle oxphos and atp production concurrently acetylcoa acts to upregulate the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway with consequences that include the stimulation of sirtuin3 and superoxide dismutase 2 sod2 the circadian impacts on mitochondrial metabolism have been most thoroughly investigated in immune cells however this would seem relevant to the regulation of metabolism in all cells as such the effects of viral infection on the circadian rhythm are intimately linked to alterations in mitochondrial metabolism and the nature of the immune response within this framework the viral suppression of pineal melatonin will be intimately associated with concurrent alterations in the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway and thereby with key aspects of mitochondrial metabolism consequently some viruses act to inhibit both pineal and mitochondrial melatonin productionthe importance of such processes is given some support by data in humans with a severe influenza infection and associated poor survival rates severe influenza and covid19 infections seem driven by an initial cytokine storm with the increase in proinflammatory cytokines acting to suppress pineal melatonin production
29
 this is the essence of the immunepineal axis
19
 whereby proinflammatory cytokines act to signal the need for an ongoing immune response and thereby prevent its suppression by pineal melatonin the major driver of the multiorgan failure that is evident in severe influenza infection is the dysregulation of mitochondrial metabolism
30
 and the lost influence of decreased pineal melatonin on such metabolic dysregulation an elevation in cellular trypsin as a hemagglutinin processing protease for viral multiplication is often an aspect of this leading to the influenza viruscytokinetrypsin cycle which is coupled to a decrease in mitochondrial atp
30

work on the influenza viruscytokinetrypsin cycle has led to new proposed treatments which target the atp crisis and multiorgan failure that occur during the late phase of infection this contrasts to the utilization of antiviral treatments with neuraminidase inhibitors which are targeted to processes that are evident in the initial phase of influenza infection treatment options proposed include the restoration of mitochondrial oxphos thereby countering infectioninduced pdk4 activation and therefore pdc inhibition clearly the reestablishment of the effector of the circadian rhythm by melatonin treatment would more naturally target an upregulation of bmal1 and mitochondrial oxphos as to how viruses that suppress bmal1 interact with exogenous melatonin will be important to determine including as to the most effective melatonin dose if applicableas il1 seems an important proinflammatory cytokine in the upregulation of the influenza viruscytokinetrypsin cycle this would indicate a role for the induction of the nod lrr and pyrin domaincontaining protein nlrp3 inflammasome
31
 most viruses increase their proliferation and survival via an increase in the nlrp3 inflammasome
32
 with the regulation of the nlrp3 inflammasome being taken over by viruses
33
 as melatonin is a significant inhibitor of the nlrp3 inflammasome
34
 the suppression of melatonin production both pineal and mitochondrial by viruses is likely to be an important aspect of how viruses disengage the nlrp3 inflammasome from physiological processes it should also be noted that il18 is induced along with il1 from nlrp3 inflammasome activation with il18 being relatively underinvestigated in viral research as in many other medical conditions
35
 il18 and il1 pathway interactions may also be relevant to the interactions of preexisting bacterial infection with new covid19 or influenza infection in the regulation of disease severity and patient survival
36
 overall the viral inhibition of melatonin may contribute to increased nlrp3 inflammasome and thereby to viral proliferation and survivalsirtuins are an important aspect of mitochondrial metabolism both directly via mitochondrialocated sirtuins sirtuin3 4 5 and indirectly via cytosolic sirtuin1 induction of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma pparppar coactivator1 pgc1  which is a major regulatory path of mitochondrial metabolism the sirtuins are also an aspect of the circadian rhythm
37
 alterations in the levels and effects of cytosolic nuclear and mitochondrial sirtuins are also evident in a number of viral infections including within dendritic cells which have an important role in regulating the patterned immune response
38
 generally the sirtuins seem to be evolutionary conserved antiviral agents
39
 like the circadian rhythm viruses may act to disengage sirtuins from their regular physiological processes the evolutionary conserved relationship of melatonininduced sirtuins is important to the maintenance of mitochondrial function
40
 highlighting another important aspect of normal mitochondrial function that viruses can disengage via the suppression of pineal and mitochondrial melatoninmicrornas mirna are important mediators of cellular coordination with each mirna regulating up to 100 genes consequently alterations in the regulation of mirnas are another aspect of how viruses modulate immune and wider cell function a number of mirnas act to suppress ywhaz1433 including mir7 mir375 and mir451 thereby suppressing the 1433 stabilization of aanat and leading to a general inhibition of the melatonergic pathway increased mir451 is one of the mechanisms whereby the influenza virus acts to regulate dendritic cells and therefore patterned immune activity
41
 the influenza virus also increases mir7
42
 whilst mir375 can have contrasting effects of viral survival and replication
43
 although mirnas can influence multiple genes the impact of quite distinct viruses on these mitochondrial melatonergic pathway regulating mirnas would indicate an important role for this pathway in to how viruses can determine cellular functionthere is a growing interest in the role of the gut microbiome across a host of diverse medical conditions including neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions
44
 but also immunemediated conditions such as multiple sclerosis and arthritis15 45 in line with this recent data show that many viral infections including influenza drive changes in the gut and lung microbiomes
46
 with viralmediated changes in the gut including gut dysbiosis and increased gut permeability these authors also show how such changes in the gut microbiomepermeability can contribute to secondary bacterial pneumonia
46
 the high levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines that are evident in many viral infections especially during the cytokine storm increase gut permeability both directly and via mucosal mast cells mucosal mast cell tnf as increased by stressinduced corticotropin releasing hormone crh
47
 also mediates psychological stressinduced gut dysbiosispermeability these are two mechanisms whereby infection induced increases in gut dysbiosispermeability can occur with consequences for mitochondria and immune cell function as well as for the severity of viral infectionsthere are a number of ways that the gut microbiomepermeability can be relevant to viral infection pathophysiology including from a reduction in the gut microbiomederived shortchain fatty acid butyrate to an increase in the levels of circulating lipopolysaccharide lps arising from an increase in gut permeability
48
 as the alterations in butyrate and lps can impact mitochondrial function and immune system responses including from changes in the regulation of immune cell mitochondria such changes in gut processes provide another focus for viral interactions with wider body systemsgut dysbiosis and increased gut permeability are intimately linked butyrate acts to maintain the gut barrier at least in part via an increase in the melatonergic pathway in intestinal epithelial cells
49
 butyrate is also an immunesuppressant via its capacity to disinhibit pdc and thereby increase mitochondrial oxphos tca cycle and acetylcoa for the melatonergic pathway
17
 it seems not unlikey that butyrate therefore acts on the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway to increase melatonin production as suggested by its induction of the melatonergic pathway in intestinal epithelial cells
49
 dysregulating the gut microbiome and decreasing gutderived butyrate may therefore be another mechanism whereby viruses can act to modulate mitochondrial and immune cell function butyrate is also a histone deacetylase hdac inhibitor thereby allowing it have epigenetic regulatory effects that are relevant to viral infections a number of hdacs act to regulate viral infections with the inhibition of hdac1 leading to a decrease in influenzadriven pneumonia infections
50
 the role of gut microbiomederived butyrate and the nutriceutical sodium butyrate in the regulation of viral infections clearly requires further investigationthe increase in gut permeability driven by proinflammatory cytokines allows for an elevation in the levels of circulating lps from the early phases of some viral infections by activating tolllike receptor tlr24 circulating lps can modulate the immune system as well as many other cells as most viruses first make contact with their hosts mucosal surfaces which are typically already colonized with bacterial microbials bacteriavirus interactions are a longestablished integral aspect of viral infections
51
 tlr4 activation by lps potentiates the lethality of influenza virus infection in preclinical models by increasing proinflammatory cytokine production and the glycolytic metabolic reprogramming of dendritic cells which the authors propose to be partly mediated by the induction of the tlr4 ligand highmobility group box hmgb1
52
 this is supported by other preclinical data
53

under conditions of increased gut permeability intestinal epithelial cells increase hmgb1 release in exosomes
54
 suggesting that both circulating lps and exosomal hmgb1 may contribute to viral lethality via increased gut permeability the roles of lps and hmgb1 require further investigation as to their influence on the course of different viral infections
55
 as clearly the levels of circulating lps are far lower than in most preclinical experimental investigations it also requires investigation as to whether a preexisting increase in gut permeability as in many preestablished medical conditions or following psychological stress interact with the pathophysiological changes induced by different viral infections this has treatment implications including the use of sodium butyrate which maintains the gut barrier and attenuates the stressinduced increase in proinflammatory cytokines from mucosal mast cells that underpin psychological stressinduced gut permeability
56

the increase in proinflammatory cytokines and the cytokine storm that can contribute to viral infection severity and fatality are positively regulated by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system as shown with influenza virus infection
57
 these authors also showed sympathetic nervous system activation to increase pulmonary pneumonia in a preclinical model with the inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system increasing survival
57
 some of the effects of the sympathetic nervous system may be mediated by an increase release of not only catecholamines but also neuropeptide y npy the release of which from monocytes also contributes to influenzaassociated fatality
58

in contrast the activation of the parasympathetic nervous system following the vagal nerve release of acetylcholine affords protection against some viral infections via the activation of the alpha 7 acetylcholine nicotinic receptor 7nachr
59
 including decreasing macrophage inflammatory responses
60
 it should be noted that the 7nachr is intimately associated with melatonin being positively regulated by pineal melatonin over the circadian rhythm
61
 whilst the impact of melatonin in preventing gut permeability under challenge is mediated by its induction of vagal nerve ach release and subsequent 7nachr activation
62
 as such the viral suppression of melatonin will be associated with a decrease in its induction of the 7nachr and vagal ach thereby decreasing the viral and immunesuppressive activity of vagal activated 7nachrs it should also be noted that the 7nachr is expressed on the mitochondria outer membrane suggesting more direct impacts on mitochondrial function including in immune cells and in the regulation of mitochondria ca2 influx63 64
overall shifts in the balance of the sympatheticparasympathetic nervous systems may be another aspect of viral infections this is another route whereby the viral regulation of the melatonergic pathway can act on wider systemic regulatory processes in a manner to increase viral severity and decrease host survivalit is also noteworthy that increased gut dysbiosispermeability is frequently associated with the preexisting health conditions that increase the risk of fatality from viral infections preexisting health conditions that increase fatality risk from influenza and covid19 include cardiovascular and lung disorders diabetes and cancer
65
 many of the specific medical conditions that are included within these groups of disorders are linked to an elevation in gut dysbiosispermeability66 67 mitochondrial dysfunction
68
 and circadian dysregulation69 70 with melatonin showing utility in their management71 72 ageing the main risk factor for death from influenza and covid19 is highly associated with these pathophysiological changes73 74 75 76 with melatonin partly via sirtuin induction as well as circadian and mitochondria regulation attenuating ageingassociated processes
77
 overall such data would suggest that the pathophysiological changes associated with many viruses overlap with the biological underpinnings of the highrisk conditions associated with increased risk of virusassociated fatalitydoes melatonin have utility in decreasing symptoms and fatality rates of influenza and covid19 viruses if so what are the relevant doses extrapolating from preclinical data would suggest that doses as high as 500 mg may be necessary to dampen the initial cytokine storm such doses are well tolerated in humans but clearly require investigation in virusinfected patientsdoes melatonin attenuate the downregulation of bmal1 by the influenza and possibly covid19 virusesdoes pinealderived melatonin and exogenous melatonin increase the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway in immune cells and other cell types including during the course of viral infectionpreclinical data shows that maternal exposure to an ahr ligand can drive alterations in the immune response to viral infection in the offspring
78
 it requires investigation as to whether such transgenerational effects on the viral immune response involve alterations in the mitochondrial melatonergic pathwayis the regulation of the nasmelatonin ratio by the ahrcyp1b1 cyp2c19 mglur5 p2y1 receptor or odemethylation relevant to the pathophysiology of different virusesdoes covid19 decrease the bmal1pdcacetylcoatca cycleoxphos path with consequences that include suppression of the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway and associated changes in sirtuins and mitochondrial antioxdant enzymeshow important is the induction of gut dysbiosispermeability to the consequences of the cytokine storm at the early stages of severe viral infectionsil18 was formally known as ifninducing factor with ifn having a significant role in the regulation of immune responses to viral infection
79
 does nlrp3 inflammasome induction of il18 have a distinct role from nlrp3induced il1 in virusdriven pathophysiology via their differential regulation of ifnwhat is the relevance of elevations in circulating lps arising from increased gut permeability to proliferation and severity of viral infections including influenza and covid19to what extent do variations in the melatonergic pathway and gut dysbiosispermeability explain the large variance in influenza and covid19 symptom severity across the general populationhow relevant are variations in the autonomic nervous system and 7nachr activation to symptom severity in influenza and covid19 viral infectionsgiven the common viral suppression of melatonin coupled to melatonins positive modulation of processes inhibited by most viruses it is not unreasonable to propose melatonin to have utility in limiting the symptomatology and fatality associated with viral infection including influenza and covid19 melatonin may also have prophylactic utility especially in people with preexistent medical conditions associated with suppressed pineal melatonin synthesisgiven the role of gut microbiomederived butyrate and its nutriceutical equivalent sodium butyrate in the regulation of mitochondrial function the melatonergic pathway and hdac inhibition does butyrate have a role in pathophysiology and treatment of viral infectionsare there any additive or synergistic interactions of melatonin and butyrate treatments in the management of viral infections including in decreasing fatalities from influenza and covid19 infectionsoverall commonly affected processes in viral infections would suggest that the lack of an available vaccine and antiviral and their impotence in the face of new viral mutations should not necessarily lead to a management response that is solely dependent upon social isolation in order to decrease human mortality a number of factors can act to inhibit the key cellular changes upon which viruses act with melatonin being one such factor the utility of melatonin is paradoxically underappreciated if not suppressed by its ready availability low cost and very high safety profile at the time of writing there has been a significant impact of covid19 on global economies it would seem inappropriate to wait for the pharmaceutical companies to provide a targeted antiviral and vaccine in over a years time at which point covid19 may well have mutated as highlighted throughout viral impacts on human physiology allows for the use of nutriceuticals and pharmaceuticals that may lower infection severity by targeting physiological processes melatonin is one such substance melatonin is actively inhibited by most viruses indicating its importance in the regulation of viral infections a further benefit of melatonin in the management of influenza and covid19 arises from its utility in management of the array of preexisting medical conditions associated with virallinked fatality the potential benefits of sodium butyrate in the management of influenza and covid19 infections include its immune suppressive and mitochondrial optimization effects as well as its induction of the melatonergic pathway and ability to decrease the gut permeability that is associated with high risk preexisting medical conditions overall there are biomedical financial and moral reasons for developing and testing interventions that may immediately limit the impact of viral infectionsnot applicablethe authors declare no potential conflict of interestmouse hepatitis virus  mhv is a member of the coronaviridae family in the order nidovirales coronaviruses are classified into one of three antigenic groups with mhv classified as a lineage a betacoronavirus de groot et al 2013 members of

virus clearance andor persistence in the cns and the mechanisms of virus evasion of the immune systemcoronaviruses are large 80120 nm pseudospherical particles that contain a long helical nucleocapsid surrounded by an envelope bearing both virus- and host-derived glycoproteins reviewed in masters and perlman 2013 the largest among known rna viruses the genome of coronaviruses consists of a single-stranded positive-sense 5-capped and polyadenylated rna of 3032 kilobases the 5 two-thirds of the rna genome of coronaviruses encodes the replicase-transcriptase machinery and is expressed as two very large open reading frames orf orf1a and orf1b the remainder of the genome encodes the structural proteins emagluttinin-esterase protein he spike glycoprotein s envelope protein e transmembrane glycoprotein m and nucleocapsid protein n as well as additional group-specific accessory proteins reviewed in masters 2006 the three mhv orfs encoding accessory proteins
are interspersed within the structural genes and include orf2a orf4 and orf5a encode ns2 ns4 and ns5a respectively lai and cavanagh 1997 masters and perlman 2013 fig 1b these general features of genomic organization are shared among all members of the coronaviridae family however substantial variability exists in the number and type of orfs expressed in the 3 region of the genome remarkably there is no obvious homology between the group-specific proteins encoded by different coronaviruses in fact in the case of the sars-cov several of these nonstructural proteins including the orf3a 7a 7b proteins have turned out to be structural huang et al 2006a ito et al 2005 schaecher et al 2007
several virus-encoded proteins are packaged into the virion including the nucleocapsid n the spike s glycoprotein the envelope e protein and the transmembrane m glycoprotein fig 1a in some strains of mhv and several other group 2 coronaviruses the envelope also contains a hemagglutinin-esterase he protein
 the s protein mediates attachment and fusion with the host cell is the target for neutralizing antibody and often the cellular immune response and has been shown to play a pivotal role in pathogenesis the n protein is intimately associated with the viral rna genome forms the basic structure of the helical nucleocapsid and has been shown to be involved in several aspects of genome replication masters 2006 masters and perlman 2013 shi and lai 2005 as the most abundant of all structural proteins in the virion the m protein is known to play a key role in assembly and particle formation through specific interaction with s godeke et al 2000 n hurst et al 2005 and possibly baudoux et al 1998 e proteins even though it is relatively underrepresented in the mature virus particle yu et al 1994 the e protein is also believed to play a role in virus assembly but is not absolutely required for this process kuo and masters 2003 in addition the e protein forms pentameric bundles within lipid bi-layers that have cation-selective ion channel activity wilson et al 2006 while the function of the he is not fully understood this protein possesses esterase activity vlasak et al 1988a and is not required for virus replication in tissue culture cells de haan et al 2002 schwarz et al 1990 however recent evidence suggests that the he

accessory proteins fig 1b are not individually required for growth in tissue culture cells vlasak et al 1988a however deletion of all accessory genes from mhv attenuates the virus in vitro and in vivo de haan et al 2002 although deletion of individual 3 accessory proteins has little effect on virus replication in tissue culture their conservation within the species suggests that the accessory proteins play important roles in modulating the host immune response or general host cellular processes in vivo with regard to pathogenesis some accessory proteins appear dispensable while others alone or in combination are critical for replication in the intact animal for example deletion of the orf4 gene in mhvjhm does not affect lethality ontiveros et al 2003 while mutation or deletion of the orf2a gene did not affect growth in tissue culture cells but attenuated replication in mice schwarz et al 1990 sperry et al 2005 a recent study has shown that orf2a has 25-phosphodiesterase activity which prevents the activation of cellular rnase l thereby preventing the degradation of viral rna zhao et al 2012 this antagonism of the interferon response promotes hepatitis in mhv-a59 infected mice but does not seem to affect brain pathology zhao et al 2012 as the protein ns4 of mhvjhm has not been detected in infected cells its function remains unknown the ns5 protein also has unknown functions but may antagonize the interferon response koetzner et al 2010neurotropic members of the coronaviridae family utilize both host cell proteins and host cell carbohydrates as receptors for binding and entry reviewed in masters 2006 mhv infection of host cells involves specific interaction of the s glycoprotein with a proteinaceous host cell receptor carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule ceacam- 1a williams et al 1991 however the pregnancy-specific glycoprotein  psg and other isoforms of ceacam have also been shown to serve as a receptor for some strains of mhv while psg is expressed at high levels in the cns chen et al 1995 only ceacam- 1a has been definitely proven to be the receptor used in mice hemmila et al 2004 the s protein consists of two functional domains the s1 domain is responsible for host cell receptor binding and is prone to mutation while the s2 domain mediates fusion with the host cell membrane and is more conserved between mhv strains the receptor-binding domain of the mhv s protein is present within residues 1330 of the protein kubo et al 1994 suzuki and taguchi 1996 taguchi et al 1995 but the precise location of the fusion domain within the s protein remains controversial in many strains of mhv cleavage of s into s1 and s2 domains is mediated by a furin-like enzyme and occurs during virus egress frana et al 1985 however for some coronaviruses including mhv-2 and sars-cov virion s protein is not cleaved during virus egress but is cleaved in low ph endosomes by cathepsin huang et al 2006b the ligation of ceacam- 1a induces conformational changes between the s1 and s2 domains which ultimately triggers fusion of the viral and host cell membranes virus entry can occur through one of two mechanisms the viral envelope can fuse at neutral ph with the plasma membrane of the host cell resulting in the uncoating and release of the viral genomic rna into the cytoplasm alternatively virus can be taken up into endocytic vesicles where s protein is cleaved followed by fusion of the viral envelope and host vesicle membranes with subsequent release of the genomic rna into the cytoplasm the latter process occurs at acidic ph and is inhibited by lysosomotropic agents such as chloroquine kooi et al 1991 nash and buchmeier 1997 the replication life cycle of mhv like all coronaviruses is believed to take place entirely within the host cell cytoplasm reviewed in masters 2006for hcov-oc43 cellular binding and entry involves ligation of the s protein to sialidated carbohydrate moieties on the surface of cells vlasak et al 1988b while for sars-cov entry requires binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme ace2 li et al 2003 as with mhv entry of sars-cov mers or hcov-oc43 involves conformational changes in the s protein cleavage by one of several identified proteases and functional activation of the fusogenic s2 domain fusion of sars-cov and mers has been more characterized than fusion of mhv reviewed in millet and whittaker 2014because the genomes of coronaviruses are 5 capped and polyadenylated rna replication begins immediately after virus entry via direct translation of the genome by host cell machinery fig 2 the translation of the viral rna genome results in the generation of two large polyproteins pp1a 450500 kda and pp1ab 750800 kda the translation of the second is a result of a 1 ribosomal frame shift at a pseudoknot structure during translation of orf1a brierley et al 1989 the polyprotein is processed into component proteins by at least two different viral proteases a papain-like proteinase and a second proteinase with some properties similar to those of the picornavirus 3c protease mpro in addition to a viral rdrp and helicase coronaviruses encode several novel proteins including a uridylate-specific endoribonuclease nendou a 3 to 5 exoribonuclease exon and a 2-o-ribose methyltransferase which are likely critical for viral rna synthesis the 3c- and papain-like proteinases auto-process the large polyproteins either during or after translation ziebuhr et al 2000 sixteen total proteins are generated from the two large polyproteins nsp1-16 eight of which are predicted to have enzymatic activity reviewed in weiss and leibowitz 2011 interestingly while many of the described functions of nsp1-16 are common to rna viruses and are clearly important for virus replication or transcription several others are wholly unique to coronaviruses and may play important roles in modulating cellular processes snijder et al 2003 for example the viral 2-o-ribose methyltransferase is important in immune evasion daffis et al 2010
the replication of viral rna is critically dependent on key cis-acting sequence elements present at both the 5 and 3 ends of the genome and within the genome lai and cavanagh 1997 masters 2006 sawicki et al 2007 see below the viral rdrp initiates negative-strand synthesis via recognition of signals at the 3 end of the rna genome interestingly this process can be continuous resulting in genome-length negative-strand molecules or discontinuous resulting in the generation of a nested set of subgenomic negative-strand templates transcription fig 2 genome-length negative strands serve as template for rdrp-mediated synthesis of positive-strand genome-length rna that eventually is packaged into new virionsin addition to the elements required for replication cis-acting elements within the genomic sequence termed transcription-regulating sequences  trs  are required for transcription trs elements are located in the 5 leader sequence and in front of each orf fig 1b as described above negative-strand synthesis can be discontinuous resulting in subgenomic-length rna molecules it is generally believed that subgenomic rna is produced during negative rna synthesis sawicki et al 2007 during negative-strand synthesis elongation by viral rdrp proceeds from the 3 end of the positive-strand genome until the first functional trs sequence at this point via mechanisms that are unclear the rdrp either continues to elongate to generate genome-length negative-strand rna or dissociates from the positive strand relocates to the 5 end of the positive strand and reinitiates elongation of the nascent negative strand with subsequent incorporation of the 5 antileader sequence the newly synthesized negative-strand rna with 5 leader incorporated then serves as template for subgenomic-length mrna synthesis the subgenomic mrnas are subsequently translated via host cell machinery into structural and nonstructural proteinsafter translation by host cell machinery key structural proteins including e and m traffic to and assemble on intracellular membranes located in the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi regions vennema et al 1996 the s protein also co-localizes at these sites of e and m accumulation and has a more disperse distribution throughout the cell full-length genomic rna is encapsidated by the n protein via specific binding between n or m and a packaging signal present on viral genomic but not subgenomic rna located in gene 1 molenkamp and spaan 1997 narayanan et al 2003 deletion of this packaging signal results in subgenomic rna incorporation into the virion and loss of selective advantage for the virus kuo and masters 2013 virus assembly thought to be driven by both host- and virus-specific factors occurs in the ergic but the details are not fully understood virus egress occurs when the particles are released from the cell probably at least in part through host cell secretory processes similar to exopinocytosismechanisms of transmission vary among the coronaviruses for naturally occurring enteric strains of mhv virus is transmitted via the fecaloral route compton et al 1993 enteric strains of mhv are highly contagious and once introduced into a mouse colony virus spreads rapidly eventually infecting all mice eradication of the virus from a colony is essentially impossible and generally requires the destruction of the colony neurotropic strains of mhv such as mhvjhm do not spread to uninfected animals even those within the same cage even though these strains are highly virulent for respiratory coronaviruses including hcov-oc43 hcov-229e mers-cov and sars-cov virus is spread via large droplets and contact additionally sars-cov is detected in the feces and may have spread via the fecal-oral route during the 20022003 epidemic peiris et al 2003b the relative transmissibility of human respiratoryenteric coronaviruses is not precisely known but epidemiologic studies of the sars outbreak of 20022003 suggest that aerosol transmission of sars-cov is not very efficient but is most important during superspreading events and when patients are undergoing aerosol-generating procedures sars-cov was almost always transmitted from patients after they developed clinical signs lipsitch et al 2003 peiris et al 2004like all rna viruses the coronavirus rna-dependent rna polymerases lack proofreading activity therefore these viruses exist as a quasi-species with several variants present in the population at any given time for some coronaviruses the result of this rapid ability to evolve is manifested by the ability to cross-species with rapid adaptation to growth within the new host this has been illustrated in in vitro studies in which mhv was shown to readily adapt to the use of alternate receptors baric et al 1997 1999 schickli et al 1997 2004 thackray and holmes 2004 in addition sars-cov crossed species from chinese horseshoe bats to infect animals such as the himalayan palm civet and chinese ferret badger which in turn led to infection of humans guan et al 2003 lau et al 2005 li et al 2005 similarly mers-cov is thought to have originated in bats wang et al 2014 with camels as an intermediate host hemida et al 2014 in fact mers-cov can infect cells from a wide array of animal species barlan et al 2014 raj et al 2013 lastly bovine coronavirus  bcov and hcov-oc43 are very closely related and careful genetic analyses suggested that the virus crossed species about 100 years ago vijgen et al 2005 thus at least for some coronaviruses there is a substantial body of evidence that suggests interspecies transmission can occur both in the laboratory and in natural infectionsinterestingly not all cells that express ceacam- 1a support productive infection and replication of mhv and cells that support replication may have very low levels of receptor on their surface the best example of the former phenomenon is the inability of mhv to productively infect b-cells despite very high surface expression levels of ceacam- 1a morales et al 2001 in addition mhv replicates efficiently in the cns of mice despite extremely low levels of ceacam- 1a mrna and protein expression in this tissue godfraind et al 1995 1997 nakagaki et al 2005 these observations suggest that virus or host cellular factors other than ceacam- 1a also contribute to productive infection and other data indicates that mhv can spread in cns-derived cells independent of ceacam- 1a expression gallagher et al 1992 nash and buchmeier 1996 this phenomenon occurs only with highly fusogenic strains of mhv jhm and only when the s protein is expressed on the surface of cells it is postulated that s1 is released from the s protein when expressed on the surface exposing the fusogenic s2 fragment if an uninfected cell is in close proximity virus may spread even in the absence of specific receptor in fact virus spreads in a receptor-independent manner in the cns of ceacam1a knockout mice miura et al 2008resident cns cell types that support mhv-a59
and mhvjhm replication include neurons microglia astrocytes and oligodendrocytes importantly the relatively more neurovirulent strains such as mhvjhm exhibit an enhanced ability to infect and replicate in neurons fleming et al 1986 as discussed below the infection of neurons and astrocytes may directly contribute to virus persistence in the cns as these cell types do not express similar levels of major histocompatibility complex mhc class i or class ii antigen as compared to other tissues aloisi et al 2000 fabry et al 1994 hickey 2001spread of the virus within the cns has been studied extensively in models of intracranial inoculation virus appears to first infect ependymal cells in the brain and spinal cord wang et al 1992b here the virus replicates rapidly and then migrates into the brain and spinal cord parenchyma in the parenchyma several cell types support replication of mhv including astrocytes macrophages microglia and oligodendrocytes in contrast to intracranial inoculation after intranasal inoculation mhv first infects and replicates in the olfactory nerve and bulb and then spreads transneuronally to infect distal parts of the brain that are linked through neuroanatomic connections of the main olfactory bulb mob barnett et al 1993 lavi et al 1988 the virus disseminates via retrograde spread along axonal tracts to the spinal cord barnett et al 1993 eventual spread of the virus to the white matter and infection of oligodendrocytes in the spinal cord likely involves infection of astrocytes a cell type readily infected in vitro and in vivo sun and perlman 1995 astrocytes are intimately associated with neurons in the gray matter and with oligodendrocytes and neurons in the white matter demyelination occurs when the host immune response attempts to clear virus from this site of infectioninfection with virulent mhvjhm results in acute encephalitis with extensive neuronal infection lampert et al 1973 weiner 1973 this disease is similar to acute encephalitis caused by several other virulent viruses and has not been extensively characterized while the precise mechanisms by which mhvjhm causes death in acutely infected hosts remain unclear it is likely that rapid replication and broad cell-type tropism of the more virulent strains of mhv contribute to general neurologic dysfunction widespread apoptosis in cns-resident cells is not generally observed after acute mhvjhm-induced encephalitis phillips et al 2002 wu and perlman 1999 however the extent to which direct virus destruction of infected cells contributes to the death of the mouse is unknown and recent data suggest that this disease like the chronic demyelinating disease may also be partly immune-mediatedinfection of the cns by virulent mhvjhm results in rapidly lethal encephalitis in the majority of mice however in mice protected by antivirus antibody or t-cells or in mice infected with the less virulent variant 22-v-1 a variable percentage of mice survive the acute phase of infection and exhibit chronic disease characterized by hind limb paralysis and demyelination of the spinal cord fleming et al 1986 the virus replicates at high titers during the acute phase with replication peaking at approximately 5 days post-infection pi in mice that survive the acute disease the virus cannot be recovered from mice beyond approximately 2 weeks pi but virus antigen and rna can be identified in the cns out to 1 year post infection adami et al 1995 de aquino et al 2014 lavi et al 1984a rowe et al 1997 zhao et al 2009 as virus replication increases in the cns the integrity of the bloodbrain barrier bbb is disturbed such that host inflammatory cells are now able to enter the cns zhou et al 2003 interestingly the infiltration of inflammatory cells coincides with the onset of clinical disease chronic inflammatory changes in the spinal cord of mice likely result in ongoing clinical disease and the progression of demyelinationseveral factors likely contribute to the ability of mhv to persist in the cns of experimentally infected mice first several target cells of mhv infection in the mouse cns eg astrocytes oligodendroglia and neurons do not express high levels of mhc class i or mhc class ii antigen in the absence of injury aloisi et al 2000 fabry et al 1994 hickey 2001 malone et al 2008 thus by virtue of the cellular tropism of the virus persistently infected cells may not serve as targets for virus-specific cytotoxic cd8 t-cells ctl that enter the cns on the other hand virus-specific cd8 t-cells do become activated and traffic to the cns of infected mice and the ability of ctl to recognize and eliminate infected target cells is inferred from the analyses of mhv-infected antibody-protected suckling mice model described below perlman and pewe 1998 second the brain is a tissue subject to minimal immune surveillance hickey 2001 ransohoff and engelhardt 2012 ransohoff et al 2003 so virus could replicate for longer periods of time and to higher titers while remaining undetected third as both macrophages and microglia can be infected by mhv and both are critical antigen-presenting cells in the cns direct infection of these cells might influence the overall presentation of virus-specific antigens in the cns in support of this possibility mhv infects both macrophages and dendritic cells in vitro and infection of these cells results in diminished ability to activate virus-specific cd8 t-cells turner et al 2004 zhou et al 2003 interestingly cns infection results in downregulation of ceacam- 1a receptor expression on macrophages and microglia ramakrishna et al 2004 ceacam- 1a downregulation was specifically linked to the infiltration of cd4 t-cells it is not known whether this phenomenon is strictly mhv-specific or whether this also occurs during infection of the cns with other neurotropic viruses however it is postulated that this phenomenon may contribute to mhv persistence via retargeting of the virus to other cell types or by limiting t-cell activation in the cns finally prolonged infection of the cns results in a loss of effector function by cd8 t-cells mhvjhm-specific cd8 t-cells isolated from the persistently infected cns still express cytokines such as interferon-gamma ifn- on exposure to antigen directly ex vivo but no longer are able to lyse infected targets bergmann et al 1999in addition to infecting mice mhv is also capable of infecting and replicating in the cns of rats barac-latas et al 1997 nagashima et al 1978 sorensen et al 1980 watanabe et al 1987 hamsters cheever et al 1949 and nonhuman primates murray et al 1992 while infection of monkeys can result in mhv-induced demyelinating disease the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not been systematically examined in contrast much more is known about mhv-induced disease in rats infection generally results in fatal encephalitis in both suckling lewis rats and suckling outbred animals however a percentage of rats do survive the acute disease infection of weanling rats results in variable disease but infectious mhv can be recovered from all symptomatic animals disease in symptomatic animals is characterized by demyelination of the optic nerve brainstem and spinal cord manifesting clinically as hind limb paralysis in rats that remain asymptomatic virus is neither recovered nor is there evidence of demyelination out to 60 days post-infection in one study the adoptive transfer of myelin-reactive t-cells from mhv-infected rats to nave rats resulted in widespread cns inflammation in the absence of demyelination watanabe et al 1983 this is the only example suggesting that an autoimmune process contributes to demyelination in mhv-infected animals brown norway rats
are also susceptible to mhv infection but these rats remain asymptomatic with evidence of subclinical levels of demyelination schwender et al 1991 and little evidence for virus persistence or continued replication watanabe et al 1987 the lack of clinical disease in brown norway rats is believed to be due to an effective antiviral neutralizing antibody response the role of antiviral antibody responses in acute and chronic encephalitis is discussed in detail belowit is well established that the s protein of coronaviruses dictates species specificity and cell tropism additionally a large body of evidence also suggests that the s protein influences pathogenesis and neurovirulence of mhv presumably by altering cellular tropism fleming et al 1986 parker et al 1989 phillips et al 2002 or efficiency of spread ontiveros et al 2003 phillips et al 2002 within the cns studies indicate that alterations in the s protein can also influence the nature and magnitude of the host innate and adaptive immune responses macnamara et al 2005 phillips et al 2002 rempel et al 2004 the direct link between sequence changes in the s protein and altered neurovirulence stems from several analyses initial studies with viruses such as 22-v-1 showed that diminished disease severity correlated with mutation in the s glycoprotein fleming et al 1986 a recombinant variant of mhv-a59 was engineered to express the mhvjhm s glycoprotein navas and weiss 2003 phillips et al 1999 this recombinant virus was nearly as virulent as parental mhvjhm manifested by increased infection of neurons and did not exhibit the hepatotropism of mhv-a59key insight into the host-specific factors that mediate demyelination during acute and chronic infection comes from studies of mice that are genetically manipulated to abrogate some aspect of immune function or in which a key cell or cytokinechemokine is depleted with neutralizing antibody these systems have included the use of lethally irradiated mice and scid or rag1-deficient mice inoculation of any of these mice with 22-v-1 results in acute and chronic encephalitis in the absence of demyelination of the spinal cord houtman and fleming 1996a wang et al 1990 wu and perlman 1999 however reconstitution of these mice with splenocytes results in the rapid development of demyelination demyelination is most reproducible when cells are transferred from mhvjhm-immune mice transferred hyperimmune mhvjhm-specific serum is able to mediate demyelination in mhvjhm-infected rag1 mice although not as robustly as virus-specific t-cells houtman and fleming also showed that when mice lacking cd4 or cd8 t-cells were infected demyelination developed showing that neither cell type is required for this process houtman and fleming 1996a subsequent work showed that several components of both the innate and adaptive immune system could mediate demyelination in the brains and spinal cords of these immunodeficient recipient mice for example in one study kim kim and perlman 2005a used targeted recombination to generate a virus recombinant version of 22-v-1 that expressed the macrophage chemoattractant mcp1ccl2 virus-derived ccl2 in the absence of any antiviral t-cells or antibody was sufficient to induce demyelination in the spinal cord while demyelination via immune- or virus-mediated destruction of oligodendrocytes is considered to be primary not secondary to axonal damage t-cell-mediated damage of axons has been observed concomitant with demyelination although not proven this process is probably cytokine-mediated dandekar et al 2001 of note similar findings are observed in the cns of ms patients and contribute to long-term irreversible disability trapp et al 1998 the cells and effector molecules that have been identified as playing a critical role in virus-induced demyelination are summarized in fig 3 activated macrophagesmicroglia are a common feature of mhv-induced immune-mediated demyelination as well as active lesions in patients with ms suggesting that these cells may actually serve as the final effectors of this process macrophages enter the cns as inflammatory monocytes and mature in situ maturation is characterized by the downregulation of ly6c and the upregulation of cd11c a molecule usually used to define dendritic cells in this instance it is not clear whether cd11c expression is involved in antigen presentation or if cd11c is only a maturation marker in support of the latter both cd11c and cd11c cells were found in proximity to areas of demyelination templeton et al 2008as mentioned above cxcl10 is another important chemokine in mhv-infected animals in contrast to a protective role during acute infection cxcl10 may play a pathogenic role during chronic mhv infection as in vivo neutralization of cxcl10 in chronically infected mice resulted in both reduced demyelination and clinical signs of neurologic dysfunction liu et al 2001 the elr chemokines are protective in both the acute and chronic phase through signaling of cxcr2 these cytokines protect oligodendrocytes from apoptosis and decrease demyelination as shown via cxcr2 neutralization hosking et al 2010collectively these results suggest that a pro-inflammatory milieu is present in the mhv-infected rag1 or scid cns but activated macrophages do not enter the spinal cord in the absence of an additional intervention anti-mhv t-cells or antibody or overexpression of a macrophage chemoattractant once this trigger is provided the process of demyelination is rapidly initiated often accompanied by worsened clinical disease thus macrophages serve as the final effectors of demyelination in mhv-infected mice demyelination occurs during the process of virus clearance in areas devoid of virus antigen a future research goal will be to determine how to maximize virus clearance without also causing myelinoligodendrocyte destructiondespite the robust innate immune response described above mhvjhm continues to replicate and spread declines in virus replication are only observed after the appearance of antiviral t-cells in the cns which begins by day 5 pi and peaks at approximately day 7 and day 9 pi for cd8 and cd4 t-cells respectively haring et al 2001 williamson and stohlman 1990 cd8 t-cells exert antiviral activity via direct and indirect mechanisms whereas cd4 t-cells are primarily responsible for augmenting the magnitude and quality of cd8 t-cell and b-cell responses phares et al 2012a b antiviral b-cells do not infiltrate the inflamed cns until approximately 23 weeks pi but several lines of evidence suggest that this arm of the adaptive response is critical in suppressing virus replication and spread and preventing virus recrudescence during the persistent phase of disease matthews et al 2001 ramakrishna et al 2002 as virus replication is controlled and infectious virus titers decrease so does the number of innate and adaptive immune cells however virus-specific t- and b-cells are retained at low levels in the cns of persistently infected mice marten et al 2000b zhao et al 2009infiltrating t-cells are largely mhvjhm-specific but it is now clear that infection also results in the recruitment and activation of virus-nonspecific bystander t-cells chen et al 2005 haring and perlman 2003 haring et al 2002 several lines of evidence suggest that efficient virus clearance is critically dependent on both cd8 and cd4 t-cells depletion of cd4 or cd8 t-cells prior to infection with mhvjhm or infection of mice deficient in cd4 or cd8 t-cells results in incomplete virus clearance and increased morbidity and mortality houtman and fleming 1996a williamson and stohlman 1990 while clearly important for virus clearance infiltrating cd8 and cd4 t-cells also appear to play a pathogenic role cd4 and cd8 t-cells can be detected in the cns of acutely encephalitic mice 12 days prior to the death of the animal concomitant with the onset of virus clearance consistent with but not proving a role in both virus clearance and immunopathological diseaseseveral cd8 t-cell epitopes have been discovered in mhv one dominant cd8 t-cell epitope located in a conserved region of the n protein has been identified in balbc mice this epitope n318 is h-2ld-restricted and encompasses residues n318-326 table 1 in c57bl6 b6 mice at least two immunodominant cd8 t-cell epitopes are recognized approximately 3050  of cd8 t-cells that infiltrate the b6 cns at the peak of the t-cell response specifically recognize the dominant epitope s510 h-2db-restricted s510-518 when measured by staining with mhc class i tetramer a second population of infiltrating cd8 t-cells is specific for a subdominant epitope s598 598-605 h-2kb-restricted both epitopes are derived from the hypervariable region of the s protein this region tolerates both deletions and mutations although deleted virus is usually attenuated dalziel et al 1986 fleming et al 1987 lavi et al 1990 parker et al 1989 wang et al 1992a
cd8 t-cells mediate virus clearance from astrocytes and microgliamacrophages largely by perforin-mediated cytolysis whereas clearance of virus from oligodendrocytes is primarily dependent upon ifn- expression lin et al 1997 parra et al 1999 cd8 t-cells are also capable of eliminating virus-infected cells via the faslfas pathway but this mode of clearance does not play a prominent role in clearance of mhv in vivo parra et al 2000 while direct cytolytic activity is a hallmark of cd8 t-cell effector function this activity must be carefully controlled in the cns to avoid destruction of neurons which are not generally replaceable as described above cytolytic activity is rapidly turned off in the infected cns possibly facilitating virus persistence bergmann et al 1999 marten et al 2000a bthe critical role for anti-mhv cd8 t-cells in virus clearance is illustrated by results obtained from analyses of infected suckling mice as described above infection of nave mice with highly neurovirulent mhvjhm is rapidly fatal however administration of antivirus antibody protects mice from mhvjhm but virus persists buchmeier et al 1984 in the suckling mouse experimental system suckling mice are infected at 10 days post-natal and are nursed by dams that were previously immunized with mhvjhm perlman et al 1987 maternal antibodies protect the mice from acute encephalitis and death however a variable percentage of survivors develop clinical signs of chronic disease hind limb paralysis by 38 weeks pi in each symptomatic mouse virus recovered from the brain and spinal cord is mutated in the immunodominant s510 cd8 t-cell epitope ctl escape variant virus thus immune pressure exerted by a vigorous cd8 t-cell response on mhvjhm-infected cells results in the selection of variant viruses that have undergone mutation in the immunodominant cd8 t-cell epitope pewe et al 1996 generally a single mutant is isolated from each animal with mutation detected in position 27 of the cd8 t-cell epitope that abrogates either binding to the mhc class i molecule or t-cell receptor binding the biological relevance of ctl escape in mhvjhm was demonstrated by showing that infection with the mutant viruses resulted in increased morbidity and mortality as compared to nave mice infected with wild-type virus pewe et al 1998 these results further underscore the notion that virus-specific cd8 t-cells are critical for controlling virus replication and that at least one cns-resident cell type required for virus maintenance or replication expresses mhc class i that ctl escape variant viruses can be recovered from mhvjhm-infected antibody-protected mice is of particular importance as ctl escape variants are generally only identified in humans infected with hiv or hcv or nonhuman primates infected with simian immunodeficiency virus reviewed in goulder and watkins 2004 therefore this mode of establishing a persistent mhvjhm infection has begun to provide key insight into the virus- and host-specific factors that influence the selection of ctl escape variant viruses including the relative contribution of antiviral antibody dandekar et al 2003 epitope immunodominance kim and perlman 2003 and virus fitness and t-cell functional avidity butler et al 2008a b for example the anti-mhv antibody response at the site of infection is critical for preventing the development of ctl escape variants ctl escape is rarely detected in balbb mice even though epitope s510 is recognized in this mouse strain because unlike b6 mice a large number of virus-specific antibody-secreting plasma cells are detected in the infected cns dandekar et al 2003during the persistent infection mhv-specific cd8 t-cells are retained in the cns at low levels and can be detected out to greater than 70 days pi bergmann et al 1999 marten et al 2000a b zhao et al 2009 these virus-specific t-cells are recruited from peripheral antigen-experienced and naive cells and retain the ability to degranulate and produce cytokines zhao et al 2009 in addition to dramatically influencing the clearance of mhv early after infection cd8 t-cells also play an important and varied role in mediating demyelination as described belowseveral mhv-derived cd4 t-cell epitopes are recognized in b6 and balbc mice table 2 b6 mice recognize at least three mhc class ii-restricted epitopes derived from the mhv m protein  m133 or the s protein s358 and s333 xue and perlman 1997 m133 is immunodominant in b6 mice with up to 25  of infiltrating cd4 t-cells exhibiting specificity for this epitope during the initial effector response haring et al 2001 zhao et al 2009 similarly mhv-derived mhc class ii-restricted epitopes have been identified in balbc mice in both the s protein s333 and the n protein n266 although neither elicits as strong a cd4 t-cell response as the m133 epitope van der veen 1996
virus-specific cd4 t-cells are important for mhv clearance in the absence of cd4 t-cells either by antibody-mediated depletion or through the use of mice genetically deficient in cd4 t-cells there is a marked delay in clearance of mhv from the cns houtman and fleming 1996a pearce et al 1994 sutherland et al 1997 williamson and stohlman 1990 also adoptive transfer of mhv-specific cd4 t-cell lines into infected mice or rats revealed that cd4 t-cells of multiple virus specificities could confer protection while a reduction in clinical signs of acute encephalitis was uniformly observed each virus-specific cd4 t-cell line exhibited variable effects on virus titers demyelination and cns inflammation erlich et al 1989 korner et al 1991 stohlman et al 1986 1988 yamaguchi et al 1991 while not experimentally examined these observations likely reflect differential production of cytokines altered trafficking to the cns or altered expansion by each unique cd4 t-cell clone upon activation in addition several studies reveal that cd4 t-cells are important mediators of mhv-induced demyelination during persistent infection described belowthe mechanisms by which cd4 t-cells contribute to virus clearance are not completely understood but likely involve release of pro-inflammatory cytokines most importantly ifn- which may promote antigen presentation by blood-borne and cns-resident cells bergmann et al 2006 furthermore depletion of cd4 t-cells correlated with decreased numbers of virus-specific cd8 t-cells infiltrating the brain parenchyma stohlman et al 1998 thus secretion of cytokines that serve as survival or accumulation factors for cd8 t-cells may also be a key effector function of virus-specific cd4 t-cells that infiltrate the mhv-infected cns although evidence for direct cytolytic activity of cd4 t-cells in vivo is lacking one study heemskerk et al 1995 demonstrated that virus-specific cd4 t-cells were able to lyse mhv-infected target cells in vitro moreover the adoptive transfer of these cells to mhv-infected mice protected them from fatal encephalitis heemskerk et al 1995 wijburg et al 1996 further analyses on mhv-induced cns disease in cd4-deficient mice revealed a role for cd4 t-cells in sustaining recruitment of macrophages and lymphocytes to the mhv-infected cns this lack of cd4 t-cells correlated with a decrease in the release of rantes a chemokine that has been shown to be critical for recruitment of leukocytes lane et al 2000similar to cd8 t-cells evidence suggests that virus-specific cd4 t-cells also contribute to pathology associated with mhv infection of the cns both during acute encephalitis and during persistent infection associated with demyelinating disease a pathogenic role for cd4 t-cells during acute encephalitis was demonstrated by using targeted recombination to generate a lacking the immunodominant cd4 t-cell epitope m133 infection of mice with this recombinant resulted in 100  survival in contrast to 100  mortality observed when mice were infected with wild-type virus anghelina et al 2006 introduction of a novel cd4 t-cell epitope into the variant virus reversed the phenotype resulting in 50  mortality the absence of this viral epitope had minimal effects on virulence in balbc mice in which the m133 epitope is not recognized together these results showed that the antivirus cd4 t-cell response and not some other factor caused more severe disease the ratio of mhv-specific effector cells to t-regulatory cells may be critical for these different outcomes as transfer of tregs decreased clinical disease and demyelination trandem et al 2010 interestingly virus-specific tregs exist and are even more suppressive compared to bulk tregs and inhibit pathogenic cd4 t-cell responses zhao et al 2014 these virus-specific tregs function in both the draining lymph nodes and site of infection the brain to reduce the m133-specific cd4 t-cell response and to a lesser extent the total anti-mhv cd4 t-cell response strikingly these cells express ifn- and tnf cytokines usually associated with a pro-inflammatory immune responsea substantial body of evidence suggests that cd4 t-cells also play a critical role in demyelination of the spinal cords of chronically infected mice and will be discussed belowas outlined above mhvjhm-induced demyelination is in large part immune-mediated as rag1 and scid mice do not develop demyelination in spite of high levels of virus replication in the cns and the presence of elevated levels of several pro-inflammatory molecules such as tnf mcp-1 ccl2 and ip-10cxcl10 haring et al 2001 houtman and fleming 1996b wang et al 1990 wu et al 2000a b wu and perlman 1999 initial experiments demonstrated that adoptive transfer of mhv-immune splenocytes to mhv-infected lethally irradiated mice results in both clinical and histological evidence of demyelination wang et al 1990 later similar results were obtained after transfer of splenocytes into infected scid or rag1 mice demyelination occurred with only modest reductions in virus titers dandekar et al 2003 pewe et al 2002 pewe and perlman 2002 wu et al 2000a wu and perlman 1999 both primary effector cells wu and perlman 1999 and memory t-cells bergmann et al 2004 are able to mediate demyelinationsubsequent analyses revealed that both mhvjhm-experienced cd4 and cd8 t-cells can mediate demyelination after adoptive transfer into mhv-infected immunodeficient mice however the mechanisms by which these two cell types mediate demyelination is markedly different as is the resulting clinical disease adoptive transfer of cd4 t-cell-enriched fractions resulted in severe clinical disease with mice presenting as moribund by 7 days post-transfer pewe et al 2002 sooner than is observed after transfer of undepleted splenocytes wu and perlman 1999 in contrast adoptive transfer of cd8 t-cell-enriched preparations resulted in widespread demyelination in the marked absence of severe clinical disease and only modest inflammation pewe and perlman 2002 in addition experiments using splenocytes isolated from mice deficient in ifn- tnf or perforin reveal several interesting features pewe et al 2002 pewe and perlman 2002 adoptive transfer of unfractionated splenocytes from ifn- perforin or tnf mice resulted in similar amounts of demyelination as observed after transfer of wild-type cells however the transfer of cd8 t-cell-enriched fractions from ifn- mice nearly completely abrogated demyelination pewe and perlman 2002 similar to the effect observed in mice with cd8 t cell-mediated eae huseby et al 2001 the transfer of ifn- cd4 t-cell-enriched fractions exacerbated demyelination and clinical disease pewe et al 2002 this enhanced histological and clinical disease paralleled findings in mice with cd4 t-cell-mediated eae in which more severe disease occurred in the absence of ifn- reflecting an enhanced neutrophil infiltrate into the cns tran et al 2000 in contrast to ifn- there were only modest reductions in demyelination after transfer of perforin or tnf cd8 cells pewe and perlman 2002 however transfer of cd4 t-cells from tnf resulted in milder disease with prolonged survival and only modest amounts of demyelination s perlman unpublished observations suggesting that tnf produced by cd4 t-cells exacerbated clinical disease the inflammatory response and demyelination these experiments illustrate the complexity of mhv-induced demyelination and show that the same effector molecule may have radically different effects depending upon whether cd4 or cd8 t-cells express itin addition to conventional  t-cells  t-cells are also able to mediate demyelination dandekar and perlman 2002 in mice that lack a thymus nude mice conventional  t-cell development is compromised however a subset of t-cells expressing the  tcr develop athymically in these mice nude mice infected with 22-v-1 develop hind limb paresisparalysis with histological evidence of demyelination of the spinal cord in these animals myelin destruction is mediated by  t-cells since depletion of these cells abrogates myelin destruction  t-cell-mediated demyelination like that mediated by  cd8 t-cells is dependent upon the expression of ifn-the critical role of antiviral antibody responses is best illustrated in 22-v-1-infected mice that lack either functional antibody  chain igm-deficient mt mice lin et al 1999 or in mice that lack mature b-cells jh locus-deficient jhd mice ramakrishna et al 2002 initial virus clearance was not significantly impaired in these mice however several weeks pi virus recrudescence replicates to high titers and eventually causes lethal encephalitis further experiments demonstrated a direct role for antibody in preventing re-emergence of virus as passive administration of antivirus antibody to these mice prevented recrudescence until antivirus antibody was cleared of note viruses that re-emerge in adult antibody-and b-cell-deficient mice exhibit no evidence of ctl escape in contrast to mhv-infected antibody-protected suckling miceanalysis of mhv-infected brown norway rats also demonstrates a critical role of antivirus antibodies in protection from acute encephalitis brown norway rats remain asymptomatic after challenge with virulent mhvjhm the presence of neutralizing antivirus antibody can be detected in the spinal fluid of these animals as early as 7 days pi which correlates with protection from acute encephalitis while these antibodies protect brown norway rats from acute mhvjhm-induced disease subclinical demyelination can be detected as late as 2 months pi watanabe et al 1987 the role of antibody in demyelinating disease is discussed belowrecent evidence suggests that autoantibodies could potentially have a role in mhv-induced cns pathology while not detected in wild-type mice transgenic mice engineered to express a cns-specific autoantibody develop enhanced disease with more severe encephalitis upon infection with mhv burrer et al 2007 whether autoantibody production occurs to a significant extent in mhvinfected nontransgenic mice remains unknownas discussed above passive administration of antivirus antibody also results in demyelinating disease in 22-v-1-infected rag1 mice antibody-mediated demyelination is dependent upon both complement and fc-activating receptors since demyelination occurs to a much lesser extent in fcr mice and after depletion of complement with cobra venom factor kim and perlman 2005bdue in part to the emergence of sars in 2002 and mers in 2012 and the continued potential for novel coronavirus emergence from zoonotic sources new emphasis has been placed on understanding both coronavirus-induced pathology and the host immunological response to coronavirus infections while much is known about the host-specific factors that contribute to demyelinating disease during persistent infection there still is much to be learned about the pathogenesis of coronavirus infection for example the relative contribution of antigen presentation within the cns by resident glial cells is largely unknown and an understanding of the impact of coronavirus infection of the cns on innate signaling events that eventually shape the adaptive immune response is incomplete how macrophages cause demyelination and what t-cells or antibody do to assist macrophage recognition of damaged myelin and what cytokines may be involved are other questions to be answered virus spread within this cns is also of interest how does virus cross synapses and does this require receptor expression also of interest are the differential effects of infection on astrocytes oligodendrocytes and neuronsdeveloping ways to combat virus replication during the acute phase of cns infection while simultaneously minimizing damage to the cns is an important and clinically relevant avenue of research it is clear that the cells of the immune system that function to clear virus also contribute to morbidity of coronavirus-infected mice one surprising observation has been that memory cd4 t-cells play an important role in modulating disease outcome during the acute infection thus understanding the difference between effector and memory cd4 t-cells and the mechanisms of memory cd4 t-cell function in the acutely infected cns will be of particular interest as memory cd4 t-cells may also have broadly protective roles in encephalitides including human encephalitisin addition continued work on how virus-specific factors contribute to acute and chronic encephalitis and on the curious predilection of coronaviruses to infect the cns will enable development of therapeutic and prophylactic interventions these strategies will likely provide novel strategies and new tools to modulate virus infection within the acutely infected cns while minimizing damage to host tissuefoodborne diseases are rife in many regions of the world with at least 1 in 10 people falling ill yearly from consumption of contaminated food and 420 000 deaths occurring as a result according to the world health organisation who 2015 foodborne diseases have exerted pressure on medical services contributed to economic and political distress exacerbated malnutrition and led to human suffering there are several agents such as chemicals pathogens and parasites which may adulterate food at different points in the food production and preparation process allos et al 2004 many of these agents have been extensively characterized and investigated by numerous studies farber and peterkin 1991 zhao et al 2001 le loir et al 2003 ehling-schulz et al 2004 adzitey et al 2013 botana 2014 strategies and protocols to prevent occurrence and outbreak of foodborne diseases have been devised and implemented by many researchers regulatory bodies and governments however despite the considerable progress achieved scientifically foodborne diseases continue to occur representing a significant cause of morbidity and mortality globally mead et al 1999 murray et al 2013 although foodborne diseases are more common in developing countries particularly in africa and south east asia with specific groups of people such as children the immunocompromised pregnant and aged being particularly at risk foodborne diseases are not limited to these regions or groups of people who 2007 for instance according to the centres for disease control and prevention cdc between 2001 and 2009 there were 384 million episodes of domestically acquired foodborne gastroenteritis caused by unspecified agents in the united states alone cdc 2009 approximately 178 million acute gastroenteritis occurred and there were at least 473832 hospitalizations in the us each year and 215 779 hospitalizations caused by the 24 known gastroenteritis pathogens an estimated 5072 persons died of acute gastroenteritis each year of which 1498 deaths were caused by the 24 known foodborne pathogens scallan et al 2011 health canada 2011 estimates that 1113 million cases of foodborne illnesses occur in canada every yearalthough the conventional notion is that foodborne diseases typically originate from meat and poultry products vegetables and fruits have been implicated in various foodborne outbreaks westrell et al 2009 lynch et al 2009 european food safety authority efsa 2013 a significant increase in foodborne disease outbreaks or cases associated with consumption of fresh produce has been reported this increase has been largely due to a general increase in produce consumption globalization of the produce industry and more effective surveillance tauxe et al 1997 lederberg et al 2003 havelaar et al 2010 increased consumption of fresh produce is likely due to global government efforts to promote healthy eating the associated health-promoting benefits of consuming fresh produce and ease of access to fresh local produce pollack 2001 regmi 2001 berger et al 2010 painter 2013 since fresh produce is mostly eaten raw or after minimal processing pathogen contamination constitutes a potential health risk callejn et al 2015 li et al 2017 there are numerous factors capable of compromising the microbiological integrity of produce along the farm to fork continuum all of which have potentially fatal outcomes however pre-harvest hazards to produce have been recognized as important because usually once pathogen contamination is established in the field it can be challenging to decontaminate produce there are numerous circumstances that can undermine the safety of produce on farms many of these arise because agriculture has grown more intensive over the years and produce fields are often located near animal production zones thus entwining the ecological connections between wild animals livestock and produce strawn et al 2013a strawn et al 2013b this in many cases predisposes fruits and vegetables to pre-harvest hazards some important pre-harvest hazard sources to produce include the use of contaminated soil irrigation water and manure for produce cultivation wild animals and insects have also been implicated as vehicles of pathogens to produceto ensure produce safety on a sustainable scale it is imperative to correctly understand the routes of entry fate transport establishment and survival of pathogens in the agricultural environment such as soil irrigation water and manure the knowledge gap in this regard is being filled rapidly as many studies have attempted to explain the behavior of foodborne pathogens in agricultural media and describe the associations among pathogens produce and the agrarian environment in this review the extent of the produce contamination problem is discussed as well as the sources and routes of contamination of soil irrigation water fruits and vegetables also the various mechanisms and strategies through which bacterial pathogens become established on fruits and vegetables are briefly examinedthe nutritional and health benefits of consuming fruits and vegetables have been recognized and widely publicized this has elicited changes in human dietary habits with many consumers incorporating more fruits and vegetables into their meals consequently the global production of fruits and vegetables has surged exponentially in recent decades the increased demand for produce has led to modifications such as increased use of soil amendments utilization of alternative water sources and increased imports and exports in agriculture-spanning across agronomic practices processing preservation packaging distribution and marketing beuchat 2002 some of these modifications however have great potential to compromise the safety of fruits and vegetables the biological hazards that are most relevant to fresh produce safety are either zoonotic or human in origin and can be classified into spore-forming bacteria non-spore forming bacteria viruses parasites and prions james 2006 most studiessurveillance efforts have identified bacterial contaminants in produce-borne illness outbreaks there is therefore a disproportionately higher abundance of information regarding bacterial contamination in the literature this may be because bacterial species have in fact caused many more outbreaks but other microbial groups-viruses and parasites have been understudied the most commonly implicated etiologic agents are presented in table 1
 although data and information available on outbreaks associated with fresh produce are diverse and patchy the available research evidence indicates that the foodborne illness burden due to contaminated produce has increased in recent decades in the united states between 1996 and 2010 approximately 23 of total foodborne illness outbreaks were produce related jung et al 2014 in europe from 2007 to 2011 produce was linked with 10 of the outbreaks 35 of the hospitalizations and 46 of the deaths efsa 2017 in australia fresh produce was linked to 4 of all foodborne disease outbreaks informed from 2001 to 2005 lynch et al 2009 specific produce items are more commonly linked to foodborne illness incidents for example leafy greens such as lettuce and spinach as well as fresh herbs such as parsley and basil are conventional sources of bacterial infections world health organization 2008 berger et al 2010 denis et al 2016 berries green onions melons sprouted seeds and tomatoes are similarly high-level priority produce items olaimat and holley 2012 denis et al 2016 in the us between 2006 and 2014 16 of 68 multistate foodborne outbreaks were associated with vegetables cdc 2014 a list of recent produce-related outbreaks is presented in table 2
most industrialized nations especially the united states have extensive and exhaustive datasets indicating the magnitude of outbreaks the extent of severity and casualties incurred the implicated pathogen and produce item as well as documented preventive protocols to avoid future outbreaks unfortunately however the same is not true of many other countries especially african countries the majority of which are still grappling with other challenges and hence lack the resources to efficiently track and trace foodborne illness incidents who 2000many conventional foodborne detection methods are time consuming and laborious and advanced techniques have therefore been developed and optimized as alternatives to or for use in combination with these traditional techniques many of these are rapid sensitive reliable and standardized they can be categorized into nucleic acid based biosensor-based and immunological based methods croci et al 2008 adzitey et al 2013 law et al 2014 typical examples include simple polymerase chain reaction pcr multiplex pcr real-time pcr nucleic acid sequence-based amplification nasba loop-mediated isothermal amplification lamp and oligonucleotide dna microarray other examples are optical electrochemical and mass-based biosensors and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa and lateral flow immunoassay law et al 2014 gilchrist et al 2015 these advances in epidemiological investigation approaches and techniques have made it possible to explore the crucial associations between produce and pathogens in spite of this however prompt identification of implicated produce vehicles location or point of contamination in fresh produce associated outbreaks is still a significant challenge one prime constraint is the relatively short shelf life of fresh produce which is often discarded by the time an outbreak is identified strausbaugh and herwaldt 2000 lynch et al 2009 therefore most of the time the real source of contamination is not ascertained causing investigators to speculate or assume a source this is however dangerous because in addition to the possibility of being wrong there is empirical evidence that once a particular transmission pathway is identified repeated investigations are bound to be biased in causation lynch et al 2009 another important consideration is that usually outbreaks receive widespread attention if the event i has severe public health impacts ii is unusual or sudden in that the etiological agent andproduce type are unanticipated making the circumstances of the outbreak unique and iii poses a significant risk of international spread with consequences for international travel or trade invariably the smaller less significant outbreaks are never investigated more importantly foodborne illness incidents occur sporadically in populations and these cannot be captured in routine epidemiological surveillance or outbreak investigations scallan et al 2011 this means that the data available may not be a valid representation of the problem it is likely that the foodborne illness burden related to consumption of contaminated produce is still largely underestimatedthe use of organic materials such as livestock excreta slurries abattoir wastes sewage sludge as well as municipal and industrial waste treatment residuals as soil amendments is widespread avery et al 2005 goss et al 2013 although these serve as a cost-effective source of nutrients for agricultural purposes research demonstrates that raw manure as well as contaminated or improperly treated manure constitute a significant risk of pathogenic contamination for produce james 2006 manyi-loh et al 2016 public health relevant bacteria viruses and parasites such as e coli o157h7 salmonella spp l monocytogenes campylobacter spp porcine enteroviruses bovine coronavirus bovine virus diarrhoea cryptosporidium parvum and giardia have been isolated from rawpoorly treated manure derbyshire 1973 derbyshire and brown 1978 sellers 1981 strauch 1991 pell 1997 grewal et al 2006 pathogens may be spread through direct interaction of vegetable surfaces with manure or by splashing of contaminated soilmanure particles from the soil on vegetables via rainfall andoverhead irrigation or by vectors additionally manure piles stored next to growing areas may constitute contamination risk due to run-off james 2006 warriner et al 2009manure application could be by broadcasting as a solid semi-solid or liquid throughout the field or by the introduction of livestock or wildlife feces at distinct locations jung et al 2014 in many parts of the world organic cultivation systems use more manure than conventional growers and chemical treatment against pathogens is prohibited in organic farming there have thus been some assertions that organic produce represents a more significant safety risk than its non-organic counterpart although there is no unequivocal research evidence supporting this claim johannessen et al 2005 loncarevic et al 2005 warriner et al 2009 ivey 2011 maffei et al 2016the survival of pathogens in manure and biosolids depends on factors such as the manure source production process and characteristics treatment technique applied physicochemical factors like ph and relative humidity incidence of antagonists or predators weather conditions desiccation aeration soil type degree of manure incorporation amongst others ingham et al 2004 wood 2013 table 3
 the manure composition which is determined in large part by the feed formulation dictates the profile of pathogens occurring in manure as well as their ability to persist even post-treatment franz et al 2005 certain workers have proposed that cattle diet may influence the incidence of representative bacterial species e coli o157h7 and salmonella in manure these pathogens have been reported to persist longer in manure obtained from cattle fed diets rich in energy but low in fiber content such as high digestible grass silage and maize silage compared to animals that received diets with low energy and higher fiber content such as straw franz and van bruggen 2008 it has also been suggested that feeding cattle with hay may significantly reduce shedding of acid-resistant e coli diez-gonzalez et al 1998 franz and van bruggen 2008 how effective these strategies are in reducing pathogen load in animal-derived manure is however not clearmanure treatment techniques such as composting aerobic and anaerobic digestion pelleting alkaline stabilization conditioning dewatering and heat drying have been used to treat manure before application as fertilizer for a long time while many of them are reasonably efficient concerns have been raised about their ability to satisfactorily eliminate pathogenic bacteria day and funk 2002 lu et al 2012 lorin et al 2016 tailing of pathogen inactivation curves as well as apparent regrowth or recontamination of bacteria after treatment have been reported many pathogens have been shown to be capable of withstanding manure treatment processes thereby constituting a major risk of contamination brackett 1999 composting is a popular manure treatment and composting temperatures that exceed 55 c for three days are considered sufficient to kill most pathogens grewal et al 2006 however few studies have demonstrated that the heat-induced death of bacteria in composted materials is a complex phenomenon ingham et al 2004 gupta 2012 bacterial regrowth and recontamination in cooled compost have been reported hassen et al 2001 ingham et al 2004 pelletizing is another common treatment available and is commonly applied to chicken manure chicken manure pellets pelletizing the manure reduces the off-odor and facilitates transport and storage although the process usually involves a thermal procedure more studies are required to validate whether the process efficiently inactivates clinically relevant pathogens chen and jiang 2014 jung et al 2014 the use of a fish emulsion as fertilizer has raised similar concerns although most preparation methods available include a thermal process the ability of this to inactivate enteric bacteria and viruses needs to be rigorously validated jung et al 2014due to the diverse range of variables associated with manure composition treatment pre-application storage application and incorporation regulatory bodies have stipulated minimum manure-to-harvest time intervals necessary to ensure microbiological safety the united states department of agriculture usda organic production and handling specifies that unless composted raw animal manure must be incorporated into the soil not less than 120 days prior to harvest of a product whose edible portion has direct contact with the soil surface or soil particles or 90 days if there is no direct contact usda 2015 canadian authorities specify 3 15 and 12 months for tree fruits and grapes small fruits and vegetables respectively as the minimum time delay between manure application and harvest for these crops olaimat and holley 2012there are several types of irrigation systems available each of which is typically complex and has its own drawbacks most irrigation systems create complicated ecological environments with multiple potential sources and routes of pathogenic contamination pachepsky et al 2011 each irrigation subsystem collection replenishment storage conveyance distribution off and on-farm as well as on-farm application involve processes that have great potential to compromise the microbiological integrity of the irrigation water in unique ways during transportation from the source to the field water is susceptible to significant microbiological depreciation pachepsky et al 2011 the prevailing deterioration dynamic will depend on the transportation mode for instance irrigation water transport via irrigation ditches and canals involves interaction with microbial reservoirs of bottom sediments bank soils algae and periphyton whereas water transport via pipes involves interactions with biofilms in the transport pipes jjemba et al 2010 pachepsky et al 2014 this sort of contamination is particularly prominent in reclaimed water distribution systems jjemba et al 2010 weinrich et al 2010 the method of storage for irrigation water can have a profound effect on pathogen transmission for example certain studies have demonstrated that water quality is rapidly degraded in storage ponds and tanks due to inputs from avian species or other wildlife field and samadpour 2007 mclain and williams 2008 higgins et al 2009 other storage systems such as check dams impoundments inter-basin transfer schemes abstraction schemes and reservoirs have been identified as places where indicator and pathogenic microorganisms can survive and proliferate abbasi 2001 kirubel 2015 the mode of application also has significant impacts on the risk of microbiological contamination berger et al 2010 compared with furrow and subsurface drip irrigation systems sprinkler irrigation poses a higher risk of microbiological contamination kisluk and yaron 2012 pachepsky et al 2014 surface furrow and drip irrigation systems minimize contact between edible portions of certain plants leafy vegetables provide larger surface area for contact and possible microbial attachment and irrigation water directorate 2002 fonseca et al 2011 mei soon et al 2012 uyttendaele et al 2015 hydroponic growing systems also offer this advantage jung et al 2014 allende and monaghan 2015the irrigation application method has been determined to influence the internalization of some pathogens in produce such as spinach plants according to some studies the likelihood of internalizing pathogens increases when the organisms are introduced by water sprinkling systems as opposed to when the water is directly applied to the soil solomon et al 2002 stine et al 2005 mitra et al 2009 warriner et al 2009 erickson et al 2010a kisluk and yaron 2012 zheng et al 2013 more details on pathogen internalization are provided in section 4 below depending on the geographical location the irrigation regime with respect to time of day season and harvest time may influence the likelihood of pathogenic contamination for example kisluk and yaron 2012 in a study conducted in haifa israel demonstrated that night-time irrigation and irrigation during the winter season is more likely to contaminate plants with enteric bacteria contaminated irrigation water poses the most significant risk when crops are irrigated close to harvest time because harvesting of produce containing viable pathogens is more likely therefore an adequate time interval between irrigation and harvest should be conscientiously followedthe microbial quality of irrigation water depends mostly on the source of the water in order of increasing risk of microbial contamination hazard irrigation water sources can be ranked as follows potable or rainwater deep groundwater shallow groundwater wells surface water and raw or inadequately treated wastewater james 2006 leifert et al 2008 pachepsky et al 2011 the microbial quality of rainwater or rain-harvested water is relatively good the quality and safety of use however depends largely on the collection transportation and storage means this can be illustrated with roof-harvested rainwater which may become contaminated with pathogenic bacteria and protozoan parasites because of the occurrence of animal droppings on roofs particularly immediately after relatively long periods of drought uyttendaele et al 2015 groundwater or borehole water is usually microbiologically safe except if it has been contaminated with surface runoff or other sources of contamination close to the aquifer certain farm operations such as intensive dairying and border-strip irrigation a type of surface irrigation which is a hybrid of level basin and furrow irrigation valipour et al 2015 lead to leaching of pathogens such as e coli and campylobacter to shallow groundwater thereby contaminating it close et al 2008 water from wells that are free from leaks and have sound casing are expected to be microbiologically safe factors such as the design of wells nature of the substrata depth to groundwater and rainfall may affect the microbial quality of good water james 2006 gerba 2009 surface waters which are the predominant source of irrigation waters in many countries including open canals ponds lakes rivers and streams are much more susceptible to pathogenic contamination compared to groundwater allende and monaghan 2015 uyttendaele et al 2015 sewage discharges septic tank contamination storm drains wild and livestock defecation run-off from contaminated fields industrial and municipal effluents can all potentially contaminate surface waters steele and odumeru 2004 james 2006 wastewater is usually of poor chemical and microbiological quality therefore it requires extensive treatment before it can be safely used to irrigate crops water sources other than rain used to irrigate produce is usually only minimally treated or untreated in many cases steele and odumeru 2004 jung et al 2014 it is expensive and time-consuming to treat irrigation water up to drinking water standards which is the ideal recommendation crook and surampalli 1996 forslund et al 2010although awareness of the potential dangers of using microbiologically compromised water for irrigation has increased in recent times scarcity of water resources in certain regions has contributed enormously to the use of sub-optimal supplementary irrigation water sources in such cases irrigation water represents a greater microbiological risk to produce sundstrm et al 2014 one of the most frequent pathogens implicated in water-related outbreaks is e coli o157h7 cdc 1999 hilborn et al 1999 the organism can survive for a protracted period in water even in deionized water depending on temperature conditions chalmers et al 2000 islam et al 2004a it also exhibits a remarkable ability to withstand extreme environmental conditions such as high acidity and extremely low-temperature conditionsthe ability of a pathogen to survive or persist in the environment and on produce is an essential determinant in the risk of human infection the actual risks associated with pathogens occurring in irrigation water depend on numerous variables including environmental conditions such as temperature ph and uv light santana et al 2014 other factors such as the excreted load of the pathogen its latency period before it becomes infectious its ability to efficiently multiply outside a mammalian host its infectious dose for humans inhibitory competition from the indigenous microflora as well as host response also play a relevant role steele and odumeru 2004 bacteria and viruses survive for lengthier periods in groundwater compared to surface water because groundwater tends to be cooler offers protection from sunlight and has less biological activity steele and odumeru 2004 these groups of microbes only typically last no longer than 45 and 15 days in surface water and sewage respectively conversely parasites eggscysts may survive for as long as 60 days or even several months in surface water and wastewater lefler and kott 1974 sagik et al 1978 bihn 2011 this suggests that pathogenic microorganisms are capable of surviving for extended periods which constitutes a profound threat to produce safety regardless of the source or route of exposure one potentially fatal consequence of pathogen contamination of irrigation water is the repeated inoculation of plants with the pathogens the fate and transport of these pathogens once introduced into the produce vary widely table 4 some pathogens are capable of adhesion to surfaces of produce while some others can rapidly internalize into plant tissues under certain conditions translocate and persist until consumed warriner et al 2003 bernstein et al 2007a doyle and erickson 2008 this has rendered many conventional processing and chemical sanitizing methods ineffectual hong and moorman 2005 and is a growing public health concernalthough the potential for produce contamination via irrigation water has been identified it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of the problem groves et al 2002 antwi-agyei et al 2015 despite the fact that numerous studies have linked poor microbiological quality of irrigation water with the incidence of human pathogens on fruits and vegetables direct evidence of irrigation water causing foodborne disease is relatively rare harris et al 2012 this is because a substantive cause-effect relationship is yet to be established as it is required that the same pathogenic strain is isolated from the patient produce and irrigation sources pachepsky et al 2011 furthermore there must be a clear sequence of events connecting patient produce and irrigation source steele and odumeru 2004 this is difficult to achieve due to certain limitations such as an inability to promptly identify the locations associated with produce contamination and delays inherent in foodborne outbreak investigations pachepsky et al 2011 in the absence of direct confirmation the cause-effect relationship can only be deduced based on circumstantial or subjective evidence pachepsky et al 2011 also it is apparent that there is no valid link between detected pathogen levels in irrigation waters and disease risk some studies have demonstrated a lack of correlation between pathogen prevalence in waters used for irrigation and disease incidence due to consumption of irrigated produce cooley et al 2007 mcegan et al 2013 mcegan et al 2014 there is an abundance of laboratory studies elucidating potential mechanisms of produce contamination from waterborne pathogens however field studies showing the exact process of produce contamination via this medium are relatively scarce it is thus expedient to generate more field data in this regardthe fate survival and recalcitrance of pathogens in soil depend on factors such as soil type soil moisture ph temperature nutrient availability agronomic practices as well as soil biological interactions table 5
 soil matric potential moisture levels is determined by soil properties and water inputs through precipitation andirrigation and has been demonstrated to be one of the most critical factors influencing microbial transport and survival in soil leifert et al 2008 cool moist environments are favorable for the survival of bacteria and viruses under dry soil conditions a reduction in bacterial and viral population densities are usually observed santamaria and toranzos 2003 ghorbani et al 2008 escherichia coli survival has been reported to be highest in organic soils under flooded conditions and peak populations recorded after a rise in the water-table accompanying significant rainfall events tate 1978 hagedorn et al 1978 rochelle-newall et al 2016 some pathogens such as streptococcus faecalis have been proven to thrive poorly under low soil moisture conditions kibbey et al 1978 jamieson et al 2002 cabral 2010 increased rates of virus inactivation at low soil moisture levels have been demonstrated yeager  obrien 1979 also decreased recovery of viral poliovirus type 1 and coxsackievirus b1 infectivity in dried soils was attributed to evaporation of soil water in the same study by yeager  obrien 1979 in addition experimentation by hurst et al 1978 correlated inactivation of enteroviruses echovirus type 7 strain wallace coxsackievirus b3 strain nancy and poliovirus type 1 strain lsc in sludge-amended soils with moisture loss in the sludge pilessoil ph influences microbial diversity and the biogeochemical processes which they mediate fierer and jackson 2006 nicol et al 2008 optimum ph for bacterial survival seems to be neutral but fungi are known to be more tolerant of acidic conditions compared to bacteria leahy and colwell 1990 amino acids most viruses behave as proteins have different pk values and so the ratio of positive to negative charges on proteins vary with ph yates et al 1985 in an experiment that lasted 170 days using poliovirus type 1 echovirus 7 echovirus 9 and coxsackie b3 viruses were detected up till the 110th  170th day at ph 75 while at ph 50 the viruses died off between the 25th and 60th day depending on virus type bagdasaryan 1964soil types vary depending on organic matter content water release characteristics particle size distribution and moisture retention capacity these variations significantly influence the survival of enteric pathogens in soil jamieson et al 2002 atkinson et al 2010 clay soils support the adsorption of microorganisms onto soil particles and this reduces microbial die-off rates reddy et al 1981 clays protect bacterial cells and possibly viral particles by creating a barrier against microbial predators and parasites santamaria and toranzos 2003 viruses which are mostly large proteins possessing various charges are capable of forming numerous bonds with clay minerals stotzky 1986 for example the survival of e coli is prolonged in clay soils where adsorption of cells to the soil particles protects it against protozoa mosaddeghi et al 2009 escherichia coli can persist for up to 25 weeks in clay and loam soils but for much less 8 weeks in sandy soils lang and smith 2007 results of a study that compared rotavirus survival in three soil fractions whole soil sand and clay at temperatures 4 25 and 37 c for 18 days showed least survival in sand fractions davidson et al 2013 in the absence of soil particles rotavirus survived best at 4 c with survival decreasing with an increase in temperature except in whole soil where it survived better over the entire temperature range and for more than a week at 37 c indicating that whole soil offered some protective effect davidson et al 2013 conversely though there is a report of shorter survival duration of enteroviruses poliovirus type 1 echovirus 7 echovirus 9 and coxsackie b3 in loamy soil than in sandy soil bagdasaryan 1964a link between higher organic matter content and enteric pathogen persistence has been established jamieson et al 2005 williamson et al 2005 leifert et al 2008 there is overwhelming research evidence in this regard seeing that many of the studies that compared the persistence of enteric pathogens in top and sub-soils recorded higher survival rates in topsoil zhai et al 1995 wang et al 2004 nyberg et al 2010 research has also shown higher pathogen levels in organic soils after manure application compared to sandy soils tate 1978 jamieson et al 2002 therefore the rates of pathogen survival are lower in sandy soils which have a low water-holding capacity mubiru et al 2000 erickson et al 2014alower temperatures are more suitable for bacterial and viral survival the ultraviolet radiation from the sun inactivates viruses on the surface of the soil but viruses in deeper soil strata are protected from this rodrguez-lzaro et al 2012 zablocki et al 2016 in loamy soil samples at ph 75 poliovirus and echovirus were recovered after 110130 days at 310 c compared to recovery 4090 days at 1823 c bagdasaryan 1964 similarly poliovirus type 1 and coxsackievirus b 1 pfu were recovered for up to 12 days at 37 c whereas pfu were recovered from soil for up to 180 days at 4 c temperature profiles tested were 4 22 and 37 c yeager  obrien 1979 the persistence of poliovirus in sludge-amended soil was assessed in a field study where appropriately cultivated and irrigated plots were treated with virus-spiked effluents by flooding this was done for 123 days spanning through spring summer and winter seasons poliovirus survived best during winter when it was detected after 96 days but during summer the longest survival period was 11 days tierney et al 1977 parasites seem to prefer warm temperature conditions prevalence of hookworms have been correlated to warm temperatures relatively high rainfall and low clay content sandy soils with clay content of less than 15 mabaso et al 2003nutrient availability is essential for the survival of microbes in the soil the presence of organic matter promotes the survival and in many cases the regrowth of enteric bacteria jamieson et al 2002 looney et al 2010 organic matter improves nutrient retention serves as carbon sources for bacterial species and enhances moisture retention gerba et al 1975 schoonover and crim 2015apart from environmental stress responses foreign enteric bacteria must compete with the endogenous microflora to become established in the soil environment jiang et al 2002 some autochthonous soil organisms have been shown to be resistant to newly introduced microorganisms in their environment ellis and mccalla 1976 also certain bacteriophage some protozoa nematodes and free-living soil organisms such as bdellovibrio can parasitize non-indigenous pathogens thereby limiting their survival klein and casida 1967 goss and richards 2008 additionally increased pathogen survival and regrowth in some instances in sterile soils and soils with relatively low biological activity has been reported gerba et al 1975 tate 1978 there is some research evidence that alien enteric pathogens compete poorly for nutrients and are thereby susceptible to inhibition by soil-borne bacteria jiang et al 2002 the effects that this has on the persistence of pathogens especially pathogens introduced via contamination in soil is however not yet fully understood the impacts that soil edaphic and biotic conditions have on the occurrence fate and persistence of microorganisms in soils should not be underestimated these factors can collectively or independently stifle or encourage foreign pathogens for instance members of listeria possess advantageous intrinsic factors such as an extensive repertoire of transport systems like phosphotransferase system and transcriptional regulators which makes them capable of successfully persisting in the soil ecosystem newell et al 2010 however these species are highly sensitive to extrinsic factors and this affects their ability to survive in soil environments newell et al 2010 locatelli et al 2013 although studies have been conducted on the occurrence of l monocytogenes in various ecological niches including soil more emphasis has been placed on the occurrence of listeria spp in fresh vegetables under storage conditions food processing and packaging environments the expression of genes and induction of proteins such as cold shock and cold acclimation proteins as well as tolerance for low ph and high salt concentration in these environments have received much research attention there is however need for more research to understand the dynamics of listeria survival in soilsagronomic practices such as soil improvement and manure application method influence the survival of pathogens in the soil table 5 soil improvement strategies inorganic and organic fertilizer compost biosolids and other residuals application significantly enhance the nutrient loads of soils diacono and montemurro 2010 in varying degrees these are important sources of primary nutrients such as n and p as well as secondary nutrients such as ca mg and s to the soil a ready supply of essential nutrients encourages the growth of pathogens compost application modifies the long-term soil conditions by increasing the ph steadily this therefore affects pathogen survival in soil weller 1988 sharma and reynnells 2016 bacteria tend to decline more rapidly when manure is applied superficially as opposed to when incorporated into the soil immediately after application solomon et al 2002 islam et al 2004a this is probably due to the elimination of drying conditions and exposure to uv at the soil surface schulze-makuch and irwin 2006 or because incorporation of manure disrupts macropores and boosts soil-bacteria contact jamieson et al 2002after manure application on land if applied manure is contaminated it is probable that the pathogens will move through the soil matrix either vertically or horizontally vertical movement of pathogens through the soil is influenced by the amount and intensity of rainfall climatic conditions as well as the season of application horizontal movement is known to be influenced by soil type moisture levels temperature microbial activity transport through plant roots rainfall patterns soil ph amongst other biophysical factors it is however apparent that water flow is the most important dispersal factor for percolation of manure-derived pathogens in soils regardless of type and structure although more quantitative information regarding this is desirable mawdsley et al 1995 jiang et al 2002 jamieson et al 2002 islam et al 2004b you et al 2006 leifert et al 2008 semenov et al 2009the extent of movement will affect the distribution and eventual fate of the pathogens some will spread in soil and attach to roots others may be washed off to surface waters or percolate to aquifers potentially contaminating irrigation water sources fig 2
 jamieson et al 2002 vinten et al 2002 avery et al 2004a avery et al 2004b islam et al 2004b pathogens occurring in contaminated manure therefore can be rapidly transported within soil systems gagliardi and karns 2000 kisluk and yaron 2012 the success of conveyance and distribution however further depends on inherent survival capabilities of the pathogen as well as the presence and structure of plant root systems fig 2 kemp et al 1992 mubiru et al 2000 avery et al 2004a franz et al 2008 arthurson et al 2010there is some evidence that pathogens may indeed survive longer in manure-amended soils than actual manure samples and this has been illustrated for enteric species such as s typhimurium and e coli o157h7 salmonella typhimurium has however exhibited superior persistence capabilities compared to e coli o157h7 in manure-amended soils islam et al 2004b you et al 2006 franz et al 2008 fremaux et al 2008 pornsukarom and thakur 2016 there is a paucity of data on the persistence of pathogens in manure amended-soils in the tropics ongeng et al 2015 one interesting study provides an insight into the survival of e coli o157h7 and salmonella typhimurium under tropical climatic conditions ongeng et al 2011 the study showed that survival periods were mostly shorter than the observed record in temperate regions indicating that biophysical conditions in the tropics may be more injurious to these pathogens it is therefore not prudent to predict the survival of e coli and s typhimurium in tropical soils from data obtained in temperate locationsthe soil is the most important cultivation medium and represents a relevant risk for produce contamination a myriad of studies regarding the behavior of pathogens in various kinds of soil ecosystems is available however validated consensus protocols for conducting and interpreting experimental studies as well as for evaluating the effects of environmental and soil characteristics on fate of pathogens in soils are not yet available it is important to further understand the effects of soil types environmental factors biological processes and interactions cultivation and management practices on the behavior of indigenous and foreign enteric pathogens in agricultural soilsapart from farm animals whose roles as reservoirs of enteric pathogens has been established wild animals such as birds reptiles rodents amphibians some helminths and insects like flies and beetles can also serve as vehicles of pathogens to contaminate cultivation media and produce beuchat 2006 lim et al 2014 livestock and wild animals may gain access to cultivation areas either because of adjacent land use livestock rearing or by intrusion jay-russel 2013 birds such as gulls pigeons chickens starlings canada geese migratory ducks and sandhill cranes pacha et al 1988 hald et al 2004 ekdahl et al 2005 humphrey et al 2007 have been determined to be carriers of pathogens such as e coli salmonella and campylobacter wallace et al 1997 schmidt et al 2000 wani et al 2004 insects are typically ubiquitous in cultivation fields and hence have unrestricted access to produce they are usually found in manure piles feedlots and other habitats near cultivation fields and so farms practicing mixed farming represent a more significant risk martnez-vaz et al 2014 many bacterial species have evolved to exploit insects as hosts or vectors filth flies fruit flies cockroaches and other insects act as mechanical and biological vectors to contaminate fruits and vegetables on the field sasaki et al 2000 mpuchane et al 2004 alam and zurek 2004 humphrey et al 2007 many pathogens use flies as vectors for cross-transmission for example the transient survival of pectobacterium carotovorum subsp carotovorum in the gut of the fruit fly drosophila and subsequent transmission to other plants has been observed nadarasah and stavrinides 2011 lim et al 2014under laboratory environment direct bacterial transfer from contaminated flies to fruits or plant leaves was shown to occur sela et al 2005 talley et al 2009 lim et al 2014 members of muscidae and calliphoride which are usually abundant in production fields adjacent to cattle rearing lots have been associated with the transmission of e coli o157h7 talley et al 2009 insects that feed on plants also play significant roles in produce contamination by providing direct routes for internalizing pathogens from manure to plants in the field talley et al 2009 insect deterioration creates openings that aid the ingress of pathogens into inner plant tissues thereby enhancing colonization of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria on produce warriner and namvar 2010 lim et al 2014 a seasonal trend to contamination by insects has been identified there is increased insect and animal activity during the warmer months of the year moreover peak incidences of pathogens have been reported during the warmer months liang et al 2015reptiles including snakes lizards chameleons turtles as well as other ophidians saurians and chelonians have been found harboring enteric bacteria like salmonella corrente et al 2004 beuchat 2006 many wild rodents are asymptomatic carriers of pathogens like salmonella and campylobacter the occurrence of rodents on farms are often associated with infrastructural impairment and although their destructive tendencies have been widely recognized their zoonotic risks are often primarily underestimated they are capable of amplifying the number of pathogens in the environment and transferring them to other farm animals and produce meerburg and kijlstra 2007 commensal rodents house mice and rats pose a particular threat because of their ecology they live close to livestock and high fecundity brooks and jackson 1973 witmer et al 2014attachment is pre-requisite for the colonization and subsequent transmission of enteric pathogens throughout plants including the edible portions berger et al 2010 it is important to note that attachment onto the surface of intact produce is limited in contrast to the attachment on other food commodities such as processed meat tissues erickson 2010 however the attachment does indeed occur and is facilitated by stomata lenticels broken trichomes as well as bruises and cracks occurring on produce surfaces the incidence of scars and cracks which may set in late in the growing season while the fleshy portion is enlarging rapidly in certain fruits also aids pathogen attachment bhagat et al 2010 cracks tend to occur in or on the weak areas on plant surfaces such as around lenticels and trichomes and hence these areas are more susceptible to invasion by pathogens cavities within the epidermis may also develop from cuticular cracks as the fruit develops thereby entrapping pathogens and shielding them from desiccation and disinfection the initial phase of bacterial attachment is a rapid process initiated once the bacteria establishes contact with the plant surface phyllosphere santana et al 2014 the phyllosphere also known as the aerial parts of plants pose challenges for microbial survival exposure to high uv doses temperature and relative humidity fluctuations sabotage viability brandl et al 2004 heaton and jones 2008 epiphytes that exist within the phyllosphere have however evolved specialized mechanisms to improve stress tolerance and nutrient acquisition for instance pseudomonas spp produce pigments to insulate against uv and pectolytic enzymes to gain nutrients heaton and jones 2008 the ability of the pathogen to persist on the phyllosphere improves the chances of a viable or infectious dose remaining post cultivation heaton and jones 2008 the successful attachment on the phyllosphere also depends on the crop and pathogen type a classic illustration is salmonella invasion of lettuce and tomatoes salmonella contamination of lettuce and tomatoes via soil is usually quite low implying that salmonella does not readily attach to or grow in the phyllosphere of these crops critzer and doyle 2010 also attachment of salmonella and e coli o157h7 is observed more frequently with brassicaceae compared to lettuce carrots and tomatoes which has generated the theory of selective attachment suggesting that certain produce types are more prone to contamination than others warriner and namvar 2010 specific pathogens such as salmonella have surface epitopes that can bind to plant structures such as stomata to aid attachment warriner and namvar 2010 some also have higher capabilities to metabolize nutrients contained within the apoplastic fluid of plants warriner and namvar 2010 these traits significantly enhance their attachment abilities finally hydrophobic interactions between a plants epidermal layer and microbial cells are believed to play a major role in facilitating this initial phase of attachment burnett and beuchat 2001surface colonization is the final phase of attachment during which biofilms may be formed biofilms are microbial colonies which form when single microorganisms attach and aggregate on a hydrated surface and undergo a lifestyle switch giving up life as a single cell to live on a surface in an adhesive cell matrix with other microorganisms lemon et al 2007 cells in a biofilm have a better chance of adaptation and survival especially during periods of stress as they are protected within the matrix decho 2000 and are usually resistant to antimicrobial agents lemon et al 2007 naturally occurring biofilms are present in many fruits and vegetables but the ability of foodborne pathogens to associate with them and persist is not yet fully understood brackett 1999 ferreira et al 2014 larsen et al 2014 pathogen serovars that are strong biofilm producers have been shown to attach better to both intact and injured produce surface compared to strains that are weak biofilm producers lindow and brandl 2003 kroupitski et al 2009 the occurrence of biofilms improves the chances of transient occupants of leaf surfaces such as enteropathogens of becoming effectively incorporated into phyllosphere biofilms heaton and jones 2008 bacterial appendages such as curli pili fimbriae and flagella as well as proteins in outer membranes and genes may also facilitate the surface colonization by pathogens increases in the expression of flic flagellin-encoding gene have been observed in certain produce contamination studies after attachment it becomes very difficult to remove the pathogens from produce by surface washing beuchat and scoutten 2002 overall enteric soil pathogens may reach the edible portions of fruits and vegetables via numerous mechanisms and routes and these have been elucidated by several studies natvig et al 2002 johannessen et al 2005 barak and liang 2008 tyler and triplett 2008 some of these routes include germination of seeds in contaminated soils which leads to bacterial colonization of roots and edible parts direct transfer of pathogens within the soil to crops when heavy rain or water gun irrigation causes leaf splash bacterial infiltration through roots amongst othersattached pathogens can reach the interior of fruits and vegetables via a variety of pathways the extent of internalization depends on factors such as the route and mechanism of entry the type and age of the plant the aerial and or root morphology and exudates the soil type and biology and the strain andserovar of bacteria hirneisen 2012 brandl et al 2013 lim et al 2014 the mechanism could be either passive or active santana et al 2014 passive internalization involves the uptake of bacteria mainly through roots and seeds mechanistically though enteric pathogens may be internalized via the root system and transported to edible tissues but the risk of contamination by this route is likely low matthews et al 2014 this is because in the environment particularly areas that are not prone to contamination events the levels of enteric pathogens are likely to be extremely low cooley et al 2007 matthews et al 2014 in contaminated zones however human pathogens may indeed invade root tissues and subsequently translocate to edible portions solomon et al 2002 solomon and matthews 2005 depending on the age of the plant pathogens may invade external root surfaces main and side roots as well as root hairs and subsequently internalize the developmental stage of plant root systems when contamination occurs influences the capability of pathogens to interact with penetrate plant roots and migrate to other tissues mootian et al 2009 the physiological characteristics of the roots may also determine the success of internalization for example some root vegetables possess antimicrobial properties which limits the growth and internalization of enteric bacteria hirneisen et al 2012 pathogens like e coli o157h7 have been demonstrated to survive longer in the soil in the presence of rye and alfalfa roots gagliardi and karns 2002other work has demonstrated that pathogens enter root tissues at sites of lateral root emergence or through damaged roots mendes et al 2013 salmonella and e coli o157h7 have penetrated arabidopisis and lettuce plants roots while klebsiella pneumoniae have been detected on numerous plants roots tyler and triplett 2008 other examples include the invasion as well as endophytic and systemic colonization of barley roots by s typhimurium the shoots of black pepper stem cuttings by pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as roots and shoots of tomato seedlings by p aeruginosa kutter et al 2006 kumar et al 2013 it is however important to note that successful invasion of the root and shoot system may not guarantee translocation to the edible or foliar portions of produce in some surveys bacterial pathogens were detected in roots but not leaves of crops examined watchel et al 2002 warriner et al 2003 bernstein et al 2007a mitra et al 2009 sharma et al 2009a growing body of evidence suggests that seeds may serve as primary inoculum source in produce contamination in the case of vegetables seed sprouts have been implicated as the initial inoculum source severally warriner et al 2003 deering et al 2012 kumar et al 2013 in recent time seeds have been recognized as a significant source of inoculum for foodborne illnesses associated with sprout consumption mahon et al 1997 national advisory committee on microbiological criteria for foods 1999 buck et al 2003 yang et al 2013 it is possible that enteric bacteria may be transmitted from contaminated seeds to sprout to mature plants throughout entire plant life cycle up to consumption the contamination may be transferred from seed again thus persisting in produce cultivation cycles for a long time there is a record of e coli 0157h7 adherence to outer surfaces and subsequent successful internalization of radish sprouts produced from contaminated seed during sprout growth itoh et al 1998rate and efficiency of uptake also depends on the type of produce and the level of internalization varies widely among plants and even among different species of the same crop due to variations in intrinsic factors which affect pathogen survival and proliferation golberg et al 2011 for instance certain produce items like fully ripe tomatoes are typically in the ph range 3945 which conventionally impedes growth of most enteric bacteria whereas the ph of numerous vegetables melons and soft fruits is usually 46 or higher which is conducive for bacterial growth beuchat 2002 gagliardi et al 2003 therefore gram-negative bacteria are more commonly associated with vegetables while molds and certain yeasts mostly occur on fruits due to the differences in ph requirements of the respective groups of microbes jay 2012 members of the brassicaceae family radish turnip and broccoli were demonstrated to have a higher prevalence of salmonella contamination than lettuce tomatoes and carrots when grown in contaminated soil barak et al 2008 among leafy greens radicchio and endive may be more likely to be contaminated than lettuce spinach parsley or cilantro barak et al 2008 salmonella typhimurium has been demonstrated to internalize more efficiently in iceberg lettuce and arugula leaves compared to romaine red lettuce fresh basil parsley and tomato leaves which displayed only marginal internalization listeria monocytogenes seems to exhibit a selective preference for certain vegetables like radishes and potatoes as certain studies reported that although l monocytogenes successfully invaded tissues of a wide variety of vegetables radishes and potatoes appeared to be more often and severely contaminated beuchat 1996 it is also apparent that l monocytogenes does not survive and internalize satisfactorily on fresh carrot in fact low doses of raw carrot juice have been demonstrated to inhibit the growth of the pathogen beuchat et al 1990 farber and peterkin 1991 oh 1993 benkerroum 2013internalization is believed to be a plant-pathogen specific interaction and therefore internalization success varies from pathogen to pathogen a comparison of the internalization of l monocytogenes to s typhimurium on inoculated seeds of cress radish spinach lettuce mustard carrots and tomatoes showed significant variations in the rate and efficiency of internalization by the pathogens under identical experimental conditions s typhimurium internalized into the roots of the vegetables whereas l monocytogenes did not jablasone et al 2005 similarly while s typhimurium was found to be associated with the internal portions of barley sprouts l monocytogenes l ivanovii and l innocua were not kutter et al 2006 furthermore the degree of internalization is contingent on the serovarstrain larsen et al 2014 gene expression metabolic and antimicrobial capacities vary among strains certain strains manifest up-regulation of peculiar genes like the pdu cob-cbi and out which improve carbon source utilization and may confer a competitive edge thereby enhancing the survival and persistence of these strains fox et al 2011 some e coli 0157 strains possess metabolic capacities which foster their survival in certain agroecosystems such as soils franz et al 2011 in a bid to explain the strain-specific internalization dynamics a five serovar salmonella cocktail montevideo michigan poona hartford and enteritidis was inoculated into hydroponic growth substrates serotypes montevideo and michigan were most prevalent while enteritidis hartford and poona were not detected in any of the tomato tissue samples guo et al 2001 this is a quintessential illustration of internalization variation among serovars likewise salmonella serovars cubana infantis and typhimurium exhibited varying capabilities to internalize and colonize alfalfa sprouts when seeds were inoculated under identical environmental conditions dong et al 2003some scholars have endeavored to compare the survival of two arguably most prominent foodborne pathogens e coli and salmonella serovars of both can proficiently adapt to environmental stress -numerous strains are known to become habituated to low ph conditions and subsequently manifest remarkable tolerance to stress conditions escherichia coli can perpetually evolve new varieties that have neither been previously reported nor characterized and which are capable of exploring and inhabiting previously unrecognized niches newell et al 2010 both seem to be capable of long-term survival in the agricultural environment and on produce but it is quite apparent that salmonella survives better than e coli brandl 2006 mandrell 2009 newell et al 2010 schikora et al 2012 ongeng et al 2015 many salmonella serovars bind to plants significantly better than e coli strains escherichia colis inability to lower its metabolic rate to suit the low availability of accessible organic carbon and to competently cope with low nutrient conditions contributes significantly to its die-out in soils and on produce and therefore lowers its competitiveness survival compared to salmonella beuchat 2002 franz et al 2008 franz et al 2011 franz and van bruggen 2008internalization has been correlated with motility and chemotaxis flagella mutants flighitn10 chey deficient in motility and chemotaxis respectively have exhibited reduced attachment and penetration of lettuce leaves kroupitski et al 2009 lim et al 2014 it has also been hypothesized that products of photosynthesis serve as nutrients to aid internalization of pathogens lim et al 2014active internalization typically involves the penetration of bacteria through natural openings the ability of foodborne pathogens to internalize in produce represents a significant public health risk because internalized pathogens are protected against optimized disinfection modes meireles et al 2016 except irradiation which seems capable of reasonably eradicating internalized pathogens in produce the technique penetrates produce tissues to eliminate internalized pathogens and gram-negative bacteria are very susceptible to even low doses saroj et al 2007 obryan et al 2008 however treatment with irradiation may produce off flavors colors and odors and may inactivate some of the nutrients fan and sokorai 2008 it is therefore not accepted and endorsed for produce treatment there are other relatively new technologies such as modified atmosphere packaging ozone ultrasound and ultraviolet treatments which seem promising in ensuring the microbiological safety of fresh fruits and vegetable products shayanfar and pillai 2014 however limited commercial applications have been described for most of these new technologies electron beam technology is another up-and-coming treatment option which according to experts can play a pivotal role in mitigating some of the contemporary microbiological risks facing the produce industry shayanfar and pillai 2014 lung et al 2015 it is an environment friendly cost and time effective decontamination strategy that uses low-dose ionizing radiation to treat crops -as well as other food items to eliminate microbial contamination it is capable of inhibiting the germination of crops and controls the rate of ripening of fruits and vegetables thereby extending their shelf life lung et al 2015 it inhibits a variety of enteric pathogens without compromising food sensory and nutritional qualities and can be used in combination with other traditional or non-traditional food processing technologies lung et al 2015 regulatory authorities such as the us food and drug administration have approved it but the full import of the safety of use is not yet conclusivegiven the amount of evidence indicating that enteric pathogens that are not plant pathogens can invade and be internalized into plants it is important to understand how such microbes establish access to plant tissues as this may facilitate the development of strategies to reduce internalization for successful colonization major interactions take place between pathogens and their plant hosts that determine the success of the pathogenic attack warriner and namvar 2010 many enteric pathogens have devised mechanisms to overcome plants basal defense mechanisms and innate immune responses lim et al 2014 plants first line of response to foreign invasion is by the innate immune system this consists of two main branches pamp-triggered immunity pti and effector-triggered immunity eti in the first stage microorganism associated molecular patterns pamps or mamps such as flagellin peptidoglycan lipopolysaccharide are identified by plant host receptors popularly known as pattern recognition receptors prrs deering et al 2012 these batteries of receptors deployed by the host are designed to curb the growth and spread of the pathogen ausubel 2005 pti response is broad-spectrum sensitive to molecules familiar to many classes of microorganisms including non-pathogens upon recognition plant defense signal pathways are activated among which jasmonate salicylic acid and ethylene play essential rolesvirulent plant pathogens may through diverse strategies such as the production and secretion of effectors efficiently override pti for example there are some effectors that can overcome pti by interfering with mamp detection and subsequent defense signaling kazan and lyons 2014 this results in effector-triggered susceptibility ets for susceptible interactions effectors produced and released by the microorganism are transferred into the plant cell through the ttss type iii secretion system specific nucleotide-binding leucine-rich-repeat nb-lrr proteins encoded by resistance genes resulting in eti and limitation of pathogen transmission to other tissues recognize these effectors while pti is considered the first line of defense against pathogenic infection eti is an accelerated and amplified response the outcome of which is often a hyper-sensitive response hr spoel and dong 2012the ability of pathogenic bacteria to colonize a plant may also be influenced by their interactions with other microorganisms either positively or negatively deering et al 2012 if other microorganisms supply carbon sources via degradation of cell wall polymers or induced secretion of sugars or sequester antimicrobials this can enhance pathogen colonization bais et al 2006 warriner et al 2009 augimeri et al 2015 alternatively plant pathogens that wound or destroy living tissue may create a microenvironment that is suitable for the survival andreplication of human pathogens rashid et al 2016 pathogens are often associated more with plants whose tissues have been damaged by soft-rot pathogens compared to those with healthy tissues brandl 2008 before pathogenic bacteria can colonize the surface or interior of a plant host they have to contend with the naturally occurring microflora that is already established deering et al 2012 the ability of the indigenous bacterial community to inhibit the growth of introduced enteric pathogens has been demonstrated by numerous studies liao and fett 2001 matos and garland 2005 schuenzel and harrison 2002 cooley et al 2003 johnston et al 2009there is direct evidence that the stomata play essential roles in internalization host immunity and pathogen virulence of pathogens kroupitski et al 2009 zeng et al 2010 some researchers have reported that plant stomata close in response to plant pathogens and some human pathogens melotto et al 2008 roy et al 2013 escherichia coli o157h7 has been reported to trigger stomatal closure even under high relative humidity a stressful environmental condition that generally weakens plant defenses against bacteria in field and laboratory conditions roy et al 2013stomata closure could be triggered by certain peptides such as flg22 produced by bacterial flagellin and lipopolysaccharides which are recognized by pamps or mamps in a salicylic acid-dependent manner in the case of some plant pathogens such as xanthomonas spp and pseudomonas syringae virulence factors produced are capable of overcoming this innate immunity and counter stomata defense for example pst dc3000 and several other pathovars of pseudomonas syringae produce coronatine cor a phytotoxin which can reverse stomatal closure induced by bacteria or mamps zeng et al 2010 stomatal immunity can diminish the penetration of human pathogens through the leaf epidermis resulting in low bacterial titers in the plant apoplast roy et al 2013 however plant defense responses induced by pathogens vary and plants may recognize and respond to some human pathogens more effectively than others roy et al 2013 for example comparison of plant defense responses induced by e coli o157h7 and s typhimurium sl1344 in arabidopsis thaliana and lettuce lactuca sativa revealed some variations while e coli o157h7 triggered stomatal closure sl1344 only induced a transient stomatal immunity also pr1 gene expression was significantly higher in arabidopsis leaves infected with e coli o157h7 compared with sl1344 roy et al 2013although numerous studies have examined the intricacies of internalization in fresh produce many of these are laboratory based the few available field studies which have mostly studied e coli indicate that internalization of pathogens may be not be very common in field settings zhang et al 2009 erickson et al 2010b erickson et al 2013 erickson et al 2014b more field studies are therefore required to properly understand the potentiallikelihood of enteric pathogens to internalize in fresh produce as well as the actual factors that influence the success of internalizationto successfully achieve an acceptable level of microbiological safety for fresh produce it is essential to control environmental contamination in the field by taking appropriate pre-harvest precautions one fundamental factor to consider is the state or quality of the growing fields fields on which wild or domestic animals have been recently grazed that have been subjected to flooding or may have been previously contaminated with manure constitute an unacceptable microbiological risk turb et al 2010 therefore growers need to scrupulously investigate land history when selecting a location for produce cultivation islam et al 2004a islam et al 2004b cultivation areas should be safeguarded from flooding and fecal contamination and manure should be adequately treated using popular methods like composting and aging before application as fertilizer also suitable buffer zones physical barriers such as mounds diversion berms vegetative buffers as well as ditches should be erected between animal grazing regions and produce cultivation areas james 2006 olaimat and holley 2012 appropriate livestock waste disposal and farm general waste management should be adopted to ensure safetynumerous experts have highlighted the need for monitoring regulation and control of the microbiological quality of irrigation water several regional and international standards exist for irrigation water use and practices to prevent incidence of bacterial contamination the use of potable water for irrigation and other cultivation operations is highly recommended certainly this is not economical in many instances and may increase production costs which will raise prices it is however pertinent to public health safety in developing countries a myriad of safety regulations exists such as cessation of irrigation prior to harvesting lowering of watering cans to reduce splashes from contaminated soil adoption of furrow irrigation system over the use of sprayers which expose edible portions of leafy vegetables directly to irrigation water and so on keraita et al 2007 amoah et al 2011 uyttendaele et al 2015 in cases where surface water is the irrigation water source drainage of contaminated water into the surface water reservoir may be prevented by constructing ditches buffer strips as well as retention and drainage systems potential overflow points should be identified and eliminated it is also important to determine potential points of contamination because control measures are bound to be more effective if focused on eliminating contamination at the source madramootoo et al 1997 pachepsky et al 2011 irrigation wells functional septic water and sewage systems should be installed and properly maintained especially during periods of excessive rainfall to prevent pathogen contamination buck et al 2003 olaimat and holley 2012 surface and groundwater resources should be protected from any potential sources of contamination including wildlife animal waste agricultural run-off human activity sewage or industrial effluents other management practices like removal of riparian areas erection of fences and treatment of irrigation water for example using uv treatment can be considered to enhance safety assurance of irrigation water these precautions will minimize contamination risks on produce farms and should be applicable not just to supposed high-risk crops such as leafy greens but all produce squash and others strawn et al 2013b implementing some of these may however be costly and have negative impacts on landscape health irrigation water sources should be routinely monitored to ensure microbiological safety brackett 1999 islam et al 2004b ideally there should be more regular reporting on the microbiological quality of irrigation waters in different world regions such surveys should reflect the true levels of actual pathogens rather than indicators and bias should be avoided towards contaminated samples by intensively monitoring every irrigation source possible and not just sites where extensive contamination has been known to occur stoeckel 2009as part of a total package of hygiene measures to prevent the transfer of foodborne pathogens wild animals birds flies and rodents should be controlled in cultivation areas interventions to mitigate wildlife intrusion of a farm may be costly and not entirely effective especially if not done properly thereby allowing certain animals direct access to crops in many cases it is not economical to fence large farms but small farms can be fenced to restrict wild animals jung et al 2014 other mechanicalbiological control methods include the use of scarecrows reflective strips monitoring of animal tracks and field intrusion as well as gunshots to ward off pests and animals mechanical traps and baits can be used to control mice and rodents overall practical cost-effective methods should be adopted to mitigate wild sources and routes of produce contaminationconsidering that in many important outbreaks vegetable seed sprouts have been implicated as the initial inoculum source the elimination of bacteria from seeds before planting has become crucial buck et al 2003 chemical or physical treatment methods are usually used to decontaminate seeds in a bid to reduce the risks of sprout borne disease outbreaks however this poses some challenges for growers as the chosen decontamination method has to fulfill certain conditions one important consideration is the preservation of seed viability selected treatment dosage should be able to inactivate pathogens without adversely affecting seed viability buck et al 2003 also the treatment must be able to penetrate and access bacteria that may be residing in protected seed tissues and finally certain treatments may be inactivated by seeds rendering them less effective buck et al 2003 nevertheless the efficacy of chemical seed treatments for sprout seed including chlorine compounds commonly calcium and sodium hypochlorite ethanol hydrogen peroxide calcium edta 4-hydroxybenzoic acid ozonated water and other commercial disinfectants have been extensively documented it is also possible to use gaseous chemicals and thermotherapy eg hot water treatment although excessively high temperatures may affect sprout vigor another potential issue with hot water treatment is that when treating large batches of seed it is practically impossible to achieve temperature uniformity throughout the water bath therefore while a portion of the seeds receives the appropriate temperature-time exposure some will still contain viable bacteria after treatment also there is a potent risk of cross-contamination with this technique other viable options include seed treatment with bacteriophage combinations of thermotherapy with chlorine and the use of ionizing radiation radiation is particularly appealing because it can penetrate seed tissues and possibly eliminate bacteria localized within protected tissues buck et al 2003 however it has been postulated that high levels of irradiation may distort the physiology and organoleptic properties of seedlings more research is therefore needed to evaluate the prospects and risks of this approach other precautionary measures include testing seed lots for purity and germination rate prior to marketing proper warehouse storage in metal bins until bagged as well as ensuring general facility sanitation and employee hygiene national advisory committee on microbiological criteria for foods 1999safety criteria and regulations are mostly region specific it is however critical to enforce these regulations ensure that growers adhere to such and there is a need to constantly improve standards if new information becomes available regulations should immediately be updated kpke et al 2007 most of the available data is from the developed world mainly from the us and certain parts of europe it is necessary to develop surveillance and tracking systems and generate robust databases for other regions as well more studies should be conducted under field conditions rather than laboratory or greenhouse simulations as this will provide a better understanding of how enteric pathogens behave in agricultural production environmentsfinally and more importantly it is necessary to ensure producers are mindful of their roles in assuring food safety growers should be encouraged to adopt the best possible agricultural practices to ensure produce safety it is also important to enlighten consumers about possible risks and appropriate mitigation strategies there are wrong notions and misconceptions which have to be corrected promptly for example many people believe it is not necessary to wash organically grown fruits and vegetables leifert et al 2008it is evident that epidemiologic investigations are worthwhile as public health directives and policies based on investigation output have averted impending foodborne disease crises in many cases the relevance of epidemiological surveys globally and regionally therefore cannot be overemphasized this means that epidemiological investigation tools and systems need to be objective updated precise flexible and timely while significant progress has been achieved in the area of epidemiology there are still certain cracks that need to be addressed the use of routine optimized clinical pathogen identification techniques may mean that new pathogens may likely be missed this is a potentially grave issue because periodically since the development of foodborne disease surveillance the list of foodborne pathogens has continued to expand care should therefore be taken to avoid research bias since it is likely that produce items that have been previously associated with foodborne illness outbreaks and product recalls may receive particular scrutiny new pathogens emerge due in part to evolving ecology and technology while already recognized strains continue to evolve potentially becoming smarter evading and subverting detection sanitization and plant host defenses it is important to further understand the evolution dynamics and emergence of new pathogens as well as develop and optimize methods to meet the emerging challengesawareness and surveillance of viral and parasitic enteric pathogens need to be more robustly developed although noroviruses hepatitis a rotaviruses as well as certain emerging viruses such as sars are well known they are rarely routinely screened for in fresh produce in most countries also their ecology in fresh produce is poorly understood for instance the knowledge of the stability and persistence of human norovirus in foods has been garnered mostly from the study of surrogate viruses more importantly their significance in foodborne disease incidence remains undetermined parasitic pathogens like ascaris giardia entamoeba cyclospora cryptosporidia and trichinella are recognized newell et al 2010 robertson et al 2014 but not all are routinely monitored in producethe roles that livestock and wildlife play in pathogenic contamination of fruits and vegetables as well as their epidemiology through the food chain is poorly understood it is difficult to compare the available studies because some have used naturally contaminated animals while others used experimentally inoculated animals the exact transporttransfer mechanisms of pathogens from animal fecal material or contaminated manuresoil to fruits and vegetables via splash are not yet properly understood for example it will be helpful to understand the specific spatial factors that influence the transfer of pathogens from fecal pellets to fruits and vegetables the survival times for pathogens in fecal contaminants manure and manure-amended soils are inconsistent reflecting the varying conditions under which many of the available studies have been conducted these variations are demonstrated in table 3 table 4 table 5 the fate of pathogens on the soil surface the relationship between manure-derived pathogens and soil particles as well as the states in which pathogens occur in soil slurry or manure mixtures should be further explored the exact mechanisms of uptake or transmission of pathogens from contaminated manure or manure amended soils to plants particularly in field settings should be studied this will facilitate the design of scientifically sound produce safety standards the majority of studies available on pathogen transport in soils have been conducted using homogenized natural soils in laboratory designed soil columns these may not be a true representation of field conditions and diversifying the experimental conditions will aid the development of efficient grower-level interventions that will effectively reduce the likelihood of on-field contamination of producethere are dissenting opinions among experts on a variety of issues pertinent to produce safety with regards to the factors mechanisms as well as principles that aid competent internalization and persistence of pathogens on produce there are many variations the available studies are difficult to compare largely because they have been conducted under varying physicochemical circumstances types of microcosms experimental conditions and used distinct strains shown in table 3 table 4 table 5 most studies were conducted under disparate environmental conditions and accurate weather data necessary to interpret results from the varying sources is lacking study results for one crop variety may indeed not hold true for other varieties for instance data for apples may not necessarily apply to all pome fruit and data for romaine lettuce may not apply to all leafy greens when possible varieties exhibiting greater potential for pathogen survival should be selected for experimental investigations another relevant consideration for crop selection is preference for varieties that are indigenous to the region in question some other seemingly trivial controversial issues include whether outer leaves are significantly more likely than inner leaves to become contaminated via splash and whether or not the potential for survival on the abaxial side of leaves is higher than on the adaxial side the implications of dormant non-dividing persister cells occurring in certain plant pathogens on the ability to withstand environmental stresses and extensive survival as well as the issues surrounding linked resistance is still an important research debate also even though atmospheric deposition seems to be an uncommon route of pathogenic contamination for produce it has been documented as a potentially important route beuchat and ryu 1997 harris et al 2003 mei soon et al 2012 it will be worthwhile exploring how relevant this is for produce safetywhile many of the available studies have made stringent efforts to simulate produce cultivation circumstances it is extremely challenging to create preciseaccurate environmental conditions in a laboratory setting most studies are conducted under controlled laboratory conditions factors like the biological activity of the soil manure water and crops soil and water chemistries as well as meteorological elements such as wind uv intensity temperature rainfall are simply impossible to replicate under laboratory conditions laboratory scale model systems may provide important details about the roles of environmental variables on pathogen growth and survival in agricultural environments but the slightest tweaks in experimental protocols can affect pathogen survival in agroecosystems unfortunately actual field-based studies are subject to disruption from unforeseen environmental events such as weather extremes and damage triggered by biological agents including insects or onset of plant diseasesmore field studies where typical agricultural practices and conditions are closely simulated are therefore highly desirable to further understand the persistence phenomenon safety and ethical issues however restrict the use of pathogens in the greenhouse and field-based research strategies to improve existing biocontainment and decontamination processes should be developed and optimized as soon as possible another possible solution is to develop and optimize strategies that will cater for the experimental variations in model system development an assessment and identification of environmental variables that influence the fate of test organisms should be included in experimental designs despite meticulous planning however a field trial may fail to yield serviceable results due to factors that are out of the researchers control consequently more replicate trials may need to be conducted furthermore agronomic and farm management practices are not uniform in all regions and production practices significantly differ from region to region depending on seasons and weather patterns within the same region these often depend on operation scale type of farming practices et cetera the risks associated with conventional cropping systems are bound to differ from those of systems that combine intensive livestock farming with arable farming in addition to general studies a case-by-case approach should be considered where possible if financial and technical resources as well as other circumstances permit because farming operations vary widely from farm to farm and this influences the potential for pathogen occurrence survival proliferation and disseminationthe potential of fresh produce to harbor pathogens is now well recognized and fresh produce has been established as a vehicle of foodborne disease the diverse and complex sources and routes of enteric pathogens to fruits and vegetables have been widely researched the interplay of land use water management weather patterns and specific pathogen properties and sources have been illustrated to have significant consequences for the microbiological safety of fresh fruits and vegetables attempts have been made to understand the general microbial profile of fresh produce the behavior fate and transport of pathogens as well as their location in and on plant parts the facts gleaned from these studies have been the subject of many extensive reviews there is abundant information about the factors that affect the contamination and persistence of pathogens on fresh produce in light of the available evidence significant effort must be made to efficiently monitor and illustrate recent trends in the occurrence of foodborne diseases associated with the consumption of fruits and vegetables partnerships and collaboration among all relevant stakeholders commercial growers public health practitioners veterinary and food safety experts and field biologists is necessary in order to ensure the safety of fruits and vegetables delivered to consumerson a final note the need to control all potential pathogen entry pathways has been established and is being continuously stretched by regulators and other specialists there are numerous other factors along the food production chain that may predispose produce to microbial contamination however it is of utmost importance to avoid and control microbial contamination of produce at the pre-harvest stage this is because contaminated manure water and soil have been shown to indeed contaminate produce and decontamination of produce polluted arable soil and groundwater has proven to be a very challenging and expensive endeavourthe authors declare no conflicts of interest
the development of treatments for human viral diseases consists of two quite different approaches the first is research at the molecular level to define the virus life cycle in its quest to produce progeny virus and then screen for pharmacologic drugs that block reproductive stages of that life cycle to gain knowledge of what self-components the virus requires to allow its survival and production of progeny while interacting with the host enormous computerized libraries of known chemicals or synthesized compounds are searched the goal is to identify molecules with the ability to block viral replication such assays require a robust readout and automation involving robotics to screen virtually millions of test molecules to identify just a few that show promise any molecule identified requires first confirmation and then analysis that it is not toxic by itself thereafter chemists study and modify its structure to optimize the therapeutic index that is the relative safety of a dose or treatment as opposed to its potentially harmful effectachieving the maximal advantage for an eventual therapeutic product requires vigorous chemical and biological testing to evaluate the stability half-life and best route of deliveryeither oral intravenous or subcutaneous armed with this knowledge the developers next steps of discovery are to determine the pharmacologic molecules effectiveness usually first in cell cultures and then in animal models for testing ebola virus animal models can include genetically modified mice guinea pigs or subhuman primatesin the course of this search hundreds of thousands of molecules are often screened before a therapeutic hit is uncovered unfortunately and frequently the molecule or compound identified is disqualified because of its toxicity insolubility or delivery problems chemists then work to alter the structure of the selected compound to overcome such difficulties
the time involved can be and is usually long and the financial cost being great nevertheless this approach has achieved amazing success over the last few years examples are discoveries of drugs that changed hivaids infection from a near-routinely lethal event mortality 90 to a 1 or less death rate for hiv patients who are medicated daily however these drugs are expensive and not always available in some countries similarly the antiviral therapy recently discovered for chronic hepatitis c virus hcv now cures over 95 of such patients instead of the lifetime persistent infection their predecessors suffered additionally the risk of developing liver cancer and needing a liver transplant is greatly diminished although anti-hcv therapy is initially expensive compared to the former long-term hospitalization likely transplant surgery or cancer treatment the long-term cost is modest and the value is great for patients as well as for the health care systemin view of the successful outcomes with antiviral therapies finding one or more molecules to combat ongoing ebola infection seemed possible an announcement had appeared that the small molecule gs-57341 an adenosine analog with antiviral activity protected 100 of rhesus monkeys 3 days after initiation of a lethal ebola infection the virus tested was the makona variant of ebola a virus isolated during the outbreak in sierra leone during 2014 of further interest was the drugs effectiveness against other filoviruses marburg arenaviruses lasv and coronaviruses sars despite its promise though this therapy still required testing for safety and then clinical trials in humans the issues of large-scale manufacturing and pharmacokinetics still needed resolution to determine whether a drug if produced would be available for the next ebola outbreak it was not yet available for dr khanthe second approach in the development of treatments for human viral diseases is harnessing the hosts immune response the immune system has evolved to enable the host to resist invasion by organisms like in this case ebola virus proteins in ebola that trigger an immune response are called antigens immunogens a hosts immune response to antigens can travel down two very different pathways the most common and satisfactory one provides protection controls the infection by either preventing it totally or lessening attenuating its effects and induces a protective immune response such a response can provide long-term protection from ebola virus so that a repeated infection does not cause diseasesort of one and done to mimic that scenario a vaccine is created to prime the immune response by programming it to recognize and then rapidly resist the ebola infection in an individual who later becomes exposed to a person animal or substance contaminated with ebola virus vaccines developed against viruses like measles mumps smallpox yellow fever poliomyelitis have changed the human and medical landscapes in that they succeeded in reducing the morbidity and mortality of human viral diseases this success stands as one of the greatest of public health advancements for example smallpox alone in the 20th century killed an estimated 300 million individuals about threefold more than all the wars of that century including world wars i and ii vaccination eliminated smallpox so that in the 21st century not a single case has emerged2 similarly if one is infected by ebola and survives that person is immune to reinfection indeed during the 201316 ebola outbreak such naturally immune individuals because of their resistance to reinfection by ebola often worked to provide care and transport patientshow does the immune response evade or control viral infection the immune system must discriminate between foreign antigens such as viral proteins that are not found in humans nonself and those antigens that are self proteins in your own cells and tissues cross-reactivity of a persons immune response to the virus with the individuals own self-proteins can lead to an autoimmune antiself responsea response to self-components and autoimmune diseases like lupus multiple sclerosis diabetes or thyroiditis3
after an initial exposure to viral infection the so-called acute phase a race is on between the virus which is replicating rapidly and the hosts immune system which functions first to limit the amount of virus made and second to clear the virus from the host at stake is whether the virus can successfully replicate itself to combat the virus the host mobilizes and uses many weapons that is both the immunologically specific and nonspecific responses the nonspecific factors are all early combatants against the virus and the cells it infects included in this group are natural killer lymphoid cells phagocytic macrophageslarge cells that ingest or eat virusesand proteins in the blood called complement factors that are capable of interacting with viruses and also destroying virus-infected cells important is the innate immune system that provides the initial defense against pathogens and primes the subsequent adoptive t cell and antibody immune response the major players in the innate immune response are toll-like receptors which recognize particular microbial patterns and type 1 interferons ifns again there are conflicting reports of whether ifns are suppressed or exaggerated nevertheless these innate systems are mutually complementary and are involved in developing the ensuing adoptive immune response type 1 ifns upregulate molecules on cells that present major histocompatibility complex mhc molecules molecules that code for self mhc molecules are essential for optimal interaction with t cells following a virus infection or vaccination major antigen-presenting cells called dendritic cells present segments of viral proteins peptides that become located within mhc molecules to nave t cells an action termed priming by this means virus-specific t cells are generated and expanded numerically these t cells are made in the infected host for the specific control of a virus infection thus the major combatants against viruses are antibodies and t lymphocytes both of which mount the host immune response to ebola although the relative contribution of each is not unknown however in this battle within 1014 days after infection either the replicating viruses or the hosts immune response will emerge as the winner if the immune response wins viruses are vanquished and the host survives with enduring immunity to that virus however if the immune response is overcome the ebola virus infection ends in the hosts death or in a subset of individuals fingerprints of ebola that can be found months later4 5
what is the cellular t cell virus-specific immune response the component parts are cd8 and cd4 t cells the t stands for thymus-derived and cd8 or cd4 indicates a specific molecule present on the cells surface used to identify the cell the thymus is a two-lobed gland of the lymphoid system located over the heart and under the breastbone lymphocytes formed in the bone marrow hemopoietic stem cells migrate to and enter the thymus where they are educated mature and are then selected to become either cd8 or cd4 t cells cd8 t cells function as surveillance and killer cells which accounts for their name cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctls they travel along the highways of blood vessels and wander among tissues throughout the body seeking cells that are foreign not like self because they express viral proteins ctls then recognize attack and kill such cells by this strategy they eliminate the factories making viruses cd8 t cells also release soluble factors like interferon ifn- and tumor necrosis factor-alpha tnf- that also have antiviral effects but do so without killing the virus-infected cell cd4 t cells predominantly serve a different role they release soluble materials proteins that help or induce bone marrow-derived nonthymic-educated b lymphocytes to differentiate and make antibodies cd4 t cells release soluble factors cytokines that also participate in clearing a virus infection and uncommonly cd4 t cells may also kill virally infected cellsin contrast to reacting against cells antibodies react primarily with viruses in the body fluids and are therefore most effective in limiting the spread of virus through the blood or in cerebrospinal fluids fluids that bathe the brain and spinal cord by this means antibodies decrease a hosts content of virus and diminish infectivity antibodies lower the number of viruses thereby allowing ctls to work more efficiently antibodies along with effector molecules like complement can kill virus-infected cells however this mechanism is relatively inefficient compared to ctl killing of virus-infected cells although over 100000 or more viral antigens must be present on the surface of a virus-infected cell to achieve lysis by antibody less than 10 viral antigens expressed on a cell and restricted by mhc are all that are needed for a cd8 t cell to do the job thus during infection the eradication of virus-infected cells is the primary job of ctls whereas antibodys main task is to curtail the spread of virus in body fluidsantibodies are made by differentiated b lymphocytes named plasmacytes once activated such cells can pump out 100 million antiviral antibody molecules per hourantibodies latch onto and neutralize viruses by one of several mechanisms 1 antibodies can coat or block the outer spike protein of the virus that is required to attach to the cell and begin its entry into the cell by this means antibodies can prevent infection this is the major action of vaccination 2 antibodies can aggregate or clump viruses so that the net number of infectious particles is reduced 3 with the assistance of complement antibodies can lyse disintegrate viruses and 4 antibodies can react with viral antigens on the outer membrane of the infected cells to limit the manufacturing or transcription of virus molecules inside the cells thereby restricting the amount of viruses made each antibody molecule generated acts on a specific antigen or target molecule of the viruswhen a host is initially exposed to an infecting virus or to a vaccine-containing viral antigens antibodies specific for that virus as well as ctls are generated the ctl response is initiated on the first day of infection expands over 100000 to 1000000 times by doubling roughly every 12 hours with peak expansion 78 days after exposure thereafter the quantity of these cells contracts and is maintained at 12 of the total generated these become immune memory cells immune memory t cells are rapidly stimulated and accelerated to respond when the same or cross-reactive infection occurs ie they protect against a repeated infection by the same virus antibody responses peak after the ctl response and unattached or free antibodies are often weakly detectable during the acute phase of infection the number of antibodies then rises over a period of 24 weeks after infection and they linger for yearsduring an onset of acute viral infection the mechanics of obtaining sufficient virus-specific cd8 t cells in humans to transfer into a mhc-matched individual is barely doable even when attempted as a research study in a sophisticated clinical research center in an optimal hospital setting in the west this task is not feasible during an ebola infection in africa yet the transfer of convalescent plasma plasma is blood from which red cells have been removed harvested from ebola-immune donors into acutely ill ebola patients is possible such immune plasma plasma containing antibodies to ebola can be placed in storage and thus remain available the million dollar questions aredoes this protocol work and if so is it of therapeutic value for such transfers blood is harvested in heparinized tubes to prevent clotting t cells red blood cells macrophages etc are removed by centrifugation and the resultant plasma is injected intravenously into the infected patient in clinical trials with 84 patients of various ages acutely infected with ebola virus 200250 ml of inoculum was tested this plasma was harvested from previously infected ebola patients who survived the disease6 unfortunately though the survival rate of patients in the trial did not improve significantly over that of the controls who were not so-inoculated however the study was flawed in that neutralizing antibodies to ebola were not quantitated or adjusted in the transferred plasma thus exactly why the trial failed is not clear was the entire procedure flawed or was the concentration of neutralizing antibodies in the plasma simply too low6 in other studies potent neutralizing antibodies against ebola were isolated from b cell clones of immune individuals who had recovered from ebola infections one such antibody mab114 given only once protected 3 of 3 macaques even when administered as late as 5 days into the infection cycle7 the one macaque given no neutralizing antibody died at day 10 postinfection with 108 logs of virus similarly potent neutralizing antibodies were isolated from a survivor of the 2014 ebola outbreak and 77 of the 349 monoclonal antibodies isolated neutralized ebola indicating that a broad diversity of b cell clones target sites on the ebola glycoproteins generated during infection8 impetus to develop this strategy further came from these results with ebola and the same method was used in other animalvirus models for example monoclonal antibodies proved to protect guinea pigs from hemorrhagic arenavirus junin infection of argentina9 and anti-hiv-1 antibodies prevented that infection in a monkey model10
an important consideration underlying the proposed development of an ebola vaccine was the fact that human survivors of the initial infection resisted reinfection when later exposed to ebola such observations provided the scientific rationale and the logic for financial investment by government agencies like the national institutes of health nih and charitable foundations to obtain an effective vaccine against ebola less attention came from large pharmaceutical companies whose perspective was commercial that is even if successful the vaccine would be used in as yet nonindustrial still third world countries therefore the market for that vaccine would be smaller and less profitable than in industrialized western countries also because of its highly lethal nature ebola would require specialized facilities for handling and testing finally insufficient data were available about the early events in human processing of ebola virus infectionas vaccines were considered four ebola-infected survivors undergoing the postacute phase of infection had been air-lifted from west africa to emory university school of medicine the profiles of these subjects blood were analyzed at emory and at the cdc in selective bsl-4 facilities surprisingly the individuals displayed exceptionally strong anti-ebola t and b cell responses11 these observations were the opposite of early reports that t and b responses were suppressed the cause of this difference could be temporal that is the timing of blood sample collection the advanced methodology used11 or perhaps the survivor population studied analysis of specific anti-ebola t and b cell responses during the early acute phase of disease is currently unresolved with new and better facilities in west africa especially sierra leone and kenema government hospital kgh recent nih support to identify and map t cell epitopes regions on the virus as it comes to the surface of infected host cells and funding for virologists and immunologists from both sierra leone and the united states solutions should soon be forthcoming the importance will be not only in identifying which arms of the host immune response function during ebola infection but also in discovering the essential viral proteins to constitute a vaccine that provides optimal immunity and protectionthis background brings us back to the advancing death of dr humarr khan from ebola virus infection the controversy about using zmapp for his treatment and the ethics of administering an untested drug to severely ill persons zmapp was a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies the first to be suggested 2 years earlier as a potential transfer antibody therapy for ebola12 zmapp created through international cooperation showed promising results in primates but had not been tested on or approved for human usage the majority of research to develop zmapp was funded by the national institutes of health and public health agency of canada when the ebola outbreak began the question of its use was raised although it had not yet been deemed safe or effective for treating humans tests with monkeys infected with ebola had shown a protective effect when they were given zmapp at 35 days after infection12 could zmapp have a similarly protective effect in humans also zmapp had been produced in tobacco plants a procedure used to expand its production would there be an issue of sensitivity to tobacco antigens for humans in therapy provided intravenouslythe evidence presented here suggests that zmapp offers the best option of the experimental therapies currently in development for treating ebo-v ebola virus infected patients we hope that initial safety tests in humans will be undertaken soon gary p kobinger of the canadian public health agencys national laboratory for zoonotic diseases and special pathogens stated
as dr khan lay dying in the doctors without borders care center in kailahun and the debate of whether or not to treat him with zmapp was raging over 480 miles to the northwest in monrovia liberia at samaritans purse elwa hospital another crisis was unfolding samaritans purse a christian relief ministry was coming to grips with the fact that two of its health care workers involved in treating ebola patients kent brantly a 33-year-old physician and nancy writebol a care provider and missionary showed clinical symptoms and signs of ebola the infection was confirmed by blood test a hospital administrator for samaritans purse lance plyler knew there were experimental drugs being developed elsewhere to combat ebola losing no time he contacted a cdc official stationed in monrovia to obtain names and places in the united states to seek the necessary therapeutics meanwhile the infected and quarantined kent brantly was surfing the net with his laptop computer for a potential and possible therapy for ebola brantly came across the report in nature
12 that zmapp a cocktail of antibodies to neutralize ebola saved monkeys challenged with a lethal dose of ebola even when they were several days into their illness however zmapp had been tested only in cultured cells or animals and was not yet known to be harmless or effective in humans nevertheless brantly selected zmapp as his choice was the material available lance plyler contacted gary kobinger in canada who was involved in the creation and testing of zmapp plyler requested that the drug be sent to samaritans purse hospital for its immediate use kobinger informed plyler that the nearest supply of the drug was only 480 miles away from the elwa facility at the doctors without borders kailahun care facility where khan was near death concerning khan the debate continued whether or not he should receive zmapp plyler requested the drug and arranged for a helicopter to take zmapp from the doctors without borders care center to monroviathe issue was the limited number of zmapp treatments available only five doses existed in all of africa and who should be selected to receive it zmapp had been sent to west africa to the doctors without borders care center in kailahun primarily to determine how the drug would hold up in the african environment of heat and electrical power failures the plan was to then return the drug to canada and re-evaluate its antiviral efficacy was it stable was there a loss in potency although a promising anti-ebola therapeutic zmapp had not attracted robust funds for its development in a cbs news interview dr jeffrey d turner president and ceo of defyrus a private life sciences biodefense company that collaborated with public government public health agencies and military partners in the united kingdom and canada stated the challenge that many people dont appreciate is that our plans were to scale up this drug for 2015 and even then small amounts for clinical trials what has really happened with this outbreak is its caught us in a position where we didnt have enough zmapp available because no one would have bought itzmapp was produced in a specific type of biologically engineered genetically modified tobacco plant nicotiana benthamiana grown at kentucky bioprocessing in owensboro kentucky the genes encoding the monoclonal antibodies made elsewhere were inserted in these plants and the plants then produced large quantities of the antibody however the procedure required several weeks thus in this environment the manufacture of zmapp took up to several months production was comparatively inexpensive since as many as 100 million doses of antibody could be made for 36 million in addition to kentucky bioprocessing the biopharmaceutical companies involved in the development of zmapp included san diego-based mapp biopharmaceutical and texas-based caliber biotherapeuticsafter humarr khans infection with ebola was diagnosed at kgh he asked for a transfer to the doctors without borders clinical center in kailahun to avoid further demoralizing his hospital staff by chance kailahan was the site where zmapp was stored the question being debated by the doctors at that time was should zmapp be used for humans and if so in whom how would these individuals be selected it was into this setting that the severely ill khans name entered the debate initially and under pressure from the sierra leone government to do something for khan already recognized as a national hero in that country the physicians treating khan and others involved were presented with an ethical and philosophical dilemma what if the patient died as a result of an allergic reaction to zmapp zmapp had not undergone clinical trials for safety and efficacy in humans what if the treatment failed many believed that khan should receive zmapp because in all of west africa he was the leading and best known figure involved in the war on ebola however others were hesitant also the fact that khan was african brought attention to the recent uproar that westerners were subjecting africans to lethal therapy13
after a heated argument the authorities in charge decided against giving zmapp to khan that decision would be unpopular and not in line with the general requests for help advocated by khans government and specific requests of his colleagues garry and sabeti applied pressure that he should receive the therapy khans blood had already generated antibodies to the virus indicating that his own immune system was beginning to work to combat the viral infection however as discussed above early reports that the virus could suppress the immune system remained under reassessment generating concern that the drug might affect his immune responsekhan was denied the zmapp therapy but not told of its potential benefit or that it was on hand representatives of doctors without borders said he wasnt consulted because it would be unethical to inform him of the potential drug that was not available to him one of khans close friends and fellow clinical researcher dr daniel bausch14 strongly disagreed dr khan is the ideal person to make an informed decision and i feel strongly that he should have been asked if he wanted it or notthats one area where frankly i am critical nevertheless shortly after being denied the drug khan diedthe next day despite the same concerns that prevented zmapp treatment for the dying khan other infected individuals received zmapp the treatment that might have saved khans life was instead transported to samaritans purse elwa hospital in liberia and administered to two ebola-infected health workers from the united states this act created a strongly emotional response from the local population and the international community giving zmapp to two westerners who survived and not to khan an african who died was highly controversial since not all those infected with ebola die mortality ranging 5070 possibly the two westerners would have survived without zmapp after all many did if khan had been given zmapp and died would africans be convinced he was used as a guinea pig to be tested with an experimentalunproved therapy without either formal local approval or approval by western scientific and government committees the two american recipients of zmapp kent brantly and nancy writebol were members of samaritans purse the christian missionary in liberia a source from the nih stated that someone from the cdc contacted samaritans purse and that an nih scientist later informed them of the drug however no one knew if the drug would work or if the ultimate recovery of those taking the zmapp was due to the drug after receiving zmapp kent brantly showed remarkable clinical improvement although in contrast after receiving the drug nancy writebols condition worsened however both brantly and writebol survived but may have recovered without the zmappone does not know the indisputable fact is that humarr khan died without receiving zmapp when with its therapeutic effect he might have livedmany of the natives in west african lacked trust in international efforts to combat disease and ebola strangely since the reported outbreaks of mass ebola virus infections some groups of native africans have expressed doubt that ebola really exists others have voiced allegations that health officials purposely infected the populations to harvest their organs hospitals health care stations and workers have been attacked and stoned by mobs awareness quarantine and prohibition of touching people sick or dead from the disease have been viewed by many africans as myths of western propaganda the african custom of touching and washing the body of a dead person prior to burial was being denied and led to resentment demonstrations and riots further such public health measures are alien to their culture many west africans believe in cultural superstitions and view ebola as a curse rather than a pathogen associating ebola with witchcraft and sorcery brought there by foreigners some locals believe that doctors are killing ebola patients as a punishment for sexual promiscuity fabio friscia unicef coordinator of the ebola awareness campaign explained that what was creating the greatest problem in controlling ebola was the behavior of the population15
in guinea liberia and sierra leone the local population often attacked and disrupted health care workers forcing them to leave treatment centers and hospitals in one episode occurring in south-east guinea eight members of an ebola disinfection and awareness team were killed with stones and machetes by fearful villagers the members killed were part of a relief wing of the christian and missionary alliancein august 2014 armed locals attacked a medical clinic in liberia in an area named west point where patients were quarantined locals broke down doors stole bloody mattresses sheets and equipment and caused patients to flee in a panic the day before the raid a crowd of several hundred locals drove away burial teams and police chanting no ebola in west pointviolent attacks have resulted in doctors without borders and medical volunteers having to withdraw from their posts because of concerns for their safety a spokesperson for doctors without borders stated we understand very well that people are afraid because it is a new disease here but these are not favorable working conditions so we are suspending our activities 16
despite such difficult times the story of zmapp is not over as both foreign as well as african health care providers and doctors continued to die from ebola virus infection the who endorsed the use of zmapp to combat the uncontrolled outbreak liberian president ellen johnson sirleaf in a direct request to president obama asked for a supply of the drug to be used for the treatment of local doctorsrepresenting the producers of zmapp a spokesperson for kentucky bioprocessing stated though this is all relatively new and theres still a long way to go and a lot of things are going to happen as we go into drug-approval protocols with zmappi think certainly it shows great promise that the tobacco plant can be utilized for such things well see where that goes were certainly optimistic17
prior to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars caused by sars human coronavirus hcov in 2003 123 only two human coronaviruses hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e were known 45 in the following two years two additional coronaviruses were identified namely hcov-nl63 6 and hku1 7 then very recently in september 2012 another novel coronavirus was identified in two patients of which one died 8 not much is known about this latest coronavirus and studies are underway to understand the virus better only hcov-oc43 hcov-229e hcov-nl63 and hku1 are known to continuously circulate in the human population 9 the international committee for taxonomy of viruses ictv recently reported that the three traditional coronavirus groups have been replaced by four genera namely alpha- beta- gamma- and deltacoronaviruses 10sars eventually spread to more than 30 countries in 2003 infecting 8000 people with a mortality rate of 10 11 the etiological agent was eventually identified as the sars human coronavirus sars-cov 12 the virus has been identified as an enveloped positive-sense rna virus containing a 27 kbs genome that encodes for proteins expressed from full-length and subgenomic sg mrnas 13 in addition to the replicase and structural open reading frames orfs the sars-cov genome contains eight orfs encoding for accessory proteins with no known homologues figure 1 these group-specific accessory proteins are interspersed among the structural genes at the 3-end of the genomecoronavirus accessory proteins have been shown to be dispensable for growth in vivo and in vitro 1415161718 on the other hand deletion of the nonessential genes from the mouse hepatitis virus mhv genome results in attenuation of the virus when inoculated into the natural hosts 15 indicating a possible in vivo function continuous passage of infectious bronchitis virus ibv in cell culture results in mutations in the ibv 3b gene that confers a growth advantage to the virus when cultured in cells and chicken embryos these mutations also increase the virulence of the ibv in the chicken embryos 19 reports to date make it clear that the cov accessory proteins are not essential for virus replication in vitro but since these genes are maintained in the virus genomes under selective pressures they have to confer a biological advantage to the virus in the natural environment of the infected host 20although recent evidence shows that the sars-cov accessory genes are expressed in the host during infection their functions remain somewhat obscure currently there are a range of proposed functions for these accessory proteins including modulation of viral pathogenicity and replication as well as acting as cell death inducers and interferon ifn antagonists to name a few in this review the current knowledge on sars-cov accessory proteins orfs 3a 3b 6 7a 7b 8a 8b and 9b will be summarized and will include i expression and processing ii the effects on cellular processes and iii functional studies sars-cov 3a protein also referred to as orf3 21 x1 22 orf3a 23 and u274 24 was the first of the sars-cov accessory proteins to be characterized orf3a located at the 3-end of the sars-cov genome between the s and e genes encodes for a 274 amino acid aa 31 kda accessory protein 21222526 the orf3a n-terminal ectodomain aa 1-34 contains three transmembrane regions aa 35-56 77-99 103-125 and is separated from the c-terminal endodomain aa 209-264 by a central region containing a cysteine-rich domain aa 127-133 a yxx domain aa 160-163 where x is any aa and  is an aa with a bulky hydrophobic side-chain and a diacidic domain aa 171173 24 although indirect immunofluorescence detects orf3a partly in the rough endoplasmic reticulum 27 it is mainly found perinuclearly in the golgi complex 242728 antibodies to orf3a also stain the plasma membrane 242729 where it is either secreted out of the cell 3031 or undergoes endocytosis 24 following orf3a translation the diacidic domain ensures that the protein is efficiently exported from the endoplasmic reticulum 32 to the golgi apparatus where orf3a undergoes posttranslational modifications in the form of o-glycosylation 33 before being inserted into the plasma membrane transport of orf3a to the cell surface requires two protein sorting and tracking signals the centrally located yxx and diacidic motifs 24 once in the plasma membrane the side chains of cysteine in the cysteine rich domain allow orf3a to form homo- and heterotetramers which cluster together to form a potassium-permeable ion channel 34 in transfected cells co-immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that membrane-bound orf3a interacts with structural proteins s m and e as well as with sars-cov orf7a another accessory protein 24273536the presence of orf3a in the cytoplasm of infected cells has been confirmed through immunohistochemical analysis of tissue biopsies andor autopsies of sars-cov-infected patients in lung sections the expression of orf3a is restricted to the cytoplasm of pneumocytes and to multinucleated giant cells a rare feature of the lung pathology in sars 37 moreover sections taken from the small intestine show orf3a localizes to the cytoplasm of surface enterocytes 37 the co-localization of orf3a together with the sars-cov genome in the cytoplasm of pulmonary pneumocytes and small intestinal enterocytes is not totally unexpected as the lungs and small intestine are primary targets of sars-cov infection the lung and small intestines are however not the only tissue targets for sars-cov one of the cellular receptors for sars-cov angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 383940 is also expressed by a certain population of peripheral cd14 monocytes from which osteoclasts are derived 41 interestingly the expression of orf3a in a murine macrophage osteoclast precursor cell line enhances osteoclast differentiation and may explain why many recovered sars patients suffer from reduced bone density 41 the first attempts to elucidate the functions of coronaviral group-specific genes involved the generation of recombinant mhv from which the group-specific genes had been deleted these recombinant viruses could still replicate demonstrating that these genes are dispensable for virus growth in vitro the mutant viruses did however still lead to a significant attenuation of the mhv when inoculated into mice suggesting that coronaviral group-specific genes play a role in virus-host interactions and therefore contribute to viral fitness 15 subsequently much effort has been placed on elucidating the role of orf3a in the life cycle of the sars-cov the biological functions of orf3a may be closely linked to those of the structural proteins with which they interact the s protein is involved in viral assembly and packaging of coronaviruses reviewed by 42 and so the formation of inter-chain disulfide bonds between orf3a and the s protein in the interior of the viral envelope may suggest that orf3a is integrated into viral particles reviewed by 20 indeed orf3a is incorporated into newly packaged mature sars-cov virions suggesting that orf3a is a structural protein 293043 furthermore the co-localization of orf3a with m and e proteins which are essential for viral assembly 44 suggests that orf3a is important in sars-cov assembly or budding 27 there seems to be some conflicting data in the literature as to the role that orf3a plays in viral replication in vero e6 cells transfected with a sars-cov deletion mutant lacking the 3a gene the virus still replicates as efficiently as the wild-type suggesting a non-essential function of orf3a in viral assembly in vitro 17 moreover in a study that utilized small interference rnas sirnas to knockdown the expression of orf3a in frhk-4 cells viral replication was also unaffected 34 however the transfection of vero e6 cells with sirnas specific to orf3a significantly reduced the yield of progeny sars-cov signifying an inhibition of sars-cov replication cycle in these cells 45 this could have been a combinational effect due to the concurrent knockdown of orf3b in addition to a possible role in viral replication orf3a is likely to modulate viral release as a study has shown that there is a significant reduction in viral release in frhk-4 cells transfected with orf3a specific sirnas 34 taking into account that orf3a forms a potassium-sensitive ion channel in the plasma membrane 2934 and ion channels for viral proteins control virus entry or release 4647 the mechanism whereby orf3a influences viral release warrants further investigation 34 orf3a has also been shown to regulate various host cellular responses overexpression of orf3a in several different cell culture models has demonstrated that it induces apoptosis 29484950 upregulates mrna and protein levels of fibrinogen in lung epithelial cells 51 activates c-jun n-terminal kinase jnk and the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa b nf-kappab which is involved in the activation of pro-inflammatory genes 204152 and downstream from that up-regulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as interleukin 8 il-8 and rantes ccl5 52 taken together these changes to host cellular homeostasis imply a role for orf3a in the pathogenesis of sarsthe occurrence of both apoptosis and necrosis in host cells during sars-cov infection suggests that the regulation of cell death is important for viral replication andor pathogenesis reviewed by 53 the pro-apoptotic function of orf3a is reliant on its ion channel activity 29 and is induced via caspase-8 and -9 dependent pathways ie through both the death receptor- and mitochondria-mediated pathways respectively 232948 in addition it has recently been reported that bax p53 and p38 map kinase also play roles in orf3a-induced apoptosis 54 the fact that orf3a utilizes more than one caspase pathway to trigger cell death may explain why tissue responses to sars-cov infection are distinct in different organs for instance whereas the lung pathology is dominated by diffuse alveolar damage the small intestine remains relatively intact 37even though the natural animal reservoir for sars-cov has not been identified the threat of another sars outbreak is still a disturbing possibility as bats have been shown to be natural reservoirs for different sars-like coronaviruses sl-cov 55 like all accessory proteins orf3a is unique to the sars-cov and shares an 83 homology to sl-cov 56 making it a good candidate for the development of diagnostic assays vaccines and drugs the immunogenic properties of orf3a in sars-cov-infected patients has been shown to vary depending on i whether or not the sera was collected from convalescent or recovered patients ii whether or not full-length or truncated fusion proteins were used to detect immunoglobulin g iggs to orf3a and iii the method used to detect these antibodies to orf3a namely western blot elisa or protein microarrays to date in general iggs to orf3a could be detected in only 6073 of patient sera screened 35575859 this could be due to frame-shift mutations within the 3a gene resulting in a heterogeneous population of sgrna3 transcripts in patients with acute sars-cov infection containing copies of both wild-type and mutant 3a genes 2460 these mutant 3a genes encode for proteins with distinctively shorter n-termini than the wild-type forms 24 the neutralizing activity of anti-3a sera has subsequently been assessed in vitro the sera from rabbits immunized with recombinant orf3a aa 125274 does not exhibit any significant neutralizing activity on sars-cov infected vero e6 cells 59 in another study however sera from rabbits immunized with a different recombinant orf3a aa 1528 contains neutralizing antibodies that do inhibit sars-cov infection in vero e6 cells 61 these contrasting results could be explained by differences in the immunogenicity of the central region and c-terminal domain compared to the n-terminal ectodomain respectively indeed ectodomain-specific antibodies aa 1528 from convalescent-phase patient plasma recognize and destroy sars-cov-orf3a-expressing cells 62 a more recent study has showed that mice immunized with full-length 3a dna elicit strong humoral and th1-based cellular immune responses the vaccine stimulated ifn- production mainly by cd8 t cells and interleukin-2 il-2 mainly by cd4 t cells 56 whether or not orf3a will be useful as a subunit vaccine for humans still remains to be seen though orf3b is predicted to express the 154 amino-acid 3b protein also referred to as orf4 21 x2 22 and u154 57 via an internal ribosomal entry mechanism 212225 sars-cov orf3b has been described as a multi-localized protein due to its shuttling behavior 63 although the protein initially accumulates in the nucleolus 64 it subsequently translocates to the outer membrane of mitochondria 6365 nuclear export of other accessory proteins namely sars-cov orf9b has also been previously reported 66 but how this spatio-temporal distribution impacts on orf3b behavior and function is still unclear 67 in fact one study has reported that orf3b is localized primarily in the nucleus with no evidence of mitochondrial localization 68 immunohistochemical analysis of tissue biopsies andor autopsies of sars-cov-infected patients has failed to demonstrate the presence of orf3b in vivo 37 the antigenicity of orf3b has also come into question as iggs to orf3b are detectable in sars patient sera in some studies 6970 but not in others 59 to date the presence of orf3b in sars-cov-infected vero e6 cells is the only evidence for the expression of this protein 37in comparison to orf3a protein much less is known about the functions of orf3b protein sars-cov deletion mutants lacking the 3b gene replicate to levels similar to those of wild-type virus in several tissue culture cell types 17 suggesting that like orf3a orf3b is dispensable for viral replication in vitro although orf3b may not be involved in viral replication a role for this protein in viral pathogenicity has been inferred through its ability to modulate the host innate immune response to sars-cov infection 68 orf3b has been shown to inhibit the synthesis of type 1 ifns ifn-alphabeta major components of the innate immune response as well as with ifn signaling 6768 considering that sars-cov-infected cells do not produce ifn 7172 it is possible that orf3b provides the sars-cov with a mechanism to subvert the ifn response and therefore the innate immune response 68 however when mice are infected with mutant sars-cov lacking 3b genes the deletion viruses grow to levels similar to those of wild-type virus in the lungs of balbc mice at day 2 post infection 17 this demonstrates that sars-cov is therefore able to inhibit the host ifn response without the 3b gene 17 and emphasizes the limitations of transfection studies recently sars-cov orf3b was shown to modulate the transcriptional activity of the host factor runx1b indicating a physiological role in upregulating cytokines and chemokine levels during sars-cov infection 73 orf3b also induces ap-1 transcriptional activity through activation of jnk and erk pathways 74sars-cov orf3b has also been shown to affect cell cycle and apoptosis-regulation but again there are discrepancies within the literature when overexpressed in vero e6 cells orf3b induces apoptosis and necrosis with an increase in caspase-3 activity 75 similarly expression of orf3b causes cell growth arrest in gog1 phase inducing cell- or tissue-specific apoptosis 76 since data show massive necrosis in the lungs spleen and lymph nodes as well as increased apoptosis in cells from the spleen liver lung and lymph nodes of sars patients 767778 it may suggest that orf3b contributes to these clinical observations orf6 also referred to as p6 79 is a small 63 amino acid membrane protein with no known homologues this relatively small peptide has a 44 amino acid residue amphipathic n-terminus and 20 residue polar c-terminus 80 the c-terminus contains intracellular protein sorting motifs 81 the protein is found on cytoplasmic membranes in the endoplasmic reticulum 82 and golgi-complex of cells overexpressing orf6 8283 the membrane topology of this protein is n-endo c-endo with a membrane-spanning region 36 aa in length 7984 using immunohistochemical staining orf6 was detected in both sars-cov infected cells as well as in the pneumocytes of the lung and surface enterocytes of the terminal ileum from 8 sars autopsy cases 82 the latter corresponds to the tissue-sites of infection reported by another group 37 recent work has hinted at a few possible functions for sars-cov orf6 sucrose gradient purification of sars-cov particles and virus capture assays show that orf6 is associated with purified virions with the presence of sars-cov proteins e m and s sufficient for incorporation of orf6 into virus-like particles vlps when overexpressed alone in cells 798586 as well as in virus infected cells 87 orf6 is released in membrane-associated vesicular structures most likely a subpopulation of endosomallysosomal vesicles 86 the c-terminus portion orf6 contains the sequence motif ysel which has been shown to target proteins for internalization from the cell membrane to endosomallysosomal vesicles 84 several groups have previously shown that coronaviruses use similar vesicular structures within infected cells suggesting that these vesicles have a role in the viral replication cycle 86888990 recombinant studies with sars-cov lacking orf6 remained viable in vitro and in vivo at a high multiplicity of infection moi 17 in contrast an enhancement of replication of the virus is observed at low moi which is consistent with previous findings using recombinant studies 91 recombinant studies using attenuated mhv expressing sars-cov orf6 show accelerated mhv replication 92 and lead to higher viral titers in both cell culture and the mouse central nervous system 8393 in fact the presence of orf6 leads to increased virulence of normally sub-lethal infections in mice 83 the recombinant mhv studies by tangudu and colleagues also showed that orf6 associated with viral rna co-localized with replication viral rna on cytoplasmic vesicles and increased mhv protein synthesis 2092 lastly not only did orf6 partially co-localize with nonstructural protein 3 nsp3 a marker for virus replication complexes 79 it also interacted with nsp8 another replicase protein 87 pointing to a putative role for orf6 in replication collectively these results provide strong evidence that orf6 plays a role in enhancing sars-cov replication and pathogenicity by interacting with membrane-bound replication and assembly machinery 84interestingly overexpression of orf6 in cho cells induces dna synthesis of which the biological significance is still not clear 82 however this was done in the absence of other viral proteins and needs to be verified in the context of the whole viral genome on the other hand orf6 suppresses the expression levels of co-transfected expression constructs the ability of orf6 to interfere with the expression of co-expressed constructs has previously been linked to the blockage of nuclear translocation of these proteins 8093 gunalan and co-workers also found that even though orf6 did not have a global effect on protein synthesis it down-regulated the mrna level of co-transfected nsp8 however they linked the n-terminus diacidic cluster motif ddee which is similar to the putative diacidic motif dxe which governs er export and localization to different membranous compartments 3286 to this suppression 86 orf6 is a type i ifn antagonist and its expression suppresses the induction of both ifn as well as the ifn signaling pathways 6894 the protein inhibits ifn signaling by interacting via its c-terminal region to the nuclear import protein karyopherin 2 thereby sequestering it in the cytoplasm and indirectly preventing movement of signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 1 stat1 to the nucleus 94 the 18 aa n-terminus is also required for maximal inhibition 79 and this inhibition probably plays a role in the immune evasion of sars-cov 94 orf9b immunoprecipitated with orf6 from extracts of sars-cov infected cells and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis reveal an interaction of the two in biologically relevant conditions this interaction has been validated by co-localization of both proteins in the cytoplasm of sars-cov infected cells 95 taken together findings support the hypothesis that orf6 could be a minor structural protein and could be an important virulence factor during sars-cov infection in vivothe sars-cov orf7a protein also known as orf8 21 u122 96 or x4 2297 is encoded by the first orf of sgrna7 2526 the protein is a 122 aa long type 1 transmembrane protein with an n terminal signal peptide sequence of 15 aa an ectodomain of 81 aa and a c terminus transmembrane domain containing 21 aa residues followed by a short cytoplasmic tail of 5 aa residues 98 the orf7a shares a 26 sequence homology with human cd62l protein an adhesive molecule that plays important roles in immune and inflammatory responses suggesting that orf7a may adhere to other cells and influence their functions such as leukocyte adhesion migration and the inflammatory response 97 in fact the ectodomain bears high structural and similar sequence homology to members of the immunoglobulin superfamily namely the d1 domains of icam-1 and icam-2 9899 the ectodomain of orf7a binds to the alpha integrin i domain of human lymphocyte function-related antigen 1 lfa-1 on jurkat cells suggesting that lfa-1 may be an attachment factor or even the receptor for sars-cov on human leukocytes 99 the c-terminus contains a motif krkte that typically serves as an er retrieval signal but in the case of orf7a serves as a dibasic er export signal that allows for the er exit of orf7a to the golgi apparatus 96 expression of orf7a in sars-cov-infected cells and lung tissue of sars patients has been confirmed 969798 but there are discrepancies in the literature as to the exact subcellular localization of the protein it seems to localize predominantly to the intermediate compartments between the er and golgi apparatus 13969798100 partially in the mitochondria 101 as well as in the cytoplasm 100 the export of orf7a from the er to the golgi apparatus is regulated via the er export motif 96102 therefore the presence of orf7a in the er-golgi intermediate compartment where coronaviruses are known to assemble 103 could explain how orf7a becomes incorporated into purified sars-cov particles 31 the interaction between orf7a and the viral structural proteins m e and s 3196 which are important for viral assembly implies that orf7a is important in the viral replication cycle and that virion-associated orf7a protein may exert its function early in infection 31 orf7a also interacts with the accessory orf3a which itself interacts with m e and s suggesting that these viral proteins may form complexes in sars-cov-infected cells 24 the incorporation of orf7a in vlps occurs however in the absence of s or orf3a protein interaction 31 the presence of 7a protein in the cytoplasm could explain why orf7a is able to inhibit protein translation 13 how this would be beneficial to the viral life cycle is unclear as the sars-cov relies on host cell protein synthesis to replicate viral proteins expressed orf7a also interacts with human small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide protein 100 human lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 lfa-1 on jurkat cells and with human ap4a-hydrolase 104orf7b is encoded by the second orf of sgrna7 and may be expressed by leaky scanning of ribosomes 25 this protein has been partially characterized 105 and is a 44 amino-acid long integral membrane protein that is localized to the golgi compartment in sars-cov-infected cells 102 the protein is found in association with intracellular virus particles and also in purified virions 102to date there is very little experimental evidence to support a role for orf7a or orf7b in the replication of sars-cov monkey vero e6 cells transfected with sars-cov deletion mutants lacking the 7a and 7b genes still release virions at levels similar to those of wild-type virus 102106 and virion morphology remains unchanged 107 in airway epithelial cultures generated from golden syrian hamster tracheas sars-cov replication titers are comparable to infected human cultures 106 transgenic mice expressing the sars-cov receptor ace2 one of the receptors for sars-cov also still release virions when infected with mutant sars-cov 107 moreover studies in immunosuppressed syrian golden hamsters an animal model for the study of sars-cov have shown that infection with mutant sars-cov bearing deletions in gene 7 does not result in significant changes to replication kinetics tissue tropism morbidity or mortality 102 one study utilizing sirnas targeting specifically orf7a and orf7b has however demonstrated that the silencing of these proteins significantly reduces the yield of progeny virus 45 the 70 decrease in progeny virus is not due to a disruption of the full-length genomic mrna but reflects inhibition of both sgrna 7 and 8 resulting in the subsequent knockdown of orf7a -7b -8a and -8b 45 moreover the limitations of in vitro studies must be taken into consideration for example although the 7b gene of feline coronavirus is easily lost upon virus adaptation to cell culture it is strictly maintained in naturally occurring strains and its loss is correlated with reduced virulence 108 the importance of orf7a and orf7b during the replication cycle of sars-cov therefore still remains uncertain orf7a may be important for viral host interactions and therefore contribute to viral pathogenesis in vivo by inducing inflammatory responses in sars like orf3a orf7a activates nf-kappab and the il-8 promotor 52 and downstream from that augments the production of pro-inflammatory chemokines such as il-8 and rantes 52 orf7a may also play a role in the pathogenesis of sars-cov by way of the proteins contribution to virus-induced apoptosis several studies have shown that overexpression of orf7a induces apoptosis in a caspase-3-dependent manner 101109 as well as independently via p38 mapk 13 although deletion of gene 7 does not alter markers of early apoptosis or activation of caspase 3 viruses with gene 7 disruptions are not as efficient as wild-type virus in inducing dna fragmentation an apoptotic feature in later stages of infection 102 overexpression of bcl-xl protein a member of the pro-survival bcl-2 family blocks orf7a-induced apoptosis in 293t cells suggesting that orf7a regulates host cell apoptosis at or upstream of the bcl-2 family in the apoptotic pathway 101 in addition orf7a forms complexes with bcl-xl protein and binds to other pro-survival bcl-2 family members indicating that it may induce apoptosis by interfering with the pro-survival function of bcl-xl protein 101 it must be kept in mind though that orf7a is not the only apoptosis-inducing factor during sars-cov infection review by 53 and that the actual levels at which orf7a is expressed in infected tissues is still unknown bringing into the question the validity of the overexpression data in the in vivo contextalthough orf7a is expressed in sars-cov-infected cells 9697 and in lung tissue of sars patients specifically in the bronchial epithelial cells peripheral blood erythrocytes and leukocytes 37 it does not display strong immunogenicity protein microarrays fail to detect antibodies to orf7a in sars patient sera 59 and sars patient sera has low to non-specific antibody responses to orf7a epitopes when tested on a peptide chip platform 70 the selected orf7a epitopes are therefore poorly immunogenic and so orf7a is not likely to serve as a potential marker for sars-cov infection or be important for vaccine development the orf7b protein is likely to be expressed in vivo because anti-7b antibody has been detected in sars convalescent patient serum 69 whereas the sars-cov isolated from humans infected during the peak of the sars epidemic encodes two accessory proteins termed orf8a and orf8b the sars-cov isolated from animals and some early human isolates encodes for a single 122 aa protein orf8ab interestingly this difference is due to a 29 nucleotide deletion in the mrna8 of sars-cov from some animal species 110111112113114 that splits orf 8 into orf8a and orf8b encoding 39- and 84-residue polypeptides respectively 110 in fact larger deletions were reported in sequenced orf8 genes from a cluster of viruses that were isolated from humans later during the sars epidemic 111115 vaccinia virus expressed sars-cov orf8ab contains a cleavable signal sequence which directs the movement of the precursor protein to the er and then mediates its translocation into the er lumen where it is n-glycosylated on the n81 residue 110116 and subsequently assembled into disulfide-linked homo-multimeric complexes which remains stably in the er 110 this retention and accumulation of orf8ab in the er occurs in the absence of a recognized er retention signal 110117 not only do in vitro and in vivo studies show that orf8ab is ubiquitinated but both orf8a and orf8b also binds to monoubiquitin and polyubiquitin suggesting the potential involvement of these proteins in the pathogenesis of sars-cov 116 orf8ab interacts with sars-cov proteins s m orf3a and orf7a 118 all of which have been shown to be structural proteins since orf8a is too small for its signal sequence to function it is most likely directly released from the ribosome and remains in the cytosol in its precursor form 110 antibodies to orf8a have been detected in a small number of sars patients proving that the protein is indeed expressed during virus infection 119 this group also reported that orf8a not only enhances viral replication but also induces apoptosis through a mitochondria-dependent pathway 119 when overexpressed the 96 kda orf8b localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm of vero e6 and cho cells 120 in another study however orf8b was not detected in sars-cov-infected cells or when expressed from mrnas mimicking mrna8 however after it was cloned immediately downstream of a t7 promoter a soluble unmodified and monomeric orf8b protein was expressed in the cytoplasm which was extremely unstable and rapidly degraded 120 similarly in the absence of the orf8a region orf8b undergoes rapid degradation by proteasomes 116 orf8b down-regulates the expression of sars-cov e a process that could be inhibited by the addition of proteasome inhibitors 116 for this reason e is not detectable in sars-cov-infected cells that are expressing high levels of orf8b 118 similarly to orf6 overexpression of orf8b in mammalian cells also induces dna synthesis however co-expression of sars 8b and sars 6 did not elicit synergistic effects on dna synthesis 120 the biological function of this induction is still to be elucidatedit is obvious that the 29-nucleotide deletion disrupts the proper expression of the sars-cov orf8 even though this mutation does not appear to adversely affect the survival of the virus it has become clear that orf8ab -8a and -8b have different stabilities and varying functions and could contribute differently to viral replication and pathogenesis in vivo taken together these findings suggest that orf8ab may modulate viral replication andor pathogenesis in a yet unknown manner bi-cistronic mrna9 encodes for orf9b which is translated via a leaky ribosomal scanning mechanism 121 this 98 amino acid peptide is synthesized from an alternative complete reading frame within the n gene 37121 it has no homology with known proteins and as yet its function has not been confirmed both anti-9b antibody and orf9b antigen have been detected in clinical samples from sars patients 3759 with the latter also detected in virus infected cells 37 analysis using fluorescence microscopy of live transfected cells and indirect immunofluorescence of transfected fixed cells shows that orf9b is exported outside of the cell nucleus and localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum 66122 the authors suggest that the 46-lrlgsqlsl-54 amino acid sequence motif of orf9b functions as a nuclear export signal nes 66 more recently it was confirmed that orf9b interacts with the cellular protein crm1 and gets exported out of the nucleus using an active nes this nucleocytoplasmic export of orf9b is linked to apoptosis 123 cellular crm1 exportin1 protein functions as a nuclear export receptor for proteins carrying a rev-like nes in a process that also requires the gtp bound form of the ran gtpase 124 the authors concluded that the interaction of orf9b with crm1 is essential for the proper degradation of orf9b and blocking the nuclear export of the latter induces apoptosis also orf9b was shown to enter the nucleus in the absence of any nuclear localization signal nls by passive transport independent of the cell cycle 123 the resolved crystal structure of orf9b shows that the protein has a novel fold a dimeric tent-like  structure and a central hydrophobic cavity involved in lipid binding since the protein also co-localizes with intracellular vesicles it has been speculated that the protein has a role in virus assemble via membrane association 125 interestingly recent evidence shows that orf9b is a structural protein incorporated into both purified virions and vlps with efficient incorporation dependent on the co-expression of viral structural proteins e and m 121 the interaction of orf9b with another sars-cov accessory protein orf6 was discussed earlier in this review viruses generally encode for i proteins functioning in the replication and transcription of the viral genome ii structural proteins of the virion and iii accessory proteins that enable facilitate or modulate the infection process these accessory proteins normally act by interfering with cellular processes or by modulating virus-host interactions at the level of the organism table 1 it has also been shown that these proteins are often dispensable for virus replication in vitro but required for optimal replication and virulence in the natural host 110 sars-cov is the prototype human cov and has been studied extensively in addition sars-cov contains eight encoded accessory genes interspersed amongst the viral structural genes 2225126 the most of the known covs interestingly these accessory genes are present in sars-covs isolated from bats civet cats raccoon dogs and humans suggesting important accessory functions in a variety of hosts 55127128 evidence confirms that these accessory proteins are indeed expressed during sars-cov infection but for many their functions are yet to be determined five of the sars-cov accessory proteins orf3a -6 -7a -7b and -9b have been identified as minor viral structural components and others induce ion channels act as cell death inducers and ifn antagonists table 1 it would be interesting to determine whether the high sars-cov accessory gene number correlate with the increased virulence of sars-cov when compared to the other known human covs for this reason the role of the accessory proteins in pathogenesis must be elucidated this article provides an overview of the invited lectures at the 28th international conference on antiviral research icar sponsored by the international society for antiviral research isar which was held in rome italy from may 1115 2015 it begins with reports of lectures by the recipients of isars three major awards held in memory of gertrude trudy elion antonn tony hol and william bill prusoff these are followed by summaries of the three keynote addresses and the main presentations within the three mini-symposia on rna viruses antiviral chemistry and emerging viruses because this review article simply provides short accounts of oral presentations it is not generally accompanied by references to the scientific literature any descriptions of favorable treatment outcomes should not be taken as a recommendation for clinical use generally i have added my personal comments on the meeting within the conclusion in a few instances i have added my own comment within the main text indicated either by the wording or by the use of square brackets one of my aims has been to illustrate how the great diversity of topics can stimulate thinking in other areas of antiviral research one of the strengths of icarhaving joined burroughs wellcome in 1975 phil fig 1
 worked with trudy elion for ten years during this time he was involved in the development of acyclovir zovirax and its prodrug valacyclovir valtrex in 2004 phil joined pharmasset the focus of this presentation was his research at pharmasset leading to the identification of the activity of sofosbuvir and to an understanding of its mechanism of action against hepatitis c virus hcvphils account started with the cytidine analog psi-6130 fig 2
 this was one of the more active compounds in development at that time better than the roche and idenix nucleosides but possibly a little less active than the merck compound an additional important factor psi-6130 lacked detectable cytotoxicity cc50
  100 m in a panel of 5 cell lines clone a huh7 hepg2 cem and pbm incidentally the merck compound showed no cytotoxicity in 3 cell lines but had a cc50 of 5 m in cem cells and therefore was rejected in contrast to many reported cytotoxicity values these are derived from assays in which the cells are replicating it is important to compare the effect of a compound against both replicating virus and replicating cells in order to obtain valid therapeutic ratiospsi-6130 is metabolized in cells to the corresponding triphosphate psi-6130-tp which was a good inhibitor of the hcv polymerase ns5b inhibition constant k
i
  006 m however psi-6130 was poorly absorbed orally and there was significant conversion to the inactive uridine analog a prodrug approach in collaboration with roche resulted in rg-7128 which increased the bioavailability of psi-6130 by 5-fold but it was not an approach which could enhance the short half-life of psi-6130-tp t
12
  5 h it was considered highly desirable to have a triphosphate analog with a sufficiently long half-life to enable once-a-day dosingwhile studying the metabolism of psi-6130 in cells it was noted that some of the monophosphate psi-6130-mp was converted to the corresponding uridine-mp which was further metabolized to the uridine-tp psi-6206-tp this uridine-tp analog was a less active inhibitor of the hcv polymerase than the cytidine-tp analog k
i
  042 m and 006 m respectively but had a much longer half-life t
12
  38 h and 5 h respectively the long half-life of 38 h stimulated the interest of the research team because the uridine analog psi-6206 was inactive due to lack of metabolism to psi-6206-mp it was decided to use the phosphoramidate prodrug strategy to deliver the psi-6206-mp into cells phosphoramidate prodrugs were first introduced by chris mcguigan a former president of isar although the approach is well known there are side chains which can influence the properties of the prodrug over 140 phosphoramidate prodrugs of psi-6206 were synthesized these were evaluated in a cascade of tests which are of particular interestevery successful compound has to have two basic properties a useful efficacy and a good safety profile the cascade started with an assay comparing the compound in an hcv replicon system vs a ribosomal-rna r-rna cytotoxicity test the next steps were cytotoxicity evaluations in an extensive panel of cell lines mitochondrial toxicity and bone marrow toxicity in my experience it is rare to find a compound-screening strategy giving so much emphasis to the safety profile only then the compounds were tested for triphosphate levels pharmacokinetic studies in rats and dogs and in vivo rat toxicity tests just 7 prodrugs were selected for cell culture triphosphate analysis of these psi-7851 gave the best levels of psi-6206-tp in human cells three prodrugs were then tested in vivo initially in a rat pharmacokinetic test of these psi-7851 gave the highest levels of psi-6206-tp in liver measured either by the maximum concentration c
max or by area-under-the-curve auc similarly psi-7851 was the best compound in dogs and monkeysthe activity of psi-7851 was evaluated in a range of hcv genotypes 1a 1b and 2a using replicon cells these genotypes were all sensitive to psi-7851 the ec90 values being within 2-fold also psi-7851 was active against genotypes 1a and 1b in an infectious virus assay it showed no activity against a panel of other dna and rna viruses recombinant ns5b polymerases from hcv genotypes 1b 2a 3a and 4a were all inhibited by psi-6206-tp psi-7409 ic50 values 16 28 07 and 26 m respectively this result suggested that psi-7851 would be active against genotypes 3 and 4 for which replicon assays were not available in combination with interferon or rbv there was additive activity with psi-7851 based on this evaluation scheme psi-7851 was selected as the candidate for developmenthowever psi-7851 is a mixture of two diastereomers in anticipation of questions from the fda the group decided to separate the isomers the rp isomer psi-7976 was then found to be less active than the sp isomer psi-7977 ec50
  11 and 0092 m respectively psi-7977 became sofosbuvir fig 3
sofosbuvir was approved by the fda in december 2013 and by the eu in january 2014 later in 2014 harvoni the first once a day fixed-dose combination therapy for hcv was approved this is a combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir a hcv ns5a inhibitor as of september 2014 it had been estimated that in the usa more than 100000 patients had received sofosbuvir as part of their treatment and had been cured of their hcv infection for patients with hcv sofosbuvir has been a game-changerin memory of the late tony hol a new isar award in medicinal chemistry was announced at the 2013 icar piet herdewijn the first to receive this award gave a fascinating talk entitled from modified nucleoside to a chemically modified genome at the 2014 icar dennis is therefore only the 2nd person to receive this award fig 4
 as the title of his lecture suggests dennis gave us a wonderful account of how chemistry led him into a new and totally unexpected directioncurrently there are many excellent drugs for hiv therapy but only two approved drugs target the attachment and entry of hiv into cells  maraviroc pfizer and enfuvirtide roche of these maraviroc acts as an antagonist to the cellular receptor ccr5 however hiv uses not only the ccr5 receptor m-tropic virus but also the cxcr4 receptor t-tropic virus the majority of patients newly diagnosed with hiv infection have only m-tropic hiv in one study just 5 of 59 9 had t-tropic virus initially in untreated patients t-tropic virus will emerge in about half the patients the average time being about 5 years could maraviroc therapy favor the selection of t-tropic hiv this has important clinical implications because the t-tropic virus damages the immune system and thereby significantly p
  0001 increases the rate of progression to aidsthere are no approved cxcr4 antagonists but clinical trials with amd3100 and amd11070 did validate the concept development was discontinued after phase i and phase ii trials respectively for a long time now no candidates have had a good enough safety profile for progression as a therapy for hiv but there is potential as cancer chemosensitizers on the outside of cells cxcl12 binds to cxcr4 the chemosensitizer releases the cxcl12 from cxcr4 thus enabling immune cells to destroy the cancer cells amd3100 is in phase iii trials to enhance the effects of chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia aml to obtain similar compounds an efficient general synthetic scheme was developed using readily available amino acid building blocks to evaluate these compounds several cell-based assays were established including a 2-day attachment assay cxcr4 hiv-1 magi a 6-day infection assay peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc and t-tropic hiv to initiate the signaling pathway via cxcr4 receptor cxcl12 also known as sdf-1 binds to the receptor to characterize the activity of any compound found to be active in the above assays a radio-ligand displacement assay 125i-labeled sdf-1 in cem cells was devised tiq-15 was active in both the magi and sdf-1 assays and it had good drug-like properties but needs optimizationa further aim became apparent  the potential to target both cxcr4 and ccr5 there is considerable sequence homology 65 similarity of which 33 is identical the crystal structures have similar binding pockets in the literature amd3451 had dual activity starting with the aldrich database 5 million compounds and using virtual screening for binding to both ccr5 and cxcr4 the top 300 compounds were identified of these 38 compounds were purchased and tested magi to yield 13 compounds with activity at 100 m 3 of these active at 10 m one of these compound 2 had good activity in the magi ccr5 and magi cxcr4 assays ic50
  38 and 08 m respectively it was a surprise to find that compound 2 was also active as a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nnrti of hiv the general synthetic route to similar compounds was shown in three weeks more than 50 compounds were synthesized having three parameters binding to receptors ccr5 cxcr4 and nnrti would make structureactivity-relationships sar studies challenging it was decided to focus on the binding to the two receptors from these compound 3 fig 5
 was selected ic50
  021 and 018 m respectively as an nnrti it was active at 10 m interestingly in the 125i-sdf-1 displacement assay there was no effect even at 1 mm may it be an advantage to have a compound able to inhibit the binding of hiv to the receptor but be unable to displace sdf-1another research approach has been to synthesize compounds containing the linking part of amd-3100 table 1
 this work led to q-122 msx-122 with several major advantages it does displace another compound tn-14003 bound to cxcr4 but does not displace 125i-sdf-1 the crystal structure of tn-14003 bound to cxcr4 is known q-122 msx0122 showed activity in two cancer models using micein pre-clinical testing no toxicity was seen with doses up to 600 mgkg in dogs or monkeys two phase ia trials have been completed  a single ascending dose study up to 400 mg in healthy volunteers and 56 daily doses in late stage solid tumor patients no toxicity was noted in these trials in the latter trial a woman who had fallopian tube cancer had a complete remission of her hot flashes during the dosing period therefore a phase ib study was done in women with breast cancer taking tamoxifen such patients can be on drug for 10 years and most up to 80 are subject to hot flashes the approved products for post-menopausal hot flashes are contra-indicated in cancer patients in both dose groups 100 and 200 mg q-122 showed reductions in hot flashes encouragingly some subjects had a complete response going from 50 hot flashesweek to zero alongside the response in the primary end-point there were improvements in various secondary end-points the drug had a good safety profile the mechanism for this effect is unknownit seems surprising that an antiviral research program can be the source of the first potential therapy to treat hot flashes in the large group of women on tamoxifen therapy who could have predicted that this would be the outcomeerica described how she was intrigued by viruses  they encode so few proteins yet get so much function from them for example filoviruses like ebola encode 8 proteins and arenaviruses such as lassa encode just 4 proteins yet these proteins perform about 60 functions within the life cycle of the virus another example the filovirus matrix protein vp40 is responsible for assembly budding transcriptional control and sometimes immunosuppression how is this done erica suggests that one answer is that these viral proteins are able to remodel repurpose and rearrange themselves to extend their functional complexityerica showed us the structures of the surface glycoprotein gp of ebola and marburg viruses first just the protein and then as the fully glycosylated form as it exists on the viral surface the extensive coating of sugar residues hides part of the protein from immune surveillance this complete fully glycosylated form does not bind to the receptor the sugar-linked residues are cleaved off to leave a naked protein and the receptor binding site becomes exposed we know that ebola survivors have effective antibodies but what can be protective when so many protein sites are hiddenhuman antibody kz52 was obtained from an ebola survivor 1995 this antibody works in the test tube in mice and in guinea pigs but does not protect monkeys up to 2007 kz52 was the best antibody against ebola was there still a way forward during 20112012 several groups showed that combinations of antibodies are protective in monkeys for example mb-003 from the united states army medical research institute of infectious diseases usamriid is a cocktail of three antibodies two binding to sites on the mucin domain the third to the gp glycan cap which is cleaved off in the endosome although this cocktail does not work well in vitro it does protect monkeys but how is it that kz52 works well in vitro but not in monkeys whereas mb-003 works in monkeys but not in vitro there are many unanswered questions how many antibodies which are best what assay can there be synergy to resolve such a complex set of unknowns a large sample set is requiredthe viral hemorrhagic fever immunotherapeutic consortium vhfic is a global collaboration to evaluate all available monoclonal antibodies mabs to ebola with the eventual aim to repeat this later with other viruses erica credited john dye as the major player in bringing all the interested parties together to form the vhfic initially the tortoise path was set up samples of all the antibodies were sent to ericas laboratory for coding and then sent to all the collaborators to test in their various assays and to determine the binding sites initial results suggested that antibodies binding to the top of the ebola gp did not give good neutralization in vitro but were protective whereas antibodies binding to the lower part gave good neutralization and may be protectivein parallel with the tortoise track a hare track was initiated using 6 antibodies from two current combinations it was envisaged that a focus on structure determination and in vivo efficacy could lead quickly to a reasonably efficacious product as it turned out this approach was fortuitous because the case zero of the current ebola outbreak was in december 2013 and zmapp which emerged from the hare track was discovered about february 2014 in august 2014 zmapp was used on a compassionate basis to treat health care workers repatriated to the usa zmapp consists of three antibodies 13c6 binds to the top of the gp and recruits the immune system 2g4 binds to the base of gp and 4g7 also binds to base of gp as the latter two antibodies are similar to kz52 they enable the combination to be active in the neutralization test but also they contribute to the protection which is given by the 13c6 antibody are antibodies that bind to the mucin necessary for protectionafter the first 7 months of the tortoise approach and 81 mabs much has been learnt there are mabs which bind to various parts of the ebola gp number of mabs gp1 core 15 fusion loop 2 base of gp2 8 glycan cap 17 mucin 16 and 23 mabs are still undefined usamriid carried out the protection test in mice ranking mabs on  survival of 10 mice those mabs binding to the base of gp2 gave the better protection 50100 these are similar to kz52 and to 2 of 3 mabs in zmapp there were other mabs giving about 50 protection in mice which could be considered for inclusion in a combination those mabs which bound to the gp1 top gp1 core glycan cap or mucin gave protection but no strong neutralization those mabs which bound to the base of gp gave both protection and neutralization but there was only a rough correlation the explanation is that the gp is remodeled the mucin and glycan cap are removed and therefore the core protein is not neutralizedas an example of an arenavirus nucleoprotein np erica chose lassa virus erica compared the np to a multifunction penknife  having roles in nucleocapsid assembly immunosuppression virion incorporation and regulation of polymerase the n-terminal and c-terminal domains open up to reveal a new site predicted to be the rna-binding site but the rna gate on the revealed surface of the n-terminal domain has to open before ssrna can bind to it in addition the c-terminal domain has a role in immunosuppression it is folded so that it becomes an exonuclease able to digest dsrna how these functions are balanced is still unknownin ebola and marburg viruses the vp40 protein alone can self-assemble to form virus-like particles it also controls transcription in 2000 the structure of the monomer was determined in 2003 an octameric ring structure was discovered eight n-terminal domains bound together to form the ring with the c-terminal domains in the center of the ring in 2013 sec-mals a light scattering device used to determine molecular weight of proteins proved that vp40 can exist as a dimer using mutants it was found that the butterfly-shaped dimer but not the octameric ring was essential for virus assembly the dimers can further assemble and rearrange to form zigzag-shaped hexamers which lead to virus assembly however although octameric rings are not essential for virus assembly mutants which prevent octameric ring formation are nonetheless lethal for virus replication the ring controls transcription in conclusion vp40 can form dimers for trafficking about the cell octameric rings to control transcription and hexamers for virion assemblythe traditional view is that a gene encodes the protein which folds so that the protein is able to perform one function working with ebola virus has taught us that although current computer programs follow the traditional view nature uses one protein folded in different ways to perform different functions with vp40 we see one gene encodes one protein which can fold and assemble into three distinct forms each able to perform its own function erica likened vp40 to a transformer a childs toy which can be a robot or refolded to become a truck  one form can make rna the other transport the virionlooking to the future one can anticipate that multifunctional proteins similar to vp40 will be found with other viruses  will some patterns emerge will we be able to give computer programs new rules looking beyond viruses what may we find may there be some human proteins which can fold into two forms and may this be connected with disease andor drug therapyraffaele started his presentation with three introductory slides the main points highlighted140 million people are estimated to be infected with hepatitis c virus hcv3 millionyear are newly infected15 will die after 2030 years of chronic infectionno vaccine is available
however there is good news  hcv is curable because there is no nuclear integration no dna reservoir and no latency the objective of therapy is a cure defined as a sustained virological response svr in which patients remain hcv-free for 12 weeks svr12 after the end of therapy virus elimination is associated with a reduced risk of liver cirrhosis and cancer the third slide gave the milestones in the therapy of hcv genotype 1 starting in 1991 with interferon alpha ifn 711 cure rate in 2001 with pegifn and rbv 4246 in 2011 with the addition of protease inhibitors pis 6775 and in 2014 sofosbuvir usually with another antiviral 93100raffaele gave a detailed introduction to hcv its life-cycle and the development of antiviral compounds the main viral targets have been the serine protease ns3ns4a inhibitors with names ending in previr the protein that creates the hcv replication complex ns5a names ending in asvir and the rna polymerase ns5b with names ending in buvir in the slide what have we learnt so far only nucleotide polymerase inhibitors have a good profile for all four key parameters barrier to resistance pangenotypic efficacy antiviral potency and adverse events this provides my justification for focusing on nucleotide analogs as hcv polymerase inhibitors in this summary reportwith nucleosidenucleotide analogs there seems to be a narrow sar for good efficacy against hcv virtually all active compounds having a 2-c-methyl substituent of these there appears to be a narrow sar for safety development of mericitabine roche and inx-089 bms have been terminated only sofosbuvir fig 3 has been approved three others are in development mk-3682 merck ach-3422 achillion and al-335 janssen although these structures have not been disclosed they are believed to have the 2-c-methyl-2-fluoro substituents as in sof sof shows a high genetic barrier to resistance in vitro the s282t mutant shows cross-resistance to 2-c-methyl nucleotides but the resistance to sof is modest 2 to 10-fold and the mutant has low viral fitness although clinically significant resistance to sof had not previously been reported in clinical trials the fda have analyzed clinical specimens by next-generation sequencing they have highlighted three low-frequency ns5b substitutions l159f v321a and s282r which were associated with sof failure and one baseline polymorphism n316 which may potentially reduce sof efficacy in genotype 1bsof has been combined with ledipasvir a ns5a inhibitor to form the first single pill regimen harvoni for hcv therapy ns5a is an interesting target because it has no known enzymatic activity but is crucial for the formation of the hcv membranous web within which hcv rna replicates ns5a is also involved in viral particle assembly and release several new ns5a inhibitors are being developed which have pangenotypic activity first generation ns5a inhibitors including ledipasvir have a low barrier to resistance but those in development elbasvir merck ach-3102 and gs-5816 gilead have a higher barrier to resistance and are endowed with pan-genotypic activitythere are now various ifn-free options for potential hcv therapies although there are different combinations with efficacy against genotypes 1 and 4 only sof-containing regimens are active against all genotypes 16 the best being sof with daclatasvir in clinical use this combination once daily for 1224 weeks shows activity against genotypes 14 furthermore initial data indicate that this combination will be effective against genotypes 5 and 6 in phase iii trials the combination of sof with gileads new ns5a inhibitor gs-5816 is being tested at once-daily dosing for 812 weeks against all genotypes other ifn-free combination are currently being tested in phase ii clinical trials aimed at developing what today is considered an aspirational regimen once daily single pill 8 weeks 100 svr12 for all genotypeslooking to the future one can envisage eradication of hcv at least in some areas but there remain serious hurdles one being that there are many undiagnosed hcv infections currently cost tends to limit prescription to patients with advanced disease but inclusion of patients who may spread the disease will become more important although a few patients with chronic hepatitis b achieve a functional cure after years of therapy hepatitis c is the first chronic viral infection to be cured efficiently by antiviral compounds it seems that 100 svr in all treated patients is within reach this has been a most exciting period for patients and physicians alikefrom 1995 to 2012 mdicins sans frontires msf responded to 14 outbreaks of ebola or marburg hemorrhagic fever in 2014 msfs role in the current ebola outbreak started on the 13th march with an alert from the ministry of health guinea asking for help with an outbreak in which an infection in 15 people had led to 9 deaths on 18th march a msf team arrived in guckdou just 3 days later the infection was identified as ebola on 23rd march just 10 days after the initial alert msf opened their ebola treatment unit etu in guckdou on 25th march the liberian ministry of health notified msf of four ebola deaths the next day msf set up an etu in macenta which is in guinea but close to the border with liberia the next day 27th march four ebola cases were identified in conakry guinea on 1st april msf opened their etu in conakry by this time msf had sent 60 staff out into the field about three weeks later 26th april msf opened their etu in liberia to my mind the speed of this response is truly impressivebetween november 2014 and february 2015 msf were running 10 or more centers in guinea liberia and sierra leone in total msf opened 19 etus 700 beds in 6 countries trained 800 people in europe sent out 1000 people and had 4000 local staff working in their centers because it is difficult to distinguish between the fever caused by malaria and ebola it was usual to treat all patients entering an etu with antimalarial drugs of 9492 people admitted to their etus 5176 were confirmed as being infected with ebola virus also mass antimalarial treatment was distributed to 350000 people in monrovia and 18 million people in the freetown area another service to the community was the distribution of 70000 home protection kitsone of the notable aspects of this ebola outbreak was the risks faced by health care workers  not just the ever present risk of becoming infected but facing hostility from the local community in guinea although msf staff were threatened on a number of occasions forced to withdraw sometimes and had staff suffering minor injuries in attacks no msf staff were killed unfortunately in one incident that led to the deaths of health care workers there was an attack on a guinean health promotion team this incident served as a warning to illustrate the seriousness of the threat posed conspiracy theories spread easily health care workers had difficulties at home for example their children being isolated by their class-mates at school just working in protective gear was stressful  heat exhaustion limited the safe working time to about 40 min in an 8 h shift an individual could be expected to work about 2 h in contact with ebola patients the elaborate protective procedures were successful in greatly limiting the risk of contracting ebola but could not eliminate the risk totally three international staff became infected but were evacuated to their home countries and survived among the locally recruited staff although there were exposures that were linked to workplace events most of the investigations into staff illness found that their chief risk was outside of their work with msf the staff may have had family or friends infected with ebola or performing healthcare activities outside of the msf center naturally these people being healthcare workers and known to have experience with ebola were often under significant pressure in their home communities to provide discreet services in total 28 staff members contracted ebola 14 of whom diedduring this outbreak msf have been carefully collecting data which has enabled them to find factors which were associated with increased survival factors that had little or no effect on survival rates include malefemale month of admission or time from first symptoms to admission it was expected that giving intravenous iv fluid would increase survival at the foya etu up to week 29 mid-july a few patients were receiving iv fluid but this was suspended from weeks 30 to 33 when there was a large increase in new admissions from week 34 onwards an increasing proportion of patients were receiving iv fluid unexpectedly the kaplanmeier survival estimates showed no benefit only two factors did increase the chance of survival age about 1520 years of age was best and viral load at baseline the lower the viral load the greater the chance of survival the latter was the single most important factormsf centers have participated in clinical trials the trial with brincidofovir was terminated due to lack of available trial participants the favipiravir trial is ongoing following publication of an encouraging sign of efficacy in those patients who initially presented with either low or moderate viral loads a trial with convalescent plasma had recruited 93 patients by the end of april in guinea frontline workers are being vaccinated with the merck ebola vaccine n
  390 by the end of april about 800 by mid-june 2015of 5176 confirmed cases of ebola infected patients being cared for in msf centers there were 2449 survivors although the epidemic has had a huge human cost there is a great joy every time a survivor leaves to go home fig 7
 armand sprechers conclusion lets not do this againmichael started his presentation with an introduction to hcv including data confirming that a svr12 or svr24 did indeed represent a cure of 366 patients who had achieved a svr after ifn therapy only 3 relapsed over the next 5 years a sustained response rate of 994 over a ten-year period a svr virtually eliminated the risk of dying due to liver-related disease survival was compared to an age- and sex-matched dutch population patients without svr had significantly greater risk of dying p
  0001 whereas those with svr had a normal life span p
  06 furthermore symptoms due to hcv infection are not just related to liver disease but there are various other manifestations that limit professional and social life the classification of hcv strains is continually evolving  a recent special issue in hepatology expanded the classification into 7 genotypes and 67 subtypesthe therapy of chronic hcv infection has developed since the first hcv pis were approved in 2011 during the period 20112014 the addition of a pi to pegifn increased the cure rate from about 45 to about 75 but this was only for genotype 1 the duration of therapy was still long 48 weeks side effects were common and the treatment protocol complex with the approval of sof in 2014 the duration of therapy with pegifnsof was only 12 weeks and the cure rate approached 90 also in 2014 simeprevir smv pi active against genotypes 1 and 4 daclatasvir ns5a inhibitor active against all genotypes and sofledipasvir harvoni genotypes 1 4 5 and 6 were approved various antiviral combinations allowed the exploration of ifn-free therapies in hanover januaryjune 2014 sofrbv n
  207 was compared with a pi-based therapy n
  208 the overall cure rate with sofrbv 52 was much higher than with the pi therapy 21 due to more patients being eligible for treatment 74 vs 50 better adherence 95 vs 49 and better svr 70 vs 42 respectively by september 2014 in a survey with 2185 patients in usa and europe 97 from german sites 51 of patients were on sofsmv 24 on sofpegifnrbv 15 on sofsmvrbv and 10 on sofrbv sof had become the backbone of therapies for chronic hepatitis cin 2015 a combination of ombitasvirparitaprevirritonavir genotypes 1 and 4 and dasabuvir non-nucleoside inhibitor of hcv polymerase genotype 1 were approved for the therapy of genotype 1 therapy with ombitasvirparitaprevir and dasabuvir gave svr  95 similar to that achieved with harvoni but the latter was a simple one pillday treatment treatment guidelines are changing rapidly  the european association for the study of the liver easl guidelines of april 2014 have been superseded by those of april 2015 treatment should be prioritized for patients with significant liver disease co-infection with hiv or hbv debilitating fatigue or at risk of transmitting hcv the choice of therapy depends on several factors but perhaps the more important are the genotype and the stage of liver disease moderate compensated or severe decompensated cirrhosis preferred treatment options usually include sof but the hardest-to-treat patients are those with genotype 3 with cirrhosis in such patients other options may be better even including pegifn at least for the present also for patients with renal insufficiency ombitasvirparitaprevirdasabuvir is a preferred option genotypes1 and 4 with sofdaclatasvir or pegifnsof for the other genotypeslooking ahead grazoprevirelbasvir combination is completing phase iii trials it seems to be well tolerated in patients with renal insufficiency including those on dialysis hcv resistance has emerged as a problem with ledipasvir a component of harvoni in patients treated with ledipasvir without sof essentially all patients ended treatment with resistant virus which seems to be fully competent the mutant virus persisting for more than 48 weeks after therapy however the new ns5a inhibitor velpatasvir gs 5816 is active against all genotypes and against hcv strains and mutants resistant to ledipasvir also it appears to have a high genetic barrier to resistance velpatasvir will be used with sof as a fixed-dose combination pill approvals for both grazoprevirelbasvir and sofvelpatasvir are expected in early 2016 the second nucleoside analog to receive approval about late 2016 for hcv therapy may be mk-3682 it seems possible that all patients with hcv infection so long as their liver disease is not too severe will be treatable with virtually all patients achieving a cure initially the duration of therapy is likely to be 12 weeks but 8 weeks looks possible for some patient groups so far therapies of 4 weeks have given a substantially reduced proportion of curesa novel approach is to use microrna mir-122 inhibitors at the 26th international conference on antiviral research icar held in san francisco california 2013 there was a presentation on miravirsen vere hodge 2013 within the 5utr of hcv there are two six-nucleotide regions known as seed sites 1 and 2 s1  s2 these sites are highly conserved through all genotypes of hcv and bind to a host micro-rna mir-122 which is present in liver cells this interaction prevents the degradation of the viral rna and thereby enables hcv to replicate miravirsen is a 15-base oligonucleotide containing 8 blocked bases 5-mccmattmgmtcamcamctmcmc-3 it binds to mir-122 and so prevents its binding to viral rna in a small phase ii study the mean reduction in viral load was 3 log10 and 49 patients became hcv rna undetectablein a similar approach a single dose of rg-101 2 or 4 mgkg was administered by sc injection in a placebo controlled phase ii trial n
  28 genotypes 1 3 4 at 4 weeks the mean viral load reductions were 41 log10 and 48 log10 respectively notably seven patients remained hcv rna negative for 20 weeks follow-upin conclusion chronic hcv infection has become a curable disease using well-tolerated simple once daily antiviral therapies presently the main barrier to increase treatment uptake is cost but one may anticipate that costs will decline considering the uptake in france with one of the higher rates of uptake 5 one can calculate that france will have a much reduced hcv-infected population by 2025 within the near future there is the prospect of being able to treat and cure virtually all the high-priority patients hopefully the new therapies expected in 2016 will make it easier to treat all patients irrespective of genotype when one considers how many potential hcv mutants can arise every day in untreated patients the progress with antiviral therapies is a remarkable achievementin 1968 in norwalk ohio usa a bacteria-free filtrate was shown to cause gastroenteritis eventually small virus particles 2735 nm were visualized in 1972 and the cloning of the norwalk virus genome in 1990 showed that the virus belonged to the family caliciviridae between 1995 and 2003 broadly reactive rt-pcr and taqman assays became available noroviruses are now known to be the major cause of epidemic gastroenteritis and food borne illness although norovirus outbreaks in cruise ships get a lot of publicity in the usa 20102011 most outbreaks 59 were in long-term care homes and only 4 in cruise ships the more vulnerable populations are the elderly increased risk of hospitalization and death children symptoms can last for 7 days and virus shedding can continue for 6 weeks or more and the immunocompromised chronic gastroenteritis may last months to years in countries with routine rotavirus vaccination noroviruses are the major cause of severe childhood diarrheait is easy to understand why outbreaks in semi-closed environments are difficult to control and quickly become extensive whereas an infectious dose is about 20 virus particles a symptomatic patient may be shedding about 1091012 virus particlesg stool and shedding can persist for 30 days in addition about 30 of the individuals may be asymptomatic but shedding virus albeit 100-fold less but still many times an infectious dose the gut microbiota could have an important role in the infection infectious particles can remain on surfaces for up to 2 weeks virtually all individuals will be susceptible due to the great diversity of strains and the lack of long-lasting immunityvaccines use recombinant proteins to form virus-like particles rvlp based on the self-assembly of vp1 these have shown slight efficacy and major challenges remain  cross-protection against the many strains and the duration of immunity there are no approved drugs to treat norovirus infectionsas a possible assay to test for potential therapies the use of murine norovirus mnv has been investigated in wild-type mice mnv gives an asymptomatic infection but in mice with innate immune deficiency there is diarrhea either acute or chronic two compounds were used to evaluate the assays 2-c-methylcytidine 2cmc and favipiravir the prodrug of 2cmc valopicitabine was being developed as an anti-hcv drug favipiravir t-705 has been licensed in japan for influenza treatment and is in phase iii in the usa in a mnv cell culture assay 2cmc was active ec50
  2 m but favipiravir was poorly active in an acute mnv infection 2cmc administered 1 h before infection gave 100 protection vs no survivors in the control group and decreasing protection when given 12 24 or 48 h pi 90 50 and 40 survival respectively in a chronic infection 2cmc or t-705 were administered from day 7 for 14 days and again from day 55 for 14 days during treatment 2cmc showed good reductions in viral loads but these returned to control levels when off treatment t-705 was essentially inactive in these mnv assays 2cmc would be a good positive controlever since pasteurs rabies vaccine derived from rabbit spinal cord timely post-exposure prophylaxis pep has successfully protected subjects from clinical disease the semple and fuenzalida vaccines use killed virus derived from sheep brain and mouse brain respectively these vaccines were used widely but are no longer recommended rabies virus grown in cell cultures then inactivated is used in current vaccines which promote a good antibody response and have a better safety profile than the tissue-derived vaccines rabies is normally transmitted from an infected mammal via a bite often into a muscle the incubation period is very variable from 2 weeks to 7 years but usually about 2 months it is this long incubation period that enables pep to protect the subject from clinical disease once the virus gets to the brain mortality is essentially 100 worldwide 20 million people receive pep each year nevertheless about 60000year die of rabies  the majority of these not receiving any pep in some countries vaccine cost remains a limiting factorwhen the exposure is severe both vaccine and immunoglobulin are administered but this raises the cost substantially how can the cost be reduced and availability increased one approach is to use plants to produce monoclonal antibodies mabs potential advantages include a reduced risk of contamination with animalhuman pathogens although the mabs have plant-specific glycans they neutralize rabies virus as efficiently as the original mabs hamsters were inoculated with rabies virus in the leg muscle and treated with the plant-derived antibodies 63713 or e559 at 24 h post infection pi without co-administration of rabies vaccine at 14 days pi there were 89 and 99 survivors respectively compared to 04 in the control group these two mabs each neutralize a broad range of virus isolates there is the potential to combine these mabs for therapy because they bind to different epitopesalthough there is the potential to grow transgenic plants in developing countries it would be a great advantage to be able to use an existing oral antiviral compound several approaches have been tried without success favipiravir t-705 is licensed in japan for influenza therapy and it is known to be active against many rna viruses a cell culture assay provided the first evidence for the activity of favipiravir against rabies virus in a preliminary test in mice with virus inoculated directly into the brain there was essentially no protection provided by favipiravir treatment however this was certainly a severe test which does not represent the human clinical situation in which the incubation period is commonly 2 months it is hoped that further evaluation of favipiravir will continue one can build on the experience with favipiravir used to treat patients with ebola infection in the current outbreak in west africa  it can be used safely at higher doses than for influenza infections and there was an indication that favipiravir therapy was beneficial to those patients whose levels of ebola virus at the time of presentation were low or moderate is it possible that the same may be true for patients with rabies virus infection when the exposure has been less severedengue virus denv is an emerging disease of tropical and sub-tropical regions the transmission cycle includes species of aedes mosquito  the spread of denv seems to be due to the spread of these mosquitoes there are 4 serotypes of denv prior infection with one serotype is protective against the same serotype but may enhance the severity of infection with another serotype via antibody-enhanced entry of the virus into cellsclinical symptoms can range from mild to severe the global burden has been estimated to be about 2 million severe cases of which 21000 lead to death current treatment is supportive care a tetravalent vaccine has been tested in young children both in latin america and asia it was partially effective in preventing clinical disease but very effective in preventing serious disease additionally it would be useful to have available a treatment to help patients with severe disease typically the virus load is already declining by the time a patient has serious symptoms however clinical trials showed that the use of steroids was not beneficialbalapiravir is a nucleoside analog which was being developed for hcv but stopped due to safety concerns in patients on weeksmonths of therapy a trial with balapiravir showed no benefit in denv infection similarly other potential antivirals have been evaluated in clinical trials although none has been efficacious these trials have given the oxford university clinical research unit good experience in organizing trials there is great potential to collaborate with other groups for example with the university of marseilles which is exploring inhibitors of viral rna-dependent rna polymerasehepatitis e virus hev was first described as water-borne hepatitis in 1980 and designated as hev in 1983 hev is a spherical positive-stranded rna virus belonging to the family hepeviridae the virus codes for a protease helicase and polymerase potential antiviral targets there are 5 genotypes genotype 5 does not infect humans but only one serotype in europe and usa the most common genotype is 3 but genotype 1 is particularly severe in pregnant women in india and asia genotypes 1 and 4 are common in germany from 2001 to 2006 there were 50 casesyear but since 2007 the number of cases has been increasing to 670 in 2014 worldwide hev infection causes about 70000 deathsyearhev genotype 3 has been detected in various mammals including pigs there is an increased seroprevalence in individuals in contact with pigs and transmission of hev via pork meat has been recorded in the general immunocompetent population hev usually causes a mild to moderate self-limiting disease however in immunocompromised patients such as transplant patients the prevalence of chronic hev is about 14 with progression to cirrhosis within 12 years and likely leading to deathdiagnostic tests for hev are of variable quality for example 5 hev rt-pcr assays were compared using 47 samples known to contain hev the detection rates were 100 100 97 97 and 83 this has implications for testing blood donations and blood products the annual incidence of hev infection in blood donors in germany is about 035 a prevalence and transmission study in southeast england noted that the prevalence of hev genotype 3 in the population including blood donors is unknown but probably widespread and that hev had been detected in pooled plasma samplesribavirin rbv can be used to treat hev infected patients in a case series in hannover one patient had severe acute infection genotype 1 and 11 patients had chronic hepatitis genotype 3 they were treated with rbv 600800 mgday for 5 months nine patients achieved svr one relapsed and one developed resistant virus interestingly the hev-mutant had increased viral fitness in a larger study n
  59 the median duration of rbv therapy was 3 months the majority of patients 46 achieved svr unfortunately rbv use is contra-indicated in pregnant women another compound with apparent activity against hev is mycophenolate  no chronic hev is seen in heart transplant patients receiving mycophenolatewith only one serotype a vaccine for hev seems to be a realistic possibility a recombinant hev vaccine rhev containing the capsid protein was being developed by glaxosmithkline gsk it was evaluated in a phase ii trial the vaccine was administered at months 0 1 and 6 the subjects were followed to day 800 the primary end-point was the number having confirmed hev infection from day 14 after the 3rd vaccine dose there were 69 subjects who had hev 3 in the vaccine group 03 and 66 in the placebo group 74 p
  0001 the efficacy of the vaccine was 955 unfortunately this vaccine has not been progressed to phase iii trialsin china an attenuated virus vaccine was evaluated in a large phase iii trial n
  56000 each group the subjects were followed for 55 months after the first dose there were 60 subjects who had hev infection 7 in the vaccine group 53 in the placebo group p
  0001 the vaccine efficacy was 868 although this vaccine is available in china there seem to be no plans to evaluate this vaccine in the usa or europe however the world health organization who have recently published a statement hepatitis e vaccine who position paper may 2015 in a factsheet 280 updated july 2015 their conclusions weredue to the lack of sufficient information on safety immunogenicity and efficacy in the following population subgroups who does not recommend routine use of the vaccine in children aged 16 years pregnant women chronic liver disease patients and patients on organ transplant waiting lists and travellersthere may be special situations such as outbreaks where the risk of hepatitis e or of its complications or mortality is particularly high the current who position concerning routine programmes should not preclude the use of the vaccine in these specific situations
there seems to be little prospect of a vaccine becoming widely available in the foreseeable future and ribavirin cannot be used in certain high need patients for example pregnant women therefore there is an urgent need to have safer and more efficacious drugs to treat hev infectionsin their keynote lectures raffaele de francesco and michael manns have described the exciting advances in antiviral therapies for treating chronic hepatitis c although the current therapies give high cure rates in many cases the cure rates are rather lower in those patients with genotype 3 andor have very advanced liver disease hopefully the new combination of sof velpatasvir approval target date early 2016 will effectively treat patients with genotype 3 for patients with very advanced liver disease liver transplantation will remain as an option but there is universal re-infection of the graft after transplantation hcv quasispecies evolve to generate hcv variants which have enhanced efficiency of viral entry into cells have altered receptor use and are poorly neutralized by patients antibodies viral entry is regarded as a good target for prevention and therapy of liver graft infectionthere are several host proteins which are involved in the entry of hcv into a cell but antibodies to one of these claudin-1 cldn1 has shown promising efficacy with a good safety profile cldn1-specific antibodies cldn1-mab prevent infection in cell culture models and show strong synergy with antiviral compounds they are effective with all genotypes although genotypes 2a and 6 require about a ten-fold higher dose than the other genotypes various functional assays have not revealed any toxicities in upa-scid mice grafted with human hepatocytes cldn1 expression and localization is similar to that in human liver this scid mouse model was used for several proof-of-concept studies to test for prevention of infection cldn1-mab 500 g was administered by intraperitoneal ip injection at time of infection with hcv genotype 1b and twice more in the first week there were good circulating levels of cldn1-mab to about the middle of the second week but reducing to almost baseline at week 2 in the control group each of 5 mice had rapidly increasing hcv loads during the first two weeks then reaching a plateau to 6 weeks all 5 of the mice treated with cldn1-mab had undetectable hcv levels through to 6 weeks to test for efficacy in scid mice chronically infected with hcv genotype 2a cldn1-mab was administered weekly for 4 doses 500 g ipdose in the control mice n
  4 hcv loads remained high in the treated group n
  5 the viral loads became undetectable during the four-week treatment period in 4 mice hcv remained undetectable to week 11 in a single mouse the mab levels were low and this may account for the relapse after the end of therapy however this virus showed no resistance to cldn1-mab using this model monotherapy with cldn1-mab was shown to be active against all genotypes there was no emergence of resistance and no signs of toxicity longer treatment times 7 weeks results in the elimination of hcv-infected hepatocytes in this mouse modelthis good efficacy with cldn1-mab appears to be due to its ability to inhibit cellcell transmission over time the hcv-infected cells are replaced by new uninfected cells it is envisaged that cldn1-mab therapy offers an efficient and safe antiviral strategy possibly in combination with antiviral compounds for the prevention of liver graft infection thinking more broadly this approach may be used to treat infections caused by other viruses such as dengue coxsackievirus and adenovirusrespiratory syncytial virus rsv is a highly successful virus infecting virtually every child by 2 years of age world-wide autumn is the peak season for rsv infections in the usa an ongoing trial is evaluating a potential link between asthma rsv and hospitalization for a long time there has been uncertainty whether the symptoms of rsv infection are caused directly by the virus or via the induced stimulation of the immune system recent work has shown that many respiratory cells contain rsv all those cells with cilia becoming infected there is no big influx of immune inflammatory cells the virus load peaks about 3 days after the start of symptoms viral load is a predictor for hospitalization and virus clearance is associated with recovery these findings have led to the conclusion that rsv directly causes the disease therefore there is a potential role for antiviral therapy although the window of opportunity remains uncertainpalivizumab a mab which binds to the fusion protein of rsv is the first drug licensed to prevent rsv infections motavizumab is closely related to palivizumab but has improved binding to the fusion protein both these mabs are effective in preventing rsv disease but their role in reducing established disease is still uncertaings-5806 fig 8

  043 nmin an experimental viral challenge trial healthy adult volunteers were inoculated with well-characterized strain of rsv on day 0 the incubation period varied from 1 to 7 days the volunteers were monitored for the first detection of virus in upper respiratory tract usually occurring about 25 days post inoculation therapy was started about 56 h after the first detection of virus in nasal wash gs-5806 was evaluated in a dose-ranging challenge study about 100 volunteers comprising 7 dose groups and one placebo group viral loads mucus weights and total symptom scores were measured oral dosing of gs-5806 once daily reduced the rsv replication and suppressed the infection-associated clinical symptoms in dose-dependent manner dosing of the drug for 5 days with the initial dose of 50 mg followed by 4 doses of 25 mg produced the strongest therapeutic effect with a peak viral load suppression of 4 log10 and a 10-fold reduced auc of clinical symptoms compared to placebo treatmentals-8176 is the oral prodrug of a nucleoside analog als-8112 fig 9

  0001 and p
  005 respectively there are ongoing phase ii studies in young children hospitalized with rsv infection in another volunteer study rsv and influenza were compared both viral loads and symptom scores increased later with rsv than influenza this suggests that the window of opportunity for antiviral therapy will be greater for infections with rsv than influenzaddx3 is one of the human dead-box rna helicases which contain the conserved motif with amino acid sequence dead asp-glu-ala-asp which gave this family of proteins the name dead-box the focus of this presentation was to investigate the potential antiviral benefit which could be obtained by the inhibition of ddx3 a cellular cofactor the potential benefits are easy to identify ddx3 is involved in several viral infections but not all by the same mechanism for hiv the newly synthesized viral rna is exported through the nuclear membrane via binding to ddx3 for hcv ddx3 interacts with the viral core protein which helps build the nucleocapsid for japanese encephalitis virus jev ddx3 binds to the viral rna during replication for poxvirus ddx3 binds to the viral k7 protein which is essential to overcome the ifn-mediated cellular response both west nile virus wnv and dengue virus dnv are dependent on ddx3 although the mechanism is not knownwhat harmful effects may be caused by inhibition of ddx3 it has been implicated to play a role in various processes including rna metabolism transcription splicing mrna nuclear export and translation however there are two encouraging findings ddx3 is over-expressed in several aggressive cancers and knock-down of ddx3 inhibits hiv replication but does not seem to affect cell viabilityddx3 has two sites of particular interest an atpase binding site and typical helicase catalytic site the crystal structure of ddx3 is known but only for the protein in an open form with the two sub-domains connected by a flexible linker one domain has the atpase binding site but the typical conserved motifs for a helicase are distributed between the two domains to construct a model of ddx3 in the closed conformation two approaches were tried starting with the human protein ddx48 homology 37 or the drosophila vasa equivalent to ddx3 the model resulting from the first approach did not have enough space for the rna strand but the second approach led to a model in which the rna strand fitted perfectlyusing in silico screening of commercial databases led to several hits both for the atpase site and the helicase site the latter seemed to have more potential for achieving selectivity for inhibition of ddx3  the major focus was on the optimization of compounds binding to the helicase site several compounds were inhibitors of ddx3 but inactive as inhibitors of ddx1 the three most active compounds inhibited at least two of the panel of 5 viruses but only one had results for all 5 viruses this is the first demonstration of small molecules able to target an active site of ddx3 and inhibit its activity also it is the first time that a single ddx3 inhibitor has shown activity against different virusesalthough this was a good demonstration of the concept to assess safety it is important to compare like with like inhibition of viral replication with inhibition of cellular replication especially for hiv and hcv the safety profiles of current drugs set a very high standard which would have to be matched for any new therapy studies are still ongoing in that direction on the other hand this approach may lead to anti-cancer treatments interesting data has just been received and will be published in due courseat previous icars chris has reported on his cyclosal approach to deliver the nucleoside monophosphate nmp into a cell although there are many compounds which have poor antiviral activity due to inefficient phosphorylation to the monophosphate mp the limiting step may be at the phosphorylation to the di- or triphosphate dp tp the focus of this presentation was the development of a strategy to synthesize prodrugs of nucleoside-triphosphates ntpsif a ntp is fully masked it becomes chemically labile in water the chemical stability is much improved if there is a charge on the alpha  and beta  phosphorus atoms initially for ease of synthesis the terminal phosphorus was protected with two identical masking groups in aqueous phosphate buffered saline pbs essentially no ntp was formed at 20 h but it was the predominant form at 432 h when tripppro-d4t-tp was incubated with pig liver esterase the first masking group was removed within 5 min the second much more slowly by 24 h the predominant form was the ntp with a very small amount of the ndp although symmetrical tripppro-nucleotides were able to penetrate into cells high lipophilicity was associated with desirable high transport into cells but also with high stability which led to greater amounts of nmp and ndp when there are two different masking groups one highly lipophilic the other less so the esterase cleaves the less lipophilic group first quickly followed by chemical cleavage of the remaining part of that masking group creating a charge on the terminal phosphorus atom when the second ester is cleaved the specificity for tp formation is highto demonstrate this approach d4t-dp had one masking group with a methyl group the other with c9h19 fig 10
 this prodrug was incubated with cell extracts by 4 min most of the methyl ester had been cleaved between about 15 and 60 min d4t-dp was formed with essentially no d4t-mp similarly ch3c9h19-dippro-azt-dp was prepared but in this test it was compared with the symmetrical c9h19-dippro-azt-dp the ratios of azt-dpazt-mp were 51 and 151 respectively recently comparable results were obtained in the case of the triphosphate derivatives again the non-symmetric derivatives gave better selectivity in the delivery of the tp versus the dpto demonstrate that such masked ntps can enter cells and regenerate the ntp inside cells the symmetrical c8h17-tripppro-bcna-tp fig 11
 was incubated with cem cells a lymphoblastoid cd4 t-cell line after incubation for 60 min considerable amounts of bcna-tp were detected in the cell extracts in addition to bcna-dp after incubation for 180 min bcna-tp has been dephosphorylated to give bcna-dp as the major product as well as some amount of bcna-mp in contrast incubation of the parent nucleoside bcna did not give any trace of phosphorylated bcna metabolites here only the parent nucleoside was detected an unsymmetrical version of bcna-tp has been synthesized and is being evaluatedthe denv polymerase is an attractive target for antivirals as the ns5 protein which contains the polymerase is the most conserved protein among the four serotypes of denv although the crystal structure of the free denv polymerase is known the polymerase with bound template and nascent rna strands ternary complex has not been crystallized the aim of this project was to create a model of the ternary complex of denv polymerase and then to explore the conformational changes as the polymerase initiates and then elongates the viral rnaa starting point was the crystal structure of the ternary complex of hcv polymerase the template and nascent rna strands were imported from the hcv polymerase into the denv polymerase two mg2 ions were added to the active site and the model refined via energy minimization this model was validated by docking known polymerase inhibitors the model stability was confirmed by a molecular dynamics md simulation the mg2 ions and nucleic acid appeared to be well positioned in this model of the ternary complexin the free denv polymerase crystal structure there are two loops loop a from residues 406 to 420 and loop b from residues 457 to 469 having unknown structures and a known priming loop to model the initiation complex first two mg2 ions were added to the active site as in the above model loops a and b were built according to the amino acid sequence and the priming loop residues 782796 was modeled in the presence of a short double-stranded ds rna finally an additional single-stranded ss rna was introduced through a putative tunnel as the ssrna template enters the active site it is encircled by three loops including a and b the next step was to include a longer dsrna into the model representative of the elongation phase the priming loop was re-modeled to accommodate it and the complex submitted to a md simulation specific residues in the priming loop gained contact with the nascent rna strandthese models indicate that the changing conformation of the loops especially loop a and the priming loop play an important role in enabling the polymerase to perform the different functions required for replication of viral rna synthesis initiation and elongation these results are likely to be helpful in the design of denv polymerase inhibitorschikungunya virus chikv was first isolated in 1952 from a patient in tanzania since then there have been successive outbreaks in africa the first documented epidemic in asia bangkok was in 1958 by 2005 chikv virus had spread to india and much of tropical south-east asia la runion island which is east of madagascar is a french territory with health care comparable to that in france in 2005 the first cases of chikv infections occurred in february and the outbreak peaked in may 450 casesweek the following january the epidemic spread rapidly peaking at the end of january 45000 casesweek by june 2006 there had been 266000 cases about 13 of the island population with such an extensive outbreak in an area with good health facilities some clinical aspects previously only suspected eg myocarditis were confirmed and other aspects were newly observed eg neurologic forms not just in children but also in adults fulminant hepatitis renal failure elderly patients were at slightly increased risk of mortality but generally most patients recovered although the severe arthralgia may persist for months even yearsthere are many genotypes of chikv but these are related to three major lineages i eastern central south african ecsa which includes the indian sub-lineage ii asian lineage and iii the west african lineage the latter having never produced a large outbreak but sporadic cases the common host for chikv has been aedes aegypti which is restricted to tropical regions but aedes albopictus survives in slightly cooler regions as of january 2015 in europe ae aegypti is established only in the coastal regions around the east of the black sea and in the portuguese island of madeira from 2004 to january 2015 ae albopictus has invaded and become established first in the north east costal region of italy and then spreading to much of the mediterranean coast from spain to greece within the ecsa lineage only there have been important mutations in particular a226v in the e1 glycoprotein which increases viral replication in the mosquito ae albopictus this expanding range of ae albopictus has presented chikv with an new opportunityuntil 2007 chikv had not been known to circulate in europe in 2007 a single individual returning to italy from india led to an outbreak of 197 cases in september 2010 the first two local cases were recorded in south-eastern france followed in 2014 with a cluster of 21 cases in montpellier franceat least in recent times see below chikv had not been reported in the new world until november 2013 in the caribbean island st martin five patients had a dengue-like fever but later shown to have chikv infection asian lineage although the asian lineage of chikv was the initial strain in the new world in 2014 the ecsa lineage was recently identified as the cause of a large outbreak in brazil concomitantly today there have been over 12 million cases in the new world also there is potential for the caribbean chikv to spread to france  about 400 imported cases are known to have been in regions of france where ae albopictus is presentthis account of chikv ended with an unexpected twist  had this virus spread to the caribbean and the americas previously there may have been a chikv epidemic in 18271828 as recorded by henry dickson professor of medicine south carolina usa in a recent publication halstead 2015 it was proposed that the epidemic in 18271828 then called dengue had the characteristics of chikvcchfv is a member of the family bunyaviridae the rna genome in 3 segments designated l m and s transmission is by the bites of infected ticks the main vector being hyalomma marginatum or by direct contact with blood or tissues of viremic patients or livestock various environmental factors influence tick survival and abundance the infection is seasonal march to november and the group who are at higher risk of infection are those in contact with livestock the course of disease  incubation period 37 days fever and peak viremia next 17 days followed by a hemorrhagic phase peaking about 3 days later the fatality rate can be up to 30there are no specific treatment options although ribavirin is routinely used its clinical efficacy is unproven and it is not fda approved treatment with favipiravir t-705 may be a better option as it was highly potent in cell culture and in vivo anna briefly mentioned a report using a mouse model oestereich et al 2014 the placebo-treated mice died on days 3 and 4 post infection pi with cchfv 100 pfu with ribavirin the survival time was prolonged but the survival rate was not increased favipiravir was first tested at a high dose 150 mgkg twice daily orally starting 1 h 1 day or 2 days pi and ending on day 8 all these treatments protected mice fully with essentially no evidence of infection or disease only when treatment started 2 days pi minor changes in weight temperature and aspartate amino transferase ast were detected at day 3 but not thereafter virus remained undetectable in blood and organs in all three groups throughout the observation period to provide evidence for infection of the animals in the favipiravir treatment groups the development of cchfv-specific antibodies was investigated 21 days pi only 110 10 of the animals treated 1 h pi developed antibodies whereas 1010 100 of the animals treated from day 1 or 2 pi developed antibodies in a dose ranging study favipiravir 15 and 375 mgkg was administered orally twice daily starting 1 h pi and continuing to day 8 the higher dose gave good protection  no detectable virus in blood throughout the observation period no virus in organs on day 3 and essentially no clinical signs of infection however the lower dose was only marginally active with prolonged survival time but no change in survival rate the authors conclude that these data hold promise for clinical efficacy of favipiravir in human cchfthere is no widely approved vaccine but formalin-inactivated mouse-brain virus is used in bulgaria a novel vaccine with the entire open reading frame orf of the m-segment of cchfv inserted into vaccinia virus was shown to

collaboration between hospital and research laboratory on 4th august a physician in the thessaloniki hospital noted an unusually high number of encephalitis cases the next day samples were sent to the reference laboratory and 1011 cases were shown to be positive for wnv on the night of 910th august mosquito traps were set up a positive pcr test was achieved on 12th august there was a mutation p249h in the ns3 protein previously associated with increased pathogenicity and neuroinvasiveness in humans compared to other strains following this observation reported cases of west nile neuroinvasive disease wnnd in greece have been collected from 2010 to 2013 the average number of cases has been about 100 casesyear but just 14 in 2014 of a total 441 cases in these 5 years 72 were fatal what will 2015 bringphleboviruses belong to the family bunyaviridae the disease varies from asymptomatic to serious cns infections depending on the virus several novel phleboviruses have been detected in the mediterranean region in greece 7 viruses have been reported the disease is seasonal in greece april to october in a small study 494 patients with fever of whom 50 had cns infection were tested for a phlebovirus infection during the period 20102014 there were 43 87 patients with a phlebovirus infection although the proportion of these patients with cns infections varied from year to year it was about 23rdsthere are many tick-borne phleboviruses found in the mediterranean countries as phleboviruses belong to the same family bunyaviridae as cchfv is it possible that favipiravir may have good activity against these phleboviruses favipiravir has been reported to show efficacy in rift valley fever rodent modelscoronaviruses covs infect both humans and animals human covs normally cause symptoms typical for a common cold but in november 2002 we saw the appearance of a severe acute respiratory disease which became known as sars via air travel sars quickly spread around the globe between 1 november 2002 and 10 july 2003 there were 5910 probable cases reported the outbreak was controlled by identification quarantine and isolationin 2012 when a 60 year-old saudi male with fever cough and pneumonia was studied a new cov mers was detected in contrast to sars the new virus did not spread rapidly from march 2012 to march 2015 virtually all of the 1082 confirmed cases of mers were in the middle east just 15 in europe and 10 in the rest of the world for all cases of mers the middle east is the probable source of infection of concern there were 439 deaths 40 there was a large peak of reported cases in aprilmay 2014 but otherwise there are normally a few 50 casesmonth the fact that human cases were found over a relatively long period in the absence of sustained humanhuman transmission led to the search for a local animal reservoir in the middle eastmers-cov is related to bat covs and it replicates in bat cell lines suggesting it enters cells through use of a conserved receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 also known as cd26 was discovered to be a functional receptor for mers-cov replication when either human or bat dpp4 is expressed in non-permissive cos7 cells virus replicates notably dpp4 is present on human epithelial cells of the lower respiratory tract but absent in upper respiratory tract epithelial cells this could explain the poor human to human transmission of mers compared with sarsto investigate which animal could be the source of zoonotic transmission of mers-cov antibodies to various covs were sought in sheep cows goats spanish dromedaries and omani dromedaries although antibodies to sars-cov were not detected in any of these animals antibodies to mers-cov were detected in a few individual spanish dromedaries moreover virtually all the omani dromedaries had high levels of antibodies to mers-cov using camels being presented for slaughter dpp4 expression was detected not only in the lower respiratory tract but also the upper respiratory tract and in the nasal cavity from nasal samples taken from camels of different ages the presence of mers-cov varied with age being more prevalent in younger animals age 1 year clearly virtually all the camels become infected in their first year mers-cov antibodies were detected in a minority of people who work with camels but not in people who have no contact with camels those people with antibodies did not recall having any serious diseasewould it be possible to create a vaccine effective in both camels and humans a recombinant spike protein fragment s1 amino acid aa 1731 from the full length aa 11353 previously shown to bind to bat and human cells may be used as a candidate vaccine not only do human mabs that recognize s1 also neutralize mers-cov in vitro but also expression of the spike protein by a modified vaccinia ankara virus mva-s induces virus neutralizing antibodies in mice therefore this vaccine may be tested in camels to reduce virus excretion and subsequent camelhuman transmissionfor a proof-of-concept trial of a vaccine dromedary camels were immunized with two doses of mva-s and challenged with mers-cov via a nasal spray device after immunization none of the control camels developed antibodies to mers-cov whereas all camels given the vaccine developed virus neutralizing antibodies in addition the camels which were vaccinated with mva-s showed reduced virus excretion upon challenge with mers-covin contrast to these encouraging results with the vaccine treatment of patients with interferon alfa-2a and ribavirin did not greatly

max or trough levels c
minthe first step was to determine the steady-dose level which gave good protection the lowest drug level which gave good protection for 100 h was 3  ec50 concentration then keeping the total daily dose equivalent to the constant 3  ec50 concentration once daily twice daily and four-times daily dosing were simulated as expected the once daily dosing gave the highest c
max and the four-times daily gave the highest c
min once daily dosing gave poor activity four-times daily dosing the best activitythis hollow-fiber system is a useful tool for investigating how human pharmacokinetics can influence efficacy for example would a loading dose be beneficial qin concluded we established the first human rhinovirus hollow fiber systemour three awardees have each had remarkable careers the elion award was presented to phil furman who in his early days worked on acyclovir with trudy elion to my mind acyclovir is the most important game-changing antiviral it may not have the biggest sales but it is the first antiviral drug to combine good clinical efficacy with a truly remarkable safety profile after some three decades it still stands as a benchmark for safety today acyclovir and its prodrug valacyclovir are used worldwide to treat herpesvirus infections in the generally healthy population the proportion of resistant virus remains below 1 prior to acyclovir i do not recall anyone predicting that an antiviral could be used clinically for three decades with less clinical problems than the best antibiotics however phil hardly mentioned acyclovir but focused on the research that led to sofosbuvir another game-changer this time for patients with hcv infectionsthe hol award was presented to dennis liotta like phil dennis did not describe his work that led to the invention of important antivirals for hiv therapy it has been estimated that more than 90 of hiv-positive patients in the usa have taken a drug invented or developed by dennis but he chose to describe his recent research it is a remarkable journey in which the chemistry led him into new unexpected territorythe prusoff award is for a young investigator who has already made an impact in the antiviral field and is set to continue to do so erica ollmann saphire is a highly qualified recipient in her award lecture she described how viral proteins are able to rearrange into different forms and so fulfil different functions i have been lucky to listen to many fine lectures at icar meetings over the years but ericas lecture sailed straight into my top-tenthere were three excellent keynote lectures the approvals of sofosbuvir by the fda in december 2013 and by the eu in january 2014 heralded a new era in the therapy of chronic hcv infections raffaele de francesco set the scene with an overview of the early antiviral agents which improved the cure rate when used with ifn but could not be used on their own due to hcv resistance although a few other nucleotide analogs are in development there seems to be a narrow sar and sofosbuvir remains the only approved nucleotide analog michael manns continued the story giving a detailed account of the clinical picture  how it has changed and is continuing to change rapidly  guide-lines have been written and rewritten early in 2016 new drugs are expected including sofosbuvir combined with a new ns5a inhibitor velpatasvir gs 5816 which is active against all genotypes and against hcv strains and mutants resistant to ledipasvir part of harvoni we seem to be close to an aspirational therapy single pill once daily for 8 or 12 weeks giving essentially 100 cure rates in patients with any genotype as hcv can produce 1012 virions daily in untreated patients and as it has such a great capacity for generating resistant mutants this is a remarkable scientific achievementthe third keynote speaker armand sprecher gave an amazing account of a remarkable organization mdicins sans frontires msf just 10 days after the initial alert msf opened their ebola treatment unit etu in guckdou  an impressive achievement the ebola outbreak has exacted a huge human cost however i greatly admire all the healthcare workers who responded to the emergency even though they were putting their own lives at risk armand briefly mentioned the clinical trials including that with favipiravir in the published results those treated patients who had moderate or low baseline levels of ebola virus generally had rapidly decreasing viral loads on days 2 and 4 after the start of therapy with the ebola outbreak continuing do patients routinely have their viral loads measured if it is unusual for viral loads to decrease at days 2 and 4 after entering an ebola treatment center then the viral load data gathered during the clinical trial gives the best indication that favipiravir is providing benefit to ebola patients armand ended his presentation on a happier note  i follow suit in my reportalthough the ebola outbreak is continuing there are signs of progress the world health organization who reported ebola situation report - 5 august 2015 there were 2 confirmed cases of ebola virus disease evd reported in the week to 2 august 1 in guinea and 1 in sierra leone this is the lowest weekly total to have been reported since march 2014 and marks a third consecutive decline in weekly case incidence the same report warns of the continuing difficulties facing the policy of containment an individual was a known contact but was lost to follow-up when ebola infection was confirmed intensive efforts traced over 1000 contacts however i am pleased to see that this who report mentions the trial of the ebola a suffit ring vaccination trial in guinea clusters of all contacts and contacts of contacts were defined and randomly allocated 11 to immediate vaccination or delayed 21 days later vaccination with rvsv-zebov one dose of 2    107
 plaque-forming units administered intramuscularly henao-restrepo et al 2015 essentially the trials eligibility criteria allows vaccination of all healthy adults except pregnant women the primary end-point was the number of laboratory-confirmed ebola virus disease with onset of symptoms at least 10 days after randomization there were 90 clusters with a total population of 7651 people included in the planned interim analysis there were 16 ebola cases in the delayed vaccination group no new cases of ebola virus disease were diagnosed in vaccinees from the immediate or delayed groups from 6 days post-vaccination following this result all clusters are being offered immediate vaccinationthe elimination of ebola infections seems hard to achieve but the who have reported ebola situation report  9 september 2015 continuing progress liberia has again been declared free of ebola transmission no new health worker infections were reported in the week to 6 september there have been a total of 881 confirmed health worker infections reported from guinea liberia and sierra leone since the start of the outbreak with 513 reported deaths the ebola a suffit ring vaccination phase 3 efficacy trial of the rvsv-zebov vaccine has now been extended from guinea to sierra leone contacts and contacts of contacts associated with new confirmed cases and who meet the trials eligibility criteria will therefore be offered the vaccinein the years to come there will surely be new outbreaks of ebola the current outbreak has revealed the difficulties encountered with containment but also enabled the development of new options hopefully all new outbreaks of ebola will be quickly controlled by using the vaccine to ring-fence each index case and each patient may have a greater chance of survival if treated promptly with favipiravir with vaccination healthcare workers will not be putting their own lives at riskthere were three mini-symposia rna viruses antiviral chemistry and emerging viruses these mini-symposia fulfilled an important aim of icar to bring together knowledge and expertise from the whole spectrum of antiviral research there was a good collection of rna viruses norovirus rabies dengue hev hcv and rsv for me the highlight of the chemistry was the preparation of prodrugs for nucleotide triphosphates as this opens a door to new options such an approach is able to bypass all the activation steps normally needed for a nucleosidetide and such an approach might be beneficial for antiviral antibiotics antitumor or simply for chemical biology questions using non-natural nucleoside triphosphates the third mini-symposium emphasized how the research work in the antiviral area is continuing to expand and needs to do so with a sense of urgencyfinally i have made a personal choice to include two further presentations steve ludmerer described the work of their group with mk-8876 and ended his presentation with some important questions to which i add another when considering how to treat chronic hcv infection viral resistance seems to be a more important parameter than initial potency of all the drugs licensed for the therapy of hcv or hiv those showing the greatest genetic barrier to resistance are nucleosidetide analogs these bind to a catalytic site which is highly conserved and there are few options for mutations which remain viable of course the converse is not necessarily true  some nucleosidetide analogs may show a relatively low genetic barrier to resistance for example lamivudine this presentation prompts one to consider how best to approach the therapy of other rna viral diseases what are the prospects for fusion inhibitors vs protease inhibitors vs nucleosidetide polymerase inhibitors for example the nucleoside analog als-8176 has shown excellent activity against rsv in a clinical experimental challenge trial in healthy volunteers also als-8176 has been reported to demonstrate a high barrier to the development of viral resistance although infections with many rna viruses are self-limiting in normally healthy people such infections can be long-lasting in immunocompromised patients it is important to have therapies which not only help those who would normally recover but also meet the requirements of those with high medical needsqin yu described a hollow fiber culture system for growing human cells which were infected with human rhinovirus in this system it is possible to mimic accurately the human pharmacokinetics of the drug being evaluated qin showed how this system can be used to determine the most efficacious dosing regimen from qins final comment it seems that the fiber culture system is rarely used but i suggest that it is an important tool for evaluating compounds at the 8th icar 1995 in santa fe hamzeh described the comparison between acyclovir acv and penciclovir pcv in hsv-infected human cells in a hollow-fiber culture system hamzeh et al 1995 in a review vere hodge and field 2013 there is a brief summary of this work with twice daily dosing with pcv the trough levels of pcv-tp increased after each of the first four doses in the elion lecture phil reported that the half-life of sofosbuvir-triphosphate was 38 h i would expect that hcv therapy with sofosbuvir would be improved by starting with a loading dose this fiber system could be used to prove what the optimum loading dose should bei hope that my summary of this icar will reflect some of the enthusiasm that the speakers had for their subjects and that even if the topics are not in ones own area of research there is much of interest to be appreciated rarely a major step forward in antiviral therapy happens within a short period of time within the last two years the therapy of chronic hcv infections has been transformed i am especially pleased that the 2015 icar program included outstanding talks describing this exciting progress it takes much effort to organize so many excellent presentations and so i would like to add my thanks to the isar officers and conference committee for another interesting and successful icar

the rapid growth of the global human population has prompted worldwide urbanization and the need for immense infrastructural improvements indoor environments or built environments bes have become a predominant habitat for modern individuals as urban individuals spend the majority of their times in bes mostly in homes workplaces schools public transports hospitals and other indoor spaces concomitant with this rapid growth and expansion of bes there is also a quest to maintain and protect the well-being of indoor occupants individuals in bes co-exist with a myriad of bacteria fungi viruses and microbial parasites such as mites these microorganisms together constitute the microbial community or the microbiome of the beearly interests into the be microbiome were focused on specific pathogens and how they were spread within indoor environments however recent efforts have begun to unravel the indoor microbiome as a whole examining the different effects of indoor environments on the community with broader and greater ecological focuses recent advances in culture-independent high-throughput sequencing have further catalyzed the bloom in indoor microbiome investigations allowing the detection of hundreds and thousands of microbial species in a single indoor air or surface sample as a result of high-throughput sequencing the research community now appreciates that the breadth of microbial diversity within bes are several orders of magnitude higher than previously reported using culture-dependent methods1 in addition while earlier phylogenetic marker gene-based targeted sequencing studies have identified the microbial community members within bes studies using shotgun metagenomics sequencing have further surveyed the functional potentials of a microbial community thus enabling one to gain new insights into metabolic virulence and resistance potentials of the air microbiome2 3more recent efforts have also linked microbial communities and chemical compositions detected in various indoor environments in attempts to detect relationships between microbiome and potential microbial metabolites and other chemicals present in bes3
given the rapid development in be microbiome research an overview regarding the past and current state of research is timely and warranted therefore in this chapter the importance of understanding the indoor microbiome from an ecological environmental and clinical perspective will be discussed this will be followed by a brief historical account of be microbiology describing the earliest works looking at microorganisms in indoor settings a description of some of the common contemporary methods applied to study the indoor microbiome from sampling to data analysis will also be provided different compartments of the indoor microbiome such as air- surface- and dust-associated microbial communities as well as building designs and other factors that may be important in driving differences in the be microbiome will be summarized while most of the current be microbiome works using high-throughput sequencing pertain to bacteria and fungi studies involving other members of microbial life will also be briefly discussed the subsequent description of the transmission of microbiomes within the be including the risk of pathogens and their spread within bes will underscore the importance of understanding the be microbiome finally future outlooks in be microbiome research will be presentedscientists for decades long to elucidate the relationships between human beings and their surrounding physical elements which can also be related to the biotic attributes of the natural environment as well as climate and other chemical and physical factors similarly microbial ecology defined as the study of microorganisms in the environment has been fundamental in understanding natural biochemical and geochemical processes on earth providing insights into how humans can use the knowledge of the microbial world in different ecosystems for the improvement of our health and well-being at the individual and societal levels new scientific works under the theme of microbial ecology some of which also adopting the more recent term microbiome andor microbiota are published on a daily basis testaments to both the importance of understanding the repertoire of microbial communities around us and the prevalence of such research being conducted globallythe appreciation for research focusing on the be microbiome has been evident from articles outlining pressing research questions and methodological considerations when conducting be microbiome works1 4 5 indeed the man-made nature of bes make them unique environments compared to any other ecosystems with a very diverse range of buildings in terms of design location occupancy ventilation or maintenance these building properties can shape distinct microbiomes in similar bes the core be microbiome in general consisted of microorganisms with outdoor environmental origins as well as contributions coming from indoor occupants such as humans and pets moreover activities of occupants may also play major roles in shaping the be microbiome4 6 7 in addition depending on the operational function and purpose of the be from single-family residential buildings to commercial buildings building characteristics and indoor environmental factors including temperature humidity and airflow rates as controlled for example by a heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac system are adjusted to maximize occupant comfort these factors are associated with changes in indoor microbial communities but their roles may be modest compared to that of be design occupancy and outdoor influences depending on the be see section 6086given the large amount of time we spend indoors understanding the be microbiome will also provide insights into the risk of pathogen transmission between occupants and how transmission is mediated by contacts between different individuals as well as between individuals and indoor surfaces multiple studies have demonstrated that cohabitation affects the composition and structure of skin-associated microbial communities and that residential cohabitants share more similar skin microbiomes suggesting that the bes at least have an indirect effect on an individuals microbiome6 the rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars virus within a residential complex in hong kong in 2003 see section 6088 is a clear example for the need to understand the roles of different bes environmental and occupancy factors in transmitting pathogens so that such transmissions can be prevented in the futureprior to the use of culture-independent methods and sequencing of nucleic acids present in the environment using new-generation sequencing platforms majority of the indoor microbiome works conducted in the last century and the beginning of this century involved culturing microorganisms mostly bacteria and fungi in laboratory growth media microbiologists typically were able to cultivate common occupant-associated bacteria including species of staphylococcus as well as environmental members including bacillus8 however culture-dependent methods inherently present numerous limitations in be microbiome research firstly only a small fraction of naturally occurring microorganisms can be cultivated in laboratory growth conditions hence the microbial diversity obtained from culture-dependent methods has been greatly underrepresented indeed studies that include both culture-dependent and culture-independent works unanimously highlight the extended microbial diversity detected via culture-independent methods including the identification of potentially pathogenic species which were otherwise undetected using culture-dependent methods8 9 lee et al8 also uncovered a much wider range of bacterial diversity in a daycare facility using 16s rrna gene clone libraries and most of these bacterial species were not detected when the same samples were cultivated notably through 16s clone sequencing the authors have established that pseudomonads were considered to be a core group of microorganisms in the childcare facility even when members of this group were only sporadically detected on agar platesthe inability for most indoor microorganisms cultivability potentially as low as 0011 to grow under laboratory growth conditions inevitably presents a biased and potentially distorted view of the number and relative proportions of microbial species co-existing in bes for example cultivable organisms such as staphylococcus are likely to be overrepresented in indoor settings in light of our current knowledge of the extended diversity of the indoor microbiome more importantly the results obtained from culture-dependent study likely depend on the cultivation conditions employed eg recipe of growth medium incubation temperature etc8 therefore inter-laboratory comparison of culture-dependent results is challenging and not meaningful if the culture growth conditions between studies are differentthe earliest culture-independent sequencing works on the be microbiome involved the construction of clone libraries followed by sanger sequencing after genomic dna gdna extraction from environmental samples while sanger sequencing has granted building scientists with an expanded view of the breadth of microbial diversity present in bes sanger sequencing has been superseded by the pyrosequencing method developed by 454 life sciences roche branford usa due to the reduced labor time cost and increased sequencing depth with the advent of pyrosequencing an increased number of be microbiome studies had been conducted and these previous works gave scientists early insights into the effects of building design occupants and their activities geography climate and time on indoor bacterial and fungal communities1 4 while pyrosequencing was the preferred sequencing method of choice for a period of time since its introduction pyrosequencing has lost its competitiveness to illumina sequencing because of its increased sequencing depth and hence reduced cost per nucleotide which is currently the most commonly used sequencing platform for microbiome analysis illumina sequencing is the current sequencing platform of choice for analyzing the be microbiome especially when shotgun metagenomics sequencing is employed2 3 4 more recently third-generation high-throughput sequencing platforms such as the pacific biosciences and the oxford nanopore technologies allow for longer read length comparable to those offered by sanger sequencing making full-length 16s rrna gene sequencing possible see section 60843 thereby potentially enabling more accurate and specific identification and community analyses of be microorganismsdespite the increased breadth of diversity that can be detected by high-throughput sequencing culturing may still provide valuable information regarding the cultivable members of the indoor microbiome for example while metagenomics sequencing has the ability to detect and identify the genetic basis of potential drug resistance2 3 culture work can undeniably demonstrate the resistant phenotype using agar plates containing different antimicrobial compounds afshinnekoo et al2 reported that drug-resistant bacteria were prevalent in various surfaces of the new york subway system therefore culture-independent methods will complement rather than entirely replace culture-dependent methods as the inclusion of both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods will undoubtedly present a more comprehensive characterization of the be microbiomethe initial step in be microbiome analysis is the collection of samples which can come from the air surface and water at any location associated with the be depending on the source different sampling methods are required for example air samples can be collected actively using different bioaerosol samplers that draw air directly from the immediate environment4 alternatively the be air microbiome can be inferred by collecting settled dust samples or dusts and particulates from hvac filters4 the selection of air sample type has been shown to be associated with differences in the detected microbiome4 similarly the type of surface swab and the swabbing protocol also influence the recovery of microorganisms from be surfaces10 these results highlight the challenges in comparing studies adopting different sampling methods as the majority of be microbiome studies involve the use of only one sampling method4 more importantly careful consideration of the appropriate sampling protocol for each study should be exercisedthe extraction and purification of genomic dna from the collected sample is one of the most crucial laboratory steps in microbiome analysis and maximizing yield is especially important with low biomass samples such as those collected from bes a number of commercial kits are available for routine extraction of different sample types eg air filter surface swab water etc collected in bes as extraction kits are not necessarily dna-free4 the inclusion of controls in the extraction step is important for the effective detection and removal of contaminating sequence data at later stepsmetabolically active cells of the be microbiome can be detected using the propidium monoazide pma dye which can penetrate cells with compromised membranes and bind to its dna thereby inhibiting pcr amplification11 alternatively sequencing of complementary dna cdna as a proxy for rna to detect the metabolically active members of the be microbiome as well as rna viruses may be facilitated by the use of rna extraction kits however these kits are typically designed to remove genomic dna present in the total genetic pool therefore in order to simultaneously survey both dna and rna populations of the microbiome collection of duplicate samples one for dna and one for rna extraction or applying a co-extraction protocol is required12 other detection methods such as bromodeoxyuridine staining and stable-isotope probing may also be employed in the future to identify active components of the indoor microbiomethe majority of be microbiome studies involving amplicon sequencing to date target the bacterial 16s rrna andor the fungal its marker genes for bacterial 16s rrna gene sequencing due to the short read length of the illumina platform sequencing is often limited to a fragment of the 16s rrna gene specifically one or two of the nine hypervariable 16s rrna gene regions are sequenced the v1-2 and v4 regions are commonly targeted for microbiome works of the be4 despite their popularity primers targeting these regions do not encompass the entire ribosomal gene and full length 16s rrna gene sequencing may be preferred specifically third-generation long read length sequencing platforms such as pacific biosciences and oxford nanopore sequencing technologies may allow the standardization of full-length 16s rrna gene sequencing thereby bypassing observed community variations that arise from sequencing partial 16s rrna gene regions additionally full-length 16s rrna gene sequencing will also increase the resolution of the detected sequences to species and strain levels within the be microbiomea suite of bioinformatic tools are available for microbiome analyses and they have been adopted and used for be microbiome characterization some earlier be microbiome works involved the use of mothur13 an open-access software package first introduced in 2009 mothur enables sequence read quality control and processing taxonomic classification as well as community composition analyses and additional tasks and functions despite the early introduction of this tool mothur is still currently used in studies investigating the be microbiome references of such studies can be found in ref 4 and is continuously updated with additional featuresquantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime is perhaps the most widely used analytic package in be microbiome research14 similar to mothur qiime contains a suite of wrapper tools that enables sequence quality processing taxonomic classification and various community diversity and compositional analyses one associated tool sourcetracker4 provides a bayesian approach in estimating the proportions of the microbiome coming from particular sources since its introduction qiime and sourcetracker have been used widely in be microbiome studies providing insights into the relationships between the microbiomes of the be and that of occupants such as the importance of occupant skin and gut microbiota in feeding the indoor microbiome depending on building characteristics in addition sourcetracker results also point to the outdoor microbiome being an important source of the be microbiome4 recently the originally developed qiime has been updated to qiime2 that features a more streamlined user interface and expanded analytical capabilities for more accurate microbiome analyses as with mothur qiime2 is continuously updated with new featuresmetagenomic shotgun sequencing enables the characterization of the metabolic virulence and resistance potentials of the entire microbial community without the need of pcr amplification also compared to targeted sequencing of phylogenetic or functional marker genes a greater amount of nucleic acids is required for shotgun sequencing bioinformatic tools for the analyses of shotgun metagenomic data can be broadly divided into read-based where taxonomic and functional profiling of short sequence reads obtained from the be are performed or assembly-based where taxonomic and functional characterizations are performed after short reads are assembled into contigs or metagenome-assembled genomes shotgun sequencing in general as well as bioinformatic tools available for metagenomics data analysis have been reviewed recently15
airborne microorganisms in indoor environments comprise a diverse community originating from soils plants humans animals and water sources in addition to a few ubiquitous species most environmental microorganisms encountered indoor are confined to a specific location of the building in other words it is less likely for two bes in close proximity to harbor identical airborne microorganisms of environmental origins this is primarily due to differences in microbial community of outdoor air which has been predicted by source-tracking analysis as a major source of indoor airborne microorganisms across a wide range of bes such as dwellings classrooms offices and public transit4 16having said that there may exist a core indoor microbiome across building types including taxa belonging to genera commonly associated with occupants and those that may be pathogenic17
the dispersal of outdoor microorganisms may be regulated by the mode of ventilation applied in bes in a previous hospital study chloroplast dna was found to be significantly less abundant in the air of mechanically ventilated rooms than those that were naturally ventilated which was thought to be removed by the filters of mechanical systems18
in addition to the migration of outdoor air some indoor pathways and reservoirs may affect the load of airborne microorganisms in bes human occupants emit microorganisms predominantly from the skin and occupants have long been recognized as a major source of indoor airborne microorganisms6 the emitted microorganisms not only increase the microbial load but also affect the composition of airborne microbial community common inhabitants of various parts of the human body can be detected in bes4 moreover the indoor space was imprinted with a personalized microbial cloud which could be used to predict the occupancy of specific human hosts1 however when the indoor space was well ventilated and sparsely occupied the indoor airborne microbial community closely mirrored outdoor air with modest microbial signature from human body4 16 these results suggest that the contribution of outdoor air and human occupants to indoor air microbiome is associated with the occupancy density and frequency and ventilation strategyin many bes an important source of airborne microorganisms is the growth of fungi or molds when moisture is available in bes fungal spores can germinate and form colonies where thousands of new spores are produced in damp houses visible mold growth is often associated with increased concentration of cladosporium spores and exposure to penicillium and aspergillus spores may trigger asthma in children19 moreover the relative proportion of moisture-related airborne fungal species tends to increase in dwellings with limited ventilation low air exchange rate and high humidity19 given the adverse health effects of molds and spores a review paper contends that fungi can be used as an indicator of indoor air quality19 but there is no consensus yet on the level of indoor airborne fungi that signifies contamination to minimize the growth of molds ventilation is an effective strategy in damp bes in addition developing strategies such as environmental-friendly mold removal products to eliminate harmful molds or spores from bes will benefit human healthbe surfaces provide an ideal interface for particle deposition indeed deposition is an important mechanism but not necessarily the final fate of airborne microorganisms it is known that airflow can deliver particles onto surfaces while such air movement can also cause particles already settled to be resuspended in the air in a previous indoor study thatcher et al20 examined the correlation between airflow speed and particle deposition rate the results suggest that the deposition rate of all particle sizes 0510 m increased with increasing air speed 519 cms1 with larger particles showing greater effects than smaller ones in addition at a given airflow speed the deposition lossrate coefficient this term is defined as the number of particles depositing on the total surface available for deposition per unit time and is expressed in units of s1 increased with particles size ie larger particles are more likely to deposit compared to smaller particles despite the lack of direct evidence on microbial transmission between air and surface within bes it is plausible that most microorganisms on be surfaces especially those of environmental origin are deposited from indoor air or are the result of direct intrusion from outdoorsthe type of surfaces may also select for specific microorganisms within an indoor space distinct microbial communities can be found on different types of surfaces which are influenced by occupants behaviors and activities skin-surface contact is a major route for microbial transmission with transfer events reported between hands and routinely touched surfaces such as doorknob as well as bare-foot and floor6 as a result indoor surfaces may be imprinted with personalized microbial fingerprints that are traceable to a specific body site likewise microorganisms can also be introduced indoors by shoes coming into contact with floors for example linoleum floors in rural residences were found to be contaminated with fecal indicator escherichia coli originated from outdoors with boots acting as viable transportersin addition to direct transmission of microorganisms between human and be surfaces through physical contact microbial transmission is also possible through indirect mechanisms for example floors in many bes generally harbor abundant skin-associated bacteria which is thought to be the result of skin shedding and microbial deposition following aerosolization4 moreover surface microbial community can be affected by occupants deliberate actions such as cleaning practices the load of bacteria and viruses on contaminated surfaces was significantly reduced through a single wipe with a wet fabric and the treatment with disinfectant resulted in additional reduction of all pathogens probably by the means of inactivation however a recent study by kwan and colleagues21 demonstrated that skin-associated microorganisms can return and re-establish onto surfaces in schools within days following routine cleaning and suggested that schools may require more frequent cleaning to reduce the transmission of potential pathogens between occupantsindoor dust is thought to be the time-integrated assemblages of particles which have previously been airborne and consists of organic and inorganic materials with microorganisms in relatively high abundance most microorganisms are unlikely to grow in dust unless adequate moisture is available in most bes microorganisms in dust are considered to be mainly dispersed from outdoor air as the surfaces where dust deposits are unlikely to be cleaned frequently andor are in little or no direct contact with human occupants indeed indoor dust harbors abundant microorganisms of soil and plant origin with microbial community composition varying upon changes in the local outdoor microbial reservoir hence it is expected that the indoor dust microbial community is largely shaped by outdoor environmental conditions when a large geographic scale is considered consistent with this expectation a global survey of household dust reported that phylogenetically distinct fungal communities were identified for each region and the fungal communities in temperate zones were more diverse than those in the tropics22 within a smaller geographic scale the seasonality pattern may be reflected in the dynamics of indoor dust microbial community when a long time scale is consideredin addition to environmental taxa human-associated microorganisms may also deposit on indoor surfaces after being released as aerosols via skin shedding or respiration barbern et al23 reported that household dust contained abundant bacteria with human dermal vaginal and fecal origins and the number and sex of occupants greatly affected the bacterial community in household dust in contrast the composition of indoor dust fungal communities was predictable across different geographic and climatic regions with minimal influences from human occupants23 occupant activities such as walking can cause the resuspension of settled dust which is considered an important mechanism for aerosolizing indoor microorganisms16 overall indoor dust harbors a highly diverse microbial community where bacterial members are strongly affected by human occupants while fungal members are largely mediated by geography and climateventilation is a key strategy in architectural design regulating the entry of ambient air into indoor space natural ventilation generally provides sufficient air exchange rate and outdoor airborne particles can easily penetrate openings and leaks of the building envelopes to enter indoors mechanical ventilation is commonly equipped with in-system or in-duct filters so that outdoor particles that are larger in sizes are restricted from entering the indoor space thus the influence of outdoor microorganisms on indoor microbiomes is expected to vary according to the ventilation strategy adopted in the bes consistent with this airborne bacterial communities in naturally ventilated rooms resembled adjacent outdoor air while distinct microbial community was found in rooms with mechanical ventilation in addition mechanically ventilated rooms harbored less diverse microbial communities than naturally ventilated rooms6 similar to indoor air the type of ventilation was also shown to affect the structure of indoor dust microbiome however it is worth noting that an improperly maintained ventilation system can serve as an amplification and dissemination site for microbial pathogens16 overall ventilation plays a crucial role in shaping the diversity and composition of indoor microbiome and regular maintenance ie cleaning practices is required to improve the air quality of beswithin a be space the spatial relationships between components will govern the microbial community detected for example hallways which act as viaducts for occupants between other rooms in a building will have very different spatial and associated be properties to a washroom kembel et al24 hypothesized that building form and organization which are in turn dependent on the function of the space are important determinants of the indoor microbiome the authors used terminologies associated with network analysis ie degree betweenness and connectedness to describe the spatial characteristics of an indoor space and associated changes in microbiome based on these spatial properties within spaces that share identical be function eg within office spaces areas that were highly connected and closer to each other were also more similar in microbial communities this was also seen in other be microbiome studies comparing different buildings within various geographical ranges see below recently it has also been hypothesized that highly connected indoor rooms and spaces serving different functions within a building with minimal wall separation may also reduce microbial community divergence16
humans harbor a diverse community of microorganisms inside and outside the body in occupied indoor settings individuals emit as high as 106107 bacteria and fungi per person per hour1 the influence of occupancy on the composition of airborne microbial community is associated with occupancy density and frequency and ventilation strategy as discussed above in addition to indoor air occupancy has been shown to affect the diversity and structure of surface and dust microbial communities via different transmission mechanisms mediated by human behaviors and movements see sections 60852 and 60853 similarly pet ownership is also associated with increased diversity in the microbial community of household dust which is likely to be the result of furred pets transporting exogenous microorganisms from outdoor environments into be spaces7
like humans plants are host to symbiotic microorganisms in addition to a few plant and human pathogens most of the microbial inhabitants tend to be beneficial and neutral although there are limited studies on this topic indoor plants as a source of microorganisms have been recognized7 based on our current knowledge plants are a dispersal source of indoor environments in a way similar as human occupants and plant-associated beneficial microorganisms can positively affect human health also given that the outdoors act as important sources of the indoor microbiome it is likely that both indoor and outdoor plants contribute to the indoor be microbiome6
the outdoor microbial community represents a diverse assemblage of microorganisms from multiple origins such as soils plants insect animal feces and water bodies6 although a few species are ubiquitous most microorganisms are more or less confined to certain localities since outdoor environments are a major source of microorganisms encountered indoors the indoor microbial community is largely shaped by geography and location thus distinct microbial community andor indigenous species were identified for bes from geographically different areas6 in addition to the geography pattern the influence of landuse and urbanization degree on indoor microbiome is also evident dwellings in rural areas generally harbored abundant microorganisms of environmental origin due to the high exposure to green area eg forest and farmland likewise in urban regions the composition of airborne bacterial community of outdoor bes eg parking space was also affected by the nearby vegetation however urbanization generally reduced the indoor exposure to environmental microorganisms and the indoor microbial community in more urbanized regions tended to be more homogenous25
climate plays a crucial role in regulating the richness and evenness of microbial communities in outdoor environments generally warm temperatures in summer are associated with aerosolization of bacteria from soils plants and water sources whereas these bacteria of environmental sources tend to be rare or absent in outdoor air during winter given the importance of outdoor microorganisms on indoor microbial community significant pattern of seasonality was also detected indoors according to a previous time-series study see section 60853 although seasonal changes in meteorological factors can be buffered by the building envelops the relative humidity of a single indoor space may vary largely within a short period of time due to human activities eg shower in bathroom and weather conditions eg rainstorm as indoor temperature is generally controlled at 1530 c the growth rate of many microorganisms especially fungal species can be dramatically increased when relative humidity is elevated bes with serious moisture issue such as water-damaged homes are usually associated with the growth of visible molds which can affect the composition of indoor airborne microbial community and has been shown to induce health problems19 in addition to seasonal climatic changes the be microbiome is also subjected to occasional severe adverse weather conditions resulting in alterations of the microbial communities that can persist for months after the onset of events2
while the majority of the indoor microbiome is of bacterial and fungal origins bes also contain a viral community the virome indoor environments may facilitate the transmission of viruses between occupants see section 6088 recent appreciation for understanding the indoor virome from a broader ecological perspective has applied metagenomic sequencing to survey viral communities in bes given the small particle size and low abundance of viruses in indoor environments the specialization and optimization of sampling and processing methods such as the use of commercial kits specialized for extraction of viral genetic materials26 have been adopted for example to maximize yield of viral genetic material rosario et al26 performed a combination of sonication physical disruption filtration and ultracentrifugation to facilitate viral release from filters as well as the release of its genetic materials and concentration of viral genetic material following extraction in summary thorough methodological optimizations are needed to collect sufficient viral genetic contents for its characterization in the beto date a diverse collection of dna and rna viruses have been detected across bes that are thought to infect bacteria fungi humans plants and insects for example human skin-associated propionibacterium phage has been detected across different bes while other viruses commonly detected in humans such as entero phages papillomaviruses polyomaviruses and herpesviruses may be abundant and prevalent in bes26 the same factors driving bacterial and fungal indoor microbial communities such as ventilation mode and rate and human occupancy may also affect indoor viral communities furthermore viruses within indoor environments can come from pets plants and the outdoorssome of the remaining challenges in characterizing the indoor viral community involve the construction of a comprehensive viral database with high taxonomic resolution as the majority of viral sequences currently detected in bes cannot be classified to deeper taxonomic levels such as genus species and strains also it is generally challenging to precisely identify the potential sources of viruses detected indoors given their ability to travel long distances in addition care must be taken to describe the presence of human retroviruses in indoor settings as some of these retroviral sequences may in fact originate from human host genomethere is relatively limited information on the archaeal community ie archaeome of bes possibly due to the fact that the most common 16s rrna gene region targeted in be studies ie v4 does not provide good coverage of archaeal species within the community however given that alternative primers have been shown to be more suitable for the characterization of archaea in other ecosystems27 archaeal taxa with potential human origins may be more readily detected in bes in the futureone of the major incentives for a greater understanding of the indoor microbiome is to effectively prevent the transmission of diseases within such environments therefore safeguarding occupant health the importance of understanding be designs and other factors in terms of pathogen transmission is perhaps best exemplified by the spread of the sars virus within the amoy gardens residential complex in hong kong in the work of yu et al28 the authors provided evidence that the sars virus was likely originated from virus-contaminated soil stacks that have returned to bathrooms via dried water traps viral particles then may have entered the air shafts and moved upwards to enter different residences of the same unit within the building block viral particles that are now present in multiple levels within the same residential unit may also be transferred to neighboring units of the same building block and also be transmitted to other building blocks within the complex through wind such a study emphasizes the importance of taking a multifaceted approach in understanding how pathogens are mobilized within and between indoor environmentsexamining the transmission routes of microorganisms within bes in hospitals for example can aid in understanding how pathogens may spread within indoor environments and how various building designs and anthropogenic factors shape pathogen spread following reports of respiratory conditions of lifeguards around a hospital pool area angenant et al9 were able to detect mycobacterium sequences among other potential respiratory pathogens in the air directly above the indoor warm-water therapy pool thereby providing possible mechanism of spread of mycobacterial pathogens from the pool to the lifeguards more recently using a fluorescence-based and particle-counting bioaerosol sensor a hospital-based study demonstrated the potential for dispersion of particle-associated microorganisms from various textiles used in patient rooms across the hospital29 the authors reported that bacteria some of which may be pathogens presumably associated with hospital patients and personnel can be spread across multiple floors and be detected in textile holding rooms with minimal occupancy suggesting that the spread of pathogens into a be may not need to directly involve occupants these studies also highlight the need for potential changes in building operation to prevent transmission of pathogens within bes such as increase of air circulation in the therapy pool environment9 or additional personal protective equipment when handling hospital gowns and linens29
a pre-requisite for host occupant infection is the survival of pathogens within the be indeed human pathogens grown in planktonic conditions showed reduced viability when inoculated onto be surfaces with a survival time on be surfaces of less than a month30 however organisms present on indoor surfaces may survive in the form of a biofilm and laboratory assessments of viability of microorganisms within biofilms may be more appropriate in the study of marks et al
30 they inoculated and compared the viability of streptococci on plastic and hand surfaces following planktonic or biofilm growth in the laboratory biofilm cells remained viable on surfaces for extended periods of time compared to their planktonic counterparts and biofilm cells were able to colonize the upper respiratory tracts of mice even after a month of being inoculated onto be surfaces organisms directly collected from the indoor surfaces can also be cultivated and can potentially resist antimicrobials and subsequently transmit from one individual to others indirectly through survival on indoor surfaces2
in addition to the spread of pathogens building scientists and health professionals can also assess whether selective pressures imposed by occupants induce an effect on the be microbiome eg use of antimicrobial chemicals hartmann et al3 found that the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes was positively correlated with the application dose of specific antimicrobial chemicals within bes however the authors were not able to correlate structural dissimilarities of the investigated indoor dust microbiomes with the applications of antimicrobials in the corresponding bes additional studies will be required to provide a mechanistic explanation for the association between the concentrations of antimicrobial chemicals and relative abundances of resistance genes in the bescurrently we are only beginning to fully grasp the transmission viability virulence and resistance properties of microorganisms within indoor environments either by laboratory controlled experiments andor characterization of microorganisms directly from field sampling however to further gain insights into how bes directly or indirectly affect transmission of potential pathogens a multidisciplinary approach is necessary by incorporating knowledge in building science engineering biology and chemistry also stemming from the growing appreciation that exposure to microbial metabolites andor molecules may also affect occupant health the integration of indoor microbiome data with data representing the exposure of the myriad chemicals we are exposed to daily will undoubtedly provide a more complete and integrated view of what occupants are exposed to in a beprevious observational and laboratory studies have been crucial toward our current understanding of the common microbial inhabitants of the different be ecosystems how experimental and analytical methods influence the be microbiome data interpretation the roles building designs and other environmental and anthropogenic factors play to shape the be microbiome the mechanisms of transmission of microorganisms and potential pathogens within and between the be and its occupants and the chemical molecules that are associated with indoor microorganisms recent advances in molecular microbiology technologies now enable us to obtain high-depth-resolution profiling of microbial communities in terms of composition structure and function for example while previous clone library-based analyses provide functional potential profiles of the microbial community in and around bes at limited depths recent metagenomics analyses allow be scientists to directly answer questions related to microbial virulence and resistance potentials within bes species- and strain-level classification of be microorganisms and their potential sources and various aspects of be that may affect microbial functional profiles2 3metagenomic sequencing also allows in-depth analysis of the microbiome consisting of organisms other than bacteria or fungi such as the be viral community in addition advances of sequencing technology platforms have pushed the development of new and improved bioinformatic tools that may allow for more meaningful analyses of the be microbiome for instance the inherent low-biomass nature associated with some bes have been met with benchmarking works4 17 in order to maximize the biomass yield while minimizing erroneous and contaminating sequences that may otherwise take up a large proportion of sequencing dataadditional works are now being performed to focus on the viable and metabolically active portions of the be microbiome as dna-based microbiome studies do not differentiate microorganisms that are viable and those that are not while rna-based studies looking at the viable microbial communities have been performed in other ecosystems existing works attempting to understand the viable components of the be microbiome are limited to fluorescent dye methods which only allow the screening of non-active cells with a damaged cell membrane12 recently gomez-silvan et al12 assessed the viable portion of the residential air and surface microbiome via rrna sequencing which may be a more direct assessment of viability compared to methods based on cell membrane integrity adopting an optimized protocol for rna isolation and preservation the authors revealed that the viable components of the residential microbiome differ greatly from the total genetic pool of the same be and a sizable portion of the be microbiome as determined by dna methods may not represent viable organisms however due to differences in correlations between metabolic activity and rrna levels12 careful interpretation of cellular activity using rrna data is warranted nonetheless additional be studies focusing on viable components of the microbiome using rrna sequencing is anticipatedenvironmental sustainability has become one of the most pressing scientific and social issues of the 21st century subsequently there is a global rise in the construction and commission of environmentally friendly and energy-efficient buildings including green and zero-carbon buildings zcbs these special buildings with careful consideration of building use geographical and climatic factors utilize specific innovative designs to minimize energy consumption while maximizing occupant comfort given our understanding of how building designs may affect the indoor microbiome it is unclear whether the use of these energy-efficient be designs may also affect the microbial communities of these buildings leung and colleagues reveal that a low-occupancy zcb in hong kong presented air microbiome resembling that of other be studies16 specifically the majority of the zcb air microbiome consisted of taxa commonly associated with the outdoor environment with a more modest influence from taxa associated with occupant skin although several studies reported similar relationships between occupant environment and be regardless of green building certification it is unknown whether these studies are representative of bes around the world as each be is dependent on social cultural regulatory and climatic considerations that are specific to the location of the be16 therefore additional focus is required to gain insights into microbial exposures of occupants in energy-efficient buildings to provide a more comprehensive view of the energy-efficient building microbiomethe need to safeguard the health and well-being of indoor occupants has been one of the driving forces for conducting be microbiome research today building scientists continue to characterize the indoor microbiomes of different bes from both ecological and clinical standpoints while cultivation studies have enlightened us in identifying some of the microorganisms that are present indoors recent advances in culture-independent high-throughput sequencing technologies have greatly expanded our views of the be microbiome also the list of available analytic and bioinformatic tools for the characterization of the be microbiome continues to expand making this a truly exciting time for indoor microbiome research through collaborations between microbiologists clinicians engineers and building scientists we now have a drastically deeper understanding of various physical temporal environmental anthropogenic and other factors in shaping the microbial communities of indoor environmentsfuture directions of the be microbiome will undoubtedly aim at manipulating elements of indoor environments to enhance the health of occupants through alterations of the be microbiome and creating a healthy living environment specifically characterizing the non-pathogenic or beneficial microorganisms within the be and how they are affected by various factors is crucial to ensure that these microbial members are retained within the be and on occupants thereby enhancing the health of indoor occupants at the same time by identifying indoor pathogens their metabolites and pathogenic potentials as well as how various factors affect the survival and transmission of pathogenic constituents of the microbiome researchers can strive toward altering indoor conditions to either remove such pathogens or limit their transmission indoorsthe term biological warfare typically conjures images of medieval warriors tossing dead cattle over city walls or clandestine government agents secretly releasing mysterious microbes into enemy territory of course biological warfare does encompass such activity but the vast majority of what constitutes biological warfare is far more mundane ever since life evolved on earth about 38 billion years ago organisms have constantly devised new ways to kill each other any organism that makes use of toxinsfrom bacteria to snakesis engaging in a form of biological warfare humans who engage in biological warfare do so by taking advantage of these toxin-producing organismsan entire textbook could be filled with examples of organisms that employ toxins to kill other organisms we therefore touch only briefly on the natural history of biological warfarebacteria are particularly adept at biological warfare while humanity finds antibiotics incredibly useful in our battle against infectious disease bacteria did not create them for our benefit instead they make antibiotics to kill off other bacteria that are competing for the same habitat or resources similarly bacteria synthesize toxic proteins known as bacteriocins to kill their relatives because closely related strains of bacteria are likelier to compete with each other for example many strains of escherichia coli deploy a wide variety of bacteriocins referred to as colicins intended to kill other strains of e coli the genes for colicins are normally carried on plasmids and many of these plasmids are commonly used in molecular biology and genetic engineering see chapter 3 yersinia pestis the plague bacterium also makes bacteriocins called pesticins in this case designed to kill competing strains of its own species fig 221
a point of clarification the distinction between bacteriocin and toxin has to do with the target bacteria deploy bacteriocins against their fellowoften closely relatedbacteria with the deliberate intention of killing them in contrast proteins produced by bacteria that act against higher organisms are referred to as toxins perhaps counterintuitively pathogenic bacteria do not usually intend to kill the organisms they infect rather they want to manipulate them long enough to survive and reproduce the longer the host stays alive the longer it provides a home for the infecting bacteria just like antibiotics some bacterial toxins are useful to humans the bacterium bacillus thuringiensis produces an insect-killing toxin that is harmless to vertebrates and this bt toxin has been used extensively in genetically modified crops see chapter 15lower eukaryotes also regularly engage in biological warfare paramecium a ciliated protozoan carries symbiotic bacteria caedibacter known as kappa particles that grow and divide inside the larger eukaryotic cell fig 222
strains of paramecium with kappa particles are known as killers and due to unknown genetic factors and resistance mechanisms are naturally tolerant of them killer strains release kappa particles into the environment and if a sensitive paramecium ie one lacking the ability to harbor kappa particles eats and digests just a single kappa particle a protein toxin is released and kills the paramecium interestingly the toxin is not encoded by a gene on the bacterial chromosome but on a plasmid derived from a defective bacteriophage so a toxin encoded by a virus infecting the kappa particle bacterium has been commandeered for the purpose of killing other strains of paramecium
this phenomenon is not at all unusual many toxins used by pathogenic bacteria that infect humans are actually encoded by foreign dna of nonchromosomal origin such as viruses plasmids or transposons these elements are often integrated into the chromosome of pathogenic strains of bacteria for example the only strains of corynebacterium diphtheriaethe causative agent of diphtheriathat are dangerous to humans are the ones that carry a toxin-encoding virushigher eukaryotes can either create their own toxinssuch as the venom produced by snakes and scorpionsor expropriate toxins produced by other species one species of caterpillar that feeds on tobacco plants can exhale noxious nicotine at spiders chasing them away other insects rely on microbes to wage biological warfare certain parasitic wasps inject their eggs into the maggots ie larvae of plant-eating insects after the eggs hatch the newborn wasps eat the living maggots from the inside fig 223
the maggots are eventually killed and a new generation of wasps is released the secret to the wasps success is the injection of an adenovirus along with the eggs the virus targets the maggots fat body vaguely equivalent to the liver of higher animals and cripples the maggots developmental control system and immune system the maggot loses its appetite for plants and is prevented from molting and turning into a pupa the next stage in its life cyclemany different kinds of organisms engage in biological warfare bacteria kill other bacteria with antibiotics or bacteriocins they also make toxins that are targeted at higher organisms eukaryotes can either make their own toxins or commandeer those produced by lower organisms
although there has been speculation of an inevitable post-antibiotic era there are still plenty of opportunities for the development of novel antibioticsone strategy is to attack previously unexploited vulnerable spots in a bacteriums metabolism or life cycle preferably those that bacteria cannot easily defend by acquiring resistance for instance bacteria use iron chelators known as siderophores to bind iron and extract it from host proteins siderophores are excreted bind iron and are then taken back into bacteria by specialized transport systems absence of high-potency siderophores largely abolishes virulence in both plague and tuberculosis because mammals do not make siderophores their unique biosynthetic pathways provide an attractive target for development of novel antibiotics yersiniabactin the siderophore of several pathogenic yersinia species is capped by a salicyl group fig 224
the intermediate in the pathway produced when atp activates salicylate is salicyl-amp a chemically synthesized analog of salicyl-amp called salicyl-ams replaces the phosphate with a sulfamoyl group the compound is highly active and specifically inhibits siderophore synthesis this prevents the growth of yersinia under iron-limiting conditions such as encountered in the human bodyanother strategy is to screen novel microbes for antibiotics as discussed earlier bacteria produce antibiotics for the explicit purpose of killing other bacteria since most microbes that exist in nature have neither been cultured nor identified it is likely that many natural antibiotics have yet to be discovered in 2013 a new antibiotic called anthracimycin was isolated from an actinomycete that lives in the ocean the new antibiotic is active against bacillus anthracis and mrsa and modifying it with chlorine groups expanded its spectrum of activityyet another strategy is to identify and clone potential antimicrobial biosynthetic pathways for example based on its dna sequence one research group cloned a biosynthetic gene cluster from an actinomycete called saccharomonospora that was predicted to produce an antimicrobial lipopeptide expressing the gene cluster resulted in the discovery of a new antibiotic taromycin a the major advantage of this technique is that it can be applied to microbes that are difficult to culture in the laboratorya different approach is to disrupt existing antibiotic resistance rather than developing new antibiotics for example bacteriophage such as those that live in the human gut can shuttle antibiotic resistance genes between bacteria consequently developing drugs that kill or disable bacteriophage is an innovative way to combat the spread of antibiotic resistance additionally disrupting bacterial quorum sensing has been suggested bacteria use quorum sensing as a communication system in order to coordinate behavior fig 225
by releasing particular chemical compounds into the environment bacteria can detect when a threshold population density or quorum has been reached many pathogens construct antibiotic-resistant biofilms after the population has reached a particular density disrupting their communication system would cripple their ability to coordinate behavior and keep the bacteria more vulnerable to antibioticsthe history of phage therapythat is using bacteriophage also called phage to treat bacterial infectionsbegins in france in 1921 that year microbiologist felix dhrelle used phage to treat patients suffering from dysentery fig 226

in 1927 he also used phage therapy to treat cholera victims in south asia unfortunately many other scientists in the united states and elsewhere were unable to replicate his work and when the widespread production of antibiotics started in 1945 the scientific community mostly lost interest in phage therapy the french however enthusiastically practiced phage therapy into the 1990s and during those seven decades there were reports of successful treatment of typhoid fever colitis septicemia skin infections and various other bacterial diseases other countries that embraced phage therapy include poland russia and georgia today patients there can receive phage therapy for chronic and antibiotic-resistant bacterial infectionssince the 1990s the western scientific community has renewed its interest in phage therapy one benefit of using phage as opposed to antibiotics is their specificity antibiotics kill many different types of bacteriawhich is harmful if they destroy helpful gut bacteriabut individual phage species infect only a group of very closely related bacteria every bacterial infection could in theory be targeted by a highly specific phageas predicted however bacteria also can develop resistance to phage mainly through thwarting viral attachment now researchers are investigating the use of lysins a class of toxins that phage use to dismantle bacterial cell walls as part of their lytic cycle fig 227
 because lysins target conserved regions within peptidoglycan it is believed that bacteria will be less able to develop resistance lysins work best against gram-positive bacteria but genetic engineering can expand the spectrum of activity to include gram-negative bacteria alsoas an alternative to phage it may be possible to deploy predatory bacteria against human pathogens bdellovibrio which invades other bacteria rather like a virus and micavibrio which attaches to bacterial cell surfaces have been shown to kill antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria in vitrobecause of a persistent fear that we will run out of novel antibiotics many clever new technologies have been suggested to fight bacterial infections some of the most promising of these antibiotics utilize genetic engineeringfor example many pathogenic escherichia coli use the fimh adhesin to bind to mammalian cells via mannose residues on surface glycoproteins several alkyl- and aryl-mannose derivatives bind with extremely high affinity to the adhesin and block its attachment to the natural receptor such mannose derivatives therefore could serve as anti-adhesin drugs however manufacturing pharmaceuticals is quite expensive it would be far cheaper to genetically engineer nonpathogenic strains of e coli to express the mannose derivatives on their cell surfaces pathogenic bacteria would then bind to these decoys instead of to mammalian cells this would also avoid the need for continuous administration of sugar derivatives because the decoy strains of e coli would multiply naturally in the intestine alternatively nonpathogenic strains of e coli could be engineered with genes for adhesins that would allow them to compete with pathogens for mammalian cell receptors such engineered strains would also have the advantage of being able to deliver protein pharmaceuticals or large segments of dna for gene therapy into mammalian cellsa different approach is to generate altered toxins that interfere with their natural analogs typical a-b bacterial toxins are made from a single active a subunit which carries out a toxic enzymatic reaction inside a target cell and often several binding b subunits which serve as a delivery system by attaching to the cell surface because several properly functioning binding subunits are required to deliver the active subunit one approach to antitoxin therapy relies on utilizing dominant-negative mutations in the binding subunit of the toxin the mechanism involves the binding of a defective protein subunit to functional subunits resulting in a complex that is inactive overall the term dominant-negative refers to mutations in which an abnormal gene product sabotages the activity of the wild-type gene product consequently most dominant-negative mutations affect proteins with multiple subunits dominant-negative mutations have been deliberately isolated in the b protein called the protective antigen of anthrax toxin mixing mutant subunits with wild-type ones resulted in the assembly of inactive heptamers that bind the a subunits called lethal factor and edema factor of anthrax toxin as a result the toxic a subunits cannot be transported into target cells fig 228
 this technique has been shown to protect both cultured human cells and whole mice or rats from death by lethal levels of anthrax toxinmany of the advances in nanotechnology aimed at fighting pathogens involve the creation of bactericidal surfaces see chapter 7 for more on nanotechnology several metals are inherently antibacterial for instance silver ions kill bacteria through several mechanisms such as generating reactive oxygen species and disrupting protein disulfide bonds surfaces coated with silver selenium and copper nanoparticles all show antimicrobial activitymetals are not the only option a substance known as black silicon is made of tiny nanopillars that are able to physically destroy bacteria including endospores through mechanical stress fig 229
 antimicrobial activity has also been demonstrated with stacked carbon nanotubes called nanocarpets see chapter 7 additionally polymers of esters and cyclic hydrocarbons reduce attachment of bacteria such discoveries could allow for improved sanitation in health-care settings and the manufacture of antimicrobial medical devicesantibiotic resistance is a growing concern but contrary to popular reports it is not necessarily an intractable problem novel targets for antibiotics phage therapy genetic engineering and nanotechnology provide multiple possibilities for fighting antibiotic-resistant pathogens
slightly more advanced forms of biological warfare emerged when soldiers began dipping spears in feces and throwing poisonous snakes during the black death epidemic of the mid-1300s the tartars catapulted plague-ridden corpses over the walls into cities held by their european enemies although this is sometimes credited with spreading the plague rats and their fleas were far more effective at spreading bubonic plague than contact with corpses fig 2210
given the state of hygiene in most medieval towns or castles there was little need to provide an outside source of infection with plague typhoid smallpox dysentery and diphtheria already around all that was usually necessary was to let nature take its course similarly a widespread myth exists that european settlers purposefully infected native americans with smallpox while it is true that the british military attempted this strategy during the french and indian war in the mid-1700s the vast majority of native american deathsperhaps as much as 95 of the populationwere due to inadvertent infection with smallpox and other diseasesthe truth is until very recently humans were not particularly hygienic consider for instance that antiseptic surgeryinvented by joseph lister and now considered a mainstay of modern medicinewasnt widely adopted until the late 1870s before then armies and civilian populations were so dirty and disease-ridden that practicing germ warfare was like throwing mud on a pig it is only in our modern hygienic age that biological warfare has become a more meaningful threatmodern biological warfare began during world war i although the germans refused to use biological agents against people they did use them against animals infecting allied horses with glanders burkholderia mallei and anthrax the french also employed glanders against german horses during world war ii the infamous japanese unit 731 experimentally infected chinese prisoners of war with horrifying diseases such as cholera epidemic hemorrhagic fever and venereal disease it was also responsible for dropping plague-infected flea bombs on cities in china although this likely had little effect partly because plague was already endemic to the region fig 2211
after world war ii particularly during the korean war the united states ratcheted up its biological weapons program perhaps the most controversial aspect of the program was the purposeful release of biological agents such as the relatively harmless serratia marcescens over american cities to study weapons dispersal the military unintentionally infected 11 civilians one of whom died by 1969 the us had weaponized anthrax and tularemia however in 1975 the us renounced all biological weapons by signing the biological weapons convention bwcthe soviet union also signed the bwc but then deceitfully enlarged its efforts the scope of the soviet program was astonishing the soviets manufactured several hundred tons of anthrax and an accidental release in 1979 killed 66 people the former ussr also made thousands of pounds of smallpox and plague and in 1989 they supposedly managed to weaponize marburg virus which causes a deadly hemorrhagic fever similar to ebola these allegations remain unconfirmed finally under president boris yeltsin in 1992 russia ended its biological weapons program but the fate of the weapons stockpiles remains unclear
today biological warfare is feared less from nations and more from terrorist groups or lone wolves but there is disagreement over just how much of a threat this poses many believe that terrorists would be incapable of carrying out an effective large-scale biological attack for instance in 1984 the rajneesh cult gave food poisoning to about 750 citizens of a small oregon town for political purposes by adding salmonella to salad bars aum shinrikyo a japanese cult that perpetrated a sarin gas attack in the tokyo subway in 1995 experimented with biological weapons but to no avail the 2001 us anthrax attack discussed in more detail in the following section killed only 5 people skeptics point to incidents like these as evidence that bioterrorists are incapable of inflicting widespread damage other analysts disagree fig 2212
some biological agents such as anthrax require little expertise to grow or weaponize with microbiological information universally available on the internet some experts believe that it is just a matter of time before a large bioterrorist attack occurs a small crop duster airplane loaded with anthrax and flown over a major city could potentially kill hundreds of thousands if not millions of people exacerbating the problem is the fact that a 2010 federal commission found the united states to be completely unprepared in the event of a bioterrorist attackduring the vietnam war the viet-cong guerillas dug camouflaged pits as booby traps inside they often positioned sharpened bamboo stakes or splinters smeared with human waste although it was possible to contract a nasty infection from these the main purpose was psychological the tactic worked the response of american troops was to alter their movements in a way that was disproportionate to the actual threat an analogous scenario played out following the 2001 anthrax attack in the united states in which there was a colossal disruption of postal services and massive new expenses yet only 5 people died in the attack compare that to the roughly 62000 americans who died from influenza and pneumonia that same year
both of these examples serve to underscore two important points first biological warfare will almost certainly have a far greater psychological impact than direct impact and second protective measures against biological attacks are costly and inconvenient for instance giving soldiers vaccines against all possible biological agents would be impractical and possibly dangerous if they have been developed under emergency conditions without thorough testing also vaccines have side effects consider the anthrax vaccine used by the us army that was approved in 1971 vaccination requires six inoculations plus annual boosters it produces swelling and irritation at the site of injection in 5 to 8 and severe local reactions in about 1 of those inoculated although major systemic reactions are rare although it works against natural exposure it is uncertain whether it would protect against a concentrated aerosol of anthrax sporesor consider the smallpox vaccine fig 2213
 for every 1 million people vaccinated the cdc estimates that 1000 people will have serious side effects 14 to 52 people will have life-threatening side effects and 1 or 2 people will die is it worth vaccinating an entire army or nationknowing ahead of time that many will die or become sickto protect them against an unlikely threat from an epidemiological standpoint the answer is clearly no which explains why citizens do not receive smallpox vaccinations the general rule in public health is to vaccinate only if the risk of the disease is greater than the risk of vaccinationeven if widespread vaccination is forgone in favor of other measures such as protective clothing or respirators there is still the financial cost a nation that invests heavily in bioterrorism preparedness could have spent that money in more productive ways dressing troops in special clothing and equipment could promote heat stress or make them easier targets for conventional weaponry additionally medications taken prophylactically to prevent infectious diseases are expensive rarely 100 effective and may have long-term negative health consequencesbiological warfare has been practised since ancient times however it has only rarely been effective naturally occurring infectious diseases have killed far more people still bioterrorism may pose a serious threat today even if an attack kills relatively few people the psychological impact could be enormous
biological warfare is used to kill injure and psychologically intimidate enemies many naturally occurring diseases are effective agents although it might be possible to improve them with genetic engineering as discussed laterwhat makes for an effective biological agent five major factors need to be considered
preparation some pathogenic microorganisms are relatively easy to grow in culture whereas others are extremely difficult or expensive to manufacture in sizeable quantities viruses for instance can grow only inside host cells and culturing animal cells is more complex than growing bacteria similarly pathogenic eukaryotes such as plasmodium malaria or entamoeba amoebic dysentery are difficult to culture on a large scale although some pathogenic fungi can be grown relatively easily bacteria are generally the easiest to manufacture on a large scale but most bacterial infections can be cured with antibiotics viruses though more difficult to grow have the advantage of being largely incurable despite a small and growing range of specific antiviral agentsanother factor is weaponization the disease agent must be prepared in a manner that facilitates storage and dispersal because bacterial cells and spores tend to clump together spontaneously they must be weaponized to allow effective delivery
dispersal dispersal is a particular challenge for biological weapons the most likely option would be some form of airborne delivery however if applied outdoors this tactic would be vulnerable to the whims of the weather not only is a pleasant breeze required but also the wind needs to blow in the right direction during the 1950s the british government conducted field tests with harmless bacteria when the wind blew them over farmland many of the airborne bacteria survived the trip and reached the ground alive in contrast when the wind blew the bacteria over industrial areas especially oil refineries or similar installations the airborne bacteria were almost all killed ironically air pollution may help protect an urban population from a bioterrorist attack to aerosolize a biological agent for an indoor attack a buildings ventilation system or a medical nebulizer could be used fig 2214

persistence persistence may be the most difficult factor to consider on the one hand the biological agent should be able to persist in storage until it is ready to be deployed and it must survive long enough in the environment to infect the enemy on the other hand it should not persist so long that the victor is unable to invade and conquer enemy territorymany infectious agents are sensitive to desiccation and become inactive if exposed to air for significant periods of time moreover natural uv radiation from the sun also inactivates many bacteria and viruses thus most biological warfare agents must be protected from this open air factor before use and then dispersed as rapidly as possible for instance many viruses last only a few days if even that outside their animal or human hosts however infections due to these agents may persist among the local populationanthrax is often chosen as a biological weapon because of its ability to persist for long periods of time the bacterium bacillus anthracis which causes the disease spreads by forming spores that are tough and difficult to destroy fig 2215
 when suitable conditions return for example inside the lungs of a human the spores germinate and resume growth as normal bacterial cells releasing life-threatening toxins
incubation time a problem unique to biological warfare compared to conventional weapons is that death or incapacitation from infectious disease is a relatively slow process even the most virulent pathogens such as ebola virus or pneumonic plague can take a few days to kill an infected enemy would therefore still be capable of fighting for a significant period yet a biological agent that kills too quickly may not have time to spread among the enemy population
high-containment laboratories high-containment laboratories are needed for research and development of infectious biological agents biological containment is rated on a scale with four levels biosafety level 1 bsl-1 microbes are mostly harmless such as nonpathogenic e coli bsl-2 organisms are human pathogens but not easily transmitted in the laboratory such as salmonella bsl-3 organisms are dangerous and often can be transmitted via aerosol such as tuberculosis and sars bsl-4 laboratories are for extremely dangerous and easily transmissible microbes such as ebolathe whole bsl-4 laboratory is sealed off and kept at a little under normal atmospheric pressure in case of a leak outside air will flow into the laboratory helping ensure contaminated air will remain there instead of seeping out operations are conducted inside safety cabinets with glove ports to enter a bsl-4 lab a researcher must use an air lock and exchange outside clothes for a separate set of lab clothes including a special spacesuit that is equipped with its own air supply fig 2216

when finished a scientist leaves behind his lab clothes and uses an exit equipped with disinfectant showers and ultraviolet lights some high-containment labs are designed so that the only exit is via total submersion in a pool of disinfectant ultraviolet lights are used to sterilize both the laboratories themselves and the air locks especially when working with virusesusing high-containment facilities for research is expensive and time consuming for manufacturing biological weapons on an industrial scale the inconveniences are correspondingly worse however terrorist groups or rogue nations may only care about secrecy and may be willing to forgo biosafety considerations the us armys criteria for a biowarfare agent are given in box 221
five major factors that influence the use of a biological warfare agent include preparation dispersal persistence incubation time and the necessity of high-containment laboratories a variety of viruses bacteria and toxins have been proposed as effective agents these are classified into three categories by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc according to their level of risk
box 221requirements for biological warfare agentsaccording to the us army a biological warfare agent should fulfill the following requirements1it should consistently produce death disability or damage2it should be capable of being produced economically and in militarily adequate quantities from available materials3it should be stable under production and storage conditions in munitions and in transportation4it should be capable of being disseminated efficiently by existing techniques equipment or munitions5it should be stable after dissemination from a military munition
anthrax is a virulent disease of cattle that infects humans quite easily it is caused by the bacterium bacillus anthracis which is relatively easy to culture and forms spores which can survive harsh conditions that would kill most bacteria the spores may lie dormant in the soil for years and then germinate on contact with a suitable animal victimthree main forms of anthrax occur cutaneous anthrax that is infection of the skin is rarely dangerous gastrointestinal anthrax occurs mostly in grazing animals and is relatively rare among humans although it can occur via ingestion of bacteria or spores from contaminated meat inhalational anthrax in which the spores enter via the lungs gives a high death rate in many ways anthrax is the ideal biological weaponlethal highly infectious and cheap to produce with spores that store wellthe problem with anthrax however is that the spores are so tough and long-lived that getting rid of them after hostilities are over is nearly impossible during world war ii the british tested anthrax using sheep as the targets on the tiny island of gruinard which lies off the coast of scotland although it was firebombed and disinfected the island remained uninhabitable for nearly 50 years because of anthrax spores still surviving in the soil finally in 1990 the island was declared safe after it was treated with a solution of formaldehyde and seawater the indestructibility of anthrax spores would thus be problematic for a military occupation but it could be useful as a defense mechanism anthrax spores seeded into the soil of sparsely populated land could serve to protect against foreign invaders
yersinia pestis the causative agent of bubonic plague was responsible for the notorious black death epidemics of the middle ages and is a current bioterrorism threat plague is typically spread by flea bites however aerosolized bacteria can cause the pneumonic form of plague this form of the disease is highly infectious and has a mortality rate close to 100 if untreated besides japans use of plague as a biological weapon during world war ii discussed previously the british biological warfare center at porton down maintained large-scale plague cultures for several years following the war in the 1960s the united states experimented with spreading plague among rodents in vietnam laos and cambodia to little practical effect because it can be obtained relatively easily from nature plague may be an attractive weapon for bioterrorists fig 2217
an unconfirmed report in 2009 indicated that 40 al-qaeda terrorists in algeria accidentally became infected with plague and died presumably from a biological weapons experiment gone awryother potential bacterial agents include the following
brucella
brucellosis is a disease of cattle camels goats and related animals brucellosis was developed as a biological weapon by the united states from 1954 to 1969 in humans it behaves erratically both in the time for symptoms to emerge and the course of the disease although human victims often fall severely ill for several weeks it is rarely fatal even if untreated it could be used as an incapacitating agent
francisella tularensis
tularemia is a disease of rodents or birds that has a death rate of 5 to 10 in humans if untreated it is highly infectious and generally regarded as an incapacitating agent
burkholderia pseudomallei
melioidosis is related to glanders burkholderia mallei a disease of horses melioidosis is a rare disease of rodents from the far east that is spread by rat fleas melioidosis is more virulent than glanders and untreated is fatal some 95 of the time in humans
in many ways anthrax is one of the best biological weapons it is lethal highly infectious and easy to produce and it has long-lasting spores plague is also lethal and its pneumonic form can spread from person to person potential incapacitating agents include brucellosis and tularemia

variola the viral etiologic agent of smallpox is a member of the poxvirus family these large viruses contain double-stranded ds dna fig 2218
poxviruses are the most complex animal viruses and are so large they may be seen with a light microscope they measure approximately 04 by 02 microns compared to 10 by 05 microns for bacteria such as e coli unlike other animal dna viruses which replicate inside the cell nucleus poxviruses replicate their dsdna in the cytoplasm of the host cell they build subcellular factories known as inclusion bodies inside which virus particles are manufactured poxviruses have 185000 nucleotides encoding 150 to 200 genes about the same number as the t4 family of complex bacterial viruses
variola virus infects only humans which allowed its eradication by the world health organization a task completed by 1980 smallpox is highly infectious and exists as two variants variola major with a fatality rate of 30 to 40 and variola minor with a fatality rate of around 1 fig 2219
 their genome sequences differ by approximately 2 vaccinia virus is a related mild poxvirus of unknown origin that is used as a live vaccine immunity is conferred against several closely related poxviruses including smallpox and monkeypoxfor governments the preparation of large amounts of a virus whose particles are fairly stable and long-lived such as smallpox is feasible it is believed that the former soviet union had done so as discussed earlier the virus could be delivered using a medical nebulizer see fig 2214 or through the use of suicidal volunteers who would deliberately infect themselves and then travel to densely populated target areas they would mingle with as many people as possible by attending large events and utilizing mass transit however transmission requires close contact and when a person is most contagious he may be feeling far too ill to actually walk around in publicthough many viruses are difficult to culture in large amounts and are unstable during storage several others have been considered as possible biological warfare agents
filovirus ebola and marburg viruses make up a family of negative single-stranded ss rna viruses known as the filoviruses which form long thin filaments fig 2220
 patients vomit and ooze blood from various orifices including their eyes and ears ebola outbreaks in sudan and zaire have had 80 to 90 fatality but closely related strains exist that are not as virulent for example in 1989 an ebola outbreak occurred among long-tailed macaques in a research facility in reston virginia however this strain was not lethal to humans transmission generally requires substantial exposure to infected body fluids so filoviruses are difficult to acquire by casual exposure in practice this makes them a relatively poor choice for use as a biological warfare agent
flavivirus dengue fever and yellow fever are both caused by members of the flavivirus family yellow fever is frequently lethal whereas dengue is rarely fatal but it is very painful and incapacitates its victims for several days however both are spread by insect bites which would make their use as biological weapons difficult
arenavirus an arenavirus that appeared in the lassa river region of nigeria in the late 1960s causes lassa hemorrhagic fever which symptomatically resembles an ebola infection this segmented ssrna virus has extremely high mortality and is typically spread by rodents
smallpox is the most likely virus to be used as a biological warfare agent it is highly infectious and the death rate may reach 30 to 40 other viruses with higher mortality rates may be prohibitively difficult to distribute
fungal agents perhaps may be most effectively used against staple crops for instance cereals and potatoes which are an important part of the food supply a wide variety of fungi exist that destroy these crops such as rusts smuts and molds their spores are often highly infectious and easily dispersed by wind or rain and in many cases there is no effective treatmentsoybean rust and wheat stem rust are examples of pathogenic fungi that could destroy major crops in addition to destruction of the crop certain fungi may produce toxins for example when ergot grows on rye or other cereals it produces a mixture of toxins that cause a syndrome referred to as ergotism which can lead to convulsions hallucinations and even death fig 2221
 some researchers believe that community ergot poisoning may have been responsible for the hysteria that led to the salem witch trialsanother potential fungal agent is aspergillus flavus which infects cereals and legumes and produces the carcinogenic aflatoxin acute aflatoxin poisoning can cause liver damage and death and chronic exposure can cause cancer herculean efforts are made to keep the food supply free of aflatoxinfrom the perspective of biological warfare there are many advantages to using a fungal agent against crops first an entire crop might have to be screened even if only a small part was infected causing major disruptions and economic losses second dispersal could be rather easily accomplished by spraying fungal spores with a crop duster airplane over farmland alternatively seeds could be infected especially since many of them are imported to the united states and may be more easily accessed for contamination third modern agriculture is particularly vulnerable to infection because large acres of genetically identical cultivars are often planted in high density this lack of genetic variability could allow for an infection to spread rapidly finally fungal agents that attack crops pose little danger to those using themthe spores of highly infectious fungi could be used as biological warfare agents to target staple crops
another approach to biological warfare is to use purified toxins rather than a living infectious agent a variety of toxins are known that may be purified in substantial quantities bacteria primitive eukaryotes such as algae or fungi higher plants and animals all make toxins table 222

botulinum toxin the most toxic substance known is botulinum toxin it is made by the anaerobic bacterium clostridium botulinum and is the cause of botulism a severe form of food poisoning it has been proposed as a biological warfare agent but has actually found its most frequent application in cosmetics under the name botox it is also used to treat a few clinical conditions in which a muscle relaxant is neededbotulinum toxin is a neurotoxin that blocks transmission of signals from nerves to muscles thus causing muscular paralysis the incredible potency of botulinum toxin is due to its enzymatic activity it is a zinc protease that cleaves snare proteins in the neuromuscular junction that are required for release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine death is generally due to paralysis of the lungs and respiratory failure fig 2222

c botulinum almost never causes infections but will grow in improperly canned food proper canning uses a pressure cooker to destroy the hardy spores produced by clostridium if the spores are not destroyed they can germinate after the bacteria die they release botulinum toxin which accumulates in the food merely 50 ng of botulinum toxin is enough to kill the average human the toxin can however be destroyed by heatingterrorists of the japanese cult aum shinrikyo discussed previously have attempted to use botulinum toxin aerosols were dispersed at various sites in tokyo and at us military installations in japan on several occasions between 1990 and 1995 the attacks failed mainly because the cult used strains of c botulinum that failed to produce toxin on the other hand millions of people have willingly had extremely dilute preparations of botulinum toxin botox injected into their face to eliminate wrinkles the procedure works because botulinum toxin inhibits the muscle contraction responsible for causing them
ricin many higher plants make ribosome-inactivating proteins rips these enzymes split the n-glycosidic bond between adenine and ribose from a specific sequence in the large-subunit ribosomal rna clipping adenine from the rrna totally inactivates the ribosome a single rip molecule is sufficient to inactivate all the ribosomes and kill a whole cell because rips are synthesized as precursor proteins that are fully processed only after exiting the plant cells cytoplasm the toxin does not kill the plant intact ribosomes from different types of organisms differ greatly in their sensitivity to rips mammalian ribosomes which contain 28s rrna are by far the most sensitive on the other hand the activity of many rips against bacterial ribosomes which contain 23s rrna is low or negligible and this has allowed the genes for some rips to be cloned and expressed in e coli
like many bacterial toxins ricin is a typical a-b toxin in which the a chain exhibits toxic enzymatic activity and the b chain mediates entry into the target cell ricin is lethal at around 3 gkg body weight meaning that 300 g should kill a large human ricin is extracted from the seeds of the castor bean plant ricinus communis fig 2223
 this plant is widely grown both for ornamentation and on a large scale for castor oil production because of its widespread availability high toxicity stability and lack of any antidote there are several examples of the use of ricin as a biological weaponricin achieved international notoriety in 1978 when the bulgarian defector georgi markov was assassinated in a london street by ricin the communist assassin wielded a modified umbrella that injected a hollow 06-mm-diameter metal sphere filled with ricin into markovs leg in 1991 four members of the patriots council an extremist group in minnesota with an antigovernment and antitax ideology purified ricin in a home laboratory they were arrested for plotting to kill irs and law enforcement agents with ricin in late 2013 actress shannon richardson pleaded guilty for mailing letters containing ricin to president barack obama and new york city mayor michael bloomberg in a scheme to frame her estranged husband in a completely separate incident in january 2014 james dutschke also pleaded guilty to sending ricin to president obama and other government officials with the intention of framing an elvis presley impersonator with whom he had a personal feud
abrin though less well known abrin which is also a ribosome-inactivating protein is four times more toxic than ricin abrin is derived from the seeds of abrus precatorius commonly known as jequirity or rosary pea fig 2224
the beautiful seeds are widely used in jewelry particularly rosary beads however the seeds are so toxic that if broken or damaged a small prick in the skin is sufficient to absorb a lethal dose of abrin there have been reports of abrin poisoning in jewelry makers as well as in individuals who ingested seeds but there are no known instances of abrin being used as a biological weapon
conotoxin cone snails are predators that use a venom cocktail containing at least 100 different conotoxins to paralyze and kill their prey the most dangerous cone snail to humans conus
geographus stabs fish with a venom-filled harpoon located in its proboscis fig 2225
death from the sting of a cone snail is largely due to -conotoxins which cause muscle paralysis leading to respiratory arrest other toxins may trigger cardiovascular collapse symptomatically -conotoxins resemble botulinum toxin although the mechanism of action is different because most conotoxins are short peptides 1030 amino acids in length the concern from a biological warfare perspective is not that a government or terrorist would harvest venom from cone snails but that the toxins would be chemically synthesizedpurified toxins are possible biological warfare agents natural toxins can be isolated from bacteria plants and animals but other toxins could be chemically synthesized botulinum toxin disrupts the neuromuscular junction and is the most potent toxin known ricin and abrin are ribosome-inactivating proteins that are made by certain plants
the soviet germ warfare facility is known to have modified smallpox virus and generated a variety of artificial mutants and hybrids the details are largely unavailable however recent experiments with mousepox ectromelia virus have given disturbing results mousepox is related to smallpox but it only infects mice its virulence varies greatly depending on the strain of mouse genetically resistant mice rely on cell-mediated immunity rather than antibodies natural killer nk cells and cytotoxic t cells destroy cells infected with mousepox virus thus clearing the virus from the bodyresearchers modified mousepox virus by inserting the human gene for the cytokine interleukin-4 il-4 il-4 is known to stimulate the division of b cells which synthesize antibodies the rationale for engineering the virus was that il-4 would stimulate the production of antibodies and lead to an improved and more balanced immune response what actually happened was the opposite of what was expected the creation of a virus with vastly greater virulence not only did it kill all of the genetically resistant mice but it also killed 50 of mice that had been vaccinated against mousepox the expression of excess il-4 suppressed the nk cells and cytotoxic t cells furthermore it failed to increase the antibody response the reasons are not fully understood but they do serve as a reminder that the immune system is under extremely complex controlsimilar results have been seen with strains of vaccinia virus which is used for vaccination against smallpox whether insertion of il-4 or other immune regulators into smallpox itself would lead to increased virulence by undermining the immune response is unknown pox- viruses already possess genes designed to protect the virus by interfering with the action of nk cells and cytotoxic t cells fig 2226
 these are the cytokine response modifier crm genes and they vary in effectiveness among different poxviruses one reason smallpox is so virulent may be that it already subverts the bodys cell-mediated immune response in this case adding il-4 would not be expected to increase virulencewith genetic engineering it is also possible to hide a potentially dangerous virus inside a harmless bacterium this strategy is already used in nature when bacteriophages insert their genomes into bacterial chromosomes or plasmids and later re-emerge to infect other hosts
theoretically cloning the entire genome of a small animal or plant virus into a bacterial plasmid could create a biological weapon larger viruses could be accommodated with bacterial or yeast artificial chromosomes in the case of rna viruses a cdna copy of the virus genome must first be generated by reverse transcriptase before cloning it into a bacterial vector any virus containing a poison sequence a base sequence that is not stably maintained on bacterial plasmids could perhaps be cloned as separate fragments such a strategy works for yellow fever virus but a complete functional cdna requires ligation of the fragments in vitromany cell types both bacterial and eukaryotic can take up dna or rna under certain circumstances by transformation consequently the naked nucleic acid genomes of many viruses both dna and rna are infectious even in the absence of their protein capsids or envelopes thus once a viral genome is cloned the dna molecule containing it may itself be infectious alternatively the cdna version of some rna viruses can successfully infect host cells and give rise to a new crop of rna-containing virus particles this has been demonstrated for rna viruses such as poliovirus influenza and coronavirusthe cleverest strategy for generating an rna virus is to clone the cdna version of its genome onto a bacterial plasmid downstream of a strong promoter fig 2227
 the natural rna version of the viral genome will be generated by transcription when induced the bacterial cell would generate a large number of infectious viral particles a dangerous human rna virus loaded into a harmless intestinal bacterium under the control of a promoter designed to respond to conditions inside the intestine could pose a formidable threatgenetically engineering biological warfare agents to make them deadlier is a minor threat since many naturally occurring microbes are already very dangerous however certain poxviruses have been modified to become more virulent inserting viral dna into plasmids carried by harmless bacteria could create camouflaged viruses
rather than attempting to grow and identify disease-causing agents using classical microbiological techniques molecular diagnostics analyzes molecules typically dna but rna proteins and volatile organic compounds can also be used other diagnostic methods involve the use of antibody technology and are discussed in chapter 6 molecular techniques have the advantage of being quicker more accurate and more sensitiveone diagnostic method is called fluorescent in situ hybridization fish for details see chapter 3 biopsies or other patient samples are directly probed with fluorescent dna oligonucleotides specific to a pathogen of interest if the pathogen is present the probe binds to the complementary dna in its chromosome and the fluorescence can be visualized under a microscope a new innovation called peptide nucleic acid pna replaces the negatively charged sugar-phosphate backbone of dna with a neutral peptide backbone probes made of pna bind complementary dna more tightly and enter bacterial cells more easily fig 2228
most other methods based on dna detection involve extracting dna from a sample followed by amplification via pcr because primers can be designed to amplify dna sequences unique to a particular pathogen pcr itself can serve as a diagnostic tool the advantages of pcr are that it theoretically requires only a single molecule of target dna and works on microbes that cannot be cultured in the laboratory the downside is that pcr is susceptible to contamination and false positives a variant of pcr see chapter 4 called randomly amplified polymorphic dna rapd can be used to distinguish different strains of the same bacterial species this capability is useful in epidemiology for tracking the spread of infectious diseaseadditionally every species of microorganism has a different small-subunit ribosomal rna ssu rrna sequence 16s rrna in bacteria and 18s rrna in eukaryotes thus if a patient has an unknown infection clinicians can use pcr to amplify the gene encoding the microbes ssu rrna primers that recognize the conserved region of ssu rrna are used to amplify the gene the pcr fragment is then sequenced and compared with a database of known dna sequencesanother technique that generally relies on ssu rrna is checkerboard hybridization this allows multiple bacteria to be detected and identified simultaneously in a single sample a series of probes corresponding to different bacteria are applied in horizontal lines across a hybridization membrane fig 2229
 pcr is used to amplify a portion of the ssu rrna gene from clinical samples which may contain a mixture of pathogens the pcr fragments are then labeled with a fluorescent dye and applied vertically to the membrane after denaturation and annealing to allow hybridization the membrane is washed to remove unbound dna those samples that hybridize to the probes appear as bright fluorescent spotsa potentially revolutionary technology called plex-id has been developed by abbott laboratories it combines traditional pcr with mass spectrometry to identify unknown microbes in patient samples dna is extracted and many different sets of primers are used to amplify various target sequences the fragments are then analyzed with a mass spectrometer to determine their mass from this information the dna sequence can be deduced and the pathogen identified plex-id can make a diagnosis in 8 hoursin the future it may be possible to diagnose disease using an electronic nose as the name implies the device detects volatile organic compounds that are released by pathogens or by the body in certain diseased conditions
biosensors are devices for the detection and measurement of reactions that rely on a biological mechanism fig 2230
 biosensors have been traditionally used in medical diagnostics and in food and environmental analysis by far the biggest use has been the clinical monitoring of glucose levels in diabetics using the enzyme glucose oxidasethere is growing interest today in using biosensors to detect biological warfare agents placing biosensors in high trafficked areas such as in malls or subway stations could allow for continuous surveillance additionally handheld devices giving a rapid response at the site of a possible attack would be highly useful several proposals exist that would use specific antibodies or antibody fragments as detectors for biological warfare agents see chapter 6 for antibody engineeringb cells carry antibodies specific for one antigen so one proposal is to use whole b cells in a biosensor when an antigen binds to the antibody on the surface of a b cell it triggers a signal cascade engineered b cells have been made that express aequorin a light-emitting protein from the luminescent jellyfish aequorea victoria aequorin emits blue light when triggered by calcium ions fig 2231
 living jellyfish actually produce flashes of blue light which are transduced to green by the famous green fluorescent protein gfpin a biosensor when a b cell detected a disease agent or any specific antigen calcium ions would flood into the cell due to activation of a signal cascade fig 2232
 this in turn triggers light emission by aequorin the light emitted is detected by a sensitive charge-coupled device ccd detector this approach could detect 5 to 10 particles of a biological warfare agent approximately 10000 b cells specific to different pathogens could be assembled in array fashion onto a chip placed inside the biosensoranother scheme developed by the ambri corporation of australia uses antibody fragments mounted on an artificial biological membrane which is attached to a solid support covered by a gold electrode layer channels for sodium ions are incorporated into the membrane when the ion channels are open sodium ions flow across the membrane and a current is generated in the gold electrode the ion channels consist of two modules each spanning half the membrane when top and bottom modules are united the ion channel is open when the top module is pulled away the ion channel cannot operate binding of biological warfare agents by the antibody fragments separates the two halves of the channels which in turn affects the electrical signal fig 2233
diagnosing pathogenic bacteria with molecular techniques particularly using the genes encoding ribosomal rna sequences is faster and more sensitive than traditional microbiological methods biosensors use biological components themselves to monitor for suspicious biomolecules
biological warfare has been around since life first evolved humans are most concerned about the biological warfare directed at us including infectious diseases and the ability of microbes to evolve resistance to antibacterial agents although this development is worrisome new strategies and technologies are being developed to fight back against the growing problem of antibiotic resistancehumans have often attempted to use biological agents in warfare although with little overall success so far several highly virulent infectious agents including anthrax plague and smallpox as well as certain biological toxins such as ricin and abrin are regarded as likely biological warfare agents whether or not genetic engineering can create improved bioweapons is as yet uncertain developing quicker ways to detect and diagnose microbes is an active area of research

macroautophagy hereafter referred to as autophagy is a cellular pathway that delivers cytoplasmic proteins and organelles to the lysosome for degradation it occurs at a basal level in nutrient-rich conditions but can be upregulated in response to various stress conditions such as starvation autophagy can be non-selective that is a portion of the cytoplasm is engulfed for example in response to amino acid deprivation or selective selective autophagy targets various cargoes for degradation this includes organelle-specific autophagy including mitophagy pexophagy and reticulophagy and xenophagy which is the degradation of microorganisms1autophagy has also emerged as an innate immune response pathway targeting intracellular bacteria in the cytosol in damaged vacuoles and in phagosomes to restrict bacterial growth autophagy can be induced on bacterial infection and involves the formation of double-membrane compartments known as autophagosomes around target bacteria and their transport to lysosomes for degradation2 extensive work has been done to determine the induction and targeting mechanisms of antibacterial autophagy it is now thought that multiple host factors and pathways are activated and contribute to this processincreasing evidence also suggests that bacteria have evolved strategies to combat autophagy3 recent studies have indicated the existence of active interactions between bacterial factors and host autophagy components certain bacteria can inhibit the signalling pathways that lead to autophagy induction45 mask themselves with host proteins to avoid autophagy recognition678 interfere with the autophagy machinery to escape targeting910 or block fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome11 some bacteria even actively exploit autophagy components to promote their own intracellular growth1213 the mechanisms by which bacteria interfere with autophagy remain mostly unclear and are currently the subject of intense investigationin this review we provide an overview of the mechanisms of canonical and non-canonical autophagy and then focus on the interplay between bacteria and autophagy including how autophagy targets bacteria for clearance and how bacteria block this process or hijack it for survivalthe hallmark of autophagy is the formation of the double-membrane autophagosome which captures and transports cytoplasmic components to the lysosome for degradation in mammalian cells and yeast autophagosomes are initiated at the phagophore assembly site pas14 an example of a pas in mammals is the omegasome a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate ptdins3p-enriched subdomain of the endoplasmic reticulum er15 a group of autophagy-related atg proteins are the key players in autophagy although some also have non-autophagy functions table 1canonical and selective autophagy autophagy can be dissected into the following steps signal induction membrane nucleation cargo targeting vesicle expansion and autophagosome formation fusion with the lysosome cargo degradation and nutrient recycling14 fig 1induction can be triggered by a range of signals from nutrient limitation in the case of non-selective autophagy to the recognition of specific cargo such as damaged mitochondria or bacteria16 the unc-51-like kinase 1 ulk1 known as atg1 in yeast complex which comprises ulk1 atg13 fak family kinase-interacting protein of 200 kda fip200 and atg101 also known as c12orf44 is the signal initiation complex and has a key role in recruiting atg proteins to the pas17 in the presence of nutrients the ulk1 complex is inhibited by mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 mtorc1 which promotes growth in nutrient-rich conditions17 mtorc1 phosphorylates ulk1 and atg13 thus inhibiting the recruitment of the ulk1 complex to the pas1819 by contrast when mtorc1 is inactive during nutrient limitation or rapamycin treatment ulk1 is released1819 which enables it to phosphorylate fip200 translocate to the pas and recruit other atg proteins to initiate autophagosome formation181920 the ulk1 complex is also essential for initiation during selective autophagy although in most cases it is unclear whether ulk1 recruitment is regulated by mtorc1 or by other signalling molecules for example in yeast atg1 is required for pexophagy21 mitophagy22 and the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting pathway cvt pathway23 and in mammals fip200 is crucial for the autophagic degradation of salmonella enterica subsp enterica serovar typhimurium24the ulk1 complex recruits beclin 1 becn1 atg6 in yeast atg14-like atg14l and phosphoinositide 3-kinase regulatory subunit 4 pik3r4 vacuolar protein sorting-associated 15 vps15 in yeast to the pas where they are involved in the phagophore membrane nucleation step this is achieved by engaging ptdins3-kinase class iii ptdins3kc3 vps34 in yeast resulting in the production of ptdins3p at the phagophore this leads to the recruitment of ptdins3p-binding proteins such as wd-repeat domain phosphoinositide-interacting 1 wipi1 atg18 in yeast and wipi2 atg21 in yeast to the pas to aid phagophore assembly by at least in yeast recruiting downstream atg proteins atg16 and atg8 see below2526 atg9 is also important for phagophore assembly in yeast atg9 exits from the trans-golgi network tgn and associates with small vesicles2728 some of which contribute membranes at least partially for phagophore biogenesis2728 in mammals atg9 localizes at the tgn and on endosomes transiently interacts with omegasomes and is required for pas formation and expansion2930 however atg9 is not incorporated into the pasautophagosome elongation is mediated by two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems the atg12atg5 ubiquitin-like-conjugate which is activated by the e1-like enzyme atg7 and the e2-like enzyme atg10 promotes phagophore elongation3132 in addition atg12atg5 forms a complex with atg16l1 which associates with the expanding phagophore membrane33 but is released from the autophagosome membrane when the vesicle is complete32 the fusion of atg16l1- associated precursor vesicles with each other is mediated by snare proteins and possibly contributes to the phagophore expansion process34 atg12atg5 is necessary for the formation of the second ubiquitin-like conjugate light chain 3 lc3 also known as map1lc3b atg8 in yeastphosphatidylethanolamine pe which is activated by the e1-like enzyme atg7 and the e2-like enzyme atg3 the atg12atg5atg16l1 complex directs lc3 to the target membrane35 where it becomes conjugated to pe by the e3-like enzyme activity of atg12atg5 ref 36 the cysteine protease atg4b is also required for lc3pe formation as it cleaves the carboxyl terminus of lc3 and exposes a glycine residue that is then covalently attached to pe37 in addition atg4b deconjugates a proportion of the lc3pe complexes when autophagosome formation is complete thus facilitating the recycling of lc3 for the formation of new autophagosomes3738 recent studies in yeast indicate that this deconjugation process is necessary for efficient autophagosome biogenesis as well as for maturation of the autophagosome into a fusion-capable autophagosome3839 lc3 has been shown to mediate the hemifusion of vesicles and to control the size of the autophagosome in yeast4041eventually autophagosomes mature into degradative autolysosomes by a series of fusion events with endosomes and lysosomes in mammals the fusion of an autophagosome with a lysosome requires the small gtpase rab7 ypt7 in yeast42 the autophagosomal snare protein syntaxin 17 ref 43 and the lysosomal snare vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 vamp8 as well as lysosomal membrane proteins such as lysosomal-associated membrane glycoprotein 2 lamp24445 in yeast the vesicle snare v-snare proteins vacuolar morphogenesis protein 7 vam7 and ykt6 the target snare t-snare proteins vam3 and vti1 the gtpase ypt7 the ypt7 guanine nucleotide exchange factor gef monensin sensitivity 1calcium-caffeine-zinc sensitivity 1 mon1ccz1 and homotypic vacuole fusion and vacuole protein sorting hops proteins46 are all required for autophagosome fusion with the vacuole which is the yeast counterpart of the lysosome lysosomal breakdown of the inner autophagosomal membrane and the autophagosome cargo is mediated by lysosomal hydrolasesselective autophagy has an additional step  cargo selection  which is mediated by cargo receptors and adaptor proteins in mammalian cells cargo-specific receptors usually contain an lc3-interacting region lir that mediates the recruitment of lc3-decorated autophagosomes to the cargo for example mitochondria474849 moreover ubiquitin-associated cargoes are recognized by ubiquitin-binding protein adaptors which also contain lirs50 one example is p62 which links various cargo targets including ubiquitylated protein aggregates5152 ubiquitin-tagged peroxisomes53 and bacteria85455 to autophagosomes other adaptor proteins that have both a ubiquitin-binding domain and an lir have also been discovered including nbr1 next to brca1 gene 156 ndp52 nuclear dot protein 52 kda also known as calcoco257 and optineurin58 nbr1 is involved in the targeting of protein aggregates56 peroxisomes59 and the bacterial pathogen francisella tularensis60 for autophagy ndp52 and optineurin together with p62 are involved in the autophagy of s typhimurium555758alternative non-canonical autophagy recent studies have identified alternative autophagy pathways that are independent of some of the core machinery components these are known as non-canonical forms of autophagy for example autophagy that is independent of ulk1 and ulk2 has been observed after long-term glucose starvation61 moreover a recent study found that autophagy can occur in atg5-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts62 atg5-independent autophagy which contributes to organelle clearance during erythrocyte maturation depends on the ulk1 complex and becn1 but does not require lc3pe and several other essential conventional autophagy components including atg7 atg12 atg16l1 and atg9 becn1-independent autophagy has also been identified in cancer cell lines in which it is induced by apoptotic stimuli such as staurosporine63 and by the antioxidant resveratrol64 as well as in non-tumour cell lines in which it is induced by the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium65 and by the recombinant viral capsid protein vp1 of foot-and-mouth disease virus66 among others becn1-independent autophagy involves the formation of double-membrane autophagosomes and requires the ulk1 complex atg5 atg7 and lc3pe conjugation systems but the exact mechanism remains unclear636467a recent study identified a non-canonical form of autophagy in which the autophagosome was derived from the late endosome  a process known as endosome-mediated autophagy enma68 enma is induced by the toll-like receptor tlr ligand lipopolysaccharide in dendritic cells which contain late endosomes known as major histocompatibility complex mhc class ii-containing compartments miics typical miic marker proteins and autophagy proteins including lc3 and atg16l1 were associated with these miic-derived autophagosomes notably enma was independent of atg4b and lc3 conjugation to pe as the miic-derived autophagosomes were formed in atg4b-knockout dendritic cellsduring tlr- or fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis in professional phagocytic cells autophagy components including lc3 becn1 ptdins3kc3 and atg12atg5 are translocated to the phagosomal membrane to promote phagosome fusion with the lysosome6970 this process does not involve the formation of a double- membrane autophagosome and has been termed lc3-associated phagocytosis lap induction of lap is independent of the ulk1 complex71 but requires the activity of nadph oxidase and the production of reactive oxygen species ros70 nadph oxidase is activated and assembled on the phagosomal membrane during the phagocytosis of microorganisms and generates ros in the phagosomal lumen to directly kill them how ros induce the recruitment of lc3 to the phagosome and how autophagy components facilitate lysosomal fusion remains unknown notably lap is thought to restrict the growth of bacterial pathogens such as s typhimurium70 and burkholderia pseudomallei72 in host cellsas mentioned above bacteria have been identified as targets of selective autophagy and this process is known as xenophagy in this context autophagy acts as an innate immune mechanism against bacterial infection autophagy can target intracellular bacteria either in the cytosol or in vacuoles to restrict their growth fig 2a in most cases lc3-decorated autophagosomes are formed around the target bacteria2 and deliver them into the lysosome for degradationautophagy targeting
s
typhimurium one well-studied example of a bacterium that is targeted for autophagy is s typhimurium fig 2b autophagy is essential for restricting the growth of this bacterium in caenorhabditis elegans and dictyostelium discoideum73 s typhimurium uses its two type iii secretion systems t3sss encoded by salmonella pathogenicity island 1 spi-1 and spi-2 to invade epithelial cells and typically resides in the salmonella-containing vacuole scv74 however a subset of bacteria damages the scv membrane early after infection via spi-1 t3ss pore-forming activities on the vacuolar membrane and can potentially escape into the cytosol to obtain nutrients for rapid growth75 some of the cytosol-exposed bacteria are targeted by autophagy within damaged scvs as shown by the recruitment of lc3 and other atg proteins to the bacteria as a consequence autophagy protects the cytosol from bacterial colonization76how s typhimurium is selectively targeted to autophagosomes has been the subject of many studies evidence suggests that scv membrane damage exposes specific signature molecules either on the bacterial surface or on the inner face of the scv membrane and in turn these molecules recruit adaptor proteins from the cytosol that then recruit autophagy components to the scv fig 2b for example it has been shown that a population of bacteria is associated with ubiquitylated proteins shortly after invasion indicating exposure to the cytosol76 these ubiquitin-positive bacteria also colocalize with adaptor protein p62 see above and lc3 ref 55 which suggests that p62 links the bacteria to autophagosomes via lc3 the adaptor protein optineurin58 also has a role in bacterial autophagy phosphorylation of optineurin by the innate immune receptor tank-binding kinase 1 tbk1 which activates the transcription of type i interferons ifns strengthens its interaction with lc3 which restricts the intracellular growth of s typhimurium58 recently a host ubiquitin e3 ligase leucine-rich repeat and sterile -motif-containing 1 lrsam1 was found to have a role in the ubiquitylation of proteins that are associated with the autophagy of s typhimurium77 but the ubiquitylated host and bacterial proteins that are involved are unknownother host molecules are also thought to participate in the autophagic targeting of bacteria and to interact with autophagy adaptor proteins specifically scv membrane damage exposes the host cell sugar molecule -galactoside  which normally localizes to the plasma membrane surface and luminal face of endosomes including scv membranes  to the cytosol this -galactoside is recognized by its cytosolic receptor galectin 8 which binds ndp52 and thus recruits lc3 to the damaged scv78 remarkably it is the recruitment of ndp52 to bacteria through galectin 8 binding not ubiquitin binding that is required for ndp52-mediated autophagy of s typhimuriumtherefore both ubiquitin and sugar signals contribute to the autophagy of bacteria in damaged vacuoles the existence of three adaptor-mediated pathways p62 optineurin and ndp52 might guarantee the maximal targeting of cytosol-exposed bacteria although the order of activation of each pathway is not entirely clear at the moment the peak of lc3 association with s typhimurium is at 1 hour post-infection a time at which both ubiquitin and galectin 8 have been recruited to the bacteria7678 it is possible that ubiquitin recruits p62 and optineurin to the bacteria at the same time and that galectin 8 recruits ndp52 in parallel more precise kinetic and microscopic studies are needed to resolve the order of translocation of ubiquitin and galectin 8 to the bacteria at the early stages of infectionother core machinery autophagy components such as ulk1 fip200 atg14l atg16l1 and atg9 are also targeted to the scv and each of them has a role in restricting the intracellular growth of s typhimurium24 however targeting of lc3 to the scv is independent of the essential autophagy factors the ulk1 complex the becn1 complex and atg9 therefore lc3 can be recruited to scvs by at least one other non-canonical pathway indeed s typhimurium is also targeted by the lap pathway it has been shown that nadph oxidase and ros are necessary for efficient recruitment of lc3 to bacteria70 in addition the lipid signalling molecule diacylglycerol dag is recruited to scvs and its production is necessary for efficient lc3 recruitment to bacteria79 in fact dag-positive bacteria are not associated with ubiquitin or p62 and inhibiting both dag and p62 leads to an additive inhibitory effect on lc3 recruitment to the bacteria these results suggest that the dag pathway and the ubiquitin-adaptor pathway contribute independently to the recruitment of lc3 to s typhimurium the downstream effector of dag protein kinase c pkc is also required for lc3 recruitment to bacteria79 pkc can activate nadph oxidase by phosphorylation of one of its components80 which suggests that dag-dependent lc3 targeting of bacteria involves the pkcnadph oxidaseros pathway it remains unknown what triggers the translocation of dag to the scvs the spi-1 t3ss of s typhimurium is required for dag localization on the scvs suggesting that either bacterial effectors or the membrane damage caused by t3ss pore-forming activity is involved whether lap occurs before canonical autophagy targets s typhimurium is not clear ros production is very rapid after bacterial invasion peaking at 10 min post-infection81 and association of dag with s typhimurium peaks at 30 min post-infection79 it has also been suggested that ros might contribute to damaging scv membranes therefore activation of lap signalling might occur slightly earlier than activation of the ubiquitinadaptorautophagy pathway correlative electron microscopy studies are needed to distinguish lap from the canonical autophagy pathwayother bacteria targeted by autophagy
mycobacterium tuberculosis is another example of a bacterium that is targeted for autophagy in damaged vacuoles fig 2a during infection of macrophages m tuberculosis blocks phagosome maturation and replicates in the phagosome a recent study showed that 30 of phagosomal mycobacteria were selectively targeted by lc3 and atg12 by 4 hours post-infection82 the membrane-permeabilization factor early secreted antigenic target of 6 kda esat-6 also known as esxa which is the major substrate secreted from the bacterial type vii secretion system esx-1 is required for the targeting of m tuberculosis for autophagy autophagy is thought to be triggered following damage to the m tuberculosis-containing phagosomes with ubiquitylation of host and bacterial proteins having a major role ubiquitin-associated bacteria colocalize with p62 ndp52 and lc3 which suggests that phagosomal damage triggers bacterial targeting by lc3 and adaptor proteins and thus allows targeting of the bacteria by selective autophagy82 the same study found that naked bacterial dna in the host cytosol can function as the signal that triggers autophagy possibly through the activation of tbk1 and sting both of which are necessary for ubiquitin-mediated selective autophagy of m tuberculosis83 the ubiquitin e3 ligase parkin was recently implicated in autophagy of these bacteria84autophagy also selectively targets cytosolic bacteria such as group a streptococcus gas85 when actively invading hela cells gas escapes from the endosomes to the cytoplasm in a process that is mediated by the toxin streptolysin o slo a member of a family of cholesterol-dependent pore-forming cytolysins86 most cytosolic bacteria are enveloped in lc3-decorated gas-containing autophagosome-like vacuoles gcavs and are degraded through autophagy85 fig 2a gcav formation and bacterial clearance are severely impaired in atg5-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts compared with wild-type cells in which most bacteria are killed during the first 4 hours post-infection moreover slo is necessary for autophagic targeting of the bacteria as slo-deficient mutants are not sequestered in lc3-positive autophagic structures and survive longer than wild-type bacteria8586 notably slo-deficient mutants remain in endosomes and cannot escape to the cytosol of hela cells so bacterial exposure to the cytosol may function as the signal for antibacterial autophagy engagement of the human cell surface pathogen receptor cd46 has also been shown to induce autophagy clearance of gas by activating becn1 and ptdins3kc3 ref 87in addition to atg proteins members of the rab gtpase family localize to gcavs and are involved in their formation for example rab7 which mediates late endosome maturation and rab23 which regulates intracellular vesicle transport were found to be necessary for the formation of gcavs8688 rab9a which mediates protein transport from late endosomes to the tgn is required for gcav enlargement and fusion with the lysosomes88 rab9a and rab23 are not involved in starvation-induced canonical autophagosome formation88 which suggests that they have unique roles in selective bacterial autophagyanother study showed that in human oropharyngeal keratinocytes gas uses both slo which is required for the association with ubiquitin and the pore-forming cytolysin streptolysin s sls which is required for the association with galectin 8 to damage the vacuolar membrane resulting in its association with ubiquitin or galectin 8 and consequent targeting by autophagy adaptor proteins89 however in this study slo was shown to promote bacterial survival in human oropharyngeal keratinocytes together with nad glycohydrolase a toxin that is encoded in the same operon slo inhibits the fusion of gcavs with lysosomes89 thus in human oropharyngeal keratinocytes gas infection induces the xenophagic response but bacterial toxins inhibit the formation of mature autolysosomes and enable bacterial survival this is a more complex interaction between bacteria and autophagy than that seen in hela cells in which autophagy kills most bacteria during early infection85although some bacteria are targeted and eliminated by autophagy others have developed ways to escape this defence system or even hijack the autophagy machinery to promote their intracellular growth fig 3 table 2 in addition to the examples that are discussed below other bacteria such as f tularensis yersinia enterocolitica and orientia tsutsugamushi have been reported to escape autophagy but the bacterial and host factors that are involved have not been fully elucidated6090919293inhibition of autophagy-initiation signalling some bacteria have developed strategies to inhibit the signalling cascade that initiates autophagy for example it has been shown that early after s typhimurium infection 1 hour post-infection membrane damage triggers a transient cytosolic amino acid starvation response as shown by the activation of the amino acid sensor gcn2 a kinase that phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eukaryotic initiation factor-2 eif2 which controls protein synthesis5 this acute amino acid starvation inhibits mtorc1 activity and relocalizes mtor which is a part of mtorc1 from the late endosome to the cytosol5 thus activating autophagy signalling however by 4 hours post-infection the cytosolic amino acid pool is restored and mtor is reactivated mtor then relocalizes to late endosomes and scvs thus inhibiting autophagy targeting towards s typhimurium fig 2b interestingly inactivation of mtorc1 by rapamycin treatment resulted in an association of 50 of bacteria with lc3 at 4 hours post-infection which suggests that s typhimurium escapes autophagy targeting at this time point by promoting mtorc1 activation although it remains unclear how this is achieved it has been shown that spi-2 t3ss is upregulated 4 hours after infection94 and spi-2 t3ss or its secreted effectors might have a role in the relocalization of mtorc1 regulators to the scvsanother example of a bacterium that has evolved to avoid autophagy is m tuberculosis str h37rv in this bacterial strain deletion of the gene encoding eis enhanced intracellular survival induces the formation of autophagosomes following the infection of bone marrow-derived macrophages which suggests that eis can inhibit autophagy activation during infection by wild-type bacteria95 further analysis revealed that this is achieved by interfering with jun n-terminal kinase jnk signalling thus blocking the production of ros which are required for autophagy triggering eis-mutant bacteria were found to activate jnk and to consequently promote the production of ros95 eis is an n-acetyltransferase that acetylates and activates a jnk-specific phosphatase mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 7 which inhibits jnk phosphorylation and leads to its inactivation96in addition bacterial toxins have been shown to inhibit autophagy induction by modulating the levels of cyclic amp a second messenger that regulates many cellular processes such as lipid and glucose metabolism and pro-inflammatory cytokine production9798 camp is thought to negatively regulate autophagy as its major effector protein kinase a pka97 inhibits autophagy in yeast by directly phosphorylating atg13 which is a component of the atg1 complex and camp- and pka-modulating drugs have been reported to block autophagy in mammals99 many bacteria express camp-increasing toxins to inhibit host innate immune responses for example oedema factor toxin from bacillus anthracis is an adenylyl cyclase that can directly increase intracellular camp levels100 and cholera toxin from vibrio cholerae is an adp ribosyltransferase that is capable of indirectly increasing camp by activating host adenylyl cyclases101 both toxins have inhibitory effects on host cell autophagy induction when cells were treated with purified toxins the induction of different types of autophagy was significantly reduced including rapamycin-induced autophagy s typhimurium-induced autophagy and lap4 suggesting that camp regulates an upstream signal that is common for all of the above tested autophagy pathwaysdirect interference with the activity of autophagy components some bacteria inhibit autophagy by directly interfering with the activity of autophagy components fig 3a for example legionella pneumophila induces autophagy in infected mouse macrophages in a manner that is dependent on the bacterial type iv secretion system t4ss known as the doticm secretion system102 the bacterium is internalized in a phagosome wrapped by er structures a process that is thought to favour bacterial growth in which autophagy components such as atg7 and lc3 are sequentially recruited to eventually deliver the bacterium to lysosomes102 however it was recently shown that l pneumophila can avoid autophagy targeting during infection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells10 by the production of the t4ss effector ravz this protein functions as an atg4b-like cysteine protease that directly targets the amide bond between the tyrosine and the glycine at the c terminus of lc3 which is covalently linked to pe on autophagy induction to form lc3pe10 therefore ravz irreversibly deconjugates lc3 from pe and inhibits autophagosome formation this is the first evidence of a bacterial effector protein mimicking the function of a host autophagy component to modify another critical autophagy protein and inhibit the whole processanother example of a bacterium that interferes with autophagy components is shigella flexneri which invades epithelial cells and escapes from the endosomal compartment into the cytoplasm to multiply and disseminate to other cells s flexneri can evade autophagy by directly inactivating the autophagy regulator rab1 which is a small rab gtpase that also mediates er-to-golgi trafficking recent studies have shown that rab1 is required for autophagosome formation in mammalian cells103104 possibly by controlling the levels of ptdins3p on the omegasome by targeting the ptdins3-phosphatase myotubularin-related 6 to the omegasomal membrane105 another study reported that the s flexneri t3ss effector vira has a gtpase-activating protein gap domain which suggests that it can inactivate rab gtpases9 indeed in wild-type bacteria vira inactivates rab1 thus inhibiting autophagy induction and in the absence of vira bacteria are more efficiently decorated by lc3 ref 9 fig 3bevasion of autophagy recognition by masking the bacterial surface some bacteria avoid recognition by the autophagy machinery by masking themselves with host molecules one such example is s flexneri which produces icsb a virulence factor secreted by the t3ss that is important for bacterial pathogenesis at a post-invasion stage106107 icsb bacteria which still escape into the cytosol have a reduced ability to spread into neighbouring cells in certain polarized cells106107 these bacteria become sequestered in multilamellar autophagosomes by the ubiquitinp62 and ndp52lc3 pathways and show defective replication654 compared with icsb bacteria of which 35 are targeted to autophagosomes at 2 hours post-infection and 50 are targeted to autophagosomes at 6 hours post-infection only 10 of wild-type bacteria are targeted for autophagy throughout the first 6 hours of infection which suggests that s flexneri uses icsb to escape autophagy6 in fact icsb binds to a bacterial surface protein icsa also known as virg and competes with its binding to host atg5 thereby masking the bacteria from atg protein recognition6 fig 3b in addition when compared with wild-type bacteria icsb mutants are more frequently surrounded by cage-like structures formed by septins a group of conserved gtp-binding proteins that are often found at the cell-bud neck during cell division and these entrapped bacteria are targeted for autophagy108 as septins are necessary for the recruitment of ubiquitin p62 and ndp52 to the bacteria54 it is possible that icsb masks the bacteria from septins and prevents their autophagic targeting identifying the septin binding partners on bacteria and elucidating their interactions with icsb will be necessary to fully understand how icsb blocks septin cage capturelisteria monocytogenes is another example of a bacterial pathogen that can mask itself to avoid autophagy recognition during l monocytogenes infection of mouse macrophages the bacterium is internalized by phagocytosis but damages the phagosomal membrane by secretion of the pore-forming toxin listeriolysin o llo and other bacterial and host factors and escapes into the cytosol to replicate109 cytosolic bacteria express acta a cell surface protein that recruits the host arp23 actin-related protein 23 complex which can then polymerize actin on the bacterial surface the forces that are associated with actin polymerization promote bacterial intracellular motility and cell-to-cell spread110 which are thought to help the bacteria to escape autophagosome capture111112 notably acta mutant bacteria are sequestered in lc3-positive double-membrane vacuoles following the addition of the antibiotic chloramphenicol to block bacterial protein synthesis111113 by contrast wild-type bacteria are not targeted for autophagy even when treated with chloramphenicol which suggests that when bacteria have acquired actin on their cell surface they become capable of escaping autophagy at later times during the infection however another study using a different l monocytogenes strain found that it was not the actin-based motility but instead the ability of acta to recruit host proteins such as actin the arp23 complex and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein that enabled the bacteria to escape autophagy8 specifically at 2 hours and 4 hours post-infection only 5 of wild-type bacteria were lc3-positive and thus targeted for autophagy but nearly 60 of acta2 bacteria were associated with lc3 ref 8 however acta-mutant bacteria which cannot polymerize actin and lack motility but can recruit other host proteins successfully escaped autophagy recognition this suggests that l monocytogenes uses acta to recruit host cytoskeleton proteins on the bacterial surface and mask the bacterium from ubiquitin recognition and autophagy targetingthe recently identified l monocytogenes virulence factor internalin k inlk also has a role in autophagy escape by interacting with mammalian host major vault protein mvp and recruiting it to the bacterial surface7 mvp and actin are distributed to opposite sides of the bacterial surface and each shields one part of the bacterium to avoid ubiquitinp62lc3-mediated autophagy recognitionescaping autophagy by as yet unclear mechanisms some bacteria use their effector proteins to escape autophagy by mechanisms that remain unclear in terms of the target of the effectors or the exact stage of autophagy that they interfere with one such example is the gram-negative bacterium b pseudomallei which uses a t3ss to escape from the phagosome into the cytosol where it obtains actin-based motility replicates and disseminates studies have shown that a very small population 510 of wild-type b pseudomallei is targeted for lap72 mutants that lack the t3ss3 effector bopa or the translocator bipd are defective in phagosomal escape and exhibit higher levels of colocalization with lc3 3040 and lamp1 indicating that wild-type bacteria use t3ss3 to avoid autophagy recognition however most wild-type bacteria enter the cytosol but are not targeted by autophagy in this case evasion of autophagy is mediated by t3ss1 as bacteria that lack the putative t3ss1 atpase encoded by bpscn successfully enter the cytosol but are more efficiently targeted by lc3 and show defective survival in raw macrophages114115m tuberculosis str erdman has been shown to be targeted and eliminated by autophagy in mouse macrophages 30 of bacteria were lc3-positive at 4 hours post-infection116 another study showed that only 10 of wild-type bacteria were targeted for autophagy117 interestingly treatment with small interfering rna against coronin 1a which is a protein that associates with filamentous actin increased the percentage of lc3-positive bacteria to 30 and bacterium-containing phagosomes were captured in autophagosomes via ubiquitinp62lc3 recruitment thus in this case the bacteria interfered with coronin 1a to avoid autophagy targeting however the mechanisms by which m tuberculosis can modulate coronin 1a to inhibit autophagy remain unclearblocking autophagosome fusion with the lysosome another group of bacteria are recognized by autophagy and are sequestered in autophagosomes but can block or delay the maturation of bacterium-containing autophagosomes into degradative autolysosomes thus avoiding autophagic killing the mechanisms by which these bacteria block autophagosome fusion with the lysosome remain mostly unknown for example infection with adherent-invasive escherichia coli aiec triggers the accumulation of autophagosomes in the cytosol as well as the sequestration of intracellular bacteria into canonical autophagosomes118 however although the aiec-containing autophagosomes acquire lamp1 they do not fully mature into degradative autolysosomes so the bacteria avoid killing notably the upregulation of autophagy by starvation or rapamycin treatment can restrict aiec growth suggesting that autophagy is an immune defence mechanism against aiec118early after mycobacterium marinum infection of macrophages lc3 is recruited to a population of m marinum-containing phagosomes119 these lc3-positive compartments have a single membrane and are decorated with the late endosomal proteins rab7 and lamp1 but they do not acquire the lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin d and are not degradative indicating a block of the lc3-associated phagosome fusion with the lysosomeother bacteria such as m tuberculosis str h37rv120 chlamydia trachomatis121122 yersinia pestis123 and helicobacter pylori124125 have also been shown to accumulate in non-acidic or non-degradative autophagosomes during infection but less is known about how these bacteria block autophagosome fusion with the lysosomehijacking autophagy for growth some bacteria even actively use autophagy for intracellular growth and infection and show defective replication in autophagy-deficient cells these bacteria include staphylococcus aureus13 anaplasma phagocytophilum12126 coxiella burnetii127128129130 brucella abortus131 serratia marcescens132 m tuberculosis str erdman in epithelial cells133 l pneumophila in permissive aj mice102134 brucella melitensis135 porphyromonas gingivalis136 uropathogenic e  coli137 and yersinia pseudotuberculosis138 in most cases these bacteria actively induce autophagy but at the same time block autophagosome fusion with the lysosome then use the autophagosome as a replicative niche for their growtha well-studied example of a bacterium that uses autophagy components for the biogenesis of its replication compartment is s aureus the bacteria become sequestered in double-membrane autophagosomes during infection of hela cells but fusion of these autophagosome with the lysosome is inhibited and they are used as replicative niches13 following replication the bacteria escape into the cytosol and cause autophagy-dependent cell death and this depends on host atg5 ref 13 but not on ptdins3kc3 and becn1 ref 139 and the bacterial accessory gene regulator agr system specifically the agr-secreted -haemolysin hla indeed agr and hla mutants cannot trigger autophagy and are delivered to lysosomes where they are degraded13139 interestingly s aureus infection decreased cellular camp levels and reduced the activity of the camp effector exchange protein directly activated by camp 1 epac also known as rapgef3 and the downstream factor rap2b140 suggesting that bacteria trigger autophagy by inhibiting the cellular campepacrap2b pathway notably rap2b is known to increase the levels of cytoplasmic calcium which is required for the activation of calpains a family of cysteine proteases that cleave atg5 to generate a form of atg5 that does not function in autophagy but instead is involved in apoptosis induction similarly a phagocytophilum grows in double-membrane vacuoles that are decorated with autophagy proteins such as lc3 and becn1 refs 12 126 autophagosome formation is nucleated by the bacterial t4ss secreted effector anaplasma translocated substrate 1 which directly binds becn1 ref 126 however the autophagosomes do not acquire the late endosomal and lysosomal protein lamp3 indicating that fusion with the lysosome is impaired how bacteria block autophagosome maturation is unclearanother example of a bacterium that hijacks autophagy is c burnetii which is the causative agent of q fever c burnetii survives after invasion of host cells in large coxiella-replicative vacuoles crvs that are decorated with the autophagy components lc3 becn1 and rab24 refs 127 128 129 130 overexpressing lc3 or becn1 promotes bacterial infection and increases the number and size of the crvs at early infection times and inhibition of autophagy impairs crv formation and bacterial replication127130 c burnetii infection also induces recruitment of the anti-apoptotic protein b cell lymphoma 2 bcl-2 to the crv and the interaction between becn1 and bcl-2 is important for crv development and inhibition of apoptosis130 therefore the bacteria use autophagy components for intracellular replication and block apoptosis to promote persistent infectionin addition to promoting their growth some bacteria hijack autophagy components to promote their intercellular spreading b abortus resides in a brucella-containing vacuole bcv after internalization by phagocytic or epithelial cells and traffics from this endocytic compartment to the er to form the er-derived bcv rbcv which is permissive for bacterial replication at a later infection stage rbcvs further convert into double- or multi-membrane autophagic bcvs abcvs and this requires ulk1 and becn1atg14lptdins3kc3 activity but is independent of membrane elongation factors including atg12atg5atg16l1 and lc3pe131 at very late time points during infection heavily infected cells release bacteria and cause re-infection of neighbouring cells which generates infection foci approximately 80 of these infection foci have been shown to have abcv-containing cells and formation of infection foci depended on ulk1 or becn1 expression as well as on abcv formation131 collectively these results suggest that b abortus hijacks some of the autophagy components to form the abcv which enables bacterial cell-to-cell spread it was speculated that the abcvs can promote the release of bacteria out of the cell but further work is needed to clarify the possible mechanisms that are involvedautophagy was first shown to target intracellular pathogenic bacteria for degradation in 2003 when a study reported that acta-mutant l monocytogenes was captured in autophagosomes under certain conditions113 in the following year wild-type gas was shown to be sequestered and eliminated by autophagy during infection of host cells85 which indicates that autophagy is an important host defence mechanism against bacterial pathogens since these two seminal studies there has been a flurry of research on antibacterial autophagy by microbiologists cell biologists and immunologists notably although bacteria can be targeted by autophagy increasing evidence suggests that pathogenic bacteria have developed many ways of interfering with the host autophagy machinery these include the use of virulence factors to camouflage the bacteria or to directly subvert autophagy signalling andor autophagy proteins thereby avoiding autophagy targeting bacterial factors can mimic modifiers of autophagy components to shut down their proper functions or directly bind and recruit autophagy proteins to the bacteria to favour their growthmany key questions in the field remain to be answered first the mechanisms of the signalling induction pathways that trigger xenophagy are largely unknown so far s typhimurium-induced autophagy is the best-studied model and multiple pathways have been found to contribute to xenophagy of note nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing 1 nod1 and nod2 which are cytosolic nod-like receptors nlrs that detect peptidoglycans on intracellular pathogens are involved in the induction of autophagy targeting of s flexneri and l monocytogenes by directly binding to atg16l1 and recruiting it to the bacterial entry site on the plasma membrane141 it will be important to investigate whether other bacteria that can be sensed by nod1 and nod2 also trigger xenophagy by the same mechanism it will also be necessary to characterize how different signalling pathways regulate xenophagy induction at the same time in a coordinated manner as well as how they activate autophagy initiation proteins such as the ulk1 complexthe mechanisms of selective cargo recognition are not fully understood although the ubiquitinadaptorslc3 pathway seems to be the main mechanism of autophagy recognition for some bacteria other mechanisms also exist for example tectonin -propeller repeat-containing protein 1 tecpr1 is thought to function as a cargo receptor that links autophagosomes to s flexneri s typhimurium and gas by interacting with atg5 and wipi2 ref 142 however it remains unknown how tecpr1 recognizes different bacteria moreover tecpr1 only localizes to ubiquitin-negative bacteria142 suggesting that it mediates a ubiquitin-independent pathway in addition a recent study showed that human transmembrane protein 59 interacts with atg16l1 via a 19-amino-acid-long motif143 thereby selectively targeting endosomes to autophagy the same atg16l1-binding motif was found in other proteins suggesting that adaptor proteins that engage atg16l1 could target other specific cargoes such as bacteria to autophagyhow certain bacteria block autophagosome fusion with lysosomes and whether bacterial effectors are involved remains to be fully elucidated it is possible that bacteria use their virulence factors to inhibit the recruitment of key factors that are involved in autophagosomelysosome fusion such as rab7 to the bacterium-containing autophagosomes searching for bacterial mutants that do not block autophagosome fusion with lysosomes might provide some answersfinally it is unknown in most cases whether all components of the canonical autophagy machinery are involved in xenophagy and whether they function in their canonical manner as discussed above some bacteria are targeted by lap which does not require the ulk1 complex suggesting that different initiation mechanisms which possibly do not require mtorc1 might be involved s aureus induces xenophagy independently of the becn1 complex140 and it is unclear whether ptdins3kc3-independent sources of ptdins3p are involved in inducing xenophagy or whether ptdins3p is dispensable in this contextinvestigating the interactions between bacterial factors and atg proteins has been a major focus of recent research and it will remain one for many years to come a better understanding of the mechanisms by which bacteria manipulate autophagy will inform drug design and the therapeutic treatment of bacterial infectionsepidemiologic data on respiratory viral infections are available in many nations and many factors have been studied in predicting outcome and guiding national policy on management of these infections respiratory viral infections cause significant morbidity and misery affecting millions of children annually worldwidealthough most infections are short-lived and managed by the general practitioner some children are seriously affected and require hospitalization 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 these viruses account for a large workload in many pediatric departments and are responsible for upper respiratory infections croup bronchiolitis and pneumoniain a study of nearly 100000 pediatric admissions the commonest childhood hospital admissions were associated with respiratory viral infections 2 chiu and colleagues 8 also described that influenza infections were the commonest assessing disease burden of respiratory disorders in hong kong children with hospital discharge data and linked laboratory data nelson and colleagues 3 found that a primary diagnosis of a respiratory disorder was common upper respiratory 301 tonsillitispharyngitis 105 crouplaryngitis 23 acute otitis media 27 bronchitischest infection 26 bronchiolitis 102 pneumonia 209 influenza 4 asthma and allergic rhinitis 165 in a recent study viral and atypical bacterial pathogens in children hospitalized with acute respiratory infections were identified by using a broad-capture rapid and sensitive method multiplex polymerase chain reaction pcr assay to detect 20 different respiratory pathogens from respiratory specimens of 475 children hospitalized over a 12-month period for acute respiratory tract infections including influenza a subtypes h1 h3 and h5 influenza b parainfluenza types 1 2 3 and 4 rsv groups a and b adenoviruses human rhinoviruses enteroviruses human metapneumoviruses human coronaviruses oc43 229e and sars-cov chlamydophila pneumoniae legionella pneumophila and mycoplasma pneumoniae
12 the overall positive rate 47 was about 2 times higher than previous reports based on conventional methods influenza a parainfluenza and rsv accounted for 51 and noncultivable viruses accounted for 30 of positive cases influenza a peaked in march and june influenza b was detected in january february and april parainfluenza was prevalent throughout the year except from april to june most rsv infections were found between february and september adenovirus had multiple peaks whereas rhinovirus and coronavirus oc43 were detected mainly in winter and early spring rsv infection was associated with bronchiolitis and parainfluenza was associated with croup otherwise the clinical manifestations were largely nonspecific in general children infected with influenza a adenovirus and mixed viruses had higher temperatures in view of the increasing concern about unexpected outbreaks of severe viral infections a rapid multiplex pcr assay is a valuable tool to enhance the management of hospitalized patients and for the surveillance for viral infections circulating in the communityamong hospital admissions a small percentage of children would require pediatric intensive care unit picu support 13 14 15 16 hon and colleagues 17 reported the clinical pattern and outcome of all children with a laboratory-proven diagnosis of respiratory virus infection admitted to the picu of a teaching hospital three respiratory virus species rsv n  17 influenza n  13 and parainfluenza n  12 accounted for 86 of cases picu admissions due to influenza a were more common than influenza b whereas parainfluenza type 3 was the commonest subtype of parainfluenza infection comparing these 3 common viruses the mean age of children admitted with rsv was lower than with influenza or parainfluenza preexisting conditions such as prematurity and chronic lung disease were only present in children with rsv infection these respiratory viruses caused both upper croup and lower respiratory tract diseases bronchiolitis pneumonia extrapulmonary presentations were less prevalent and included encephalitis seizures cardiac arrest coexisting diabetes ketoacidosis and acute lymphoblastic leukemia one patient with rsv and another with influenza a died during their picu stay nearly half of these patients required ventilatory support or received systemic corticosteroids and 88 received initial broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage approximately 1 in 5 of them had nebulized adrenaline airway endoscopies or bacterial coinfections adenovirus was isolated in 4 patients and 2 both with adenovirus type 3 died during the picu stay similar findings in picu were reported 14 15 in particular influenza infection causes significant morbidity and mortality in young children 15 immunizations are recommended for all children aged 6 months to 18 years although severe forms of influenza are rare in children the disease may be life-threatening and most occur in children with underlying disease 16 during the 2003 influenza season there was an increased number of children with influenza a infection admitted to an australian picu and an increased number of deaths compared with previous years 16 the cost of influenza-related hospitalizations in children is high 13 in a united states study high-risk patients had higher mean total costs than low-risk patients and cardiac metabolic and neurologicneuromuscular diseases and age of 18 to 21 years were independently associated with the highest hospitalization costs 13the influenza viruses are rna viruses of the family orthomyxoviridae influenzavirus a influenzavirus b and influenzavirus c are the genera that affect humans 18 influenzavirus a has one species influenza a virus the type a viruses are the most virulent human pathogens among the 3 influenza types and cause the most severe disease 19 the influenza a virus has different serotypes based on the antibody response to these viruses 20 influenzavirus b also has only one species the virus almost exclusively infects humans 20 and is less common than influenza a this virus mutates at a lower rate than type a and consequently is less genetically diverse with only one influenza b serotype 20 21 this reduced rate of antigenic change combined with its limited host range ensures that pandemics of influenza b do not occur 18 22 influenzavirus c has only one species influenza c virus causes mild disease in children 23 24 indeed seroepidemiological studies have revealed that influenza c virus is widely distributed globally nevertheless because the isolation of this virus is difficult there have been few reports on its clinical features 23 severe illness and local epidemics from influenza c have been reported 19 23 25 hay and colleagues 20 summarized the evolution of influenza viruses which results in recurrent annual epidemics of disease that are caused by progressive antigenic drift of influenza a and b viruses due to the mutability of the rna genome and infrequent but severe pandemics caused by the emergence of novel influenza a subtypes to which the population has little immunity the latter characteristic is a consequence of the wide antigenic diversity and peculiar host range of influenza a viruses and the ability of their segmented rna genomes to undergo frequent genetic reassortment recombination during mixed infections contrasting features of the evolution of recently circulating influenza ah1n1 ah3n2 and b viruses include the rapid drift of ah3n2 viruses as a single lineage the slow replacement of successive antigenic variants of ah1n1 viruses and the cocirculation over some 25 years of antigenically and genetically distinct lineages of influenza b viruses constant monitoring of changes in the circulating viruses is important for maintaining the efficacy of influenza vaccines in combating diseasethe diagnosis of influenza based on clinical impression is problematic in a prospective study children 13 years old or younger with respiratory infections were examined 26 at each visit a nasal swab specimen was obtained for the detection of influenza and the physician recorded his or her opinion on whether the child had influenza among 2288 infections the overall sensitivity of the clinical diagnosis of influenza was 38 and the positive predictive value was 32the transmission of influenza can be mathematically modeled to help predicting how the virus will spread in a population 27 28 people who contract influenza are most infectious between the second and third days after infection and infectivity lasts for around 10 days 27 children are much more infectious than adults and shed virus from just before they develop symptoms until 2 weeks after infection 27 29 for influenza control it is very important to investigate viral shedding and resistant viruses 29 according to mitamura and colleagues 29 viral loads are decreased after the start of antiviral agents but resistant viruses are detected in some patients influenza can be spread by direct transmission when an infected person sneezes mucus into the eyes nose or mouth of another person through people inhaling the aerosols produced by infected people with coughing sneezing and spitting and through hand-to-mouth transmission from contaminated surfaces or direct personal contact 30 31 the relative importance of airborne droplet and contact transmission of influenza a virus and the efficiency of control measures depends on the inactivation of viruses in different environmental media weber and colleagues 31 systematically reviewed information on the environmental inactivation of influenza a viruses and modes of transmission the airborne route is a potentially important transmission pathway for influenza in indoor environments the importance of droplet transmission has to be reassessed contact transmission can be limited by fast inactivation of influenza virus on hands and is more dependent on behavioral parameters than airborne transmission however the potentially large inocula deposited in the environment through sneezing and the protective effect of nasal mucus on virus survival could make contact transmission a key transmission mode in the airborne route it has been demonstrated that the inhalation of just one inhalable droplet 055 m in diameter might be enough to cause an infection 31 although a single sneeze releases up to 40000 droplets 32 most of these droplets are large and will quickly settle out of the air 31 the influenza virus can also be transmitted by contaminated surfaces successful control of a viral disease requires knowledge of the different vectors that could promote its transmission among hosts thomas and colleagues 33 assessed the survival of human influenza viruses on banknotes given that billions of these notes are exchanged daily worldwide banknotes were experimentally contaminated with representative influenza virus subtypes at various concentrations and survival was tested after different time periods influenza a viruses tested by cell culture survived up to 3 days when they were inoculated at high concentrations the same inoculum in the presence of respiratory mucus showed a striking increase in survival time up to 17 days bhong kong3352001 virus was still infectious after 1 day when it was mixed with respiratory mucus when nasopharyngeal secretions of naturally infected children were used influenza virus survived for at least 48 h in one-third of the cases the investigators concluded that unexpected stability of influenza virus in this nonbiological environment suggests that unusual environmental contamination should be considered in the setting of pandemic preparedness 33 bean and colleagues investigated the transmission of influenza viruses via hands and environmental surfaces the survival of laboratory-grown influenza a and influenza b viruses on various surfaces was studied both influenza a and b viruses survived for 24 to 48 hours on hard nonporous surfaces such as stainless steel and plastic but survived for less than 8 to 12 hours on cloth paper and tissues measurable quantities of influenza a virus were transferred from stainless steel surfaces to hands for 24 hours and from tissues to hands for up to 15 minutes virus survived on hands for up to 5 minutes after transfer from the environmental surfaces their observations suggest that the transmission of virus from donors who are shedding large amounts could occur for 2 to 8 hours via stainless steel surfaces and for a few minutes via paper tissues the investigators concluded that the transmission of influenza virus via fomites may be possible under conditions of heavy environmental contamination 34 however if the virus is present in mucus the virus can survive for longer periods 31new influenza viruses are constantly evolving by mutation or by reassortment 20 definitive means of prophylaxis is by vaccination in particular high-risk patients may develop life-threatening primary viral pneumonia or complications such as bacterial pneumonia 35 vaccination against influenza with an influenza vaccine is recommended for all children 6 months to 18 years old due to the high mutation rate of the virus a particular influenza vaccine usually confers protection for no more than a few years the world health organization annually predicts which viral strains are most likely to be circulating in the next year allowing pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines that will provide the best immunity against these strains 35 the vaccine is reformulated each season for a few specific flu strains hence it is possible to be vaccinated and still get influenzain an influenza pandemic the benefit of vaccines and antiviral medications are often constrained by limitations on supplies and effectiveness nonpharmaceutical public health interventions are vital in curtailing disease spread good personal health and hygiene habits such as hand washing avoiding spitting and covering the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing are reasonably effective in reducing influenza transmission 36 in particular hand washing with soap and water or with alcohol-based hand rubs is effective in inactivating influenza viruses 37 these simple personal hygiene precautions are recommended as the main way of reducing infections during pandemics 36 37 surface sanitizing may also help prevent influenza and respiratory viral infections 38 alcohol is an effective sanitizer against influenza viruses quaternary ammonium compounds can also be used with alcohol so that the sanitizing effect lasts for longer 39 a wide variety of active chemical agents biocides are found in these sanitizing products many of which have been used for hundreds of years including alcohols phenols iodine and chlorine 39 in hospitals quaternary ammonium compounds and bleach are used to sanitize rooms that have been occupied by or equipment used for patients with influenza symptoms 39it is uncertain if reducing public gatherings by for example closing schools and workplaces will reduce transmission because people with influenza may just be moved from one area to another such measures would also be difficult to enforce and are often unpopular 36 when small numbers of people are infected isolating the sick might reduce the risk of transmission 36 influenza infects many animal species and transfer of viral strains between species can occur birds are thought to be the principal animal reservoirs of influenza viruses 40 phylogenetic analysis showed that nucleoprotein genes have evolved into 5 host-specific lineages including i equineprague56 eqpr56 ii recent equine strains iii classic swine h1n1 swine eg aswineiowa1530 and human strains iv gull h13 viruses and v avian strains including north american australian and old world subgroups the presence of avian and human nucleoproteins in some swine isolates demonstrates the susceptibility of swine to different viral strains and supports the hypothesis that swine may serve as intermediates for the introduction of avian influenza virus genes into the human virus gene pool 40 some strains are highly virulent to poultry and may cause more severe symptoms and significant mortality 41 42 an avian-adapted highly pathogenic strain of h5n1 called hpai ah5n1 for highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of type a of subtype h5n1 causes h5n1 flu or avian influenza which is endemic in many bird populations especially in southeast asia this asian lineage strain of hpai a h5n1 is spreading globally at present there is no evidence suggesting efficient human-to-human transmission of hpai a h5n1 nevertheless h5n1 may mutate or reassort into a strain capable of efficient human-to-human transmission the exact changes that are required for this to happen are not well understood and there is a need to find better predictors of both seasonal and potentially pandemic influenza 43outbreaks in pigs are common and do not cause severe mortality 44 in 2009 an outbreak of influenza a virus subtype h1n1 occurred in mexico the virus is being commonly referred to as swine flu but there is no evidence of transmission from pigs to people instead the virus is spreading from person to person this strain is a reassortment of several strains of h1n1 that are usually found separately in humans birds and pigs 45parainfluenza viruses belong to the rna paramyxovirus family and are a common cause of respiratory infections in children 46 47 48 these viruses are the second most common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in younger children 48 human parainfluenza viruses hpivs are second to rsv as a common cause of lower respiratory tract disease in young children similar to rsv hpivs can cause repeated upper respiratory tract infections throughout life hpivs can also cause serious lower respiratory tract disease with recurrent infection eg pneumonia bronchitis and bronchiolitis 48 each of the 4 hpivs has different clinical and epidemiologic features the most distinctive clinical feature of hpiv-1 and hpiv-2 is croup ie laryngotracheobronchitis hpiv-1 is the leading cause of croup in children whereas hpiv-2 is less frequently detected both hpiv-1 and hpiv-2 can cause other upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses hpiv-3 is more often associated with bronchiolitis and pneumonia hpiv-4 is infrequently detected possibly because it is less likely to cause severe disease the incubation period for hpivs is generally from 1 to 7 days 49 the virion is unstable in the environment surviving a few hours on environmental surfaces and is readily inactivated with soap and water hpivs spread from respiratory secretions through close contact with infected persons or contact with contaminated surfaces or objects infection can occur when infectious material contacts mucous membranes of the eyes mouth or nose and possibly through the inhalation of droplets generated by a sneeze or cough hpivs can remain infectious in aerosols for over an hour hpivs are ubiquitous and infect most people during childhood the highest rates of serious hpiv illnesses occur among young children serologic surveys have shown that 90 to 100 of children aged 5 years and older have antibodies to hpiv-3 and about 75 have antibodies to hpiv-1 and -2 the different hpiv serotypes differ in their clinical features and seasonality hpiv-1 causes biennial outbreaks of croup in the fall presently in the united states during odd-numbered years hpiv-2 causes annual or biennial fall outbreaks hpiv-3 peak activity occurs during the spring and early summer months each year but the virus can be isolated throughout the year infection with hpivs can be confirmed either by isolation and identification of the virus in cell culture or by direct detection of the virus in respiratory secretions usually collected within 1 week of onset of symptoms using immunofluorescence enzyme immunoassay or pcr assay or by demonstration of a significant increase in specific igg antibodies between appropriately collected paired serum specimens or specific igm antibodies in a single serum specimen in particular the multiplex reverse transcription-pcr rt-pcr assay can be used as a rapid and sensitive diagnostic method for the viruses 50 accumulating knowledge on the molecular structure and mechanisms of replication of hpivs has accelerated research on prevention and treatment several strategies for vaccine development such as the use of live attenuated inactivated recombinant and subunit vaccines have been investigated and it may become possible to prevent hpiv infections in the near future nevertheless no vaccine is currently available to protect against infection caused by any of the hpivs 51 passively acquired maternal antibodies may play a role in protection from hpiv types 1 and 2 in the first few months of life highlighting the importance of breastfeeding strict attention to infection-control practices should decrease or prevent spread of infection frequent hand washing and not sharing items such as cups glasses and utensils with an infected person should decrease the spread of virus to others excluding children with colds or other respiratory illnesses without fever who are well enough to attend child care or school settings will probably not decrease the spread of hpivs because the viruses are often spread in the early stages of illness in a hospital setting spread of hpivs can and should be prevented by strict attention to contact precautions such as hand washing and wearing of protective gowns and glovesrhinoviruses rvs are nonenveloped single-strand rna viruses that belong to the picornaviridae family the virus is most frequently associated with common cold rhinovirus plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of otitis media and asthma exacerbations 52 53 current evidence indicates that viral and not bacterial infections are the most important respiratory illnesses that increase the severity of asthma 52 the most significant risk factor for the development of preschool childhood wheezing is the occurrence of symptomatic rhinovirus illnesses during infancy which are clinically and prognostically informative based on their seasonal nature 54 rvs have proven to be the virus most often found in association with increased asthma severity 52 with the use of sensitive rt-pcr methods respiratory viruses are found in approximately 80 of wheezing episodes in children and in approximately one-half of such episodes in adults 53 in one study rv rna was detectable in more than 40 of asthmatic children 6 weeks after an acute exacerbation 55 asthma exacerbations were more severe in patients with persistence of rv rna suggesting that the severity of acute asthma might be linked to prolonged and possibly more severe rv infections most cases of rv infection are mild and self-limited despite its high incidence and prevalence nasopharyngitis croup and pneumonia are occasionally caused by rv rvs can be transmitted by aerosol or direct contact the primary site of inoculation is the nasal mucosa the conjunctiva may be involved to a lesser extent rv attaches to respiratory epithelium and spreads locally rv does not efficiently replicate at body temperature the optimal temperature for rv replication is 33 to 35c this fact may explain why rv replicates well in the nasal passages and upper tracheobronchial tree but less well in the lower respiratory tract the incubation period is approximately 2 to 4 days 49 rv is shed in large amounts with as many as 1 million infectious virions present per milliliter of nasal washings but viremia is uncommon viral shedding can occur a few days before cold symptoms are recognized by the patient peaks on days 2 to 7 of the illness and may last as long as 3 to 4 weeks a local inflammatory response to the virus in the respiratory tract can lead to nasal discharge nasal congestion sneezing and throat irritationrv possesses various transmission modes and can infect a huge population at any given time aerosol transmission is the most common transmission mode for respiratory tract infections transmission occurs when small airborne particles are inhaled or large droplets are directly touched direct hand contact with infected secretions or indirect contact with fomites is also important patients then infect themselves by touching their noses or conjunctivae highly contagious behavior includes nose blowing sneezing and physically transferring infected secretions onto environmental surfaces or paper tissue contrary to popular belief behaviors such as kissing talking coughing or even drooling do not contribute highly to the spread of disease infection rates approximate 50 within the household and range from 0 to 50 within schools which indicates that transmission requires long-term contact with infected individuals brief exposures to others in places such as movie theaters shopping malls friends houses or doctors offices incur low risk of transmissionpleconaril is an orally bioavailable antiviral drug being developed for the treatment of infections caused by picornaviruses 56 this drug acts by binding to a hydrophobic pocket in vp1 and stabilizes the protein capsid to such an extent that the virus cannot release its rna genome into the target cell when tested in volunteers during the clinical trials this drug caused a significant decrease in mucus secretions and illness-associated symptoms 57 however the food and drug administration has not approved this drug for treatment of common cold and the gastrointestinal side effects are not insignificantcoronavirus is a genus of animal virus belonging to the family coronaviridae and the virus is enveloped with a positive-sense single-stranded rna genome and a helical symmetry 58 human coronaviruses are difficult to grow in the laboratory coronaviruses primarily infect the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of mammals and birds the most publicized human coronavirus sars-cov which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome sars has a unique pathogenesis because it causes both upper and lower respiratory tract infections and can also cause gastroenteritis coronaviruses are believed to cause a significant percentage of all common colds in human adults primarily in the winter and early spring seasons 49in 2003 following the outbreak of sars that had begun in the previous year in asia and secondary cases elsewhere in the world the world health organization issued a press release stating that a novel coronavirus identified by several laboratories was the causative agent for sars 59 the virus was officially named the sars coronavirus sars-cov the genome of sars-cov is 29727 nucleotides in length and has 11 open reading frames and its genome organization is similar to that of other coronaviruses phylogenetic analyses and sequence comparisons show that sars-cov is not closely related to any of the previously characterized coronaviruses 60 the sars epidemic resulted in more than 8000 infections about 10 of which resulted in death 61 following the high-profile publicity of sars outbreaks there has been a renewed interest in coronaviruses for many years scientists knew only about the existence of 2 human coronaviruses hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 the discovery of sars-cov added another human coronavirus to the list by the end of 2004 3 independent research laboratories reported the discovery of a fourth human coronavirus named nl63 nl or the new haven coronavirus by the different research groups 62 screening of clinical specimens from individuals suffering from respiratory illness identified additional hcov-nl63infected individuals indicating that the virus was widely spread within the human population 62adenovirus infections most commonly cause illness of the respiratory system as well as various other illnesses such as gastroenteritis conjunctivitis and cystitis symptoms caused by adenovirus infection range from the common cold syndrome to pneumonia croup and bronchitis 49 63 patients with compromised immune systems are especially susceptible to severe complications of adenovirus infection adenoviruses are transmitted by direct contact fecal-oral transmission and occasionally waterborne transmission some types are capable of establishing persistent asymptomatic infections in tonsils adenoids and intestines of infected hosts and shedding can occur for months or years adenovirus infections can occur throughout the year but outbreaks of adenovirus-associated respiratory disease are more common in the late winter spring and early summer antigen detection pcr assay virus isolation and serology can be used to identify adenovirus infections because adenovirus can be excreted for prolonged periods the presence of virus does not necessarily mean it is associated with disease most infections are mild and require either no therapy or only symptomatic treatment because there is no virus-specific therapy serious adenovirus illness can be managed only by treating symptoms and complications of the infection deaths are rare but have been reported 17 strict attention to good infection control practices is effective for stopping nosocomial outbreaks of adenovirus-associated disease such as epidemic keratoconjunctivitis maintaining adequate levels of chlorination is necessary for preventing swimming pool associated outbreaks of adenovirus conjunctivitishuman metapneumovirus hmpv was first isolated in 2001 in the netherlands by using the rna arbitrarily primed pcr rap-pcr technique for identification of unknown viruses growing in cultured cells 64 65 serologic studies showed that by the age of 5 years virtually all children in the netherlands have been exposed to human metapneumovirus and that the virus has been circulating in humans for at least 50 years 64 hmpv is a negative single-stranded rna virus of the family paramyxoviridae and is closely related to the avian metapneumovirus ampv subgroup c hmpv may be the second most common cause after the rsv of lower respiratory infection in young children although infection with hmpv tends to occur in slightly older children and to produce disease that is less severe 63 66 67 68 coinfection with both viruses can occur and is generally associated with worse disease 69 hmpv has been shown to have worldwide circulation with nearly universal infection by age 5 years similar to influenza and rsv activity is greatest during the winter in temperate climates 63 66 67 most of the available data on the clinical manifestations of hmpv infection are from studies of children in whom the virus causes upper respiratory tract infections bronchiolitis and pneumonia 63 66 67 reinfections with hmpv occur throughout adult life and hmpv infection has been documented in 1 to 9 of adults each year using rt-pcr and serology for diagnosis illness is generally mild in young adults with serologic evidence of asymptomatic infection in many cases 65 human metapneumovirus accounts for approximately 10 of respiratory tract infections that are not related to previously known causative agents 70 the virus seems to be distributed worldwide and to have a seasonal distribution with its incidence comparable to that of the influenza viruses during winter 63 64 67 71 serologic studies have shown that by the age of 5 years virtually all children have been exposed to the virus and reinfections are common human metapneumovirus usually causes mild respiratory tract infection although small children and immunocompromised individuals are at risk of severe disease and hospitalization 64 the identification of hmpv has predominantly relied on rt-pcr technology to amplify directly from rna extracted from respiratory specimens treatment is symptomatic no effective treatment or vaccine for hmpv is currently available but ribavirin has shown effectiveness in an animal model 70 72the symptoms of common cold or upper respiratory tract infection resemble symptoms of influenza disease except that they are usually milder symptoms of influenza can start abruptly 1 to 2 days after infection 73 usually the first symptoms are chills or a chilly sensation and fever with body temperatures ranging from 38 to 39c 74 75 suzuki and colleagues 74 studied the natural course of fever during influenza virus infection in children and found that fever was most prominent in ah3n2 and young children secondary fever was observed frequently at 72 to 132 hours in all types the duration of fever was associated negatively with the age of the child and positively with the maximal temperature 74 symptoms of influenza may also include aches especially joints and throat extreme coldness fatigue headache irritated watering eyes and reddened eyes face mouth throat and nose 73 it is difficult to distinguish between the common cold and influenza in the early stages of these infections 73 75 but flu can be identified by a high fever with a sudden onset and extreme fatigue 75 in the subtropics influenza is an important cause of hospitalization among children with rates exceeding those reported for temperate regions 8 and influenza-related hospitalizations among children in hong kong 7 the influenza viruses are significant human respiratory pathogens that cause both seasonal endemic infections and periodic unpredictable pandemics the worst pandemic on record in 1918 killed approximately 50 million people worldwide it is striking that the spectrum of pathologic changes described in the 1918 influenza pandemic is not significantly different from the histopathology observed in other less lethal pandemics or even in deaths occurring during seasonal influenza outbreaks 19 coronaviruses parainfluenza and rsv are important viruses that can cause the clinical syndrome of common colds other viruses such as adenoviruses and influenza viruses can cause common colds but are more likely to cause acute nasopharyngitis and more severe respiratory infectionsseveral studies demonstrate the incidence of the common cold to be highest in preschool and elementary school-aged children an average of 3 to 8 colds per year is observed in this age group with an even higher incidence in children who attend daycare centers because of the numerous viral agents involved and the many serotypes of several viruses especially rv it is not unusual for younger children to have new colds each month during the winter season adults and adolescents typically have 2 to 4 colds per year a seasonal increase in incidence during the winter months is observed worldwide the most common manifestation of rv the common cold is mild and self-limited common colds by definition do not have objective evidence of pharyngeal irritation and rv is an uncommon cause of acute nasopharyngitis however severe respiratory disease including bronchiolitis asthma exacerbations and pneumonia can occur in infants and young children 76 indeed rv may be associated with more severe lower respiratory tract infection in children than previously reported particularly in the noninfluenza rsv season 76 because antibodies to viral serotypes develop over time the highest incidence is found in infants and young children in addition young children are more likely to have the frequent close personal contact necessary to transmit rhinoviruschildren with common cold are usually afebrile although temperatures of 38 to 39c may occur in younger children profuse nasal discharge can be clear and watery or mucopurulent purulent secretions are common after the first few days of illness and do not imply bacterial sinusitis unless symptoms and signs of an upper respiratory infection persist for more than 10 days without appreciable improvement 77 despite sore throat the pharynx has a normal appearance without any erythema exudate or ulceration infection occurs rapidly with the virus adhering to surface receptors within 15 minutes of entering the respiratory tract rvs preferentially grow at 32c as opposed to the body temperature of 37c and hence infect mainly the upper respiratory tractinfluenza can cause pneumonia which can be fatal particularly for the young and the elderly although it is often confused with other influenza-like viral infections such as the common cold influenza is generally a more severe disease 73 influenza is typically transmitted through airborne aerosols created by coughing or sneezing infections also occur through contact with infected body fluids or with contaminated surfaces influenza viruses can be inactivated by sunlight disinfectants and detergents 78vaccinations against influenza are available 79 80 the most common human vaccine is the trivalent influenza vaccine tiv that contains purified and inactivated material from 3 viral strains this vaccine typically includes material from 2 influenza a virus subtypes and 1 influenza b virus strain the tiv carries no risk of transmitting the disease and it has very low reactivity a vaccine formulated for 1 year may be ineffective in the following year because the influenza virus evolves rapidly and new strains quickly replace the older ones most people will recover completely in about 1 to 2 weeks but some will develop life-threatening complications young children people with chronic medical conditions and pregnant women are at risk for complications from influenza 81 82 guillain-barr syndrome can be a rare side effect of influenza vaccines with an incidence of about 1 case per million vaccinations 83 adverse event reporting rates have been reasonably constant over time and no new safety concerns emerged after review of 15 years of postlicensure surveillance data 83patients with flu are advised to get plenty of rest drink plenty of liquids avoid using alcohol and tobacco and if necessary take medications such as paracetamol acetaminophen to relieve the fever and muscle aches associated with the flu children and teenagers with flu symptoms particularly fever should avoid taking aspirin during an influenza infection especially influenza type b because of the risk of reye syndrome 84 antibiotics have no effect on the infection unless prescribed for secondary infections such as bacterial pneumonia the 2 classes of antiviral drugs used against influenza are neuraminidase inhibitors and m2 protein inhibitors adamantane derivatives 85 neuraminidase inhibitors are currently preferred for flu virus infections because they are less toxic and more effective 35 antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir trade name tamiflu and zanamivir trade name relenza are neuraminidase inhibitors that are designed to halt the spread of the virus in the body 86 these drugs are often effective against both influenza a and b 87 the cochrane collaboration reviewed these drugs and concluded that they reduce symptoms and complications 88 all the aforementioned antiviral drugs shorten the course of influenza disease by approximately 1 day and relieve symptoms to some extent 89 different strains of influenza viruses have differing degrees of resistance against these antivirals and it is impossible to predict what degree of resistance a future pandemic strain might have 90 the increase in influenza vaccinations among young children together with the routine therapeutic use of neuraminidase inhibitors has led to a decrease in the influenza-associated mortality rate 91 to determine the interventions most likely to curtail an influenza pandemic carrat and colleagues 27 and grassly and colleagues 28 mathematically modeled the transmission of influenza to predict how the virus will spread in a population these results support the stockpiling of antiviral drugs and accelerated vaccine development nevertheless neuraminidase inhibitors should not be used in routine seasonal influenza control in a serious epidemic or pandemic neuraminidase inhibitors should be used with other public health measures 88the most common syndrome that often affects infants and children younger than 6 years is laryngotracheobronchitis 92 the condition is commonly known as croup due to the characteristic croupy cough associated with infection and inflammatory of the subglottic region 92 croup is characterized by a barking cough varying degrees of inspiratory stridor and hoarseness as a result of laryngeal or tracheal obstruction 93 the condition may be mild moderate or severe and even fatal croup is most often caused by parainfluenza virus with types 1 and 2 responsible for the majority of cases 92 93 however other viral infections can also cause it 17 croup is most common in the fall and winter but can occur year-round with a slight predilection for males 92 the respiratory distress is caused by an inflammatory response to the infection rather than by the infection itself respiratory distress usually occurs in young children as their airways are smaller and differently shaped to those of adults making them more susceptible the treatment of croup depends on the severity of symptoms it is important to maintain a calm atmosphere for the parents and child most children can be managed effectively at home antipyretics should be given if the child is febrile adequate hydration should be maintained corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy 93 corticosteroids have potent vasoconstrictive and anti-inflammatory properties and can reduce airway inflammation vascular permeability and mucosal edema 93 good evidence now exists to support the use of corticosteroid in the management of severe moderate or even mild croup 94 dexamethasone is often used due to its prolonged physiologic effects the severe form requires emergency medical treatment in the intensive care unit nebulized epinephrine should be considered for children with moderate to severe croup and should be used with caution in children who have tachycardia or ventricular outlet obstruction racemic epinephrine works by stimulation of the -adrenergic receptors in the airway with resultant mucosal vasoconstriction and decreased subglottic edema and by stimulation of the -adrenergic receptors with resultant relaxation of the bronchial smooth muscle randomized studies comparing racemic epinephrine with either placebo or no treatment have shown significant improvements in croup scores in the treated patients over controls 95 the simultaneous use of corticosteroid helps to reduce the rebound phenomenon associated with the use of epinephrine and obviates the need for hospitalization 93 children who have moderate or severe croup with blood oxygen saturation of less than 92 should receive oxygen antibiotics have no value children with moderate to severe croup are hospitalized for observation intubation is rarely needed 17bronchitis is a common disease in the adult population but is less frequently described in children bronchitis is usually due to common viral infections but can occasionally be complicated by secondary bacterial infections jartti and colleagues 96 detected metapneumovirus by pcr in 10 8 of 132 consecutive children admitted to turku hospital finland for acute expiratory wheezing median age 7 months range 425 months the mean duration of hospital stay was 25 days standard deviation 16 and mean duration of respiratory symptoms was 19 days the white blood cell count c-reactive protein and rantes regulated on activation normal t-expressed and secreted cytokine concentrations in nasal secretion remained low whereas interleukin-8 concentrations in nasal secretion were high human metapneumovirus is a clinically important causative agent of acute wheezing in young children 96 smuts and colleagues 97 evaluated the role of the novel respiratory viruses such as human metapneumovirus hmpv human coronavirus nl63 hcov nl63 and human bocavirus hbov in wheezing illness in children consecutive children presenting with acute wheezing to a pediatric hospital from may 2004 to november 2005 were prospectively studied a nasal swab was taken for rt-pcr and pcr for hmpv hcov nl63 and hbov when positive the genes were sequenced shell vial culture for rsv influenza a and b viruses adenovirus and parainfluenza viruses 1 2 and 3 was performed on every fifth sample two hundred and forty-two nasal swabs were collected from 238 children median age 124 months a novel respiratory virus was found in 44 of 242 182 hmpv hbov and hcov nl63 was found in 20 83 18 74 and 6 24 of samples respectively fifteen of 59 25 samples were positive for other respiratory viruses viral coinfections occurred in 6 of 242 25 viruses are an important cause of wheezing in preschool children hmpv hcov nl63 and hbov are less common than the usual respiratory pathogens 97the term usually refers to acute viral bronchiolitis of infancy in temperate climates bronchiolitis is most frequently seen during winter and early spring in tropical countries the disease occurs more frequently during the rainy season 98 bronchiolitis is most commonly caused by rsv or human pneumovirus 1 4 other common respiratory viruses that may also cause the same clinical entity include metapneumovirus influenza parainfluenza coronavirus adenovirus and rhinovirus 66 coryza mild cough fever lethargy and decreased appetite are common at the onset of illness this then progresses to noisy raspy breathing and wheezy cough physical examination is characterized by prolonged expiratory phase wheezing tachypnea dyspnea intercostal retractions hyperresonance on chest percussion and tachycardia 98 the diagnosis is usually made by clinical examination in ambulatory settings chest radiography is not routinely indicated but may sometimes be useful to exclude pneumonia testing for specific viral cause such as rsv by nasopharyngeal aspirate can be performed but the testing usually has little effect on management identification of rsv-positive patients can be helpful for disease surveillance patient cohorts in hospital wards to prevent cross-infection and reducing the need for other unnecessary diagnostic proceduresrespiratory complications are common in infants with severe rsv bronchiolitis which include apnea and hypoxemia 98 children with rsv bronchiolitis in early life are at increased risk of developing asthma later in childhood although the association is lost by 13 years of age 99 100there is no effective specific treatment for bronchiolitis therapy is primarily supportive frequent small feeds are encouraged to maintain hydration as evidenced by good urine output and sometimes oxygen may be required to maintain blood oxygen levels suction of the nasopharynx to remove excessive secretions is often performed to maintain a clear airway in severe cases nasogastric tube feeding or intravenous fluids are required in extreme cases mechanical ventilation might be necessary kellner and colleagues 101 102 performed a meta-analysis of bronchodilator therapy in infants with bronchiolitis and reported that bronchodilators produced a modest short-term improvement in clinical scores the rate and duration of hospitalization however were not affected by bronchodilator therapy the investigators concluded that routine use of bronchodilators in those who wheeze for the first time is not justified given the modest short-term clinical improvement along with the high cost of the medication in theory epinephrine has an added advantage over 2-adrenergic selective bronchodilators because its -adrenergic component may diminish catarrhal secretions and mucosal edema of the airway a meta-analysis of 14 randomized controlled trials that included inhaled or systemic epinephrine as one of the bronchodilators showed that epinephrine may be favorable to salbutamol and placebo among outpatients with bronchiolitis 103 however there is insufficient evidence to support its use for the treatment of bronchiolitis among inpatients because some children will respond to bronchodilators if bronchodilators are to be tried careful clinical evaluation of the response to the first few doses must be made in order for a decision to be made about continuance or discontinuance of the medication a recent multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled trial that included 800 infants with bronchiolitis seen in the emergency department suggests that combined therapy with dexamethasone and epinephrine may significantly reduce the rate of hospital admission 104 the use of ribavirin in treating rsv infection is controversial ribavirin is used sometimes for infants with preexisting lung heart or immune disease 105 106 107 108 the american academy of pediatrics has recommended that decisions about ribavirin administration should be made based on the particular clinical circumstances and physicians experience 109 antibiotics are usually not indicated in uncomplicated bronchiolitis 110 111 nevertheless thorburn and colleagues 112 found that up to 40 of children with severe rsv bronchiolitis requiring admission to the picu were infected with bacteria in their lower airways and were at increased risk for bacterial pneumonia in general prevention of bronchiolitis relies on measures to reduce the spread of the viruses that cause respiratory infections such as hand washing and avoiding exposure to those symptomatic with respiratory infectionspremature infants and others with certain major cardiac and respiratory disorders may benefit from passive immunization with palivizumab a monoclonal antibody against rsv palivizumab is administered intramuscularly at a dosage of 15 mgkg monthly beginning just before the onset of the rsv season for a total of 5 months as recommended by the american academy of pediatrics for prophylaxis in high-risk children 109 113 the use of palivizumab in asian cities with no winter or definite seasonality is controversialrisk factors for bronchiolitis deaths in the united states have been described and multiple cause-of-death and linked birthinfant death data for 1996 through 1998 were used to examine bronchiolitis-related infant deaths 114 risk factors were assessed by comparing infants who died with bronchiolitis and surviving infants during 1996 through 1998 there were 229 bronchiolitis-related infant deaths resulting in an average annual infant mortality rate of 20 per 100000 live births the majority 55 of infant deaths occurred among infants younger than 3 months the bronchiolitis mortality rate was highest among infants weighing less than 1500 g at birth very low birth weight vlbw as compared with infants weighing 1500 to 2499 g low birth weight lbw and 2500 g or heavier at birth 298 64 and 13 per 100 000 live births respectively vlbw and lbw infants remained at an increased risk of dying of bronchiolitis after controlling for other risk factors other risk factors included increasing birth order low 5-minute apgar score young maternal age unmarried mother and tobacco use during pregnancy the investigators concluded that vlbw and lbw infants are at increased risk of dying of bronchiolitis 114leader and colleagues 115 provide current estimates of the incidence associated risk factors and costs of severe rsv infections among infants in the united states defined as emergency department visits hospitalization and death between 1997 and 2000 there were 718008 emergency department visits by infants with lower respiratory infection diagnoses during the rsv season 2281000 and 29 were admitted costs of emergency department visits were approximately us202 million rsv bronchiolitis was the leading cause of infant hospitalization annually total hospital charges for rsv-coded primary diagnoses during the 4 years were more than 26 billion an estimated 390 rsv-associated postneonatal deaths occurred in 1999 low birth weight and prematurity significantly increased rsv-associated mortality rates the investigators concluded that rsv is a major cause of infant morbidity and mortality severe rsv is highest among infants of black mothers and medicaid-insured infants prematurity and low birth weight significantly increase rsv mortality ratesadmission criteria for bronchiolitis can be derived based on the severity of the disease 116 a clinical score is useful in the evaluation and grading of bronchiolitis severity 117 clinical deterioration requiring picu admission is an uncommon occurrence in previously healthy infants admitted to a general pediatric inpatient unit with rsv infection extreme tachypnea and hypoxemia are both associated with subsequent deterioration however only a small proportion of patients who clinically deteriorate present in this way the clinical usefulness of these parameters therefore is limited 118 adequate oxygen saturations should be maintained to avoid hypoxia 119 chest physiotherapy using vibration and percussion techniques does not reduce length of hospital stay oxygen requirements or improve the severity clinical score in infants with acute bronchiolitis 120 121 the course of rsv disease is variable in an east denmark study the clinical course was milder than reported elsewhere possibly as a result of the low prevalence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in denmark 5 however rsv constitutes a considerable burden to the danish pediatric health care system and the investigators suggest that prophylaxis against rsv is desirable 5severe forms of respiratory viral infections are rare in children but may lead to life-threatening conditions such as severe pneumonia necessitating picu admission and occasionally resulting in death 17 122 community-acquired pneumonia cap is a significant cause of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide viral etiology is most common in young children 68 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 in cap viral coinfection especially rsv human bocavirus rhinovirus human metapneumovirus and parainfluenza viruses ranges between 282 and 688 children with viral coinfection more frequently require hospital admission than those with single viral infection suffice to say viral coinfections are frequent in children younger than 3 years with cap and can be a poor prognostic factor 130 although a possible microbial cause is identified in less than half of the patients clinical findings and results of blood cultures chest radiographs and white blood cell and differential counts usually do not distinguish patients with a defined cause from those without a known cause for pneumonia 124 128 129 131 132 children with typical bacterial or mixed bacterialviral infections have the greatest inflammation and disease severity michelow and colleagues 133 evaluated consecutive immunocompetent children hospitalized with radiographically confirmed lower respiratory infections from january 1999 through march 2000 one hundred and fifty-four hospitalized children with lower respiratory infections were enrolled median age was 33 months range 2 months to 17 years a pathogen was identified in 79 of children typical respiratory bacteria were identified in 60 of which 73 were streptococcus pneumoniae viruses in 45 mycoplasma pneumoniae in 14 chlamydia pneumoniae in 9 and mixed bacterialviral infections in 23 multivariate logistic-regression analyses revealed that high temperature 384c within 72 hours after admission and the presence of pleural effusion were significantly associated with bacterial pneumonia 133oxygen therapy is life-saving and should be given when oxygen saturation is less than 92 127 antimicrobials are often used to cover for possible coinfections with bacteria 124 128 134 135 mechanical ventilation is often required for respiratory failure 17 125 death is uncommon 17 125 136hand hygiene through washing with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub is highly effective in reducing influenza a virus on human hands 37 appropriate hand hygiene may be an important public health initiative to reduce pandemic and influenza transmission influenza immunization can be given to children as young as 6 months there is no vaccine available for parainfluenza adenovirus rhinovirus or metapneumovirus rsv prophylaxis is available but expensiveone of the clinical problems facing pediatric intensivists is the differentiation between viral and bacterial infections when an acutely ill child with or without respiratory manifestations is admitted an empirical course of antibiotics is often used in the initial management to avoid missing any treatable bacterial coinfections 17 a low threshold for negative-pressure reverse isolation should be considered whenever possible so that other critically ill patients are not put at risk rapid diagnosis of respiratory viral infections in children is important as prompt diagnosis results in significantly reduced hospital stays antibiotic use and laboratory use 137upper airway obstruction in croup is usually caused by the parainfluenza virus however influenza may be more common than parainfluenza in causing croup in the picu 17 in lower respiratory disease such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia radiographic abnormalities are often present rendering differentiation from bacterial infections and coinfections difficult 10 sometimes parenchymal involvement as evidenced by abnormal radiography is more common with rsv than influenza infection 17 as it is often difficult to delineate viral from bacterial infection in the acute setting initial broad-spectrum antibiotics are used in the majority of patients to cover for pneumonia and sepsis 138 139 antibiotics can be discontinued when viral studies are positive and the patients have stabilizedin one study the mortality potentially attributable to the 4 respiratory viruses rsv influenza parainfluenza and adenovirus was low during the picu stay 17 adenovirus was notorious in its preponderance in causing severe diseases like encephalitis bronchiolitis obliterans and myocarditis in the series of hon and colleagues 17 2 of the 4 patients with adenovirus died during their picu stay three of the patients had the serotype 3 which is known to be able to cause severe respiratory infection 140 bacterial coinfections were often present and included various gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria cultured in the tracheal aspirate urine or blood 17 the most common organism was streptococcus pneumoniaeextrapulmonary manifestations of viral infection are an important cause of morbidity and range from seizures to cardiac arrest 141 142 143age is an important demographic factor among the 3 respiratory viruses rsv infections in particular can cause significant morbidity and mortality in young children chronic lung disease and prematurity have been found to be associated with infection with the rsv virus 144 145 146 147monthly intramuscular injection of palivizumab has been advocated in patients vulnerable to rsv infections 5 148 149 universal influenza vaccination of children older than 6 months may help prevent infection by influenza and is now recommended in the united states 11 15respiratory viral infections leading to picu admissions may lead to significant morbidity and mortality 17 presentation can be pulmonary and extrapulmonary prompt diagnosis will ensure that the appropriate treatment such as corticosteroid for croup can be instituted as soon as possible vaccination of the high-risk groups may help to prevent infection and icu admissionthe causes of severe childhood respiratory virus infections are heterogeneous and the infections may at time be life-threatening many of these respiratory viral infections share similar symptomatology and occasionally cause outbreaks and severe respiratory disease the misleading abbreviation sars was coined in 2003 150 the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome was based on a clinical definition in that patients who had fever respiratory symptoms not necessarily severe and with an epidemiologic link were considered to have sars patients clinically diagnosed to have sars may or may not have sars-cov 150 151 overdiagnosis may lead to stigmatization and inconvenience in the workplace or at school in contrast underdiagnosing the condition may lead to the disease being unrecognized and the potential for the pathogen to spread in the community imprecise definition therefore carries serious public health consequences in fact the clinical features of many patients with sars were neither severe nor respiratory in nature 150 many new surveillance guidelines and confusing abbreviations appeared a new abbreviation ili was introduced to mean influenza-like illness the definitions for many of these abbreviations are nearly identical if not the same as the clinical definition of sars ie contact  fever  respiratory symptomatology  other symptoms this can cause unnecessary confusion indeed the only difference between ili influenza avian flu swine flu and sars is the virus applying the initial clinical definition of sars to avian or swine influenza these patients all had sars because their symptoms and epidemiologic links were just like sars 150 152 however the term sars is no longer used unless sars-cov is isolated from the patient regardless of whether severe respiratory symptoms and epidemiologic links are present outbreaks of severe acute respiratory infections with epidemiologic links will occur from time to time although sars-cov is out and may never come back the sars concept of index surveillance and epidemiologic and prognostication studies for severe respiratory viral infections is here to stay sars is very much alive among us 150 152human genetic studies have provided crucial insight into neurodegenerative disease ndd pathogenesis alzheimers disease ad is a prime example of how advances in genetic technology have facilitated the evolution of our understanding of the etiology of ndds early studies using genetic linkage approaches identified familial mutations in proteins related to amyloid beta production amyloid precursor protein app presenilin 1 psen1 and psen2 as well as the late onset ad load risk variant apolipoprotein e4 apoe4 1 these studies provided important insight into amyloid as a critical factor in ad pathogenesis and prompted application of molecular approaches and animal models to understand the disease since 2007 2 case-control genome wide association studies gwas have identified many novel ad-associated genetic variants 3 though many of these individually confer only modestly elevated risk for developing ad collectively these studies provide broad insight into the pathways and processes involved in load many identified genetic linkages are implicated in modulating immune function 4 demonstrating an important role for the immune response in admore recently next generation sequencing technologies have made possible the identification of rare variants some of which may confer higher disease risk and therefore can provide important insight into genes with strong biological roles in disease 1 the application of whole exome sequencing 5 and gwas with imputation based on predicted genetic associations 6 to ad led to the identification of relatively rare variants in the gene triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 trem2 that are associated with a high risk for developing ad heterozygous trem2 variants confer similar risk for ad as one copy of apoe4 significantly the ad-associated trem2 variants are largely coding variants in contrast to most of the single nucleotide polymorphisms snps identified in gwas 7 making it more straightforward to translate into in vitro and in vivo models and perhaps also into therapeutics 8 trem2 variants have now also been linked to other ndds suggesting that trem2 is critically involved in shared disease mechanismsthe excitement in the field following identification of these ad-associated trem2 variants was also driven by its implications providing a clear link between the innate immune system and ndd pathogenesis while it has long been known that immune cell function is dysregulated in ad and other ndds it was not clear whether this actively contributed to disease pathogenesis and progression or was just a secondary response to ad-related pathology however this debate was largely settled in favor of the former when trem2 variants were found to be significantly associated with risk for ad and other ndds and to form a genetic basis of polycystic lipomembraneous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy plosl also known as nasu-hakola disease because trem2 is exclusively expressed on immune cells these genetic associations were hailed as providing conclusive evidence that immune dysregulation can be a primary causal contributor to ndd pathogenesis 9 10 thus ndd-associated trem2 variants provide a new avenue to investigate the important roles that the immune system plays in neurodegeneration 11in the 4 years since trem2 variants associated with ad risk were identified many groups have developed research programs aimed at understanding trem2 genetics expression structure signaling function and its relationship to ndd pathologies and applied these findings to clinical biomarkers and therapeutics progress in these areas has clarified our understanding of the biology of the trem2 receptor while it was previously thought that trem2 expression was decreased by pro-inflammatory stimuli and mediated anti-inflammatory effects it is now clear that its roles are more complex in vitro inflammatory stimuli decrease trem2 expression but in vivo trem2 expression is increased in inflammatory contexts more than half of studies report that trem2 has a pro-inflammatory effect suggesting that there must be cell type- and context-dependent functions of the receptor recent studies have also illuminated new aspects of trem2 biology which necessitate a reevaluation and reinterpretation of previous literature one example is the finding that soluble trem2 is produced in ad in a disease progression-dependent manner 12 and that this soluble form of the receptor may have distinct biological effects 13 14 other fundamental aspects of trem2 biology are also under intense investigation including epigenetic and posttranslational modification of trem2 that affect expression and function the ontogeny of trem2 expressing cells in the brain and how non-canonical signaling pathways may contribute to trem2 function this review offers a comprehensive synthesis of these studies alongside previous trem2 literature to identify areas of consensus and emerging questions in the field this understanding will be crucial to support informed design and interpretation of studies of trem2 and the immune response in ndds moving forwardthere is great diversity in the trem2 variants that have been associated with ndds including single amino acid substitutions frameshift and nonsense mutations and changes in splice sites predicted to alter the inclusion or exclusion of particular exons 15 and while most of the trem2 variants identified are present in the coding sequence there have also been disease-associated variants found in the 3utr 16 and upstream of the transcription start site 17 the first ndd-associated trem2 variants identified were w78x and w44x which result in premature truncation of the protein a variant at the consensus splice site which results in exclusion of exon 3 and the k186n mutation which disrupts association of trem2 with its obligate intracellular signaling adaptor dap12 18 these all likely result in a loss of trem2 function and a patient with the e14x nonsense variant of trem2 had no detectable trem2 transcript levels 19 subsequently a host of diverse trem2 variants have been identified despite their structural diversity all of the ndd-associated trem2 variants identified have been suggested to confer loss of function through different mechanisms however whether loss of function truly unifies all of these variants is still very much an open questiontrem2 was first identified as a genetic cause of plosl also commonly known as nasu-hakola disease 20 21 which is characterized clinically by bone cysts and fractures neuropsychiatric symptoms and dementia 22 neuropathologically plosl patients have axonal degeneration and white matter loss as well as cortical atrophy 23 24 this is accompanied by an inflammatory response consisting of increased microglial density and activation and astrocytosis 25 these neurological manifestations can also occur in the absence of fractures 26 or bone cysts 27 paloneva and colleagues 18 were the first to link trem2 variants with plosl and since then many studies have identified homozygous trem2 variants that form the genetic basis of plosl 2833studies in families with frontotemporal dementia ftd 34 or frontotemporal lobar dementia ftld found that plosl-associated trem2 variants t66 m 35 36 w198x 37 q33x and y38c 36 in either homozygosity or heterozygosity could also cause ftd 3537 fig 1 case-control studies were then performed to assess whether trem2 variants might increase risk for ftd in the general population initial studies suggested that there was a positive association between trem2 variants as a whole and risk of ftd 16 38 with a significant association found between ftd risk and individual trem2 variants including t96k and l211p 39 and r47h 40 others failed to replicate this association with trem2 variants and ftd or ftld 34 39 41 42 however an association between trem2 variants and specific endophenotypes of ftd including reduced white matter volume seizures and motor symptoms has been reported 43 together it is not clear whether trem2 variants increase risk for ftd outside of specific familial cases but they may influence specific clinical manifestations of the disease
it was investigated whether trem2 variants could also confer risk for alzheimers disease while it was first suggested that plosl-associated genes might confer risk for ad in 1983 44 a small case-control study in 2007 failed to demonstrate a significant association with ad risk 29 however larger studies in 2013 found that heterozygous expression of the trem2 r47h 5 6 and d87n variants 5 were significantly associated with ad risk the association of trem2 variants with ad has been extensively replicated 15 16 4548 and the r47h variant 16 37 41 42 4956 validated in neuropathologically-confirmed cases 57 other variants have also been consistently shown to confer ad risk including d87n 5 15 r62h 51 56 l211p and t96k and h157y 51 58 fig 1 while rare individuals with ad homozygous for the r47h 41 50 59 and l211p 41 variants have also been identifiedstudies examining the association of trem2 variants with particular ad endophenotypes yielded somewhat inconsistent results likely due to the small sample size of patients with these trem2 variants some found that r47h trem2 variant carriers had a decreased 41 or a trend toward decrease 54 in the age of ad onset though others found no significant association 49 60 additionally some found that disease progression was accelerated in r47h carriers 60 61 though this was not observed in all studies 41 other variants were also found to increase 62 or decrease 17 the rate of ad progression despite possible differences in ad onset or progression the clinical presentation of ad in r47h carriers is similar to non-carriers 41 49 though there may be a higher incidence of some endophenotypes including seizures and motor symptoms 63trem2 variants have also been assessed as potential risk factors for other neurodegenerative diseases though the findings in these other disease contexts are less definitive in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als one study found a significant association of the r47h variant and als risk as well as an inverse correlation between trem2 levels in the spinal cord and survival in als patients 64 though this was not replicated by others 40 the trem2 r47h variant has also been reported to be associated with increased risk of parkinsons disease 39 by some 40 65 66 but not all studies 6 42 67 in order to understand these differences lill and colleagues 42 divided their groups by ethnicity and found that the odds ratio of the r47h variant was significantly higher in their northern european population compared to non-northern europeans others identified another parkinsons disease pd-associated snp 5 kb upstream of trem2 66 though its effect on trem2 expression is not known the trem2 r47h variant has also been investigated as a risk factor for posterior cortical atrophy 68 multiple system atrophy 69 essential tremor 70 multiple sclerosis 71 and creutzfeldt-jakob disease cjd 41 though these studies were not conclusive one family has been identified in which a mutation in trem2 is thought to result in progressive non-fluent aphasia 72 though other cases will be necessary to confirm this association so far evidence suggests that trem2 variants are not significantly associated with dementia with lewy bodies 73 ischemic stroke 40 or progressive supranuclear palsy 40 because many of these diseases share overlapping clinical features with ad and ftd it will be important to validate any associations of trem2 with other ndds in neuropathologically confirmed cases overall the association of trem2 variants with these other ndds is less clear and future studies with large sample sizes in diverse but well-matched populations will be required to definitively establish whether trem2 variants confer risk for ndds other than plosl ftd and ad importantly the association of trem2 variants with multiple ndds suggests it may underlie common disease mechanisms trem2 dysfunction may provide insight into mechanistic links among these diseasesepidemiologically the prevalence of trem2 variants differs greatly among individuals from different genetic backgrounds 74 in caucasian populations the minor allele frequency maf of the r47h trem2 variant ranges from 012026 in the united states to up to 2 in some specific british populations 5 6 59 while the r47h variant is virtually absent in east asian individuals 56 69 7581 nine other trem2 variants were present in east asian populations and collectively associated with ndd risk 82 similarly the maf of the r47h and r62h variants are much lower in african americans compared to european american populations 83 84 however exonic sequencing of trem2 revealed variants that had much higher mafs in the african american population compared to european americans and some of these variants were significantly associated with ad risk in that population 83 because of the small mafs it is not clear whether the effect sizes of these variants differ among different ethnic groups as well the low mafs and diversity in the frequency of trem2 variants across populations necessitates that studies have large study populations and be well-matched for ethnicity it will also be important to take advantage of the identification of these trem2 variants across diverse populations to gain a full understanding of how trem2 variants confer ad risk and how they might interact with other genetic differences among individuals from distinct genetic backgroundsseveral groups have examined the relationship between trem2 and other ndd risk factors variants in siglec-3 cd33 are significantly associated with ad risk and cd33 levels on human blood monocytes were found to inversely correlate with surface trem2 levels 85 the ad-associated cd33 allele increased its surface expression effectively decreasing trem2 signaling another ad-associated gene membrane-spanning 4-domain family a ms4a was found to be co-enriched with trem2 in the human brain and is substantially upregulated in monocytes derived from patients with plosl-associated trem2 variants 86 an ad-associated snp in ms4a correlated with altered soluble trem2 strem2 levels in cerebrospinal fluid csf suggesting that ms4a may also regulate trem2 expression or processing 86 trem2 levels are also increased in ad mouse models lacking pgrn expression which models lower pgrn expression observed with an ad and ftld-associated pgrn genetic variant 87components of the trem2 signaling pathway have also been associated with ndds including its intracellular signaling adaptor dnax activation protein of 12 kda dap12 also termed tyrobp dap12 and trem2 variants produce virtually indistinguishable phenotypes in plosl patients 18 30 however satoh and colleagues 25 found that dendritic cells derived from monocytes of plosl patients with trem2 or dap12 mutations had very different patterns of gene expression suggesting that they may produce the same phenotype through different molecular mechanisms a rare dap12 variant at the site of interaction with trem2 also confers risk for developing early onset ad 88 and dap12 was found to play a central role in ad-related molecular networks 89 as its relationship to ndds might predict dap12 deficient mice also have synaptic degeneration and reduced myelination 90 though recent evidence suggests that dap12 deficiency may be neuroprotective in an ad mouse model 91 the precise mechanisms underlying these changes are not yet understood variants in additional proteins associated with the trem2 signaling pathway ship1 and colony stimulating factor 1 receptor csf1r have been associated with ad risk and leukoencephalopathy with spheroids 92 93 in addition apoe a putative trem2 ligand 9496 is clearly established as an ad risk factor 97 finally environmental risk factors for ad including traumatic brain injury 98 99 diabetes 100 and age 101 all alter trem2 expression in the brain together the identification of variants in genes involved in these common immune pathways suggest that trem2 along with its interaction partners together play an important role in modifying ndd pathologytrem2 is located on human chromosome 6 in a gene locus containing several trem and trem-like genes such as trem1 triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells like transcript 1 treml1 and treml2 which likely originated from duplication events but now have relatively diverse sequences 102104 many of these genes including trem2 are highly conserved between humans and mice while others are present only in mice trem3 and treml6 or humans treml3 and nkp44 there may be some shared mechanisms of gene regulation across the locus for example there is a retinoid x receptor rxr binding site upstream of the entire locus that is thought to result in coordinate regulation of these genes 105 however in some cases opposing regulation of these different genes has been shown such as between trem2 and trem1 85 and between trem2 and treml2 106 107 it is not known what factors contribute to these inverse correlations in expression snps within this locus can also result in changes in expression of multiple trem genes variants in the treml2 66 and treml4 108 gene have been shown to increase brain trem2 and treml1 expression levels chan and colleagues 85 found that ad-associated variants in trem1 result in reduced trem1 expression on human monocytes and increased trem2 expression moreover an intronic variant in trem1 which decreases its expression leads to increased amyloid accumulation and cognitive decline in ad patients 109 however non-ad associated variants decreased both trem1 and trem2 expression leading the authors to suggest that the ratio of trem1 and trem2 expression rather than the absolute changes in expression may be important for disease additionally variants in treml2 increase pd risk 62 and other disease-related snps that alter treml2 levels 66 associate with ad in gwas analyses 93 another variant of treml2 was found to be protective against developing ad 107 an intergenic variant associated with ad risk was shown to alter rna levels of treml4 110 these data highlight the importance of characterizing the expression patterns of all trem members in an effort to pinpoint co-regulatory mechanisms among these genes physiologically and in the context of diseasetrem2 expression is highly cell-type and context specific however the molecular mechanisms governing this highly specific regulation of trem2 expression are just beginning to be understood while there are several predicted transcription factor binding sites in the utrs and promoter region of trem2 only a few have been functionally validated pu1 a master regulator of myeloid cell fate specification is present in the trem2 promoter 111 the rxr agonist bexarotene was found to enhance rxr occupancy of known binding sites 105 upstream of trem2 in mice though this did not correlate with increased trem2 rna levels 112 however in ad mouse models bexarotene did enhance gene expression of trem2 112 suggesting that rxr may effectively induce trem2 transcription when cells are already primed in a particular context nkb 113 114 protein e 115 rankl and nfat 116 have all been shown to regulate trem2 expression in different cell types but it is not clear whether these factors directly regulate expression one group has suggested that nfb may instead regulate trem2 expression by increasing levels of microrna34a which in reporter assays decreased trem2 expression 113 117121 there are also epigenetic changes that have been shown to influence trem2 expression in humans hippocampal enrichment of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine 5hmc a marker of active demethylation at the trem2 transcription start site and in exon 2 were found to positively correlate with trem2 mrna levels 122 methylation upstream of the trem2 transcription start site was also increased in ad a context in which trem2 levels are also increased 123 additionally methylation at the cpg sites in intron 1 negatively correlated with trem2 mrna levels in human leukocytes and methylation at these sites was reduced in ad patients 124 others have found that h3kme2 and h3kme3 histone modifications which typically are associated with active gene transcription are increased at the trem2 locus in dbdb mouse adipose tissue 125 and in cultured dendritic cells and macrophages during differentiation 126 contexts in which trem2 mrna levels are elevatedfinally there are likely post-transcriptional mechanisms of regulation of trem2 expression which contribute to differential expression in different contexts trem2 mrna stability can be dynamically regulated the half-life of trem2 mrna in cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells went from 113 h to 4 h after toll-like receptor tlr ligation 127 furthermore hu and colleagues 128 found that trem2 mrna expression strongly correlated with surface levels of trem2 protein on monocytes but only weakly correlated with protein expression on granulocytes in the plasma this suggests that in addition to differential regulation of trem2 transcription through transcription factors and epigenetic markers trem2 expression can be further differentially controlled at the mrna and protein level in distinct cell types through mechanisms which are not resolvedhow trem2 variants affect trem2 expression is a topic currently under investigation as discussed above some trem2 variants are known to reduce trem2 expression the nonsense mutations e14x 18 and q33x 129 were both found to eliminate trem2 protein expression trem2 rna levels were reduced in patients harboring the variant t66m 23 and a splice donor mutation in intron 3 130 heterozygous expression of a variant that affects trem2 splicing in intron 1 which is associated with early onset dementia also affected the expression of the common variant allele of trem2 reducing it by more than half 131 it is unclear how these variants result in reduced trem2 transcript levels though it has been suggested that epigenetic changes may partially account for these effects in contrast the r47h variant either did not change 57 or trended toward increasing trem2 transcript levels 132 in individuals with ad although there were no changes found in gene methylation upstream of trem2s transcription start site in r47h carriers compared to controls 123 variants tend to cluster around exon 2 where trem2 expression was found to be correlated with 5hmc enrichment 122 whether variants affect regulation of trem2 rna expression at the level of epigenetics transcription factor binding rna stability or altering the cell phenotype in a manner that indirectly drives alterations in trem2 transcription is not yet clear at the protein level in transfected cell lines t66m and y38c trem2 variant proteins were found to be degraded by the proteasome leading to decreased protein expression 133 in ad patients with r47h variants there was a trend toward decreased trem2 protein levels in one study 57 but a trend toward an increase in another 132 it will be crucial to continue collecting data from trem2 variant carriers to gain a clearer picture of how trem2 expression is altered by different disease-associated variants in plosl patients with dap12 mutations there was a variable effect on dap12 expression levels in some cases increasing and in others decreasing expression 23 it may be that trem2 variants also alter trem2 expression in distinct waystrem2 is expressed on many cells of the myeloid lineage as its name suggests including dendritic cells 101 126 130 134136 granulocytes 128 bone marrow and monocyte derived macrophages 126 130 135 137 138 and tissue macrophages like splenocytes 139 kuppfer cells 140 alveolar macrophages 141 142 and osteoclasts 19 116 143 fig 2 trem2 is not reported to be expressed on lymphocytes 128 its expression on circulating monocytes remains controversial initially it was thought that trem2 was only expressed after differentiation of monocytes into macrophages 130 and others have provided further data to support a lack of trem2 expression or expression on only a small subset of monocytes in humans 101 126 135 144 and mice 145 however others have detected trem2 expression in whole blood 124 146148 and specifically on human 85 128 and mouse 149 monocytes these disparate findings may be due to differences in sensitivity of detection or other technical factors but it will be important to resolve moving forward
it is clear that trem2 is expressed in the brain and most evidence documents that trem2 is expressed exclusively within the brain by microglia all published studies to date find that primary cultured microglia express trem2 139 150153 in vivo most studies detect trem2 expression in mouse microglia 11 101 152157 though some find that it is expressed by only a subset of these cells 114 158161 and others could detect trem2 rna but not protein expression in mouse microglia 162 furthermore studies demonstrated that when microglia are acutely depleted from the brain through csf1r antagonist treatment in vivo 163 through cd11b-hsvtk depletion in brain slices 155 or chronically in pu1 knockout mice 154 trem2 is no longer detectable in the cns in humans experimental outcomes have been more variable with some detecting high levels of trem2 expression across all microglia 156 others finding lower levels of trem2 expression 164 and others not detecting microglial expression of trem2 25 with a few exceptions most evidence is in strong agreement that trem2 is expressed at least under normal physiological conditions specifically in microglia within the cnstrem2 expression in the cns is also regulated throughout development and its expression pattern varies across different brain regions trem2 is first detectable in the mouse cns at e14 and continues to be expressed through adulthood 154 however at p1 all brain myeloid cells express trem2 rna but not all of these cells still express detectable levels by p10 which has also been supported in vitro 165 this early elevated trem2 expression also occurs in other organs following macrophage infiltration during organogenesis 137 trem2 expression is also regulated differentially across brain regions in humans and mice trem2 was found to be highly expressed in white matter 101 165 hippocampus 101 156 165 and spinal cord 18 156 among other regions while this could suggest that particular microenvironmental niches induce trem2 expression locally within distinct microglial populations it may also simply reflect the high density of microglia in these regions 101trem2 expression has been shown to be dramatically altered in the contexts of inflammation injury and disease in vitro application of classically pro-inflammatory molecules tnf 117 136 il1 107 136 166 ros 166 167 ifn 168 tlr agonists including lipopolysaccharide lps 106 114 135 136 167170 cpgs 171 and other tlr ligands 114 127 138 150 mitochondrial lysates 172 and bacteria 173 decreased trem2 expression while anti-inflammatory molecules vasoactive intestinal peptide 174 and il4 168 increased trem2 expression in contrast in vivo inflammation and different disease states almost universally increase trem2 expression stimuli that induce an inflammatory response in the lung increase trem2 expression in alveolar macrophages 141 149 173178 high fat diet 100 179 increased inflammation and trem2 expression in adipose tissue liver and brain trem2 is also upregulated in numerous other inflammation-related contexts including sepsis 180 rheumatoid arthritis 181 corneal infection 182 macular degeneration 117 glioma 183 oral 184 esophaegeal 185 and liver 186 cancers following prosthetic joint implants 187 osteoporosis 188 colonic mucosal injury 189 colitis 190 gastrointestinal mucositis 191 and muscular sarcoidosis 192 in the cns trem2 expression is increased in the context of traumatic brain injury 98 99 stroke 160 193 spinal nerve transection 194 als 64 pd 66 prion disease 155 195 models of demyelination 151 159 196198 and following beta-amyloid a vaccination 199 only one study found reduced trem2 expression in in vivo inflammatory contexts following lps injection and middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice 114 trem2 has also been shown in almost all cases to positively correlate with aging both in mouse models 200 201 and in humans 101 soluble trem2 a product of full-length protein cleavage or alternative splicing is detectable in csf and its levels were also positively correlated with age 12 86 202 203 though this was not reflected in blood 204 taken together these studies largely demonstrate that in vitro inflammatory stimuli decrease trem2 expression while in vivo inflammatory stimuli predominantly increase trem2 expression clearly suggesting that the dogma based on early studies that trem2 expression is universally reduced in inflammatory contexts is not applicable to in vivo contexts why this occurs is not clear but may reflect differences in cell recruitment acute versus chronic signaling non-cell autonomous signaling pathways or phenotypic changes in myeloid cells that occur when they leave their native environmentthe most comprehensive assessment of changes in trem2 expression has been performed in the context of alzheimers disease studies in ad patient brain tissue almost exclusively show increased trem2 expression 122 132 150 164 205208 and some 124 128 148 but not all 146 found this was also reflected in increased trem2 levels in monocytes from ad patients trem2 levels in the brains of ad mouse models are also increased one study reports a reduction in trem2 rna levels before the onset of pathology in tg2576 mice 209 though after the onset of pathology all amyloid models of ad examined have increased trem2 rna and protein levels 162 200 210214 this upregulation of trem2 expression occurs shortly after the onset of pathology and largely seems to correlate with amyloid burden 85 157 215 and the association of myeloid cells with amyloid plaques 207 208 tau models of ad also show increased trem2 levels 211 216 however trem2 is only increased long after neurofibrillary tangle development in these models 211 consistent with trem2 upregulation at late stages of disease progression in postmortem ad brain tissue 207 several studies have sought to determine what aspect of ad pathology drives trem2 expression trem2 is upregulated in myeloid cells associated with plaques 158 162 212 213 217 218 and specifically trem2 is highly expressed on myeloid cell processes in contact with plaques 219 in support of a plaque-driven upregulation in trem2 expression varvel and colleagues 217 depleted microglia from the brains of an ad mouse model and allowed the brain to repopulate with new myeloid cells these new cells that repopulated the brain initially failed to associate with plaques but eventually became plaque-associated and coordinately upregulated trem2 expression furthermore stereotactic injection of beta-amyloid 42 a42 into the cortex and hippocampus of wild-type mice was sufficient to induce an upregulation in trem2 transcripts within 24 h 214 together these findings suggest that amyloid can increase trem2 expression in myeloid cells to determine whether this effect was cell-autonomous cultured microglia were treated with a though these studies have so far produced inconsistent results with respect to trem2 expression 106 214 significantly melchior and colleagues 158 found that there was no effect on cultured microglia treated with beta-amyloid 40 a40 on trem2 levels but if they added a40 to mixed glial cultures this did result in upregulation of trem2 on microglia by flow cytometry this suggests that at least this a species may drive trem2 expression through feedback from other cell types though the signals that mediate a-induced upregulation of trem2 on myeloid cells are not yet knownnot all myeloid cells associated with plaques express trem2 158 162 investigation of which subset of myeloid cells upregulated trem2 in the ad brain has yielded conflicting results some findings suggest trem2 cells may be peripherally derived macrophages rather than brain resident microglia jay and colleagues 162 found that trem2 was expressed on cd45hi myeloid cells which expressed the monocyte marker ly6c and not the microglial-specific marker p2ry12 following toxoplasma gondii infection in 5xfad mice mohle and colleagues 220 found that trem2 was expressed most highly by c-c chemokine receptor type 2 ccr2ly6clof480 cells in the brain a marker signature of peripherally derived macrophages trem2 expression in other disease models including basal cell carcinoma 138 sciatic nerve transection 221 and colonic mucosal injury 189 was found to be upregulated coincident with the peak of macrophage infiltration into the tissue in contrast others have detected trem2 expression on dark microglial cells in the brain which are 4d4 and 4c12 a marker signature consistent with resident microglia 215 wang and colleagues 222 also performed experiments in which age-matched cd451 wt donors were parabiosed with cd452 ad mouse models and were not able to detect cd451 cells in the brains of the ad mice indeed the contribution of peripherally derived macrophages to ndd pathologies has a long and controversial history however if trem2 is expressed on these cells it suggests they may play a key role in modulating pathology and thus this issue should continue to be exploredtrem2 is a single pass transmembrane protein whose ligand binding domain includes an extracellular ig-like domain 223 with n-linked glycosylation sites 133 136 170 224 phosphorylation sites and disulfide bonds which are thought to perform important structural roles the transmembrane domain anchors trem2 to the membrane and contains the intramembraneous lysine residue necessary for association with its intracellular membrane adaptor dap12 this is followed by a short cytoplasmic tail with no established function disease-associated variants of trem2 alter many of these structural elements fig 1 many variants are found in exon 2 and may change the structure of its ligand-binding domain impacting the affinity of trem2 for different ligands for example the y38c variant associated with plosl and ftd is predicted to alter an important flanking sequence of the cysteine residues which form trem2s disulfide bonds 36 223 likewise glycosylation is affected in cells transfected with y38c and t66 m trem2 variants 225 though not in several other variants examined 48 glycosylation of the r47h variant was also found to be reduced 225 though not to the same extent as the other trem2 variants in vitro in humans expressing the r47h variant there were no significant differences in the level of glycosylation 132 but there were differences in the pattern of glycosylation 133 224 trem2 variants can also affect other important structural motifs of the trem2 protein such as those required for dap12 association and overall protein folding and stability t66m and y38c variants 223 along with v126g are predicted to be important for protein packing consistent with impaired protein folding t66m and y38c variants exhibit enhanced proteasomal degradation 129 the r47h variant has been predicted to impair protein stability 226 but transfected r47h-trem2 constructs actually have an increased half-life relative to wt trem2 and are resistant to proteasomal degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum er 224 ndd-associated trem2 variants located on the surface of the protein r62h t96k d87n and r47h are not predicted to substantially alter trem2 structure 223 227 but instead affect ligand binding 223 as the structure of trem2 and disease-associated variants continue to be resolved we will gain better insight into the organization of structural features essential for trem2 functiontrem2 can also be produced as a soluble protein fig 3 soluble trem2 strem2 has been detected in the supernatants of mouse 225 and human cells in culture 198 225 it has been proposed that strem2 could be produced by both alternative splicing and proteolytic cleavage insertions 161 or frameshifts 228 preceding exon 4 terminate the transmembrane domain and are predicted to yield a soluble product in human brain tissue at least three trem2 isoforms have been detected 51 with isoform 1 encoding the full-length protein being the most highly expressed 122 meanwhile the transcript encoding a 219-residue splice isoform is expressed to a lesser extent than isoform 1 in the hippocampus of ad patients 132 whereas the degree of expression of the 222-residue splice isoform has yet to be resolved based on rna sequencing data in ad mice 1520 of transcripts were predicted to be alternatively spliced 208 notably these alternative transcripts have been identified in human monocytes 228 and in ad brain tissue 51 132 evidence of elevations in expression of trem2 exons 3 and 4 in advanced ad cases by microarray-based gene expression analysis 229 is suggestive of trem2 alternative splicing in ad 51 132 228 the expression of full length and splice isoforms of trem2 are strongly correlated in ad tissue suggesting all trem2 isoforms may be coordinately regulated 132 dna methylation within the body of the gene has been shown to impact alternative splicing 123 and as trem2 can be methylated within exon 2 122 it is possible that context-dependent changes in methylation may also result in altered splicing however direct evidence that alternatively spliced mrnas are translated is lacking
the sequential proteolytic processing of trem2 has definitively been shown to generate strem2 132 225 230 in vitro inhibitor studies revealed full-length trem2 is proteolytically cleaved by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein adam10 resulting in shedding of the ectodomain 136 225 230 detection of trem2 c-terminal fragments ctfs within cell lines 133 225 230 and human brain extracts 231 is suggestive of a two-step proteolytic cleavage event of trem2 following ectodomain shedding by adam10 the remaining membrane-associated trem2 c-terminus undergoes intramembrane proteolysis by -secretase to release its intracellular domain 230 -secretase cleavage of trem2 results in accumulation of trem2 ctfs without a corresponding increase in full-length trem2 at the plasma membrane upon -secretase inhibition 133 230 232 it is not known how this process is regulated but it is known that trem2s adaptor protein dap12 is required for strem2 production at least in some contexts 149whether the production of strem2 in ad occurs by alternative splicing or ectodomain shedding is unclear it may be cell-type and context dependent as different cell types showed either an up- dendritic cells or downregulation microglia monocytes of the trem2 splice transcript levels when stimulated by lps 161 228 il13 and il4 were also shown to enhance strem2 production in bone marrow derived macrophages 149 this is consistent with studies examining other members of the trem family as trem1 233235 and trem-like transcript-1 236 which also produce cell-specific protein productstrem2 variants linked to ad and other neurodegenerative diseases can alter soluble trem2 generation trem2 variants can drive novel trem2 splicing 28 32 such as the plosl-associated trem2 variant c482  2 t  c in which conversion of a single nucleotide at a splice-donor consensus site within intron 3 results in the deletion of exon 3 in addition to exon 2 andor exon 4 18 this is proposed to produce soluble protein products 28 lacking either the transmembrane tm domain or both the tm and ectodomain while most trem2 variants are expressed in all isoforms of trem2 there are disease-associated variants expressed only in the alternatively spliced isoforms of trem2 15 16 51 58 83 several reports have also demonstrated that trem2 variants t66m and y38c yield significant changes in strem2 release by cultured cells 86 225 this was also evident in individuals homozygous 203 225 and heterozygous 86 for the t66m variant exhibiting a loss or reduction in csf levels of strem2 respectively other case reports showed disease-associated trem2 variants lowered csf strem2 levels compared to a non-carrier group 86 while some have reported decreased levels of strem2 and trem2 intracellular domain icd production in vitro with the r47h variant 224 the trem2 r47h variant acted similarly to wild-type in strem2 production in other in vitro assays 225 and ad patients carrying the r47h variant had elevated levels of csf strem2 86 there was a trend for higher transcript levels of a 219-residue trem2 splice variant in cortices of late-stage ad cases with the r47h risk allele compared to significant elevation in this splice isoform in non-carrier ad cases 132 these data altogether suggest that different trem2 variants have distinct effects on strem2 levelsin addition to altering proteolytic cleavage the localization of trem2 within the cell can greatly impact trem2 signaling and its trafficking appears to be a highly dynamic process in homeostatic conditions trem2 seems to be primarily found intracellularly 237 associating with the trans-golgi network 156 200 238 and in a population of exocytic vesicles 238 these vesicles appear to be continuously shuttled to the membrane a process which can be rapidly induced by increases in ca2 in response to ionomycin 238 it is not clear what other specific stimuli or disease contexts result in changes in trem2 localization within the cell but this will be critical to understand trem2s functional role in these contexts trem2 is recycled from the membrane in clatherin-coated vesicles in a beclin-1 239 and vps35-dependent manner 239 240 vps35 mediates recycling of trem2 from the membrane via retromer complexes 240 when this process is blocked trem2 increases its association with the lysosome and is degraded 240 trem2 variants can impact trem2 localization within the cell in cells in which trem2 variants were transfected t66m and y38c 48 133 223 225 237 as well as other variants 48 significantly reduced trem2 surface expression these variants increased the localization of trem2 with the er 133 225 which may indicate impaired protein folding the r47h variant was found to either not alter surface expression 48 133 or reduce surface expression of trem2 to a lesser extent 225 unlike the other variants r47h trem2 was mostly localized to the trans-golgi network rather than the er comparable to the wt receptor 133 225 however yin and colleagues 240 did find that the r47h variant had reduced association with vps35 resulting in increased lysosomal degradation following recycling of the receptor from the surface overall this suggests that variants may in part impact trem2 function by altering the localization of trem2 within the cell while trem2 has been proposed to play a functional signaling role exclusively on the cell surface this could also impact possible functional roles of trem2 in other cellular compartmentsdespite substantial efforts the identity of the biological ligands of trem2 remains controversial fig 4 trem2 is known to modulate myeloid cell activity in response to microbial products 241 which led several groups to test bacteria as a possible source of trem2 ligands using a trem2-fc fusion protein that consists of the extracellular ectodomain of trem2 attached to the fc-portion of human igg trem2 was found to bind to some bacteria 242 243 including gram-positive s aureus and gram-negative species e coli f tularensis but not s cerevisiae 244 245 salmonella or typinmurin 246 trem2 was specifically found to bind highly anionic bacterial products 244 and pertussis 247 and cholera 248 toxins in addition to microbial products trem2 was also reported to bind to high molecular-weight nucleic acids 160 and heat-shock protein 60 249 that were further shown to initiate trem2 signaling in reporter cell lines while some of these interactions were found to be of relatively low affinity 249 recognition of many molecules like carbohydrates and glycans induce only minimal biological signaling at low densities but at high densities when receptors are forced into closer contact can create strong biological effects 250 indeed glycosaminoglycans and specifically heparin sulfate were found to modulate trem2 binding 223 and it has been suggested that this may result in clustering of trem2 on the membrane thus potentially modulating trem2 binding to other ligands 251
unidentified trem2 ligands were also detected by trem2-fc binding to the cell surface of macrophages 252 human astrocytoma cells 244 dendritic cells 253 n2a cells 153 223 thp-1 cells 223 and apoptotic cells 160 in support of these findings trem2 deficiency partially impairs microglial recognition of apoptotic cells 94 153 160 recent studies have demonstrated that trem2 binding to these cells is sensitive to proteinase k suggesting the receptor binds to protein 223 perhaps complexed with proteoglycansit had previously been shown that members of the trem family recognized lipid ligands 254 and lipids may also help mediate the interaction of trem2 with ligands on the cell surface polar lipids found on the cell surface were assessed as possible trem2 ligands 223 242 254 using lipid arrays 96 and reporter assays 196 222 while anionic lipids seemed to produce among the highest levels of response additional factors that influence the particular lipids that trem2 recognizes requires further study this lipid binding may allow trem2 to sense changes in the local environment as exemplified by trem2-positive cells binding to externalized phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells 153 and myelin debris 196some studies suggest that trem2 may bind lipids in cis with other protein-based interactions 223 trem2 has also been reported to bind to lipoproteins including apolipoprotein a1 apoa-i clusterin clu and low density lipoprotein ldl though apoe has been most widely demonstrated to bind to soluble trem2-fc this binding seems to occur independent of apoe isoform 9496 255 and be dependent on residues 130149 255 because trem2 binds to lipids the lipidation status of apoe and other apolipoproteins could dictate their binding affinity to trem2 several studies 95 96 255 demonstrate that trem2-apoe binding is not dependent on lipid loading however others have found that lipidation was necessary to drive trem2 binding 94 lipid association is reported to be necessary for trem2 binding to apoe apoa-i and apoa-ii from cynomolgus macaque csf and serum 96 apoe binding to trem2 was found to induce trem2 signaling in nfat reporter cell lines 255 though how its binding to trem2 would alter signaling in vivo remains to be determined because apoe can bind to apoptotic cells 95 and amyloid plaques 95 96 it has been proposed that an interaction between trem2 and apoe may indirectly allow it to mediate recognition and phagocytosis of these substrates this may be important in the recognition of ad-related stimuli by trem2 because trem2 was found not to bind to plate-bound a 222 but did bind to areas around amyloid plaques in an ad mouse model 158 however the possibility of trem2 binding directly to a in addition to these indirect interactions has not been fully excluded together these data indicate that in addition to protein  proteoglycan complexes trem2 may also bind to lipids and protein-lipid complexesad-associated trem2 variants including r47h r62h d87n and t96k are found on the surface of the protein and impact ligand binding 223 studies employing a trem2 r47h-fc chimeric protein revealed the r47h mutation significantly reduces trem2 binding to cells 223 apoe 96 including all three isoforms 95 and its lipidated form 94 other lipids 144 222 apolipoproteins 94 96 and lipoproteins 144 trem2 variants at either the same residue r47a r47e and r46a 96 or with a similar r-to-h substitution r62h 94 144 as r47h similarly disrupted trem2 recognition of apolipoproteins 94 or cells 223 however r62h and r52h variants demonstrated relatively comparable lipid detection to wt trem2 144 other variants residing within the trem2 ectodomain y38c t66m k48m effectively abolished trem2 binding to proposed ligands 94 while those located on the ectodomain proximal to the stalk region of trem2 d87n t96k exhibited enhanced interactions with some ligands 144 223 while decreasing association with others 94 trem2 variants within the stalk region h157y e151k r136w or intracellular domain l211p had no significant impact on ligand binding the differences among these disease-conferring trem2 variants recognition of cells lipids lipoproteins and apolipoproteins may alter how they impact downstream signaling however it remains unclear whether the ligands identified thus far are the relevant binding partners of trem2 in vivo and mediate the receptors ability to respond to damage or infection in the cns future work establishing the full array of physiological trem2 ligands and how variants impact these interactions will be instrumental in elucidating the role of trem2 on myeloid cells in response to different pathologic stimulibecause the major isoform of trem2 has only a short cytoplasmic tail it requires the intracellular adaptor dap12 136 256 to mediate several of its signaling functions 139 143 along with trem2 dap12 is required for signaling of other trem family members 242 mdl-1 and siglecs and can be used as an adaptor for other receptors critical for regulating myeloid cell function including csf1r and toll like receptors 257 in some contexts cross-talk among these receptors has been shown to occur at the level of dap12 availabilityin order to associate with the membrane dap12 requires the presence of its receptors 256 indeed dap12 is clustered at the same area of the membrane where trem2 is highly upregulated on myeloid cell processes in contact with plaques in an ad mouse model 258 at the membrane dap12 can associate with other dap12 molecules to form homodimers through cysteine residues in its short extracellular domain 259 in some contexts dap12 can also heterodimerize with dnax activation protein of 10 kda dap10 260 which can modify downstream signaling cascades it is not known whether dap12 complexes constitutively associate with trem2 or whether this is induced upon ligand binding in vivo but recent data using a split luciferase assay found that trem2-dap12 association in transfected hek cells was primarily driven upon trem2 stimulation 237 interestingly the t66m trem2 variant but not r47h or s116c variants enhanced the constitutive association with dap12 in this system 237 regardless activation of trem2 and other dap12-associated receptors results in tyrosine phosphorylation of dap12 within its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs itam by src family kinases casein kinase ii at residues 8588 and at residues 7981 by pkc 259 this phosphorylation occurs only when dap12 is receptor-associated 139 and serine  threonine phosphorylation of the itam motifs are required for signaling 139these phosphotyrosine residues on the dap12 itam serve as docking sites for a number of molecules that initiate signaling cascades that activate an immune response there are several immune stimulating molecules that associate with dap12 in response to trem2 activation fig 4 crosslinking trem2 commonly used to mimic trem2 activation can result in recruitment of dap10 pi3k or lab to the trem2-dap12 complex in turn these molecules are activated through tyrosine phosphorylation principally by itam-associated syk and go on to activate downstream signaling components including akt rac vav and mapks including erk 129 136 139 159 182 260263 these initiate changes in gene expression and cytoskeletal rearrangement which mediate many downstream cellular functions associated with immune cell activation 264while itam domains are typically activating they can be inhibitory in certain contexts 265 266 when the itam motifs of dap12 are partially phosphorylated 267 inhibitory phosphatases ship shp and the adaptor downstream of kinase 3 dok3 are recruited to the trem2-dap12 signaling complex these molecules inhibit immune activation 265 268270 possibly through blocking dap10 pi3k and syk association with the trem2-dap12 complex and preventing activation of erk vav3 and calcium mobilization 260whether signaling through dap12 results in activation or inhibition of the immune response seems to be receptor- and stimulus-dependent activation of trem2 and myeloid dap12-associating lectin 1 mdl1 but not sirp enhanced association of the inhibitory ship1 with dap12 260 similarly macrophage colony stimulating factor mcsf alone but not mcsf and rankl induced localization of ship1 to dap12 260 even different levels of the same stimulus can induce association of trem2-dap12 with different downstream signaling components for example peng and colleagues 270 found that a low dose but not a high dose of lps resulted in association of dap12 with dok3 this served to dampen the cellular response to lps as dok3 deficiency increased downstream signaling components cytokine production and death of mice administered an otherwise sub-lethal dose of lps however at high doses of lps treatment dok3 did not associate with dap12 ship1 was also shown to moderate the response of trem2-induced proliferation when ship1 deficient preosteoclasts were exposed to an activating trem2 antibody osteoclast formation was upregulated an additional 4-fold 260whether dap12 serves to activate or inhibit the immune response depends on the receptor it is associated with the stimulus used to activate that receptor and the strength of that stimulus it may also depend on availability of different downstream signaling components locally at the membrane their relative expression in the cell 262 or other environmental factors 271 much of the signaling data thus far was performed in cultured osteoclasts and future studies may find that other cell types use distinct signaling mechanisms whether trem2 signaling is activating or inhibitory in the context of disease is also not known and a greater understanding of the different trem2 pathways that are relevant in disease will be instructive interestingly ship1 variants also confer risk for ad and it is thought that these variants result in a change in the transcriptional start site of ship1 resulting in a protein that lacks its sh2 domain which is necessary for association with itams and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs itims 272 this suggests that these inhibitory components that associate with trem2 deserve attention moving forward in understanding immune-related pathways that are important in adthere is a general consensus that trem2 likely acts as a homodimer or homomultimer to induce downstream signaling this is a common mechanism of activation of other receptors with similar structures to trem2 in which ligand binding induces complex formation and initiates downstream signaling cascades almost all studies examining trem2 signaling have provoked trem2 dimerization using antibody-mediated crosslinking to induce signaling 136 however there is also evidence that trem2 can associate with other receptors including plexina1 273 274 other studies are suggestive that trem2 could also bind to treml1 236 through co-ip experiments or csf1r due to their close linkage in network analyses 101 and the strong commonalities in their downstream pathways 222 275 while these last two interactions remain to be validated it is certainly possible that trem2 also acts through these alternative heteromeric complexes whether this is regulated by the cell type or context and whether this is an important role of trem2 endogenously in the context of ndds remain to be determinedthe biological roles of strem2 have been controversial initially strem2 was postulated to act as a decoy receptor opposing full-length trem2 function a soluble version of a closely related trem family member strem1 modeled by a trem1-fc fusion protein competes with its membrane-bound form to block trem1 signaling 276 and produces opposing effects on inflammation and survival following lps injection in mice 277 soluble trem2 may similarly act as a decoy receptor to negatively modulate trem2 signaling 198 225 in support of this in vitro a chimeric trem2-fc protein used to model soluble trem2 inhibited osteoclastogenesis a process that requires trem2-dap12 signaling 278recent studies suggest that strem2 may have its own biological function exogenously applied strem2 was internalized by cultured bone marrow derived macrophages and promoted survival in cells lacking trem2 expression 149 however strem2 failed to rescue phagocytosis in trem2 deficient bone marrow macrophages in culture 279 recent data also demonstrate that treatment of microglial cell lines with trem2-fc or a hek-cell produced strem2 peptide increases survival in line with full-length trem2 function 14 this study also found that strem2 strongly induced an inflammatory response in culture models of microglia these data suggest that there are important biological roles of strem2 other than acting as a decoy for the full-length trem2 receptor the mechanisms underlying strem2 function are not yet well understood but interestingly does not require the presence of full-length trem2 or its intracellular adaptor dap12 14the signaling role of trem2 ctfs is also starting to be explored in the absence of -secretase activity membrane-associated trem2 ctfs have been proposed to either promote trem2 anti-inflammatory signaling in response to lps 280 or impair trem2 signaling by sequestering dap12 from interacting with full-length receptors 230 reducing dap12 phosphorylation and downstream plc activation 230 232 along with trem2-mediated phagocytosis 232 production or stabilization of ctfs on the membrane may also provide a point of cross-talk through which trem2 could modulate the signaling of other dap12-associated receptors it is clear that further study will be necessary to gain insight into how these soluble trem2 products impact signaling both of trem2 and other pathways critical to innate immunitywhile trem2 expression and signaling are context-dependent there are some commonalities in trem2 function that have been found across the diverse cell types and environments in which it has been studied fig 4 one of which is regulating myeloid cell number the impact of trem2 on myeloid cell number outside of the context of disease or stimulus is not completely clear while knocking down trem2 in primary microglia lead to reduced cell number 106 it had no effect on osteoclasts derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs from plosl trem2 e14x carriers lacking trem2 expression 19 and microglial numbers were the same up to 1 year of age in mouse models lacking trem2 expression however crosslinking trem2 did promote an increase in osteoclast number in culture 143 what is clear is that trem2 has an effect on increasing myeloid cell number in response to inflammation or disease trem2 deficiency was shown to prevent increases in the brain myeloid cell populations in response to traumatic brain injury 98 ischemia 160 193 aging 196 and in the initial response to demyelination 196 though it did increase the number of cells in a model of sepsis 170trem2 deficiency also prevented local increases in myeloid cells around plaques in ad amyloid plaques are typically surrounded by a rapidly recruited 281 282 cluster of activated myeloid cells in ad human brain tissue 283 284 and in ad mouse models 285 recent evidence demonstrates reduced myeloid cell accumulation around amyloid plaques in trem2 hemizygous 222 258 286 and trem2- 145 162 222 258 287 and dap12-deficient 258 ad mouse models as well as in postmortem ad human brain tissue from individuals harboring the trem2 r47h variant 60 these data illustrate that trem2 and its adaptor protein dap12 are required for myeloid cell accumulation around amyloid plaques while wang and colleagues 145 222 found that trem2 deficient ad mice had a decrease in total brain myeloid cells others found that this was primarily driven by the specific loss of plaque-associated myeloid cells 258 287 together this suggests that trem2 is important for myeloid cell expansion in response to disease evidence suggests that in various contexts trem2 is important for myeloid cell survival proliferation and chemotaxis all of which could lead to disease-associated increases in myeloid cell numbertrem2 has been shown in multiple contexts to be important for cell survival osteoclasts 261 and bone marrow derived macrophages 149 from trem2 deficient mice and liver cancer 186 and glioma cell lines 183 in which trem2 was knocked down had increased levels of caspase 3 bcl-2-associated x protein bax annexin v and tunel positivity all suggesting that trem2 deficiency enhanced apoptosis similarly primary microglia and the bv2 microglial cell line with reduced trem2 expression had decreased survival along with decreased levels of elements of the survival-related wnt-catenin pathway 13 conversely trem2 activation through receptor crosslinking increased survival of monocyte-derived dendritic cells 136 and osteoclasts 260 in culture microglia derived from trem2 deficient mice did not show more cell death at baseline but when levels of csf1 an important factor for the maintenance of microglial survival were reduced trem2 deficient microglia were more likely to undergo apoptosis 222 this was also found to be the case in bone marrow derived macrophages 149 in an ad mouse model trem2 deficiency also increased the number of plaque-associated myeloid cells which were tunel 222 taken together these studies suggest that trem2 is protective against apoptosis especially under stressful cellular conditionstrem2 may also increase cell number through promoting myeloid cell proliferation in glioma cell lines 183 liver cancer cell lines 186 and primary microglia 13 reduced levels of trem2 led to cell cycle arrest the number of proliferating myeloid cells were also decreased in vivo in response to demyelination 288 colonic mucosal injury 189 and in ad mouse models 145 287 lacking trem2 expression while the mechanisms of this regulation of proliferation are not clear trem2 deficiency in cultured osteoclast precursors prevented csf1-mediated proliferation 261 a process also critical for proliferation of many macrophage populations including brain myeloid cells it has been suggested that trem2 may interact with the csf-1 receptor to mediate these effects in dendritic cells derived from plosl patient pbmcs expressing q33x and v126g trem2 variants gene expression profiling identified negative regulation of proliferation as a genetic pathway which was significantly increased in variant carriers compared to controls 135 in addition to being important for directing proliferation of the cells in which its expressed trem2 might also promote a myeloid cell phenotype that directs proliferation of other cells in the surrounding microenvironment trem2 is highly upregulated during organogenesis when macrophages release factors to promote proliferation of surrounding cells 137 in tumor associated macrophages where analogous macrophage-driven trophic support occurs 183 and following cns trauma where myeloid cells serve as an important source of neurotrophic support during tissue repair 289 interestingly trem2 is strongly upregulated by neural stem cells 290 and esc-derived oligodendroglial precursors 291 a relationship between trem2 expression and neurogenesis has not yet been explored but given the influence of trem2 of proliferation on other cell types this may warrant further examinationtrem2 may also influence cell differentiation differentiation was impaired in osteoclasts derived from plosl patients expressing trem2 variants 19 and in raw macrophages deficient for trem2 through a plexina1-dependent pathway 274 however otero and colleagues 261 demonstrated that mouse-derived trem2 deficient preosteoclasts differentiated into osteoclasts faster though the role of trem2 in cell differentiation is not completely clear this step in cell phenotype determination may also contribute to the changes in cell numbers and population observed in the context of trem2 deficiencyanother potential contributor to trem2s role in expanding the myeloid cell population in the context of disease or inflammation is by modulating chemotaxis or migration of these cells in culture knocking down trem2 reduced chemotaxis of glioma cells in a boydon chamber assay in response to serum 183 and in the bv2 microglial cell line in a scratch assay 158 microglia from trem2 deficient brain slices exhibited reduced chemotaxis into co-cultured brain tissue from old or ad mouse models 292 in addition trem2 deficient mice had fewer microglia migrate to the site of apoptotic neuron injection in the brain and had slower process extension toward a brain laser lesion as measured using two photon microscopy 292 conversely trem2 crosslinking increased ccr7-dependent chemotaxis 136 139 143 trem2 was also found to be co-enriched with genes involved in purinergic signaling a key pathway directing microglial chemotaxis in network analyses 101 though whether trem2 regulates p2r-receptor mediated chemotaxis has not been examined experimentally however others did not see a deficit in chemotaxis in plosl patient-derived osteoclasts 19 kiialainen and colleagues 135 found that pbmcs cultured from patients with plosl-associated trem2 variants had both up- and down-regulated components of the chemotactic response it may be that different components of the chemotactic pathway and therefore different types of chemotaxis are differentially regulated by trem2studies have examined the effect of trem2 on specific chemotactic pathways that are involved in tissue infiltration by myeloid cells wang and colleagues 183 found that trem2 deficient glioma cell lines downregulated cxcl10 cxcr3 mmp2 and mmp9 which are all important in tissue invasion in network analyses trem2 was significantly co-enriched with dock2 and dock8 which are involved in tissue transmigration 101 and mice deficient for trem2 had reduced leukocyte infiltration following experimental induction of colitis 190 there was also decreased neutrophil recruitment to mouse lungs in response to bacterial infection in trem2 deficient mice 173 in vitro cells lacking trem2 expression had reduced chemotaxis toward ccl2 292 mice lacking dap12 were found to have significantly reduced recruitment of peripheral macrophages in vivo in response to cigarette smoke or intranasal c-c motif chemokine ligand 2 ccl2 administration and these dap12-chemotactic deficits were found to be rescued by reintroducing a trem2-dap12 fusion construct 141 trem2 deficient mice also had reduced levels of ccl2 292 and fewer peripheral immune cells in their brain following middle cerebral artery occlusion mcao 193 there was a trend toward a correlation between ccl2 and strem2 levels in the csf of human ad patients which may suggest that trem2 plays a role in mediating ccl2-mediated chemotaxis of cells in the context of ad as well however other studies have found no link between trem2 and monocyte trafficking into inflammatory tissues 149 future studies will be necessary to assess which chemotactic pathways are influenced by trem2 and whether that includes pathways related to peripheral immune cell infiltration into the cns in nddsa well-characterized function of trem2 is to enhance phagocytosis trem2 is expressed in a subset of myeloid cells within the cns that have high phagocytic capacity 215 across numerous in vitro studies loss of trem2 results in reduced phagocytosis of a variety of substrates including apoptotic neurons or neuronal cell lines 95 139 153 160 bone 19 293 bacteria and bacterial products 170 225 237 249 and lipids 94 129 conversely trem2 activation or overexpression enhanced uptake of these substrates 139 159 214 trem2 expression correlated with a40 uptake in bv2 cells in which trem2 was knocked down or overexpressed 158 a42 uptake was also reduced in trem2 deficient primary microglia 214 225 and in the n9 microglial cell line expressing a non-functional trem2 when plated onto brain slices from ad mouse models 279 in agreement with these findings in vivo trem2 deficient mice have reduced localization of a within cd68 phagosomes in ad mouse models 258 and reduced uptake of deposited a three hours after injection into the brain 145 together these findings suggest that trem2 is important for a uptake by brain myeloid cells however in culture trem2 expression was no longer found to correlate with a uptake after pretreatment of cells with lps 158 a similar effect was observed in a mouse model of sepsis where injection of myeloid cells overexpressing trem2 enhanced bacterial phagocytosis and survival but not if the mice were pretreated with lps 180 these findings suggest that the mechanisms of trem2-dependent phagocytosis can be modified by other signals in the microenvironment interestingly the other modulatory components present in the brain microenvironment change throughout the course of ndds which could explain some of the differences in trem2 function at different stages of disease progression outside of ad trem2 is important for clearance of myelin in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis eae 159 and peri-infarct tissue in mice following mcao 160 however it does appear that the effect of trem2 on phagocytosis can be cell type specific sharif and colleagues 173 found that bone marrow macrophages derived from trem2 deficient mice had reduced phagocytosis but trem2 deficient alveolar macrophages had increased uptake of bacteria in vitro and in vivo r62h 94 and r47h trem2 variants had impaired phagocytosis 240 this was also true in hek cells transfected with trem2-dap12 fusion constructs expressing r47h t66m and y38c variants 225 interestingly while all of these variants impaired uptake of polystyrene beads t66m and y38c but not r47h impaired uptake of e coli particles 225 suggesting that different trem2 variants could affect recognition of specific phagocytic substrates as well as induce changes in basal phagocytic activity reflected in the fluid phase uptake of beads more studies will be required to parse out the role of trem2 in basal phagocytosis and cargo-driven phagocytosis of specific substratesthe mechanism underlying trem2-dependent uptake of various substrates is not clear while transfection of a trem2-dap12 construct into cho cells was shown to be sufficient for uptake of neuro2a cells 153 it may be that trem2 does not have to directly bind to its phagocytic substrates as trem2 binding to hsp60 was sufficient to increase phagocytosis of bacteria 249 if trem2 does not directly bind to these substrates then it must interact with other phagocytic pathways it is possible that trem2 impacts fluid-phase phagocytosis rather than cargo driven phagocytosis trem2 may also interact with other phagocytic receptors for example mertk is essential for the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells 294 and is upregulated on the same cell population as trem2 in ad 213 network analyses have also shown that trem2 is co-enriched with genes involved in fcr and complement-mediated phagocytosis 101 in support of an association between trem2 and fc-dependent phagocytic pathways stimulating cells lacking trem2 function with an antibody against the desired phagocytic substrate did increase internalization of the substrate but did not rescue it back to wt levels 279 trem2 deficient alveolar macrophages were found to increase phagocytosis and this was found to be dependent on the upregulation of first component of complement q c1q in these cells 173 which acts to opsonize phagocytic substrates it may also be that strem2 plays a role in binding and directing phagocytosis of substrates by these other pathways as adam inhibitors reduced strem2 production and decreased phagocytosis of e coli 225some have also suggested that these findings may reflect changes in degradation of phagocytic substrates rather than their uptake forabosco and colleagues 101 found that genes associated with lysosome activity were co-enriched with trem2 across the brain and in monocyte-derived macrophages in plosl patients there is an accumulation of large cd68 myeloid cells suggesting that phagocytic uptake by these cells may be intact 25 in a cuprizone model of demyelination trem2 deficiency was found not to impair uptake of myelin debris but that this debris remained in cells longer than in controls suggesting that degradation was specifically impaired 288 this was also found to be true in trem2 deficient macrophages which were able to take up bacteria at comparable levels to cells expressing wt trem2 but were unable to kill and degrade them 263 however jiang and colleagues 214 found that in primary microglia in which trem2 was knocked down a42 degradation was unaffected together the exact role of trem2 in phagocytosis and other means of cellular uptake and degradation of substrates from the microenvironment remain unclear though it clearly does play an important role in these processestrem2 interacts with many other inflammation-related pathways while trem2 has been touted as being anti-inflammatory it seems that the interaction between trem2 and other inflammation related pathways is actually more complex depending on the precise stimuli the strength 260 and duration 4 over which they are presented the cell type and the context trem2 can play different roles in the inflammatory response in support of this network analyses found that trem2 was co-enriched with both classically pro- and anti-inflammatory gene clusters in the brain 101 likewise a microarray analysis of macrophages derived from a plosl patient pbmcs showed components of the inflammatory response and innate immune response were both up- and down-regulated respectively relative to controls 135 outside of the context of injury or disease the transcriptional profiles of trem2 deficient 222 or overexpressing 214 myeloid cells compared to controls was fairly similar it is in the context of disease where trem2 seems to heavily influence changes in inflammation-related pathwaystrem2 has been classically described as being anti-inflammatory and several in vitro and in vivo studies are supportive of an anti-inflammatory role for trem2 in certain contexts knocking down trem2 in cell lines increases levels of proinflammatory mediators such as inos tnf il1 and il6 240 in response to apoptotic neuronal membrane components 139 tlr ligands 168 including lps 159 169 170 280 and a42 157 a transient knock down of trem2 in the p301s tau model and in the samp8 model of accelerated aging also increased inflammatory cytokine production 201 216 trem2 deficiency also resulted in increased levels of ifn tnf and inos 189 following colonic mucosal injury and trem2 knockdown or antibody-mediated inhibition increased expression of many inflammation-related cytokines following corneal infection 182 moreover overexpressing trem2 in cell lines amyloid 214 and tau models of ad 295 reduced levels of these pro-inflammatory transcripts together these studies suggest that in some contexts trem2 can attenuate inflammatory responseshowever many other studies also support that trem2 can mediate or amplify inflammatory responses for instance trem2 knockdown impaired ros production 246 263 trem2 deficient microglia are more ramified in culture a morphological signature of reduced activation 160 trem2 deficient ad mouse models have reduced levels of inflammation-related transcripts in both unbiased rna sequencing approaches 222 and in the genes il1 and il6 in targeted analyses 162 287 plaque-associated cells in ad mouse models deficient 222 or haploinsufficient 286 for trem2 also had decreased cell soma size surface area and increased process length indicative of reduced activation 222 recent work using single cell sequencing approaches indicates that trem2 is required specifically for a second phase of the myeloid cell response in ad which allows cells to fully adopt a neurodegeneration-associated phenotype 296 this may be true in diverse disease contexts as pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were also reduced in trem2 deficient mice following traumatic brain injury 98 ischemia 193 lung infection 149 173 and demyelination 196 where trem2 deficient brain myeloid cells exhibited a less activated morphology 288 conversely activation of trem2 in a macrophage cell line increased no release 136 agonizing trem2 following spinal nerve transection increased tnf and il1 194 and overexpression of trem2 increased expression of il6 tnf and mcp1 in mouse adipose tissue 129 because these studies examined gene expression in whole tissue it is not clear whether these changes are due to changes in immune cell phenotype or alteration in cell number in the affected tissues however taken together these findings clearly indicate that trem2 can also promote inflammatory responses in certain contexts this body of data strongly opposes the often-cited descriptor of trem2 as an anti-inflammatory receptor future studies will be required to delineate the molecular and environmental determinants that govern how trem2 contributes to the inflammatory response in different contextswhile the number of studies have been limited trem2 variants associated with ndds also seem to have mixed effects on inflammatory responses the r47h variant impaired inflammatory responses in bv2 cells 240 yet r47h carriers with ad had increased expression of genes related to inflammatory pathways compared to non-carriers 57 a variant within intron 2 of trem2 which is prevalent in african american individuals was found to be significantly associated with levels of c-reactive protein crp a systemic marker of inflammation whose expression is primarily driven by il6 and il1 110 however it is not clear whether this represents a direct relationship between this trem2 variant and systemic inflammationin addition to impacting the inflammatory responses of myeloid cells trem2 also seems to be able to indirectly feedback onto the inflammatory response in other cells within the microenvironment including astrocytes astrocytosis measured by glial fibrillary acid protein gfap levels was reduced across all stages of pathology examined in trem2 deficient ad mouse models 162 287 in areas of active demyelination 288 and trended toward a reduction in gfap area in mice following ischemia 160 however gfap levels were unchanged in trem2 deficient mice at acute and chronic time points following traumatic brain injury 98 suggesting that trem2 must work in tandem with context-dependent signals to alter astrocyte activation one of the characteristic features of plosl is astrocytosis 22 and in a plosl patient with a trem2 variant gfap levels were significantly increased in frontal lobe tissue 28 this suggests that trem2 can play multiple roles in regulating astrocyte activation depending on the precise contextwhile regulating cell number phagocytosis and inflammation are the best studied roles for trem2 other studies have suggested additional roles for the receptor such as regulation of synaptic pruning and monitoring of synaptic function 297 because of the cross-talk between trem2 and complement pathways and a clear role of trem2 and complement in phagocytosis in disease 298 it would be of interest to assess whether trem2 influences synaptic function by modulating synaptic pruning either normally during development or aberrantly in the context of ndds others have suggested that due to the close apposition of trem2 cells to oligodendrocyte precursors during development they may support their function 154 trem2 has also been shown to be important for angiogenesis following stroke 160 because of trem2s proposed lipid-related ligands and the strong links between lipid metabolism and ndds it would not be surprising if trem2 also played roles in this pathway in support of this lipid metabolism was the most strongly altered pathway in trem2 deficient mouse brains following cuprizone-induced demyelination 288 how trem2 affects these normal functions within the brain has not been studied but may represent important future areas of investigationoutside of the brain studies have proposed additional roles for the trem2 receptor trem2 has been proposed to play a role in adaptive immunity myeloid cells expressing higher levels of trem2 were able to increase t cell proliferation better than those expressing lower trem2 levels 158 trem2 was also found to be co-enriched with genes related to adaptive immunity in gene network analyses 101 however others have found that activating trem2 through crosslinking did not upregulate molecules involved in antigen presentation 159 299 suggesting that trem2-mediated stimulation of adaptive immune responses may be indirect or require additional environmental factors trem2 also seems to be important for cell maturation 136 and in particular multinucleation of osteoclasts 19 143 293 it is not yet known how trem2 might mediate these additional functionsthe observed changes in trem2 expression signaling and function with disease-associated genetic variants ultimately translate to changes in ndd pathology many studies have focused on how trem2 and disease-associated variants impact ad-related pathologies studies examining loss of trem2 function in amyloid mouse models initially appeared to support contradictory conclusions some groups found that trem2 deficiency reduced 162 258 while others found that it increased 222 amyloid pathology however recent evidence has harmonized these results by demonstrating that trem2 deficiency has a changing role throughout ad progression reducing amyloid pathology early but increasing it at later stages of disease 287 studies overexpressing trem2 in ad mouse models also found a temporal effect of this overexpression which reduced pathology early in disease progression 214 but no effect at a later time point 300 this is supported by korvatska and colleagues 60 who demonstrate accelerated disease progression in r47h carriers compared to non-carriers with ad this may also explain discrepancies in human studies of r47h carriers who found no association between r47h carriers and non-carriers in amyloid deposition 49 and others who found that r47h carriers had significantly more plaques compared with non-carriers 57 this changing role for trem2 throughout progression of amyloid pathology may also reflect a dynamic role for myeloid cells themselves as hickman and el khoury 11 posit these brain myeloid cells may be protective early through clearance of a but detrimental later in disease progression when they enhance the inflammatory response without being effective phagocytes alternatively it could reflect how trem2 impacts the phenotype and abundance of distinct myeloid cell subsets or perhaps other microenvironmental cues which change trem2 downstream signaling to favor alternative pathways while mouse models so far have recapitulated several aspects of trem2 localization and function observed in human brain tissue it is worth noting that there is a caveat to studying trem2 in mouse models of ad with psen mutations since -secretase is also important for trem2 ctf cleavage 232 it is not clear whether changes in -secretase activity would be likely to greatly alter trem2 function in vivo but this should be a consideration when interpreting these studiesinterestingly there also appears to be a difference in the mechanism by which trem2 affects pathology early and late in disease progression early trem2 deficiency decreases the number of plaques while later in disease progression increase in pathology is instead driven by increased plaque size 287 while its not clear exactly how trem2 could modulate a proteostasis early in disease progression to impact plaque number trem2 was shown to impact app processing in a genome-wide sirna screen 301 though since it is not neuronally expressed this would likely occur through indirectly altering neuronal phenotype conversely later in disease the association of myeloid cells with plaques has been proposed to limit plaque growth by forming an insulated microenvironment or barrier 258 302 trem2 deficiency appears to impede the formation of this barrier and in doing so cause a shift from compact to diffuse plaques 258trem2 has also been studied in ad in the context of modifying neuritic dystrophy several studies have found increased neuritic dystrophy around plaques in trem2 deficient mice 145 258 and in human r47h carriers with ad 57 trem2 overexpression in 7-month but not 18-month-old appps1 mice had increased levels of synaptophysin suggesting that enhanced trem2 expression may protect against a-driven synapse loss 157 300 one possible mechanism for this lies in the larger more diffuse plaques with high soluble a affinity 258 observed in trem2 deficient mice late in disease progression 287 the relative toxicity of soluble a is well documented including its roles in blocking long-term potentiation 303 and inducing tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation 304 305 together these data suggest that functional trem2 is necessary for microglial clustering around amyloid plaques and may thereby form a barrier around plaques which limits neuritic dystrophy however not all data support a protective role of plaque-associated myeloid cells on ad pathology microglia can serve as synaptotoxic agents in ad through complement-mediated synaptic pruning 298 in this way the loss of plaque-associated myeloid cells due to trem2 deficiency could be beneficial others suggest that it may not be that more dystrophic neurites are formed around plaques in trem2 deficient mice and r47h carriers but that trem2 deficient myeloid cells are not as effective at clearing them 215 further evidence will be required to assess the formation and clearance of dystrophic neurites across stages of ad in the context of trem2 deficiency or trem2 variants to assess these possible mechanismsthe impact of trem2 on tau pathology in ad has also been examined the effect of trem2 on phosphorylated tau p-tau accumulation in dystrophic neurites in ad is not clear with some studies showing an increase 145 222 and others showing a decrease 162 in hyperphosphorylated tau markers surrounding plaques in trem2 deficient amyloid mouse models of ad these different outcomes are likely related to disease progression dependent effects on the amyloid pathology driving this accumulation less work has been done in tau models of ad but overexpressing trem2 under the cd11b promoter in the p301s tau model of ad resulted in reduced hyperphosphorylated tau levels coordinate with a decrease in activation of two of the known tau kinases cyclin dependent kinase 5 cdk5 and gsk3 295 opposite effects were observed in p301s mice in which trem2 was knocked down 216 in humans trem2 protein levels in the temporal cortex of ad patients correlated with tangle score and paired helical filament phf levels 164 and strem2 levels in csf are correlated with csf tau levels early in clinical ad progression 202 suggesting an important relationship between trem2 and tau pathology in humans r47h patients had higher levels of csf p-tau 53 61 and a variant located upstream of trem2 was associated with increased tau pathology in the brain 109 together these findings suggest that trem2 variants may also have an impact on tau-related pathologies in ad though the mechanisms governing this association are less clearstudies have also examined how trem2 and its variants impact neuronal and tissue loss and cognition in ad trem2 protein levels in the temporal cortex of ad patients were positively correlated with cleaved caspase 3 and negatively correlated with the presynaptic marker snap25 164 suggestive that loss of trem2 could impact synapse pathology there was also a significant reduction in neurons in layer v of the cortex in trem2 deficient amyloid models of ad 222 and a substantial rescue of neuronal loss when trem2 was overexpressed in amyloid 157 and tau 295 ad mouse models these changes in neuron number also correlated with a rescue in behavioral deficits 157 295 interestingly however trem2 expression levels on peripheral monocytes correlated with lower mmse 128 and moca scores as well as reduced gray matter volume 148 r47h variant carriers with ad also had reduced gray matter volume 63 in the temporal cortex and hippocampus 61 there was also a trend toward a reduction in hippocampal volume 306 and significant decreases in other brain regions 63 in r47h carriers even in the absence of clinical ad though no changes in cognitive function were reported in middle-aged r47h carriers 307 the variant did correlate with cognitive deficits in older adults with r47h variants 6 this was also true in healthy individuals heterozygous for nhd variants 308 these findings suggest that trem2 variants may have direct effects on neuronal loss even in the absence of ad pathologyalthough not as extensively studied as in ad the impact of trem2 on other ndd-related pathologies has also been assessed plosl patients have severe white matter dystrophy 22 and oligodendrocytes that survive in plosl patient white matter express markers of cell stress 309 suggesting a role for trem2 deficiency in white matter degeneration in cuprizone-mediated demyelination models trem2 deficiency impaired recovery and increased levels of axonal degeneration markers 288 289 in addition injecting mice with trem2 transduced myeloid cell precursors prevented eae-induced demyelination and ameliorated motor phenotypes 159 in addition to affecting oligodendrocyte survival and recovery following demyelination trem2 variants in plosl have also elucidated other roles of trem2 in ndds plosl patients often experience seizures 22 310 resulting in excitotoxicity one patient with a predicted loss-of-function trem2 plosl mutation had a reduction in many synaptic components including nine gaba receptor subunits which could play a role in mediating this enhanced excitability 28 however the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is not well understood and requires further studytrem2 has also been shown to modify tissue loss and behavior in several neuroinflammatory contexts trem2 deficiency reduced hippocampal volume loss and improved some behavioral outcomes at chronic time points following traumatic brain injury 98 in contrast trem2 deficient mice had increased infarct volume in one mcao model 160 though no change in another study 193 treatment with a trem2 agonist induced pain behavior in mice in a dap12-dependent manner even in the absence of nerve injury 194 outside of the brain trem2 deficiency results in increased body weight and glucose and insulin intolerance in mice fed a high fat diet 129 trem2 variant carriers may also have increased risk of systemic infection 311 and trem2 deficiency is detrimental in the context of bacterial infection 149 170 180 263 overall in the brain and the periphery despite great advances in assessing how trem2 alters pathology there is still no clear picture of how trem2 mediates these diverse functional impacts across inflammatory and disease contexts this will require a greater understanding of trem2 expression signaling and function and how these features change in the context of pathology while these studies do point toward some common mechanisms by which trem2 might modify aspects of pathology relevant to multiple ndds it is clear that the role of trem2 in ndds is not simplesince the identification of ndd-associated trem2 variants and the detection of strem2 in the csf and plasma of ad patients there has been much excitement about how this may translate into immune-related ndd biomarkers and therapeutics elevated levels of strem2 were first detected in the csf of patients with multiple sclerosis ms and other inflammatory neurologic diseases 312 and were found to be significantly elevated in ms patients 313 these findings served as an impetus to examine whether csf strem2 might also be changed in ad patients groups have reported elevations 314 reductions 225 or non-significant changes 203 in csf strem2 in ad cohorts not stratified by disease stage table 1 however as shown in table 1 studies that did divide subjects by stage of disease progression csf strem2 levels were found to be significantly higher in patients with ad-related mild cognitive impairment 202 315 316 and mild dementia 202 225 compared to controls and ad cases 202 cross-sectional studies in patients with dominantly inherited ad confirmed a significant increase in csf strem2 starting 5 years before expected onset of clinical dementia but found no significant differences between ad patients and controls beyond 5 years after symptom onset 12 together these studies suggest a specific elevation in csf strem2 levels in the early symptomatic stages of ad interestingly strem2 was also found to be significantly elevated specifically in early stages of als pathology before returning to baseline at late stages of disease 317 while its not clear whether these disease-stage dependent effects are due to a common mechanism it will be interesting to see whether this pattern continues to be consistent across ndds
the detection and reported changes with disease progression in csf levels of strem2 have raised questions of its origin and biological meaning in health and disease in ad patients csf strem2 was not associated with changes in csf a42 86 202 314 316 but positively correlated with csf biomarkers total tau 86 202 and phosphorylated tau 202 314 316 including in cross-sectional cohorts with dominantly inherited ad 202 several groups have proposed that csf strem2 levels may signify microglial activation in response to ad-related pathology 86 202 313 314 316 evidence of csf strem2 positively correlating with glial protein ykl-40 in csf 314 316 another proposed ad immune biomarker in addition to immunosuppressive agents causing a reduction in csf strem2 levels 313 are consistent with this theory changes in strem2 appear to be independent of apoe4 status 318320 further work assessing how strem2 generation changes with microglial phenotype will be needed to definitively validate strem2 as an indicator of microglial activation a recent clinical study proposes a neuroprotective role for strem2 reporting higher gray matter volume in areas susceptible to ad pathology for mild cognitive impairment mci and ad patients with high csf strem2 levels 316 though this correlation was not found in all studies higher levels of csf strem2 at late stages of als also correlated with longer survival 317 these findings in combination with the positive correlation between csf tau and strem2 could indicate that elevated strem2 production occurs as a protective response to neurodegeneration though there is no definitive consensus yet as to the biological significance of strem2the current data on strem2 illustrate limitations for its use as an ndd biomarker several ndds including ms ad and ftd are associated with elevated strem2 in csf 86 314 suggestive of a common innate immune mechanism in these distinct pathologies it has also been suggested as a biomarker for welding fume exposure 142 and as discussed above can be regulated in many other inflammation-related contexts this lack of disease and context specificity in strem2 changes raises concerns for its utility as a diagnostic tool for ad recent data show csf strem2 levels are altered differentially throughout ad progression these observations raise questions about its utility as a diagnostic readout for ad disease status in diverse neurologic cohorts though does suggest that strem2 levels could be helpful in identifying stage of ad in coordination with other biomarkers 321 moreover heslegrave and colleagues 314 acknowledged that strem2 levels in ad patients and controls while significantly different substantially overlap thereby further limiting its diagnostic utility transcriptome-based studies found dysregulation of several innate immune genes in blood from ad patients 320 which led others to assess whether trem2 expression might also be changed in blood while studies did find a correlation between trem2 expression on blood monocytes and an ad diagnosis 128 strem2 in plasma was shown to not correlate with csf strem2 levels 86 and plasma samples yielded non-significant differences in strem2 of ad and ftd patients compared to healthy controls 86 225 while strem2 alone does have clear limitations as a biomarker it may have a potential application as part of a biomarker panel to assess the immune response in ad and other neurodegenerative diseasesin addition to its potential as a biomarker many have suggested that trem2-directed therapeutics may prove to be a novel target for ndds there are several factors to consider in developing trem2 therapeutics first while trem2 variants confer as strong a risk for developing ad as one copy of the apoe4 allele the minor allele frequency of trem2 variants are substantially lower with less than 1 for trem2 to approximately 20 for apoe4 7 55 thus though some have suggested that therapeutics might want to restore wt trem2 function in these variant carriers as a potential therapeutic correcting trem2 variants are not likely to be a broadly applicable therapeutic approach rather studying trem2 variants that confer risk for ndds will illuminate components of the immune response centrally important in immune modulation of pathology and serve as a prerequisite to developing targeted immune-directed therapeutics so far the field has identified potential changing roles for immune cell function throughout progression of ad and possibly identified a key role for peripherally derived immune cells in ad pathology which would greatly aid in therapeutically targeting the immune cells relevant to ad pathologycommon functions of trem2 have been identified across multiple ndds which suggest therapeutic targets could be relevant to multiple disease contexts however we have not found a simple explanation for what trem2 does across cell types and contexts based on its disease progression dependent effects it does not appear that simply activating or inhibiting trem2 would be beneficial even in the context of ad there may also be sex-dependent effects of trem2 as some 86 but not all 202 have shown differences in strem2 levels in csf between male and female subjects likewise a trem2 variant was associated with markers of systemic inflammation specifically in women not men and was hormone-independent 110 with the lack of strong biomarkers to stage ndds and the variability in clinical progression among patients it is not likely that increasing or decreasing trem2 will be the universal solution to ndd pathologiesrather understanding when where and how trem2 is working is more likely to provide insights into immune function that can be modulated throughout disease progression however the emphasis on understanding trem2 in ndds began just 4 years ago and we still have a long way to go to understand trem2s expression signaling function and effects on these various pathologies it will also be essential to start to dissect how the diverse array of trem2 variants result in ndd risk while this understanding of trem2 variants may not directly translate into trem2-directed biomarkers or therapeutics at this time the insight into how the immune system actively participates in ndd pathology promises to provide many avenues for a new class of immune-directed therapeutic targets for nddsthe disease fip was first described in 1963 as a syndrome in cats characterized by immune-mediated vasculitis and pyogranulomatous inflammatory reactions 24 in 1978 a virus was identified as the etiologic agent and in 1979 it was classified as a coronavirus labeled feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv 25 fip has become an increasingly important disease for veterinarians and must now be considered to account for most infectious disease-related deaths in pet cats thus taking over this title in recent years from feline leukemia virus felv infection which is decreasing in prevalence and importance a possible explanation for an increase in the prevalence of fip is that management of domestic cats has changed 20 with the introduction of litter boxes more cats are kept permanently indoors exposing them to large doses of fcov in the feces that would previously have been buried outdoors more and more cats are spending part of their life in crowded environments such as at cat breeders or shelters which increases their stress and exposure to fcov while in such an environment 26coronaviruses can cause harmless and mostly clinically inapparent enteral infections in cats but they can also cause fip in earlier days it was the common hypothesis that two different coronaviruses existed in cats the feline enteric coronavirus fecv and the fipv since then it has become known that fipv develops out of fecv spontaneously within the infected cat both viruses are identical with regard to their antigenetic properties and with the exception of a single mutation their genetic properties but they are different with regard to their pathogenicity this is why only the term feline coronavirus fcov should be used to describe all coronaviruses in catsfcov is an rna virus and belongs to the genus coronavirus of the family coronaviridae coronaviruses are pleomorphic enveloped particles that average 100 nm in diameter range 60120 nm and contain single-stranded rna characteristic petal-shaped projections called peplomers range 1224 nm protrude from the viral surface 29 these peplomers are responsible for the crown-like corona appearance of the virus when visualized under the electron microscope which led to the term coronavirus the peplomer proteins are used for virus attachment to cellular surface proteins which act as receptors for the virus they are shaped so that they can bind specifically to topical enterocytes replication of nonmutated fcov is thus primarily restricted to enterocytes the mutated fip-causing fcov has a broader cell spectrum including macrophagesfcov belongs to the same taxonomic cluster of coronaviruses as transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev porcine respiratory coronavirus canine coronavirus ccv 16 30 31 32 and some human coronaviruses 33 in many species of animals coronaviruses have a relatively restricted organ tropism mainly infecting respiratory or gastrointestinal cells 34 in cats and mice however coronavirus infections can under certain circumstances involve several organs coronaviruses have a relatively low species specificity ccv that can cause diarrhea in dogs is closely related to fcov and can also infect cats after contact with ccv-containing dog feces cats develop antibodies that cross-react with fcov one ccv strain induced diarrhea in laboratory cats after experimental infection in a cat infected with another ccv strain histologic changes identical to changes typically seen in enteral fcov infection were detected in one study ccv even caused fip 35depending on their antigenetic relation to ccv fcov strains can be classified into the subtypes serotype i and serotype ii antibodies against ccv neutralize fcov serotype ii but not fcov serotype i fcov serotype ii strains are genetically more closely related to ccv than are fcov serotype i strains and fcov serotype ii strains seem to have arisen by recombination between fcov serotype i strains and ccv 19 21 32 aside from the different degree of neutralization by antisera to ccv serotypes i and ii are different in their growth characteristics in cell culture and in their cytopathogenicity in vitro fcov serotype i strains are difficult to grow in cell culture and cause a slowly developing cytopathogenic effect fcov serotype ii strains however grow more rapidly and produce a pronounced cytopathogenic effect 36 serotype i is the more prevalent serotype in field infections between 70 and 95 of isolated fcov strains in the field in the united states and europe belong to serotype i in japan however serotype ii predominates 19 37 most cats with fip are infected with fcov serotype i both serotypes can cause fip however and both can cause clinically inapparent fcov infections 38fcov is distributed worldwide in household and wild cats 27 28 the virus is endemic especially in environments in which many cats are kept together in a small space eg catteries shelters pet stores there is virtually no multiple-cat household without endemic fcov at least 50 of cats in the united states and europe have antibodies against coronaviruses in switzerland 80 of breeding cats and 50 of free-roaming cats tested positive for antibodies in great britain 82 of show cats 53 of cats in breeding institutions and 15 of cats in single-cat households had antibodies 8 27 fcov is relatively rare in free-roaming ownerless cats because stray cats are usually loners without close contact with each other most importantly they do not use the same locations for dumping their feces which is the major route of transmission in multiple-cat households in a study in gainesville florida 250 adult feral cats in a trap-neuter-return program were tested for antibodies to coronavirus 88 of the sera were negative confirming that most of these cats were not infected 39 in another study feral cats were tested at the time they were brought into local shelters in which multiple cats were kept together and at 1-to 2-week intervals thereafter at the time of entering only a small number of cats had antibodies approximately 15 the percentage however increased rapidly until virtually all cats in the shelters were infected with fcov 40although the prevalence of fcov infection is high only approximately 5 of cats in multiple-cat household situations develop fip the number is even lower in a single-cat environment 5 9 10 the risk of developing fip is higher for young and immune-compromised cats because the replication of fcov in these animals is less controlled and the critical mutation is thus more likely to occur more than half of the cats with fip are younger than 12 months of age 41fcov is also an important pathogen in nondomestic felids 42 kennedy et al 43 found evidence of fcov infection in 195 of 342 investigated nondomestic felids in southern africa which included animals from wild populations and animals in captivity there is also a high incidence of fip in wild felids in captivity in the united states and europe eg in zoos cheetahs are highly susceptible to development of fip and a genetic deficiency in their cellular immunity is thought to predispose them to the disease 44cats are usually infected with nonpathogenic fcov through fcov-containing feces shed by a cat with a harmless fcov enteric infection or by a cat with fip mutated fip-causing fcov has not been found in secretions or excretions of cats with fip thus transmission of the mutated fip-causing fcov is considered unlikely under natural circumstances fip-causing fcov can however be transmitted iatrogenically or under experimental conditions if for example effusion from a cat with fip containing infected macrophages is injected into a naive cat 45fcov is a relatively fragile virus inactivated at room temperature within 24 to 48 hours but in dry conditions eg in carpet it has been shown to survive for up to 7 weeks outside the cat 46 indirect fomite transmission is thus possible and the virus can be transmitted through clothes toys and grooming tools in organ homogenates it is even resistant to repeated freezing at 70c for many months the virus is destroyed by most household disinfectants and detergents howeverthe most common mode of infection is through virus-containing feces thus the major source of fcov for uninfected cats is litter boxes shared with infected cats 47 if multiple cats are using the same litter box they readily infect each other continuous reinfection through the contaminated litter box of a cat already infected also seems to play an important role in the endemic survival of the virus rarely virus can be transmitted through saliva by mutual grooming by sharing the same food bowl or through close contact sneezed droplet transmission is also possible whether or not fcov transmission occurs to a significant degree at cat shows is still a point of discussion in one survey attending cat shows seemed to be a factor of minor significance affecting the incidence of fip 48 but in another survey more than 80 of cats at shows in the united kingdom were found to have antibodies 8 transmission by lice or fleas is considered unlikely 33 transplacental transmission can occur because fip was found in a 4-day-old kitten and in stillborn and weak newborn kittens born to a queen that had fip during the later stages of pregnancy 26 this mode of transmission is uncommon under natural circumstances however most kittens that are removed from contact with adult virus-shedding cats at 5 to 6 weeks of age do not become infected 7 most commonly kittens are infected at the age of 6 to 8 weeks at a time when their maternal antibodies wane mostly through contact with feces from their mothers or other fcov-excreting catsfcov is shed mainly in the feces in early infection it may be found in saliva when the virus replicates in tonsils and possibly in respiratory secretions and urine 49 50 it is likely that when naive cats in a multiple-cat household first encounter fcov all become infected and develop antibodies and most probably shed virus for a period of weeks or months with extremely sensitive reverse transcriptase rtpolymerase chain reaction pcr techniques it has been shown that many naturally infected healthy carrier cats shed fcov for at least up to 10 months 50 most cats shed virus intermittently but some become chronic fcov shedders for years to lifelong providing a continuous source for reinfection of other cats 51 cats that are antibody-negative are unlikely to shed 51 52 whereas approximately one third of fcov antibodypositive cats shed virus 10 it has been shown that cats with high antibody titers are more likely to shed fcov and to shed more consistently and higher amounts of the virus 51 thus the height of the titer is directly correlated with virus replication and the amount of virus in the intestines most cats with fip also shed nonmutated fcov 53 however the virus load in feces seems to decrease after a cat has developed fip 51after a cat becomes infected with fcov by ingestion or rarely by inhalation the main site of viral replication is the intestinal epithelium the specific receptor for fcov at least fcov serotype i is an enzyme aminopeptidase-n found in the intestinal brush border 60 61 62 replication of fcov in the cytoplasm can cause destruction of intestinal epithelium cells cats may sometimes develop diarrhea depending on the degree of virus replication in many cats infection persists over a long period without causing any clinical signs these cats shed fcov intermittently or continuously and act as a source of infection for other catsfip develops when there is a spontaneous mutation in a certain region of the fcov genome the genes 3c and 7b are being discussed as most important 19 whenever fcov infection exists so does the potential for the development of fip 11 63 the critical mutation always occurs in those same genes but the exact location varies comparison of the genome of the mutated virus with the parent virus revealed 995 homology 21 64 65 the mutation leads to changes in the surface structures of the virus that allow the virus phagocytized by macrophages to bind to the ribosomes in these macrophages thus this mutated virus in contrast to its harmless relative is all of a sudden able to replicate within macrophages this is considered the key event in the pathogenesis of fipdecreased suppression of the virus in the intestines by the immune system may allow for increased virus replication this in turn predisposes the cat to fip development through increased virus load because increased virus replication makes the occurrence of a virulent mutation more likely 20 66 any factors that increase fcov replication in the intestines increase the probability of the mutation to occur these factors include physical characteristics eg young age and breed predisposition immune status of the cat which may be compromised by infections eg feline immunodeficiency virus fiv or felv infection stress glucocorticoid treatment surgery as well as dosage and virulence of the virus and the reinfection rate in multiple-cat households 66 it is likely that kittens developing fip do so because they are subjected to a large virus dose at a time of life when their still undeveloped immune systems are also coping with other infections and the stresses of vaccination relocation and neutering 11 66 the question as to why one cat develops fip and many others do not is a subject of intensive research a recent study failed to detect a correlation between genetic differences in the feline leukocyte antigen complex class ii polymorphisms and susceptibility to fip 67fip is an immune complex disease involving virus or viral antigen antiviral antibodies and complement it is not the virus itself that causes major damage but the cats own immune reaction that leads to the fatal consequences within approximately 14 days after the mutation has occurred mutated viruses that have been distributed by macrophages in the whole body are found in the cecum colon intestinal lymph nodes spleen liver and central nervous system cns there are two possible explanations for the events occurring after viral dissemination from the intestines the first proposed mechanism is that fcov-infected macrophages leave the bloodstream and enable virus to enter the tissues the virus attracts antibodies complement is fixed and more macrophages and neutrophils are attracted to the lesion 20 as a consequence typical granulomatous changes develop the alternative explanation is that fip occurs as a result of circulating immune complexes exiting from the circulation into blood vessel walls fixing complement 68 and leading to the development of the granulomatous changes it is assumed that these antigen antibody complexes are recognized by macrophages but are not as they should be presented to killer cells and thus are not destroyed the consequences of the formation of immune complexes in cats depend on their size antibody concentration and antigen content immune complex deposition most likely occurs at sites of high blood pressure and turbulence and such conditions occur at blood vessel bifurcations fip lesions are common in the peritoneum kidney and uvea all of which are sites of high blood pressure and turbulence 26not only virus but chemotactic substances including complement and inflammatory mediators are released from infected and dying macrophages complement fixation leads to the release of vasoactive amines which causes endothelial cell retraction and thus increased vascular permeability retraction of capillary endothelial cells allows exudation of plasma proteins hence the development of characteristic protein-rich exudates 36 inflammatory mediators activate proteolytic enzymes that cause tissue damage the immune-mediated vasculitis leads to activation of the coagulatory system and to disseminated intravascular coagulation dican imbalance in certain cytokines eg increase in tumor necrosis factor- tnf decrease in interferon- can be found early in experimentally induced fip 69 70 71 acute-phase proteins are altered in cats with fip 72 it has been suggested that increase of the acute-phase protein 1-acid glycoprotein and changes in its glycosylation play a role in the pathogenesis of fip 73 the tissue distribution of the 1-acid glycoproteinrelated protein is however not dependent on the presence of fcov suggesting that this protein is not directly involved in the pathogenesis of fip 74in many infectious diseases preexisting antibodies protect against subsequent challenge in experimentally induced fip however an enhanced form of disease may occur in cats that already have preexisting antibodies 75 76 77 78 79 the proposed mechanism of this so-called antibody-dependent enhancement ade is that antibodies facilitate the uptake of fcov into macrophages 18 80 81 82 83 because of ade a higher proportion of antibody-positive cats died compared with antibody-negative controls and the antibody-positive cats developed disease earlier 12 days compared with 28 days or more for controls 78 these findings have complicated the search for an effective and safe vaccine because ade occurred after vaccination in many vaccine experiments ade does not seem to play a major role in the field however antibody-positive pet cats that were naturally reinfected by fcov showed no evidence of ade 26after initial fcov infection there may be a short episode of upper respiratory tract signs although these signs are usually not severe enough to warrant veterinary attention 26 fcov infection can cause a transient and clinically mild diarrhea or vomiting 20 as a result of replication of fcov in enterocytes kittens infected with fcov generally more commonly develop diarrhea sometimes have a history of stunted growth and occasionally have upper respiratory tract signs 7 rarely the virus can be responsible for severe acute or chronic vomiting or diarrhea with weight loss which may be unresponsive to treatment and continue for months most fcov-infected cats however are asymptomaticmany cats with fip develop effusions cats with effusions have ascites 
fig 1 thoracic effusions andor pericardial effusion in a survey of 390 cats with fip with effusions 62 had ascites 17 had thoracic effusions and 21 had effusions in both body cavities 41 nevertheless it is important to consider that of all cats with effusions less than 50 actually have fip in a study including 197 cats with effusions caused by various reasons approximately 30 of cats with thoracic effusions and 30 of cats with both abdominal and thoracic effusions had fip of the cats with ascites approximately 60 had fip 84in cats with ascites an abdominal swelling is commonly noticed by the owner and sometimes may be confused with pregnancy fluctuation and a fluid wave may be present in less severe cases fluid can be palpated between the intestinal loops abdominal masses may sometimes be palpated reflecting omental and visceral adhesion or enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes thoracic effusions usually manifest in dyspnea and tachypnea and sometimes in open-mouth breathing and cyanotic mucous membranes auscultation reveals muffled heart sounds 84 pericardial effusions may be present in addition to or without other effusions in these cats heart sounds are muffled and typical changes can be seen on ekg and echocardiography in one survey fip accounted for 14 of cats with pericardial effusion second to congestive heart failure 28 85some cats with effusions may be bright and alert whereas others are depressed some of these cats eat with a normal or even increased appetite whereas others are anorectic some cats have a fever and some show weight loss signs of organ failure can be present in addition to the effusion eg icterus effusions can be visualized by diagnostic imaging eg radiographs ultrasound their presence is verified by tapping the fluidin cats without effusion signs are often vague and include fever weight loss lethargy and decreased appetite cats may be icteric if the lungs are involved cats may be dyspneic and thoracic radiographs may reveal patchy densities in the lungs 86 abdominal palpation may reveal enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes and irregular kidneys or nodular irregularities in other viscera presenting clinical signs can be unusual in some cats abdominal tumors are suspected but fip is finally diagnosed at necropsy 87 other cats are presented with only gastrointestinal obstruction 88 in one case report a cat suffered from necrotizing orchitis because of fip but had no other signs 89 although believed to be so in the 1970s reproductive disorders neonatal deaths and fading of kittens are not usually associated with fip 26sometimes the main or only organ affected by granulomatous changes is the intestine lesions are commonly found only in the ileocecocolic junction but may also be present in other areas eg colon or small intestine cats may have a variety of clinical signs as a result of these lesions most commonly chronic diarrhea but sometimes vomiting obstipation can also occur 26 90 91 palpation of the abdomen often reveals a thickened intestinal area hematology sometimes shows increased numbers of heinz bodies which is a result of decreased absorption of vitamin b12cats with fip frequently have ocular lesions the most common but not obvious ocular lesions are retinal changes therefore a retinal examination should be performed in all cats in which fip is suspected fip can cause cuffing of the retinal vasculature which appears as fuzzy grayish lines on either side of the blood vessels occasionally granulomatous changes are seen on the retina 26 retinal hemorrhage or detachment may also occur the changes however are not pathognomonic similar changes can be seen in other systemic infectious diseases including toxoplasmosis systemic fungus infections and fiv and felv infectionanother common manifestation is uveitis 
fig 2 92 uveitis is an inflammation of the uveal coat of the eye which consists of the iris ciliary body and choroidal vessels the uveal coat can be seeded by immunologically competent cells that migrate into the eye the eye can thus undergo all types of immunologically mediated inflammation 93 mild uveitis can manifest as color change of the iris usually part of or all the iris becomes brown although blue eyes occasionally appear to be green uveitis may also manifest as aqueous flare with cloudiness of the anterior chamber which can sometimes be detected only in a darkened room using focal illumination large numbers of inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber settle out on the back of the cornea and cause keratic precipitates which may be hidden by the nictitating membrane in some cats there is hemorrhage into the anterior chamber if aqueous humor is tapped it may reveal elevated protein and pleocytosis 26fip is a common reason for neurologic disorders in cats in a retrospective study of 286 cats with neurologic signs more than half of the cats 47 in the largest disease category inflammatory diseases had fip 94 of all cats with fip approximately 13 have neurologic signs 95 these are variable and reflect the area of cns involvement usually the lesions are multifocal 96 the most common clinical sign is ataxia followed by nystagmus and seizures 97 in addition incoordination intention tremors hyperesthesia behavioral changes and cranial nerve defects can be seen 98 99 if cranial nerves are involved neurologic signs like visual deficits and loss of menace reflex may be present depending on which cranial nerve is damaged when the fip lesion is located on a peripheral nerve or the spinal column lameness progressive ataxia tetraparesis hemiparesis or paraparesis may be observed 26 in a study of 24 cats with fip with neurologic involvement 75 were found to have hydrocephalus on postmortem examination finding hydrocephalus on a ct scan is suggestive of neurologic fip because other diseases such as cryptococcosis toxoplasmosis and lymphoma have not been reported to cause these findings 97blood cell counts are often changed in cats with fip 102 103 however changes are not pathognomonic white blood cells can be decreased or increased although it is often stated that lymphopenia and neutrophilia are typical for fip this change can be interpreted as a typical stress leukogram that occurs in many severe systemic diseases in cats 101 in up to 65 of cats with fip anemia is present usually with only a mild decrease in hematocrit the anemia can be regenerative in these cases it is caused mainly by a secondary autoimmune hemolytic anemia aiha in which autoantibodies to erythrocytes can be found and coombs test results are positive in cats with severe intestinal changes heinz bodies can be found in large numbers in erythrocytes 26 and this can also lead to hemolysis alternatively anemia can be nonregenerative and is then mainly caused by anemia associated with chronic inflammation 41 approximately 50 of cats with fip have nonspecific reactive changes of the bone marrow at necropsy 104 thrombocytopenia can commonly be found in cats with fip as a result of dic in experimental infection thrombocytopenia was detected as early as 4 days after infection 105 other parameters indicating dic including fibrinogen degradation products fdps and d-dimers are also commonly increasedthe most consistent laboratory finding in cats with fip is an increase in total serum protein concentration 41 101 106 this is found in approximately 50 of cats with effusion and 70 of cats without effusion 107 this increase in total protein is caused by increased globulins mainly -globulins also leading to a decrease in the albumin-to-globulin ratio 101 108 109 in experimental infections an early increase of 2-globulins was reported 49 whereas -globulins and antibody titers increase just before the appearance of clinical signs 5 49 69 77 the characteristically high levels of -globulins 110 111 and the increased antibody titers 5 112 invite the conclusion that hypergammaglobulinemia is caused by a specific anti-fcov immune response antibody titers and hypergammaglobulinemia show a linear correlation but the wide variation in anti-fcov titers at a given concentration of -globulins indicates that additional autoimmune reactions occur during the pathogenesis of fip 113 114 it has been discussed that stimulation of b cells by interleukin-6 which is produced as part of the disease process additionally contributes to the increase in -globulins 115 total protein in cats with fip can reach high concentrations of up to 12 gdl 120 gl and more this however only reflects the chronic antigenic stimulation that generally can be caused by any chronic infection the cat is not able to clear through its immune response even if the serum total protein concentration is 120 gl or greater the likelihood of fip is only 90 cats with these high serum protein concentrations that do not have fip may suffer from severe chronic stomatitis chronic upper respiratory disease dirofilariasis or multiple myeloma 101in a recent study of cats with fip comparison of total serum protein concentration -globulins and the albumin-to-globulin ratio revealed that the albumin-to-globulin ratio has a statistically significantly better diagnostic value than the other two parameters 101 thus not only the increase in globulins but the decrease in albumin concentrations seems to be characteristic of fip a decrease in serum albumin occurs through decreased production because of liver failure or through protein loss protein loss can be attributed to glomerulopathy caused by immune complex deposition loss of protein caused by exudative enteropathy in case of granulomatous changes in the intestines or loss of protein-rich fluid in vasculitis it can also be explained by decreased production in the liver without compromised liver function because not only albumin but globulins contribute although not as importantly to the plasma oncotic pressure thus an increase in globulins may cause a negative feedback on albumin production in the liver an optimum cutoff value maximum efficiency of 08 was determined for the albumin-to-globulin ratio if the serum albumin-to-globulin ratio is less than 08 the probability that the cat has fip is high 92 positive predictive value if the albumin-to-globulin ratio is higher than 08 the cat likely does not have fip 61 negative predictive value 101electrophoresis is often performed and the rational behind it is to quantify -globulins and to distinguish a polyclonal from a monoclonal hypergammaglobulinemia so as to differentiate fip and other chronic infections from tumors like multiple myelomas or other plasma cell tumors quantification of -globulins is not more useful than measurement of total proteins 101 however in addition polyclonal and monoclonal hypergammaglobulinemia can occur in cats with fip and the same is true in multiple myeloma thus the value of electrophoresis is limitedother laboratory parameters eg liver enzymes bilirubin urea creatinine can be variably increased depending on the degree and localization of organ damage 116 117 but they are not helpful in making an etiologic diagnosis hyperbilirubinemia and icterus are often observed and are frequently a reflection of hepatic necrosis despite the fact that alkaline phosphatase alp and alanine aminotransferase alt activities are often not increased as dramatically as they are with other liver diseases such as cholangiohepatitis and hepatic lipidosis 26 hyperbilirubinemia is caused rarely by hemolysis as a result of secondary aiha however the hemolysis has to be severe to cause icterus bilirubin is sometimes increased in cats with fip without evidence of hemolysis liver disease or cholestasis it has been speculated that the bilirubin metabolism and excretion into the biliary system are compromised in cats with fip similar to the findings in sepsismeasurement of l-acid glycoprotein may be helpful in the diagnosis of fip 118 this acute-phase protein is increased in several infectious diseases of cats and thus is not specific for fip nevertheless l-acid glycoprotein levels in plasma or effusion are usually greater than 1500 gml in cats with fip which may help to distinguish fip from other clinically similar conditions 26if there is effusion the most important diagnostic step is to sample the fluid because tests of effusion have a much higher diagnostic value than tests performed using blood thus fluid should be collected before blood is taken to avoid a waste of money with expensive blood tests only approximately half of the cats with effusions suffer from fip 84 thus although effusions of a clear yellow color and sticky consistency are often called typical the presence of this type of fluid in body cavities alone is not diagnostic 
fig 3 the effusion in fip may be clear straw-colored or viscous and may froth on shaking because of the high protein content the effusion may clot when stored refrigerated 26 if the sample is bloody pus filled or foul smelling or is chylus fip is less likely 95 although effusions in fip can be different and sometimes red pink or almost colorless in appearance some cases of cats with fip with pure chylus effusion have even been reported 119the effusion in fip is usually classified as a modified transudate or exudate typically combining characteristics of both transudates and exudates the protein content is usually high 35 gl reflecting the composition of the serum whereas the cellular content is low and approaches that of a pure transudate 1000 nucleated cells per milliliter the protein content of effusion is high because of the high concentration of -globulins other diseases causing similar effusions include lymphoma heart failure cholangiohepatitis and bacterial peritonitis or pleuritis measurement of enzyme activity in effusion also is an indication that fip might be the underlying disease lactate dehydrogenase ldh is typically high 300 iul in effusions caused by fip because it is released from inflammatory cells activity of -amylase also is often high likely as a result of common pancreatic involvement the enzyme adenosine deaminase ad has been used to distinguish different causes of effusions and its activity was significantly high in cats with fip 120cytologic evaluation of effusion in cats with fip typically shows a pyogranulomatous character predominantly with macrophages and neutrophils 
fig 4 cytologic findings may appear similar in cats with bacterial serositis or sometimes with lymphoma these effusions often can be differentiated however by the presence of malignant cells or bacteria respectively bacterial cultures should be performed in unclear casesa simple test the so-called rivaltas test 
fig 5 has been used to differentiate transudates from exudates this test was originally developed by an italian researcher named rivalta around 1900 and was used to differentiate transudates and exudates in human patients 121 other methods have replaced this test in human medicine because of its limited diagnostic value in people it has not been shown to be diagnostically helpful in dogs with effusion 122 nevertheless this test seems to be useful in cats to differentiate between effusions caused by fip and effusions caused by other diseases 101 it is not only the high protein content but the high concentrations of fibrin and inflammatory mediators that induce a positive reaction to perform this test three quarters of a reagent tube is filled with distilled water to which one drop of acetic acid 98 is added and is mixed thoroughly on the surface of this solution one drop of the effusion fluid is carefully layered if the drop disappears and the solution remains clear the rivaltas test result is defined as negative if the drop retains its shape stays attached to the surface or slowly floats down to the bottom of the tube drop-like or jellyfish-like the rivaltas test result is defined as positive in a recent study the rivaltas test had a positive predictive value of 86 and a negative predictive value of 97 101 there are some false-positive results in cats with bacterial peritonitis those effusions however are usually easy to differentiate through macroscopic examination cytology and bacterial culture some cats with lymphoma also have a positive rivaltas test result but many of these cases can be differentiated cytologically 101 overall the rivaltas test is an easy and inexpensive method that does not require special laboratory equipment and can be easily performed in private practice it provides good predictive values and thus is a helpful diagnostic testanalysis of cerebrospinal fluid csf from cats with neurologic signs caused by fip lesions may reveal elevated protein 50350 mgdl with a normal value of less than 25 mgdl and pleocytosis 10010000 nucleated cells per milliliter containing mainly neutrophils lymphocytes and macrophages 97 123 124 which is a relatively nonspecific finding however many cats with fip and neurologic signs have normal csf tapsalthough frequently criticized antibody testing has a certain role in the diagnosis and more importantly in the management of fcov infection when it is performed by appropriate methodologies and results are properly interpreted antibody testing can only be useful if the laboratory is reliable and consistent methodologies and antibody titer results may vary significantly a single serum sample divided and sent to five different laboratories in the united states yielded five different results 26 the antigen used in a test for example can play an important role in test sensitivity and specificity eg if the antigen used for the test is derived from nonfeline viruses which is practiced by many commercial laboratories thus it is essential that antibody results that are interpreted and compared by the clinician are always obtained with the same method performed by the same laboratory and it is essential to use antibody tests validated by the scientific community evaluating titers of antibodies gives an idea of the amount of antibodies present in contrast tests eg in-house tests that only indicate the presence of antibodies without quantification are not useful they also produce a high number of false-positive and false-negative results 129 the choice of the laboratory to be used is critical and only those that perform quantitative titer evaluations should be used the laboratory should have established two levels one is its least significant level of reactivity or lowest positive titer and the other is its highest antibody titer value in searching for a reliable laboratory repeat samples from the same animal should be sent without warning to the same laboratory and to an fcov-referenced laboratory for comparison to enable useful interpretation serum or plasma samples store well at 20c without loss of antibody concentration 26the presence of antibodies does not indicate fip and the absence of antibodies does not exclude fip many authors agree that low or medium titers do not have any diagnostic value 101 130 131 approximately 10 of the cats with clinically manifest fip have negative results it has been shown that in cats with fulminant fip titers decrease terminally 77 cats with effusions sometimes have low titers or even no antibodies this is because large amounts of virus in the cats body bind to antibodies and render them unavailable to bind antigen in the antibody test or because the antibodies are lost in effusion when protein is translocated in vasculitis extremely high titers are of a certain diagnostic value if the highest measurable titer is present in a cat thus it is important to know what the highest titer in a specific laboratory is it increases the likelihood of fip in a recent study the probability of fip was 94 in cats with the highest titer when investigating a cat population in which fip was suspected 101 the diagnostic value of a high titer is also dependent on the background of the cat the highest titer in a cat coming out of a multiple-cat household situation is not extremely predictive because in those households fcov is endemic and many cats have high titers whereas the highest titer in a cat from a single-cat environment is unusual and a stronger indicator of fipalthough antibody testing in sick cats that are suspected to have fip is of limited value there are a number of other situations in which antibody testing is a useful tool a healthy cat that has no antibodies is considered likely to be free of fcov and thus is not infectious to others does not shed fcov and does not develop fip 10 it has been shown that the height of the antibody titer directly correlates with the amount of virus that is shed with feces cats with high antibody titers are more likely to shed fcov and to shed more consistently with higher amounts of the virus 51 thus height of the titer is directly correlated with the virus replication rate and the amount of virus in the intestines antibody measurement is important for the common situation in practice in which a cat is presented because it has been in contact with a cat with fip or a suspected or known virus excretor the owner wants to know the prognosis for an exposed cat or wishes to obtain another cat and needs to know whether the exposed cat is shedding fcov also cat breeders may request testing with the goal of creating an fcov-free cattery screening a cattery for the presence of fcov and screening a cat before introduction into an fcov-free cattery are also important indicationssome studies have evaluated the diagnostic value of antibody detection in fluids other than serum such as in effusions 132 the presence of antibodies in effusion is correlated with the presence of antibodies in blood 133 in a study by kennedy et al 132 antibody titers in effusions were not helpful because all cats in their study had medium antibody titers irrespective of whether they had fip or not in a study by hartmann et al 101 however the presence of anti-fcov antibodies in effusion had a high positive predictive value 90 and a high negative predictive value 79 although height of titers was not correlated with the presence of fip the measurement of antibodies in effusions is at least more useful than the measurement of antibodies in bloodfoley et al 134 determined the diagnostic value of antibody detection in csf and found a good correlation to the presence of fip when compared with histopathologic findings whereas in a study by boettcher et al 135 there was no significant difference in antibody titers in csf from cats with neurologic signs caused by fip compared with cats with other neurologic diseases confirmed by histopathologic findingsrt-pcr can be performed to reverse-transcribe coronavirus rna to cdna and then to make large quantities of dna visually detectable although fip-causing viruses are genetic mutants of harmless enteric fcov numerous sites exist in the 3c and 7b genes that can be mutated or deleted and confer on the virus the capability to infect and replicate within macrophages sometimes the change can be a single rna base as a result pcr primers to discriminate between fip-causing viruses and harmless enteric fcov cannot be designed and it is not possible to distinguish between a mutated and nonmutated virus by pcr 136 there are a number of reasons why rt-pcr results are not always easy to interpret there are several plausible explanations for false-negative pcr results the assay requires reverse transcription of viral rna to dna before amplification of dna and degradation of rna could be a potential problem because rnases are virtually ubiquitous there may be sufficient strain and nucleotide sequence variation such that the target sequence chosen for the assay may not detect all strains of fipv 19 there are also a number of explanations for false-positive results first the assay does not distinguish between virulent and avirulent fcov strains nor does it differentiate fcov from ccv or tgev although the role of these viruses in the field is unknown cats can be experimentally infected with ccv and tgev 35 137 138 these infections could result in a positive pcr result second recent studies support the hypothesis that viremia occurs not only in cats with fip but in healthy carriers fcov rna could be detected in the blood of cats with fip as well as in the blood of healthy cats that did not develop fip for a period of up to 70 months 50 57 58 136 139 in a study by gunn-moore et al 59 it was shown that in households in which fcov is endemic up to 80 of the cats can be viremic irrespective of their health status and that the presence of viremia does not seem to predispose the cats to the development of fip therefore the results of pcr tests must be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical findings and cannot be used as the sole criterion for diagnosing fiprt-pcr in effusion has been discussed as an interesting diagnostic tool data on the usefulness of this approach are limited however so far only one study including information about rt-pcr on ascites fluid of a limited number of cats has been reported in this study six of six cats with confirmed fip had positive rt-pcr results and one of one cat with ascites caused by another disease had a negative rt-pcr result 101 these numbers are however not sufficient to judge that approach sufficientlycsf has not been recommended for rt-pcr because it may contain low numbers of virus also in cats that do not have fip if the blood-brain barrier is compromised accurate studies are needed howeverrt-pcr has been used to detect fcov in fecal samples and is sensitive and useful for documenting that a cat is shedding fcov in feces 100 because cats vary in how much fcov is shed in feces repeated pcr should be performed daily over 4 to 5 days to detect accurately whether a given cat is shedding fcov samples for rt-pcr must be carefully handled kept frozen and protected from rna-degrading enzymes which are ubiquitous in most environments pcr should be performed as quickly as possible after collection even if samples are frozen delays in testing may result in false-negative results positive rt-pcr results in fecal samples document fcov infection the strength of the pcr signal in feces correlates with the amount of virus present in the intestines 51because fip is an immune-mediated disease and antibody antigen complexes play an important role it has been suggested to look for circulating complexes in serum and effusions 113 140 antibody antigen complex detection can be performed using a competitive elisa usefulness however is limited the positive predictive value of the test was not high 67 in one study because there were many false-positive results 101in a study by parodi et al 141 an immunofluorescence assay detecting intracellular fcov antigen in cells within effusion was used however the number of cats enrolled in that study was limited hirschberger et al 84 detected fcov antigen in 34 of 34 samples from cats with fip-induced effusions in a recent study involving a large number of cats immunofluorescence staining of intracellular fcov antigen in macrophages of effusion had a positive predictive value of 100 there were no false-positive results this means that if this staining test is positive it predicts 100 that the cat has fip unfortunately the negative predictive value was not high 57 cases that stained negative although the cats did have fip can be explained by the fact that the number of macrophages on the effusion smear is sometimes insufficient another explanation is a potential masking of the antigen by competitive binding of fcov antibodies in effusion that displace binding of fluorescence antibodies 101immunohistochemistry can also be used to detect the expression of fcov antigen in tissue 142 tammer et al 143 used immunohistochemistry to detect intracellular fcov antigen in paraffin-embedded tissues of euthanized cats and found fcov antigen only in macrophages of cats that had fip and not in control cats hk 144 was able to demonstrate fcov antigen in the membrana nictitans of cats with fip it was shown that positive staining of macrophages in effusion predicts fip 100 101 the same seems to be true for immunohistochemical staining of tissue macrophages immunostaining cannot differentiate between the harmless nonmutated fcov and the mutated fip-causing fcov obviously only fip-causing virus is able to replicate in sufficiently large amounts in macrophages which results in positive staining therefore in addition to histopathology if pathognomonic lesions are present detection of intracellular fcov antigen by immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry is the only way to diagnose fip definitively this tool should be used whenever possiblediagnosis of fip can be established in many cases with just histopathologic testing of biopsy or necropsy samples hematoxylin and eosinstained samples typically contain localized perivascular mixed inflammation with macrophages neutrophils lymphocytes and plasma cells pyogranulomas may be large and consolidated sometimes with focal tissue necrosis or numerous and small lymphoid tissues in cats with fip often show lymphoid depletion caused by apoptosis 26 145 146 if histologic testing is not diagnostic staining of antigen in macrophages 146 or detection of nucleic acids in tissue 147 can be used to confirm fip 
fig 7there is no indication that any treatment of a healthy antibody-positive cat would prevent development of fip 26 treatment with corticosteroids can conceivably prevent clinical signs from occurring once the mutation has occurred for a certain period of time but immune suppression might have the opposite effect and precipitate clinical fip because it can increase the risk of mutation if the mutation has not occurred yet thus immune suppression is contraindicated as long as the cat is only infected with harmless fcov because stress is an important factor in the development of fip 95 avoidance of unnecessary stress such as rehoming elective surgery or placement in a boarding cattery may be beneficial ifns eg feline ifn- which is available commercially in europe and japan have been discussed in this situation but controlled studies are missing to datemost cases of diarrhea caused by nonmutated fcov are self-limiting cats with chronic diarrhea that have antibodies against fcov in which other possible causes have been eliminated or in which fcov has been detected in the feces by electron microscopy can only be treated supportively with fluid and electrolyte replacement and dietary intervention 20 treatment with lactulose or living natural yogurt may be beneficial because it regulates the intestinal bacterial flora and increases passage time no specific antiviral treatment has yet been demonstrated to cure this condition these cases can be a challenge because they are sometimes difficult to distinguish from cats with fip which can manifest solely as granulomatous changes in the intestines leading to diarrhea fip diarrhea can only be treated with immune suppression if it is identified which conversely is contraindicated in harmless fcov infection in both cases cats usually have antibodies and sometimes high titers but can only be differentiated by exploratory surgery which should be avoided in cats with harmless intestinal fcov infectiontreatment for fip is almost invariably doomed to failure because cats with clinical fip eventually die some cats with milder clinical signs may survive for several months and enjoy some quality of life with treatment however once clinical signs become debilitating and weight and appetite decline the owner must be prepared for the reality that the cat is dyingbecause fip is an immune-mediated disease treatment is aimed at controlling the immune response to fcov and the most successful treatments consist of relatively high doses of immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory drugs immunosuppressive drugs such as prednisone 4 mgkg administered orally every 24 hours or cyclophosphamide 25 mgkg administered orally for four consecutive days every week may slow disease progression but do not produce a cure some cats with effusion benefit from tapping and removal of the fluid and injection of dexamethasone 1 mgkg into the abdominal or thoracic cavity every 24 hours until no effusion is produced anymore cats with fip should also be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive therapy eg subcutaneous fluids for as long as they are comfortable a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor ozagrel hydrochloride which inhibits platelet aggregation has been used in a few cats and has led to some improvement of clinical signs 148some veterinarians prescribe immune modulators eg propionibacterium acnes acemannan to treat cats with fip with no documented controlled evidence of efficacy immune modulators and ifn inducers are widely used and induce synthesis of ifns and other cytokines it has been suggested that these agents may benefit infected animals by restoring compromised immune function thereby allowing the patient to control viral burden and recover from the disease nonspecific stimulation of the immune system is contraindicated however in cats with fip because clinical signs develop and progress as a result of an immune-mediated response to the mutated fcovribavirin 1--d-ribofuranosyl-1h-124-triazole-3-carboxamide rtca is a broad-spectrum triazole nucleoside that has marked in vitro antiviral activity against a variety of dna and rna viruses including fcov ribavirin is a nucleoside analogue but in contrast to the most common antiviral compounds which act primarily to inhibit polymerases ribavirin allows dna and rna synthesis to occur but prevents the formation of viral proteins most likely by interfering with capping of viral mrna in vivo therapeutic concentrations are difficult to achieve because of toxicity and cats are extremely sensitive to the side effectsalthough active against fcov in vitro 149 150 ribavirin was not effective in the treatment of cats with fip in one study ribavirin was administered 165 mgkg orally intramuscularly or intravenously every 24 hours for 10 to 14 days to specific pathogen-free kittens 18 hours after experimental challenge exposure with an fip-causing virus all kittens including ribavirin-treated and untreated kittens succumbed to fip clinical signs of disease were even more severe in the ribavirin-treated kittens and their mean survival times were shortened 151 the most common side effect in cats reported in several studies already using a low dose of 11 mgkg is hemolysis this develops as a result of sequestration of the drug in red blood cells in addition a dose-related toxic effect on bone marrow occurs primarily on megakaryocytes resulting in thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage and erythroid precursors later on or at higher dosages neutrophil numbers are suppressed liver toxicity has also been reported 152 153 weiss et al 151 tried to decrease the toxicity of ribavirin by incorporating it into lecithin-containing liposomes and giving it intravenously at a lower dose 5 mgkg to cats challenged with an fip-causing virus they were however not able to reach a therapeutic concentration with this regimenhuman ifn has immunomodulatory and antiviral activity ifn is active against many dna and rna viruses including fcov ifn has a direct antiviral effect by inducing a general antiviral state of inf-containing cells that protects against virus replication it is not virucidal but merely inhibits viral nucleic acid and protein synthesis it binds to specific cell receptors that activate enzymes inhibiting synthesis assembly and release of viruses human ifn is marketed as a recombinant product rhuifn produced by a cloned human ifn gene expressed in escherichia coli there are two common treatment regimens for use of human ifn in cats subcutaneous injection of high-dose ifn 104 to 106 iukg every 24 hours or oral application of low-dose ifn 150 iukg every 24 hours when given parenterally in high doses application leads to detectable serum levels when given parenterally to cats it becomes ineffective after 3 to 7 weeks because of the development of neutralizing antibodies against the human ifn which limits its activity in a study in which cats were treated with human ifn subcutaneously cats became refractory to therapy after 3 or 7 weeks respectively depending on whether a high 16  106 iukg or a lower 16  104 iukg dose was used 154in vitro antiviral activity of human ifn against fip-causing fcov strains was demonstrated combination of ifn with ribavirin in vitro resulted in antiviral effects significantly greater than the sum of the observed effects from ribavirin or ifn alone indicating synergistic interactions 149 human ifn treatment was used in 74 cats 52 treated cats 22 controls with experimentally induced fip that received ifn p acnes a combination or placebo the prophylactic and therapeutic administration of high doses 104 or 106 iukg of ifn did not significantly reduce the mortality in treated versus untreated cats only in cats treated with ifn and p acnes at a dose of 106 iukg the mean survival time was significantly prolonged by a few days 155orally human ifn can be given for a longer period because no antibodies develop given orally however ifn is inactivated by gastric acid and like other proteins destroyed by trypsin and other proteolytic enzymes in the duodenum therefore it is not absorbed and cannot be detected in the blood after oral administration 156 thus direct antiviral effects are unlikely after oral administration instead it only seems to have immunomodulatory activity ifn may bind to mucosal receptors in the oral cavity stimulating the local lymphoid tissue and leading to cytokine release on lymphatic cells in the oral or pharyngeal area which triggers a cascade of immunologic responses that finally act systemically 157 tomkins 158 showed that orally administered ifn induced cytokine responses in buccal mucosal lymph nodes including upregulation of ifn expression and downregulation of interleukin-4 in studies in mice it was shown that subcutaneous administration of murine ifn had an antiviral effect whereas oral administration caused an immunomodulatory effect infection of mice with encephalomyocarditis virus resulted in death in 100 of mice if not treated in 40 survival of mice when treated with murine ifn orally at a dose of 2  105 iu per mouse and in 90 survival of mice when given the same dose intraperitoneally 159 confirming the immune modulatory effect after oral application therefore low-dose oral ifn treatment should not be used in cats with fip because of its immunomodulatory activity which may lead to progression of diseaserecently the corresponding feline ifn feline ifn was licensed for use in veterinary medicine in some european countries and japan ifns are species specific and the human ifn clearly differs from the feline one not only regarding its antigenicity thus causing antibody development in animals but with respect to its antiviral efficacy in feline cells even if feline ifn is used long term cats do not develop antibodies in addition because it is the homologous species of ifn in cats it is expected to be more effective than human ifn feline ifn is a recombinant product which is produced by baculoviruses containing the feline sequence for this ifn that replicate in silkworms after infection subsequently feline ifn is purified out of homogenized silkworm preparations 160 data on the efficacy of feline ifn in cats with fip are limited fcov replication is inhibited by feline ifn in vitro 161 in one study not controlled and only including a small number of cats 12 cats that were suspected of having fip were treated with ifn in combination with glucocorticoids and supportive care 162 ifn was given at a rate of 106 iukg subcutaneously every 48 hours initially until clinical improvement and subsequently once every 7 days glucocorticoids were given in the form of dexamethasone in case of effusion 1 mgkg intrathoracic or intraperitoneal injection every 24 hours or prednisolone initially 2 mgkg administered orally every 24 hours until clinical improvement then gradually tapered to 05 mgkg administered every 48 hours although most cats died 4 cats survived over a period of 2 years all had initially presented with effusions even though there was no control group in this study and fip was not even confirmed in the 4 surviving cats these results are somewhat interesting because cats with other effusion-associated diseases would not be expected to survive for 2 years without proper treatment and further studies would certainly be interestingif a cat with fip is euthanized and there are no remaining cats the owner should wait approximately 3 months before obtaining another cat because fcov can stay infectious for at least 7 weeks in the environment if there are other cats in the household they are most likely infected with and shedding fcov in natural circumstances cats go outside to defecate and bury their feces in which case the virus remains infectious hours to days slightly longer in freezing conditions domesticated cats have been introduced to litter boxes however in which fcov may survive for several days and possibly up to 7 weeks in dried-up feces thus fcov-shedding cats most likely have a better chance to eliminate the virus if allowed to go outside optimum situation is in a fenced yardit is a common practice for clients to present a cat to the veterinarian that has been in contact with a cat with fip or a suspected or known virus excretor the owner may want to know the prognosis for the exposed cat or may want to obtain another cat and needs to know whether the exposed cat is shedding fcov it is likely that the cat is antibody-positive because 95 to 100 of cats exposed to fcov become infected and develop antibodies approximately 2 to 3 weeks after fcov exposure there are a few cats however that may be resistant to fcov infection it has been shown that a low number of cats in fcov endemic multiple-cat households continuously remain antibody-negative 163 the mechanism of action for this resistance is still unknown the owner should be advised that the cat in contact is likely to have antibodies and reassured that this is not necessarily associated with a poor prognosis most cats infected with fcov do not develop fip and many cats in single- or 2-cat households eventually clear the infection and become antibody-negative in a few months to years cats can be retested using the same laboratory every 6 to 12 months until the results of the antibody test are negative cats exposed only once often have a quicker reduction in antibodies to exclude any risk at all the owner should be advised to wait until antibody titers of all cats are negative before obtaining a new cat some cats however remain antibody-positive for years a rise in antibody titer or maintenance at a high level does not necessarily indicate a poor prognosis for the cat in a study following cats with high titers the titers of 50 of these cats remained at a high level on at least three occasions yet only 4 cats died of fip 26 in contrast in a situation of endemic infection a constantly low titer is highly indicative that a cat is not going to develop fiphouseholds of less than 5 cats can spontaneously and naturally become fcov-free but in households of more than 10 cats this is almost impossible because the virus passes from one individual cat to another maintaining the infection this holds true for virtually all multiple-cat households such as breeding catteries shelters foster homes and other homes with more than 5 catswhen a cat in a household develops fip all other cats in contact with that cat have already been exposed to the same fcov there is virtually nothing to prevent fip in other cats that are in contact with the cat with fip although the risk is only 5 to 10 full-sibling litter mates of kittens with fip have a higher likelihood of developing fip than other cats in the same environment 164 indicating a certain genetic componentvarious tactics have been used to eliminate fcov from a household reducing the number of cats especially kittens less than 12 months old and keeping possibly fcov-contaminated surfaces clean can minimize population loads of fcov antibody testing and segregating cats are aimed at stopping exposure approximately one third of antibody-positive cats excrete virus 10 11 130 165 166 thus every antibody-positive cat has to be considered infectious after 3 to 6 months antibody titers can be retested to determine whether cats have become negative alternatively rt-pcr testing of several fecal samples can be performed to detect shedders it is important to detect chronic fcov carriers so that they can be removed in large multiple-cat environments 40 to 60 of cats shed virus in their feces at any given time approximately 20 shed virus persistently approximately 20 are immune and do not shed virus repeated pcr testing of feces should be performed at weekly intervals for 2 months or more to document carriers if the cats remain persistently pcr-positive for more than 6 weeks they should be eliminated from the cattery and placed in single-cat environments 164more than any other factor management of kittens determines whether or not they become infected with fcov kittens of fcov-shedding queens should be protected from infection by maternally derived antibody until they are 5 to 6 weeks old an early weaning protocol for the prevention of fcov infection in kittens has been proposed by addie and jarrett 26 which consists of isolation of queens 2 to 3 weeks before parturition strict quarantine of queens and kittens and early weaning at 4 to 6 weeks of age this procedure is based on the findings that some queens do not shed the virus and some queens stop shedding after several weeks if not re-exposed even if queens do shed young kittens have maternal resistance to the virus 7 early removal of kittens from the queen and prevention of infection from other cats may succeed in preventing infection in these kittens although straightforward in concept isolation of queens and early weaning is not as simple as it may seem the procedure requires quarantine rooms and procedures that absolutely ensure a new virus does not enter it is an advantage when the isolated queens are not shedding fcov when they are shedding low levels or when they can clear the infection early after being isolated the single most important factor is the number of animals the success of early weaning and isolation in fcov control depends on effective quarantine and low numbers of cats 5 cats in the household also human abodes do not easily allow adequate quarantine space for large numbers of queens and kittens and the time and money required to maintain quarantine increase in proportion to the number of queens and litters under quarantine in a study in large catteries in switzerland in which the same protocol was followed early weaning failed and viral infection of kittens as young as 2 weeks old was demonstrated 167 it is clear that low fcov exposure can delay infection whereas high exposure can overcome maternally derived immunity at an early agethere are two essential downsides of isolation and early weaning it is not easy to do and it fails if appropriate conditions are not maintained additionally some breeders believe that early weaning exacts a social price on the kittens in recognition of both concerns it is recommended that early weaning not be undertaken without careful consideration fcov-free households do not require routine isolation and early weaning when kittens are isolated with their queen special care must be taken during the period from 2 to 7 weeks of age to socialize the kittens the success of early weaning should also be monitored and it should not be continued if it is not successful kittens that have been successfully reared free of fcov should be antibody-negative at 12 weeks of age even if kittens can be raised free of fcov they may become infected sooner or later therefore the objective of isolation and early weaning should not be to prevent infection but to delay it 164 for early weaning to be effective it is best for kittens to be taken to a new home with no other cats at 5 weeks of age even then however early weaning is not always successfulit has been suggested to maximize heritable resistance to fip in breeding catteries genetic predisposition is not completely understood however it is known that susceptible cats are approximately twice as likely to develop fip as other cats 168 if a cat has two or more litters in which kittens develop fip that cat should not be bred again particular attention should be paid to pedigrees of males in which fip is overrepresented because line breeding often uses valuable tomcats extensively eliminating such animals may have a small but important effect on improving overall resistance 164screening of a cattery for the presence of fcov is important if there are many cats housed in a group a random sampling of 3 to 4 cats should indicate whether fcov is endemic if cats are housed individually it may be necessary to test them all cats in households with fewer than 10 cats and no new acquisitions and cats that are isolated from each other in groups of 3 or less often eventually lose their fcov infection 169 once they have been established antibody-negative catteries can be maintained free of fcov by monitoring new cats before they are introduced thus cats should be screened before introduction and antibody-positive cats should never be taken into the household cat breeders often also request that their cats be screened for fcov antibodies before mating if the cat is healthy and antibody-negative it can be safely mated with another antibody-negative cat if the cat is antibody-positive it should not be mated with a cat from an fcov-free environment 164prevention of fip in a shelter situation is virtually impossible unless cats are strictly kept in separate cages and handled only by means of sterile handling devices comparable to isolation units isolation is often not effective because of the ease with which fcov is transported on clothes shoes dust and cats comparison of shelters with different types of handling revealed a significant correlation between an increase in the number of handling events outside the cages and an increase in the percentage of antibody-positive cats in a study in which feral cats were tested at the time they were brought into local shelters in which multiple cats were kept together and at 1-to 2-week intervals thereafter only a low number of cats had antibodies at the time point of entering but the percentage increased rapidly until virtually all cats in the shelters were infected with fcov 40shelter managers should use education and communication to minimize adverse effects of fip in cat populations shelter managers should have written information sheets or contracts informing adopters about fcov and fip they should understand that fcov is unavoidable in multiple-cat environments and that fip is an unavoidable consequence of endemic fcov shelters need to optimize facilities and husbandry so that the facilities can be cleaned easily and virus spread is minimized it is essential to decrease viral load and stress levels 164there have been many attempts to develop effective vaccines but unfortunately most have failed mainly because of ade 75 78 170 171 nevertheless a vaccine was licensed primucell pfizer animal health incorporating a temperature-sensitive mutant of the fcov strain df2-fipv which can replicate in the cool lining of the upper respiratory tract but not at higher internal body temperatures 172 173 174 175 this vaccine administered intranasally produces local immunity iga antibodies at the site where fcov first enters the body the oropharynx and also induces cell-mediated immunity the vaccine has been available in the united states since 1991 and has been introduced in many european countries the concerns of such a vaccine are safety and efficacy safety concerns focus on whether the vaccine could cause fip or produce ade although some experimental vaccine trials with vaccines that never appeared on the market have recorded ade on challenge 176 177 field studies have demonstrated that this intranasal vaccine is safe in two extensive placebo-controlled double-blind field trials there was no development of fip or ade 178 179 180 there were a few immediate side effects after application such as sneezing vomiting or diarrhea which were not statistically different in the vaccinated group and the placebo group 178the efficacy of this vaccine is questioned constantly however experimental studies have reported preventable fractions between 0 176 177 and 50 to 75 175 181 depending on the investigator in a survey of 138 cats belonging to 15 cat breeders in which virtually all the cats had antibodies no difference was found in the development of fip between the vaccinated group and the placebo group 178 thus vaccination in an fcov endemic environment or in a household with known cases of fip is not effective in one of the placebo-controlled double-blind trials that was performed in switzerland in a group of cats that did not have contact with fcov before vaccination a small but statistically significant reduction in the number of cats that developed fip was noted 178 182 because the vaccine is ineffective when cats have already had contact with fcov antibody testing may be beneficial before vaccination one disadvantage is that most cats develop antibodies after vaccination thus making the establishment and control of an fcov-free household difficult in conclusion study results do not clearly identify whether vaccination has no effect versus a small effect although only marginally if at all efficacious the vaccine is at least safe and does not induce adeconcerns have arisen about a possible danger of fcov to people because there is a close antigenetic relation between coronaviruses of different domestic animal species eg ccv tgev and a coronavirus deriving from animals in close contact with humans recently caused the so-called severe acute respiratory syndrome sars that seemed to be a threat to thousands of people there is however no indication that people can be infected with fcovto approach the behavior of viruses acting as populations we must first examine the diversity of the present-day biosphere and the physical and biological context in which primitive viral forms might have arisen evolution pervades nature thanks to new theories and to the availability of powerful instruments new experimental procedures and increasing computing powerwhich together constitute the very roots of scientific progresswe know that the physical and biological worlds are constantly evolving several classes of energy have gradually shaped matter and living entities basically as the outcome of random events and darwinian natural selection in its broadest sense the identification of dna as the genetic material and the advent of genomics in the second half of the twentieth century unveiled an astonishing degree of diversity within the living world that derives mainly from combinations of four classes of nucleotides biodiversity a term coined by o wilson in 1984 and emphasized by t lovejoy and others is a feature of all living beings be differentiated multicellular organisms single-cell organisms or subcellular genetic elements among them the viruses next-generation sequencing methods developed at the beginning of the 21st century allow thousands of sequences from the same biological sample a microbial community in a soil or ocean sample a tumor or an infected host to be determined these procedures have documented the presence of myriads of variants in a single biological entity or in communities of biological entities differences extend to individuals that belong to the same biological group be it homo sapiens drosophila melanogaster escherichia coli or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 hiv-1 no exceptions have been described diversity is extensive and not restricted to the genotypic level it also affects phenotypic traitsduring decades in the first half of the twentieth century population genetics had as one of its tenets that genetic variation due to mutation had for the most part been originated in a remote past it was generally thought that the present-day diversity was essentially brought about by the reassortment of chromosomes during sexual reproduction this view was weakened by the discovery of extensive genetic polymorphisms first in drosophila and humans through secondary analyses of electrophoretic mobility of enzymes detected by in situ activity assays to yield zymograms that were displayed as electromorphs these early studies on allozymes were soon extended to other organisms assuming that no protein modifications had specifically occurred in some individuals the results suggested the presence of several different allelic forms of a given gene among individuals of the same species be it humans insects or bacteria in the absence of information on dna nucleotide sequences the first estimates of heterogeneity from the numbers of electromorphs were collated with the protein sequence information available an excellent review of these developments selander 1976 ended with the following premonitory sentence on the role of molecular biology in unveiling evolutionarily relevant information considering the magnitude of this effect we may not be overfanciful to think that future historians will see molecular biology more as the salvation for than as it first seemed the nemesis of evolutionary biologythe conceptual break was confirmed and accentuated when molecular cloning and nucleotide sequencing techniques produced genomic nucleotide sequences from multiple individuals of the same biological species variety has shaken our classification schemes opening a debate on how to define and delimit biological species in the microbial world from a medical perspective it has opened the way to personalized medicine so different are the individual contexts in which disease processes infectious or other unfold diversity is a general feature of the biological world with multiple implications for interactions in the environment and also for human health and disease bernstein 2014viruses from the latin virus poison are no exception regarding diversity the number of different viruses and their dissimilarity in shape and behavior is astounding current estimates indicate that the total number of virus particles in our biosphere reaches 1032 exceeding by one order of magnitude the total number of cells viruses are found in surface and deep-sea and lake waters below the earth surface in any type of soil in deserts and in most environments designated as extreme regarding ionic conditions ie hypersaline and temperature thermophilic

 the viruses that have been studied are probably a minimal and biased representation of those that exist with at least hundred thousand mammalian viruses awaiting discovery anthony et al 2013 epstein and anthony 2017 this is because high-throughput screening procedures have only recently become available and also because prevention of disease has provided the main incentive to study viruses disease-associated viruses are those most described in the scientific literature

based on suttle 2007 whon et al 2012 koonin and dolja 2013current virology poses some general and fascinating questions which are not easily approachable experimentally here are somewhat is the origin of virusesdid they originate before or after a cellular world was in placewhat selective forces have maintained multiple viruses as parasites of unicellular and multicellular organismsdo viruses exist essentially as selfish parasites or have they played constructive roles in the biospherewhy have a few viral forms not outcompeted most other forms or have theyhave viruses been maintained as modulators of the population numbers of their host speciesdoes virus variation play a role in the unfolding of viral disease processesis it quasispecies dynamics that characterize rna and many dna viruses a remnant of an adaptive strategy that presided all life forms in the remote pastis the behavior of present-day viruses at the population level only an inheritance of their origins or a present-day necessity
this book deals with some of these issues mainly those that are amenable to experimental testing topics covered include molecular mechanisms of genetic variation with emphasis on high mutation rates darwinian principles acting on viruses quasispecies dynamics and its implications consequences for virus-host interactions fitness as a relevant parameter experimental model systems in cell culture ex-vivo and in vivo long-term virus evolution the current situation of antiviral strategies to confront quasispecies swarms and conceptual extensions of quasispecies to nonviral systems these subjects have as a common thread that darwinian natural selection has an immediate imprint on them observable in the time scale of days or even hours the capacity for rapid evolution displayed by viruses represents an unprecedented and often underappreciated development in biology the direct observation of darwinian principles at play within short times
evolution is defined as a change in the genetic composition of a population over time in this book evolution will be used in its broader sense to mean any change in the genetic composition of a virus over time irrespective of the time frame involved and the transience of the change we treat as evolution both the genome variation that poliovirus has undergone from the middle of the 20th century to present days and the changes that the same virus undergoes within an infected individual it is remarkable that only a few decades ago virus evolution or for that matter microbial evolution in general was not considered a significant factor in viral pathogenesis evolution was largely overlooked in the planning of strategies for microbial disease control a lucid historical account of the different perceptions of virus evolution including early evidence of phenotypic variation of viruses with emphasis on the impact of the complexity of rna virus populations was written by jj holland 2006 despite having been largely ignored by virologists the present book was partly stimulated by the conviction that the concept of complexity is pertinent to the understanding of viruses at the population level having direct connections with viral disease and disease controldespite pleomorphism in cells and viruses presence or not of envelopes and viruses being spherical or even displaying a lemon-like shape or being elongated the size of viral particles and their host cells tends to be commensurate with the amount of genetic material that they contain and transmit to progeny fig 11
 the 2017 report from international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv divides viruses into 10 orders and each of them is subdivided into several families subfamilies genera species and isolates httpstalkictvonlineorg and each isolate includes a multitude of variants the task of classifying viruses meets with considerable hurdles and requires periodic revisions by the ictv an organization whose role has been essential to provide conceptual order in the vast viral world one of its objectives is the assignment of newly discovered viruses to the adequate group a remarkable number of isolates remain unclassified an echo of the natural diversity of viruses even among the limited subset that has been isolated and characterizedviruses can be divided into two broad groups those that have rna as genetic material termed the rna viruses and those that have dna as genetic material termed the dna viruses they can have linear circular or segmented genomes of single-stranded or double-stranded nucleic acid fig 11 all evidence suggests that the polynucleotide chain or chains that constitute the viral genome has all the information to generate infectious progeny in a cell as evidenced by the production of infectious poliovirus from synthetic dna copies assembled to represent the genomic nucleotide sequence cello et al 2002with regard to the concepts of genome stability versus variation addressed in this book it is helpful to divide viruses into four groups depending on whether it is dna or rna the type of genetic material which acts as a replicative intermediate in the infected cell bottom gray shaded boxes in fig 11 the nucleic acids written in the four schemes are those involved in the flow of genetic information indicated by arrows not in gene expression since all of them use messenger rna mrna for virus-specific protein synthesis mistakes in the form of misincorporation of nucleotides during the replication steps indicated by arrows are transmitted to progeny genomes rnas produced by transcription to serve solely as mrnas are essential for gene expression and virus multiplication but misincorporations in such transcripts are not transmitted to progeny it could be considered that some mrna molecules when synthesized from the corresponding rna or dna template may acquire mutations and that these mutated molecules eg an mrna encoding a viral polymerase when translated may produce a polymerase with lower copying fidelity that will evoke additional mutations we will ignore this possibility since a single mrna molecule should have a rather limited contribution to the overall genetic variation of a replicating virus population with thousands of polymerase and template molecules in the replication complexes or replication factoriesgroup 1 with a replicative scheme abbreviated as rnarna includes rna viruses whose genomic replication cycle involves only rna they are sometimes called riboviruses examples are the influenza viruses hepatitis a and c viruses poliovirus coronaviruses ebola virus foot-and-mouth disease virus or tobacco mosaic virus among many other important human animal and plant pathogens their replication is catalyzed by an rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp encoded in the viral genome often organized as a replication complex with viral and host proteins in cellular membrane structuresgroup 2 rnadnarna comprises the retroviruses such as hiv-1 the acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids virus and several tumor viruses that retrotranscribe their rna into dna retrotranscription is catalyzed by reverse transcriptase rt an rna-dependent dna polymerase encoded in the retroviral genome it reverses the first step in the normal flow of expression of genetic information from dna to rna to protein once known as the dogma of molecular biology this enzyme was instrumental in the understanding of cancer and for genetic engineering and the origin of modern biotechnology as a historical account of the impact of h temins work codiscoverer of rt with d baltimore the reader is referred to cooper et al 1995 retroviruses include a provirus stage in which the viral dna is integrated into host dna when silently installed in cellular dna the viral genome behaves mostly as a cellular genegroup 3 dnadna contains most dna viruses such as herpesviruses poxviruses iridoviruses and papillomaviruses and the extremely large viruses of amebae ie mimivirus megavirus or pandoravirus generically termed giant viruses la scola et al 2008 colson et al 2017 their replication is catalyzed by a dna-dependent dna polymerase either encoded in the viral genome or in the cellular dna cellular dna polymerases are involved in the replication of dna viruses that do not encode their own dna polymerasefinally group 4 dnarnadna includes viruses which despite having dna as genetic material produce an rna as a replicative intermediate the most significant examples being the human and animal hepatitis b viruses hbvs and the cauliflower mosaic virus of plants termed hepadnavirusesmost viruses from the more complex dna viruses ie 1200 kbp 1000 base pairs for the ameba mimivirus 752 kbp for some tailed bacteriophages and up to 370 kbp for poxviruses iridoviruses and herpesviruses the virophages that are parasites of the giant dna viruses the simplest dna viruses the circular single-stranded 1760 residue dna of porcine circovirus rna bacteriophages 4220 nucleotides of ssrna for bacteriophage q or subviral elements viroids virusoids satellites and helper-dependent defective replicons show remarkable genetic diversity however rna viruses that replicate entirely via rna templates group 1 in fig 11 retroviruses group 2 and the hepadnaviruses group 4 display salient genetic plasticity mainly in the way of a high rate of introduction of point mutations chapter 2 their mutability may be an inheritance of universal flexibility that probably characterized primitive rna or rna-like molecules thought to have populated an ancestral rna world at an early stage of life on earth section 142 thus the presence of rna at any place in the replicative schemes group 1 2 and 4 in fig 11 implies error-prone replication and the potential of very rapid evolution potential must be underlined because high error rates do not necessarily result in rapid long-term evolution in nature chapter 7the extent of genetic variation and its biological consequences have been less investigated for dna viruses than for rna viruses the available data suggest that dna viruses are closer to rna viruses than suspected only a few years ago regarding their capacity of variation and adaptation this is particularly true of the single-stranded dna viruses of animals and plants evolutionary theory predicts that high-fidelity polymerase machinery is necessary to maintain the informational stability of complex genomes those that carry a large amount of genetic information this necessity accomplished by proofreading-repair and postreplicative-repair activities that assist the replicative dna polymerases and their cellular and viral dna progenyour current capacity to sample many thousands viral genomes in short times a trend that is continuously expanding is revealing an astonishing number of slightly different viral genomes within a single infected host and even within an organ or within individual cells of an organ intrahost diversity of viruses can be the result not only of diversification within the host but also of coinfection with different viruses or variants of one virus or an infection that triggers reactivation of a related or unrelated virus from a latent reservoir or combined effects of these mechanisms in turn interhost long-term virus diversification can result from selection acting on variants generated by mutation recombination or reassortment and random sampling events independent of selection within hosts and in host-to-host transmission or their combined effects chapters 2 and 3chapter 2chapter 3a different picture of diversity is obtained by comparing the morphological characteristics of viral particles termed virions the hundreds of thousands of bacterial and archaeal viruses that have been recognized can be assigned to as few as 20 morphotypes the capsids of nonenveloped naked viruses display helical or icosahedral symmetry that determines the architecture of the virion variation in size and surface protein distributions can be attained from limited protein folds and the same symmetry principles mateu 2013 fig 12
 divergent primary amino acid sequences in proteins can fold in closely related structures the structural space available to viruses particles is much more restricted than the sequence space available to viral genomes abrescia et al 2012 sequence space and its mapping into a phenotypic space are key concepts for the understanding of evolutionary mechanisms chapter 3three-dimensional structures of entire virions or their constituent proteins can provide an overview of phylogenetic lineages and evolutionary steps in cases in which the information cannot be attained by viral genomics ravantti et al 2013 yet minor genetic modifications that do not affect the phylogenetic position of a virus or the structure of the encoded viral proteins in any substantial manner can nevertheless have major consequences for traits as important as host range or pathogenicity how such minor changes in viruses can have major biological consequences may relate to the historical role of viruses in an evolving ancestral pre-cellular biosphere to further address this issue we need to examine how viruses may have originated this in turn begs the question of the origin of life and the possible involvement of viruses in early life developmentsubstantiating the abiotic synthesis of nucleotide- or amino acid-based polymers has been arduous relative to the synthesis of monomeric organic molecules however early work by l orgel and his colleagues documented that polynucleotides could be synthesized from activated nucleotides in the absence of an enzyme miller and orgel 1974 and recent work has established that there are multiple chemical pathways for abiotic and nonenzymatic nucleotide synthesis adamala and szostak 2013 ruiz-mirazo et al 2014 mineral surfaces clay minerals zeolites manganates hydroxides etc have been proposed as key participants in the origin of life by providing scaffolds for the synthesis of nucleotide and amino acid polymers bernal 1951 gedulin and arrhenius 1994 ruiz-mirazo et al 2014 nakashima et al 2018 pedreira-segade et al 2018 the relevant features of clays are their adsorption power ordered structure capacity to concentrate organic compounds and ability to serve as polymerization templates adsorption onto mineral surfaces may lower the activation energy of intermolecular reactions minerals with an excess positive charge on their surfaces might have played a role in the evolution of rna-like or rna-precursor molecules it has been suggested that mineral-organic complexes chimeras between materials once thought to belong to unmixable categories could have been the first living organisms endowed with a genetic program cairns-smith 1965bond formation and chain extension which are needed to synthesize nucleic acids and proteins prebiotically are inhibited in liquid water thus favoring mineral surfaces as potential biogenic sites polymer formation could have also been facilitated by heating and drying with key involvement of the dried phases in catalysis towe 1994 horneck and baumstark-khan 2002 on different clay types nucleotides and amino acid polymers of dozens of residues have been synthesized providing a realistic scenario for a transition toward primitive self-replicating entities ferris et al 1996 one of the first episodes of darwinian positive selection could have operated prebiologically through differential surface binding followed by the selection of autocatalytic heteropolymers tkachenko and maslov 2018 we arrive at the paradox that while primitive polymerization reactions might have required dry surfaces later forms of life evolved in a water-rich environment with water being the major component of cells origin and establishment and evolution of life have been considered either as linked processes that obey similar rules or distinct events whose investigation requires dissimilar approaches a distinction between origin and establishment will become pertinent also when addressing the origin versus the evolution of viruses later in this chapter and the mechanisms of viral disease emergence in chapter 7a simplified overview of a course of events that led to the origin of biological systems is depicted in fig 13

rna world in the late hadean early archean periods on earth this stage should have been followed by one in which rna was complemented by dna as a repository of genetic information bywater 2012

2011 in support of a possible link between catalytic rna activities and solid mineral surfaces in the origin of life as summarized in section 141 the catalytic activity of the hammerhead ribozyme of the avocado sun blotch viroid was maintained when bound to the clay mineral montmorillonite biondi et al 2007minimum requirements for an rna world would be the presence of ribozymes and mechanisms for the intake of energy-rich molecules orgel 2002 orgel 2004 the inherently low copying fidelity of the putative ribozyme polymerases estimated in 102 to 104 errors per nucleotide copied wochner et al 2011 should have ensured genetic variation for selection to act upon variant rna molecules chirality the existence of two mirror images or enantiomers of a molecule poses a challenge for the chemical origin of biological molecules caglioti et al 2011 ruiz-mirazo et al 2014 sczepanski and joyce 2014 present-day biological systems use only d-ribose d from dextro or rotation of the plane of polarized light to the right while chemical condensation reactions produce equal amounts of the d- and l- levo forms nonenzymatic template-dependent reactions can be inhibited by the incorrect enantiomer this led to the proposal that analogs devoid of enantiomeric forms such as glycerol derivatives could have been the basis of the most primitive genetic systems schwartz and orgel 1985 theoretical studies support the notion that initial achiral conditions can evolve toward chirality in what has been defined as an extension of punctuated equilibrium to prebiological evolution gleiser et al 2008probably very little if anything remains in our present-day biosphere of a primitive rna world let alone traces of the prolonged process that went from chemistry to the first replicating organizations so profound have been the changes experienced by the earth and its surroundings for over four billion years cantine and fournier 2018 contemporary catalytic rnas found in the ribosome as part of some protein complexes and in some viroids as well as nucleotide-like coenzymes have been regarded as possible molecular remnants of a primitive rna world lazcano 1994a some authors consider the possibility that cells whose genetic material is made of rna forterre 2005 may still hide in some remote sites of our planet yarus 2010 for a transition from a purely rna or rna-like world to an extended scenario with the participation of proteins the presence of a transfer rna trna quasispecies and the generation of a genetic code endowed with evolutionary potential must have been critical eigen 1992 koonin and novozhilov 2017 initial theories of how the genetic code might have arisen were put forward by f crick l orgel and c woese in the middle of the twentieth century main proposals included a stereochemical fit between some amino acids and the corresponding bases or codons to be progressive evolution from a one nucleotide to a three nucleotides code gradual incorporation of amino acids in the coding system and the frozen accident model of codon universality for a review of early concepts see crick 1968 new insights on the code origin have come from integrating the knowledge of the mechanisms of protein synthesis with likely events in the rna world primitive trna quasispecies existing around 4000 million years ago late hadean early archean fig 13 and trna aminoacylating ribozymes should have evolved to fit the genetic code which was later expanded in coevolution with the translation machinery szathmary 1999 rodin et al 2011 caetano-anolles et al 2013 the age of the genetic code has been estimated in 38  05 thousand million years eigen 2013 and the present code structure is remarkably redundant effects of redundancy are to minimize the deleterious effects of mutations and to contribute to flexibility of functional involvement of mrna secondary structure shabalina et al 2006 koonin and novozhilov 2017 see also chapter 2the advent of dna as an informational macromolecule that was physically more stable than rna opened the way to an increase of complexity in the sense of the amount of genetic information of the genetic material dna allowed integration of modules to form the first chromosomes and transcriptional regulation prior to protein expression as in current evolutionary virology perhaps the most challenging problem to understand early life is to identify the selective constraints that influenced the course of events in contrast to the present-day environmental changes confronted by viruses multiple and complex but amenable to experimentation chapters 4 and 6chapter 4chapter 6 the conditions that permitted primitive genetic entities to acquire expanded coding and signaling capacities defy our imagination some aspects are considered nextthe most salient attributes of living matter are reproduction evolvability energy conversion metabolism and compartmentalization what selective forces might have led to the integration of these features concerning reproduction there must have been a critical transition from the absence of any inheritable instruction despite the presence of primitive polymers to the first molecules endowed with inheritable information for example a macromolecule capable of self-copying such a molecule should have had an immense selective advantage over surrounding macromolecular peers devoid of the capacity for reproduction the transition from no inheritable information to inheritable information is essential for the origin of life current evidence suggests that the process that allowed such critical transformation was slow and inaccurate slow because the catalytic rnas selected in the laboratory are about 10 million-fold slower than most protein enzymes jeffares et al 1998 yarus 2010 inaccurate because preenzymatic nucleotide polymerization would rarely display error rates below 101 to 102 mutations per nucleotide copied inoue and orgel 1983 no predators such as degrading enzymes were present to impede a slow accumulation of variant replicating molecules the slow sequence exploration might have taken place in microenvironments shielded from damaging radiation until points in sequence space compatible with self-organization replication and adaptation were encountered the adaptive potential of mutant distributions of polynucleotides is a key concept in the quasispecies theory of the origin of life eigen and schuster 1979 and a signature of present-day viruses chapter 3 replicative inaccuracy and heterogeneity appear as recurrent requirements for the major transitions and adaptability of the forms generated in the course of prebiological and biological evolution once a primitive molecular memory was implemented in the words of m eigen  information generates itself in feedback loops via replication and selection the objective being to be or not to be eigen 1994 eigen 2013 in those times this was the only simple requirement to be or not to bethis singular transition resulted in the first replicating entities that are also termed replicators or replicons they were selected for replicability stability and evolvability with trade-offs acquisition of benefits for one of the three traits at some cost for another trait likely play a role at this stage see chapter 4 for trade-offs in virus evolution optimization of primitive replicons should have been facilitated by dual genotypic and phenotypic features in the same molecule eigen 2013 that rna itself is both genotype and phenotype is a feature of present-day rna viruses that is the genomic rna determines phenotypic traits independently of its protein-coding activity for example through its involvement in rna-rna and rna-protein interactions priming of polynucleotide synthesis in the sense as we know it today should not have been a limitation since circular rna or rna-like molecules could fold partially to prime their own copying the term replicon currently refers to any genetic element that encodes sufficient information to be copied ie viruses plasmids etc even if the copying is carried out by or in conjunction with elaborate cell-dependent machinery virtual replicons are used in computer simulations to learn about the dynamics of natural living systems adami 1998 eigen 2013the environment in which primitive replicons had to self-organize about 4000 million years ago was very different from the environment we have today on earth the sun was about 2530 less luminous than the present-day sun yet it produced more ultraviolet uv light due to the absence of oxygen and ozone layer the uv radiation that reached the earth was 10- to 100-fold more intense than today with the difference being accentuated for the radiation in the 200280 nm range studies of the conversion of uv radiation into dna-damage equivalents suggest a two to three logarithm larger biologically relevant uv radiation during the time of the putative rna world as compared with todays radiation canuto et al 1982 chang 1994 horneck and baumstark-khan 2002 in such an environment radiation-related mutational input could have had drastic effects on replicating entities in ways that can be only roughly anticipated from the present-day chemistry even the simplest present-day rna genetic systems despite their small target size would undergo severe radiation damage reconstruction of protein enzyme-free nucleic acid synthesis under the radiation conditions prevalent on earth during the rna world development during late hadean and early archean eras offers a fascinating challenge and opportunity of experimental research for the rising field of astrobiologyit has been considered that the time elapsed since the earth attained a life-friendly environment until protocells arose from about 4500 million to about 3500 million years ago fig 13 was insufficient for life development this led to the panspermia theory which proposes that life has an extraterrestrial origin panspermia in different forms has been defended by noted scientists such s arrhenius in the early twentieth century and later by f crick and l orgel discussed by de duve 2002 in addition to the time estimates for life generation being arbitrary our present understanding of how error-prone replication can facilitate evolvability and exploration of novel biological functions chapters 2 and 3chapter 2chapter 3 converts a 1 million-year time period in a long time for life to originate and initiate multiple branches for its developmentenergy conversion is an essential feature of life the primitive precellular organizations might have obtained energy either from organic molecules captured from the external environment heterotrophy or from metabolites they synthesized endogenously using external energy autotrophy one line of thought considers that it is more likely that the first cells were heterotrophs and that only later they evolved toward autotrophy in the form of photosynthesis which represented a major transition in the repertoire of biosynthetic pathways nakashima et al 2018 fermentation reactions were likely the first ones exploited to break energy-rich bonds as a source of energy for primordial biochemical reactionsan alternative view is that the first cellular organism was an autotroph in particular a chemoautotroph also termed lithotroph that used inorganic compounds to obtain energy one of these proposals is that the formation of pyrite from hydrogen sulfide was used by primitive cells as an energy source resulting from reactions such as fes  h2s  fes2  2h 2e wchtershuser 1994 positive charges on pyrite crystals could accumulate negatively charged molecules eg the products of co2 fixation and undergo reductive reactions the system might have selected surface-bound polymers rather than monomers and given rise to biochirality selection of one enantiomeric form over another because of the chiral structure of pyrite wchtershuser 1988 then an evolution toward an archean carbon-fixation cycle would occur a precursor of the metabolic cycles found in present-day archaeal and bacterial organisms ruiz-mirazo et al 2014 the picture may have been more complex as judged by the success of mixotrophic organisms which are capable of switching from phototrophy light-mediated break-down of co2 for their metabolism to heterotrophy in some extreme environments of the present-day earth laybourn-parry and pearce 2007the integration of early replication systems and metabolism was probably favored by some compartmentalization of replicative-metabolic units through lipid bilayers carrara et al 2012 stano et al 2013 ruiz-mirazo et al 2014 hanczyc and monnard 2017 here a second decisive positive selection event might have entered the scene at the stage of formation of proto-cells and the first individual cells 36003200 million years ago fig 13 eigen 1992 lipid bilayers endowed with a splitting capacity should have been strongly selected at this stage of life development because of their power to spread this underlines the concept that darwinian selection need not be associated exclusively with template-copying processes membrane traffic and reorganizations are essential for the life cycle of many present-day viruses huotari and helenius 2011 virus particle stability and capacity to spread associated with membrane capture and interactions might have derived from the early genomes that exploited membrane-based organelles to achieve functional diversification compartmentalization is considered one of the key developments to initiate a cell-based life morowitz 1992 hanczyc and monnard 2017despite obvious difficulties in reproducing physical and chemical processes that were likely involved in the origin of life there is sufficient evidence to render probable that the most primitive organizations that we would now consider as living resulted from the assembly of simple organic compounds that attained a required level of complexity kauffman 1993 the various facets that distinguish living from inanimate matter are recapitulated in the definitions of life that scientists from different backgrounds in physics chemistry or biology have proposed box 12

a lazcano summarized the current situation in the arduous search of the origin of life there are still unsolved problems but they are not completely shrouded in mystery and this is no minor scientific achievement why should we feel disappointed by our inability to even foresee the possible answers to these luring questions as the greek poet konstantinos kevafis once wrote odysseus should be grateful not because he was able to return home but on what he learned on his way back to ithaka it is the journey that matters lazcano 1994b for a general overview of the history of life on earth centered in paleontology see cowen 2005after this brief survey of the origin of life we can now examine theories on how when and why viruses arose and became active actors in our biosphere
viruses were involved in the origin of life some viruses are the descendants of primitive rna or rna-like replicons that preceded cellular forms
because of their limited genetic complexity rna viruses and subviral rna elements have been considered possible descendants of the primitive replicating entities that predated cell-based life forms upper diagram in fig 14 as early as the beginning of the twentieth century hj muller lt troland and jbs haldane suggested that viruses represented primordial life forms influenced by the discovery of bacteriophages by f dherelle jbs haldane proposed viruses as intermediates between the prebiotic soup and primitive cells reviewed in lazcano 2010 in those times knowledge of viruses was superficial from todays perspective and lent to daring proposals coherent with viruses being perceived as simple despite simplicity and replication being features that could be also be attributed to primitive life forms we have to distinguish the role that virus-like entities might have played in the establishment of early life from the possibility that present-day viruses reflect how early life might have beenan origin independent of cells is suggested by the presence of a number of virus hallmark proteins in viruses which do not have counterparts in present-day cells at least in the sequences represented in data banks a number of protein folds such as the double jelly-roll fold found in the nucleoplasmic large dna viruses and related structures are also present in viruses that infect the archaeon sulfolobus and in some single-stranded and double-stranded rna viruses that infect eukaryotic cells these unique structures and other features of viruses such as genome size and its composition constitute a virus innate self krupovic and bamford 2007 that has been taken as an indication that viruses were constructed from modules that were different from those captured to build cellsthe fact that some viral proteins do not have cellular homologs or are only distantly related to cellular homologs has favored the view that a virus world preceded the origin of cells forterre 2005 villarreal 2005 koonin et al 2006 koonin 2009 in this line of thought the present-day rna viruses are considered remnants of an rna world no other biological group that has been identified uses rna as genetic material likewise transposable elements repeat sequences of mobile elements ltr-retrotransposons lines sines alus and of telomeres and centromeres are considered to be likely of a viral origin reviewed in witzany 2012
other present-day rna genetic elements that include ribozymes as constituents ie plant viroids self-replicating rnas of about 165430 nucleotides in length hadidi et al 2017 or the defective delta agent also termed hepatitis delta virus hdv might be a vestige of primitive genetic elements robertson et al 1992 hdv is dependent on hepatitis b virus hbv for the completion of its infectious cycle taylor and pelchat 2010 the hdv genome is a mosaic rna consisting of a viroid-like rna and an rna region whose complementary rna antigenomic strand encodes two forms of a structural protein termed the delta antigen both the genomic and antigenomic rnas possess a strong secondary structure with about 70 paired nucleotides the delta antigen is encapsidated by the hbv surface antigen as a component of hdv particles thus hdv appears to be the result of an rna conjunction between a viroid-like rna and an mrna-coding region such conjoined rnas might have been the precursors of the modern eukaryotic genome partition into coding sequences exons and intervening sequences introns sharp 1985 robertson 1992 robertson 1996 chao 2007 taylor and pelchat 2010 the structure of the hdv genome seems to echo processes that originated with primitive rnas selected for their ability to replicate that incorporated a protein-coding moiety through recombination with other rnas replication-competent and protein-coding chimeras might have signaled a relevant intermediate step toward more complex rna and dna genomes the advent of an enzyme that could copy rna into dna to carry out reverse transcription should have been instrumental in generating primitive dna viruses and other dna-based genomes of increased complexity lazcano et al 1992the discovery of the chimeric structure of the hdv genome illustrates how insights into the origin and early evolution of life can be gained from current genomics despite lacking experimental approaches to recreate episodes that led to virus origins even if experiments could be designed the time frame involved would occupy several generations of scientists which is not feasible given the current research grant system
viruses originated from regressive evolution of microbes with a cellular organization and became parasites of cells
this theory is quite the opposite of the previous one because it presupposes that a cellular world was the source of viruses lower diagram in fig 14 one of its conceptual pillars is that the intricacies of virus-host relationships unveiled by molecular virology render unlikely that present-day rna viruses are remnants of an ancestral rna viral world also the conditions prevailing in the rna world did not necessitate that a primitive replicon displays rapid replicationa trait of most present-day virusesfor it to become established because of the scarcity of predatorsthe theory of a cellular origin of viruses was already put forward in the twentieth century when it was evidenced that complex dna viruses encoded enzymes and immunomodulatory proteins that had cellular counterparts the virus-generating cells could be autonomously functional from the onset as autonomous as individual cells can be or belong to a class of simple cells that parasitized functionally more advanced cellsone of the mechanisms by which viruses may have originated from cells is by regression or reduction it implies that the number of genes of the virus-precursor cells diminished gradually or in a step-wise fashion to a minimum number compatible with replication at the expense of other cells that supplied basic components for gene expression and energy capture the giant dna viruses nasir et al 2012 colson et al 2017 have been regarded as a possible missing link between a primitive dna cell and the dna viruses and some of them include part of the translation apparatus abrahao et al 2018the capacity to spread so inherent to the concept of the virus might have been first selected as a positive trait for cells which then regressed toward a subcellular transmissible form prokaryotic cells can spread effectively among differentiated eukaryotic hosts and tumor cells have been regarded as transmissible parasites banfield et al 1965 murgia et al 2006 pearse and swift 2006 the observation that some infectious cells can be disseminated by insects provides a model for an early origin of arthropod-borne viruses it has been recognized that transmission of the virus from an infected cell into a recipient cell need not involve a prolonged stay of the virus in the extracellular environment infection synapses allow intimate cell-to-cell contacts through which virus transmission takes place it is estimated that synapse-mediated transmission maybe 100-fold more efficient than the transmission of viral particles released into the extracellular environment this is one of several mechanisms of bloc multiple particles transmission which has several implications for viral quasispecies dynamics chapter 3 acquisition of capacity for long-range transmission in space and time should have provided a sufficient selective advantage for a cell-to-external environment-to-cell transmission to coexist with cell-to-cell transmission in our biospherethe possibility that rna viruses derive from some organism that used rna as genetic material was suggested initially by d baltimore 1980 the evidence that rna-dependent rna synthesis is rare in cells suggests that either rna viruses derived their replicates from a now probably extinct rna organism or that the viral replicates evolved from cellular dna polymerases baltimore 1980 forterre 2005 forterre 2006a forterre 2006b yarus 2010
viruses originated from cellular dna or rna that evolved to embody autonomous replication and an extracellular step in their replication cycle
an alternative to the regressive or reduction of virus origin from cells is the escape theory it proposes that part of the genome complement of cells found a way toward autonomous replication in the sense that they could replicate on their own as parasites of cells the capacity to replicate could come from the parental cell or be acquired externally the kind of autonomy attained implied an intracellular phase of their multiplication cycle and an extracellular phase in the form of transmissible particles virions this new way of life should have been positively selected if an increased capacity of cell-to-cell transfer conferred an advantage to the cells regarding the acquisition of new traits for functional diversification while maintaining a capacity to sustain virus multiplicationdecades ago the view that viruses originated from subcellular organelles was a favored one see eg joklik 1974 despite discernible sequence identity between some viral and mitochondrial dna sequences no evidence of viruses having functions encoded in cellular organelles and not in chromosomal dna has been obtained perhaps reflecting an earlier relationship between viruses and primitive free-living cells rather than between viruses and modern eukaryotic cells see also section 17
viruses are as ancient as cells and coevolved with cells or even with precellular genomic organizations with which they shared functional modules
current genomics of viruses and their host organisms bushman 2002 mount 2004 hacker and dobrindt 2006 tends to favor a long history of coevolution between viruses and cells the structure and functions of many viral proteins do not deviate in any salient way from cellular counterparts this applies to proteins involved in genome replication and in proteolytic processing of proteins and polyprotein precursors in contrast the virus innate self that groups viral proteins and protein folds not shared with cellular counterparts and that provides a powerful argument for a virus origin independent from cells section 151 does not exclude a coevolutionary mechanism even if all modules were not common to cellular and viral entities over a several million years period see section 17 comparative genomics suggests that the exchange of functional and structural modules through lateral gene transfers together with fine adjustments mediated by mutation have contributed to the coadaptation of cells and autonomous replicons over ancient evolutionary periods gorbalenya 1995 holland and domingo 1998 jalasvuori and bamford 2008 villarreal 2008 even mechanisms that prompt viral variation in cell tropism chapter 4 have parallels in differentiated organism as an example a two amino acids insertion into ectodysplasina member of the tumor necrosis-binding familyalters its receptor specificity and the differential expression of the two protein versions plays a role in epidermal morphogenesis yan et al 2000 furthermore as the number of three-dimensional structures for viral cellular enzymes has increased to reach thousands structural similarities between key cellular and viral enzymes polymerases proteases have become apparent
baltimore 1980 proposed that a limited number of archetypal proteins could be responsible for rna virus function he named as archetypal a positive virus polymerase a negative virus polymerase a set of surface proteins and several proteases among other proteins and regulatory elements the argument that archetypal modules could spread among positive- and negative-strand rna viruses was based on features and mechanisms now recognized as much more profuse than in 1980 the multifunctionality of viral proteins their capacity to diversify by mutation and the existence of rna recombination chapter 2 regulatory strategies were also likely shared by cells and viruses small micro-rnas that now populate the cellular world can act as molecular switches for rna viral genomes to modulate their replication and gene expression van rij and andino 2008 diaz-toledano et al 2009 a likely course of events is that the long coevolution of protocells and primitive virus-like elements gradually shaped both cells at the individual and organismal level and the precursors of present-day viruses
protoviruses might have originated in primitive vesicles
early protocellular communities probably lacked a cell wall or other compartmentalization barriers an absence that allowed fluid transfers of metabolites and genetic material woese 2002 the most primitive vesicles based on lipid structures inaugurated the distinction between internal and external milieu and might have evolved to contain self-replicating macromolecules jalasvuori and bamford 2008 adamala and szostak 2013 hanczyc and monnard 2017 vesicles located in favorable microenvironments of a primitive earth had the potential to exchange small molecules between the inside and outside and export materials toward other vesicles exchanges could assist in the coupling between genome replication and an incipient metabolismdepending on their composition lipid vesicles could form and remain stable at temperatures of about 100c their transfer to lower temperatures might have modulated their permeability prior to the stage at which peptide or protein transporters were inserted as membrane components here again heterogeneities became important membranes made of mixtures of amphiphiles display increased thermostability permeability and tolerance to divalent cations budding vesicles endowed with traits such as growth division and permeability should have been positively selected for their ability to spread favorable replicating molecules and mediators of protocellular functions selected protoviral vesicles became gradually dispensable for the spreading of beneficial genes and viruses evolved from being solely beneficial entities into also displaying a parasitic behavior that exploited cell resources compare with 17 18 according to this model when cells became independent units surrounded by lipid-based membranes viruses promoted the selection of cells that expressed peptidoglycan molecules on their surface to decrease or prevent virus infection this transition could mark the onset of an arms race behavior that has been associated with a survival strategy of many present-day viruses a cell wall allowed vertical transmission of genetic information and rendered the cell metabolically independent in addition it provided an osmotic environment suitable for energy production genetic information and molecular devices for energy capture storage and use were equally important for a sustainable cellular organization thus according to this theory viruses originated from protoviral elements whose main function was to spread useful genes horizontally the evolved viruses acted as selective agents to promote microbial evolution and then became established in an increasingly differentiated cellular world villarreal 2005 villarreal 2008 hendrix 2008 jalasvuori and bamford 2008geological studies indicate that mass extinctions of a brief duration less than 100000 years a short geological time occurred at several points when multicellular organisms populated the earth some of them indicated in fig 13 the end-permian end-triassic and end-cretaceous extinctions rank among the most drastic resulting in profound environmental perturbation burgess et al 2014 and references therein as depicted in the form of red upward and downward curved lines in fig 14 perturbations associated with viral extinctions due to massive host extinctions and severe bottleneck events have periodically blurred traces of many viruses unknown to usmechanisms implied by each of the five theories summarized here might have participated in the origin of viruses as we know them today and any model will remain tentative for several obvious reasons viruses have not left a fossil record amenable to analysis with current technology moreover viral genomes can evolve at very high rates in response to environmental necessities chapter 7 and reconstructions of ancient earth environments are necessarily imprecise for these reasons viruses independently on when they became active actors in the biosphere fig 14 are unlikely to have maintained molecular signatures that could shed light on their remote pastthe viruses that infect fungi the mycoviruses recapitulate key issues on virus origins and diversity son et al 2015 roossinck 2019 two main theories of their origin are that they evolved from plant viruses that invaded fungi or that they have coexisted and coevolved with their host fungi for a long time in line with the long coevolution model of virus origins section 154 they are diverse regarding the genetic material that can be single-stranded or double-stranded rna or dna they can be either asymptomatic produce disease or modify critical host traits such as virulence again reflecting a broad range of host interactions observed with other viral groups the presence of a dsrna mycovirus in a fungus is essential for the latter to confer heat tolerance to some plants these findings have defined a three-way symbiosis required for an important phenotypic trait marquez et al 2007 roossinck 2013 see also section 173two general models have been proposed to explain the maintenance of viruses in the biological worldviruses have persisted because they parasitized opportunistically any cellular niche which was compatible with their replication apparatus and which provided adequate resources
in this view viruses are selfish replicating elements that became successful when increasingly efficient polymerization activities became part of their life cycles however several observations indicate that what was once considered purely selfish also referred to as junk cellular dna may not be that useless after all given the intimate connections between cells and viruses the view that viruses primarily exist because they are mere selfish entities seems unlikely a different issue is that under some particular environments a virus displays a selfish element-like behavior as one of the outcomes of their having been positively selected an example is the blind replication at the expense of elimination of hosts in disease processes although this is necessarily a transient behaviorthe presence of viruses was positively selected because they promoted cellular variation and functional diversification
this proposal relates to some of the theories of virus origins section 15 and the early evolution of life that implied a role for virus-like entities according to this view viruses together with other subcellular genetic elements plasmids retroelements etc penetrated the genetic material of ancestral cell forms acted as agents of lateral gene transfers and modified the expression profiles of the recipient cells probably there has been and there still is a constant flow of genes between cells and viruses and other mobile genetic elements the abundance of endogenous retroviruses in the mammalian genomes garca-montojo et al 2018 is a clear symptom of such a genetic flow a nonfunctional viral infectivity factor vif the hiv-1 protein that can counteract the mutagenic activity of the apolipoprotein b mrna editing complex apobec proteins see section 27 in chapter 2 was found in the remnant of a rabbit endogenous retrovirus termed rabbit endogenous lentivirus type k katzourakis et al 2007 about 8 of the human genome is made of retroviral-like elements present-day human endogenous retroviruses probably contribute to pluripotency of human cells santoni et al 2012 and genome regulation chuong 2018 the fusion of cells from the placenta is mediated by syncytin a protein in herv-w endogenous retroviruses chuong 2018 villarreal 2005in addition to the promotion of gene transfers to construct key cellular components viruses probably acted as selective agents for cells to evolve defense mechanisms against viruses and this may have originated new cellular functions also viruses could favor the survival of some cell types over others based on differential cell susceptibility to virus infection thus contributing to cellular diversification the need to escape viral infection may have furnished novel cell surface receptor proteins through a selection of cellular escape mutants buckling and rainey 2002 saren et al 2005 some experimental systems consisting of persistently infected cells in which the cells and the resident virus coevolve chapter 6 illustrate how viruses could act as selective agents to promote cellular variation such variation would not necessarily involve exchanges of genetic material between the virus and the cells provided sufficient genetic variation of cells took placemulticellular organisms devoid of viral entities should have endured a long-term disadvantage over an alternative scenario with the coexistence of cells and viruses selection by viruses need not be restricted to cells and it can be extended to entire host organisms and their populations an abundance of hosts may promote viral epidemiological fitness which is a factor in viral disease emergence chapters 5 and 7chapter 5chapter 7 host subpopulations may be selected by their resistance to epidemic outbreaks by highly pathogenic viruses such as in the 1918 influenza pandemics or currently with the aids or zika pandemics and ebola outbreaks in some parts of africa traditionally plagues decimated the human population and acted as selective agents for differential survival of individualsselfish-opportunistic and selected-functional are not incompatible models of virus maintenance once the instruction to replicate had been positively selected selfish elements could ensue as we learn about viral and cellular genomics the current promiscuity and diversity of viruses section 13 appear as complementary agencies to promote general biological evolution following darwinian mechanisms viruses might have contributed to the dna replication machinery of cells to the formation of the eukaryotic cell nucleus and to a number of developmental processes baranowski et al 2001 bushman 2002 bacarese-hamilton et al 2004 mallet et al 2004 villarreal 2005 villarreal 2008 forterre 2006a cells are a necessity for viruses and viruses are promoters of cell diversity and as a consequence of cellular differentiation compartmentalization and functional specializationpresent-day viruses reveal several mechanisms of exchange of genetic material that might have roots in early cellular evolution temperate bacteriophages the prototypic example being e coli phage  integrate their genomic dna in the dna of their host bacteria the uptake of cellular genes by viruses has been amply documented in transducing bacteriophages those that can transfer dna from one bacterium to another as well as in rna and dna tumor viruses even rna viruses that are not known to include a reverse transcription step in their replication cycle can incorporate host rna sequences replication-competent cytopathic variants of bovine viral diarrhea virus a type species of the genus pestivirus of the important family of pathogens flaviviridae can acquire cellular mrna sequences in their genome via nonhomologous recombination meyers et al 1989 insertion of 28s ribosomal rna sequences into the hemagglutinin gene of influenza virus increased its pathogenicity khatchikian et al 1989 some defective-interfering particles of sindbis virus included cellular trna sequences at their 5-ends monroe and schlesinger 1983 sequences related to some

genomes of birds and land vertebrates amniotes crocodilians snakes and turtles the evidence is that ehbvs are more than 207 million years old and that ancient hbv-like viruses infected animals during the mesozoic era suh et al 2014 fig 14 the existence of alternative mechanisms for the integration of viral genetic material into cellular dna suggests an ancient origin and a selective advantage of

coevolutionary interactions between hosts and their parasites vorburger and perlman 2018 frequent symbiotic and mutualistic interactions have been established with viruses human endogenous retroviruses can protect human tissues and the developing fetus against infection by some exogenous retroviruses ryan 2004 some bacteria require bacteriophage to express virulence determinants tinsley et al 2006 symbiosis can be established between bacteriophages and animals barr et al 2013 several plant rna viruses delay the symptoms of abiotic stress such as those produced by drought and frost dehydration osmotic stress and oxidative stress protection is mediated by increased levels of osmoprotectants and antioxidants in the infected plants xu et al 2008symbiotic relationships represent a state of local equilibrium between viruses and hosts triggered by compatibility and occasionally by mutual benefits an arms race implied by the virus-host interactions described in previous sections might have been the modus vivendi for viruses only interrupted by occasional armistices alternatively symbiotic and mutualistic interactions might have been the norm only interrupted by occasional defections by killer personalities that have become the key actors of hospital wards and virology textbooks roossinck 2011 li and delwart 2011 as discussed in connection with natural counterparts of the transition toward error catastrophe in viruses chapter 9 cellular editing activities such as those displayed by some of the adenosine deaminase acting on double-stranded rna and apobec proteins are also part of the innate immune response against some viruses in turn viruses have evolved multiple functions to counteract the host immune response chapter 4 the recruiting of cellular functions to confront viruses attests of transient losses of an equilibrated coexistence some middle- and long-term equilibrium between virus and host population numbers must be continuously restored by selective events otherwise this book would not have been writtenthe evolutionary origin of defense mechanisms against viruses can be regarded as a response to an excessive number of virus-cell interactions superinfection exclusion is one of the mechanisms used by present-day cells to limit replication of a virus when another one is actively replicating or incorporated into the same cell exclusion has a biochemical interpretation in the competition of two viral entities for cellular resources but it might have been boosted by early cellular adaptation to limit viral invasions chapter 4 likewise components of the intrinsic and innate immune response that prevent infection and disease might have also been endowed with activities that promoted cell variation for adaptabilitythe two opposite views of the activity of viruses in the biosphere ie opportunistic occupation of any suitable cellular niche or intimate cooperative coevolution with host cells would be expected to produce a different proportion of pathogenic viruses opportunistic invasions should lead mainly to disease-prone viruses while long coevolutionary periods should lead to a dominance of nonpathogenic viruses not all viruses that have been characterized are pathogenic and in fact only a minority of those that exist might be however since only a limited number of the viral genomes predicted by metagenomic surveys have been characterized it is not possible to adventure a proportion of beneficial or neutral versus harmful viruses in the course of investigations on poliomyelitis a search for related viruses was undertaken and a number of new viruses later to be known as echoviruses were discovered they were isolated because they caused cytopathology to cells in culture the virus-containing samples were from individuals that did not show symptoms of a viral infection the new isolates were designated as orphans meaning viruses without the disease the term echovirus derives from the enteric cytopathogenic human orphan virus some of them or their close relatives were later associated with disease syndromes but others were not viruses as diverse as circoviruses polyomaviruses or herpesviruses colonize a considerable proportion of animals and only some of the virus types are the direct cause of disease eg postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome pmws by porcine circovirus type 2 or cancer by some polyomaviruses among many other examples disease potential is unrelated to viral genome size pmws is associated with the smallest mammalian dna virus genome of only 17 kb while the almost 100-fold larger herpes virus genomes can coexist with immunocompetent humans without the noticeable diseasethe pathogenic character of a virus depends on the intricacies of virus-host interactions that are poorly understood the more the knowledge of virus-host interactions the border between the virus being pathogenic or nonpathogenic becomes fuzzier viruses may not damage essential cell functions but may affect dispensable cellular functions studies by mba oldstone and his colleagues on persistent infections of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in neuroblastoma cells demonstrated that the resident virus altered the expression of differentiated cell trait while preserving vital functions oldstone et al 1977 this is one of many examples of virus-induced modifications of the so-called luxury functions of cells oldstone 1984 disease manifestations depend on multiple host and viral factors allelic forms of several genes microbiome composition immune status coinfections with viruses or other agents and so on the dual infections with hiv-1 and hepatitis c virus hcv during the end of the 20th century accelerated the evolution of hcv-associated liver diseasein the following chapters molecular mechanisms of virus variation are reviewed in connection with virus survival and host interactions a reasonable hypothesis is that mechanisms similar to those observed in the present-day biosphere and virosphere were also in operation during the multiple transitions from a primitive replicon-based biosphere to a cellular world differentiated into different domains of life fig 15
 although this point will again be examined as part of an overview in the closing chapter of the book chapter 10 here some of the observations on the current biosphere dynamics that bear on the difficulties encountered in reconstructing the sequential transitions toward cellular differentiation are outlined the following circumstances could have blurred the relationships among evolving previral and precellular entities and among viral genomes under construction from the perspective of current genomics i episodes of evolution at rates higher than average might historically have accelerated evolution and extinction of viral and cellular genetic elements ii experimental evolution has documented that viruses often have available multiple mutational pathways to gain fitness in changing environments this could well apply to other genome assemblies at different stages of complexity the genome assemblies and linkages we observe are a set among many others possible that could have existed for prolonged time periods but that are now extinct a related aspect is that the acquisition of genomic modules from other cells or viral elements could render prior acquisitions obsolete or even detrimental in consequence an observed absence of shared genomic regions among different viral or cellular lineages from different life domains does not exclude that the shared domains had been transiently transiently meaning million years with no trace in present-day viruses or cells iii bottleneck events could have erased biological organizations that had a similar degree of adaptation than others that survived iv fitness variation associated with genomic changes due to mutation recombination or lateral gene transfers is environment-dependent and the changes in the environment over millions of years might have been dramatic such changes might have affected a limited number of local environments or most environments globally furthermore most of these potentially perturbing events might have taken place many times in unpredictable successions affecting local and few or general and many environments thus rendering reconstruction of past events from current genomics problematic domingo and perales 2019 again these contingencies will be more apparent when different facets of viral dynamics are dissected in the following chapterscontrary to the usual practice in experimental virology the contents of this chapter have forced a considerable degree of uncertainty and at times speculative argumentation it was however a necessary exercise since at least part of what we see today in viruses must have roots in the origin of life and the role of viruses in life development during epochs that humans have not witnessed we are left with trying to reconstruct this chapter is excitingly as close to physics and chemistry as it is to biology many of the questions addressed are open to debate and they will probably remain open for a long time interestingly the terms heterogeneity and complexity have appeared several times in this chapter anticipating features of present-day viruses discussed in the upcoming chapters complex populations be they of viruses cells protocells lipid vesicles primitive replicons or peptide soups are the raw materials on which natural selection can act primitiveness does not imply simplicity complexity was likely a constant trait for early and modern life both for the extinguished unknown viruses and for those we strive to understand and control see summary box
summary box
life is characterized by four integrated features replication evolvability metabolism and compartmentalization it is debated whether replication or metabolism was the dominant triggering factorat least two ancestral positive selection events might have contributed to the development of life the selection of replicating over nonreplicating polymers and selection of splitting-prone versus nonsplitting-prone membrane vesiclespresent-day viruses may be descendants from the primitive replicons that participated in early life prior to cellular organizations or from structured cells by escape or reductionkey features of many present-day viruses may be an inheritance of primitive replicons notably error-prone replication spread through membrane structures and tendency to engage in genome integration and transfersthe geological record indicates multiple brief and drastic mass extinction events in earths history such events anticipate mass extinction of the resident viruses a dynamics of emergences reemergences and extinctions might have operated historically at a grand-scale with mechanisms similar to those we observe with present-day viruses present virosphere dynamics suggests difficulties to reconstruct events that spanned millions of years

the life objective of any organism is to reproduce and a pathogen is an organism that can cause disease in its host while attempting to achieve this goal there are five major types of pathogens extracellular bacteria intracellular bacteria viruses parasites and fungi bacteria are microscopic single-celled organisms that are considered prokaryotic because they do not have the true nucleus found in eukaryotes the prokaryotic nucleus lacks a nuclear membrane and the genetic material of these organisms is usually contained in a single linear chromosome extracellular bacteria do not have to enter host cells to reproduce while intracellular bacteria do at this point the reader should take a moment to familiarize him- or herself
with the common terms and concepts used in classifying or discussing bacteria box 22-1
 viruses are not considered to be either prokaryotic or eukaryotic viruses are acellular particles consisting of a protein coat called a capsid encasing a genome of either dna or rna due to their small size viruses can only be observed with an electron microscope to propagate a virus must enter a host cell possessing protein synthesis machinery that the virus can exploit parasites and fungi are eukaryotic organisms that possess several chromosomes contained in a membrane-bounded nucleus parasites all share the characteristic of taking advantage of and being dependent on a host organism for both habitat and nutrition at some point in their life cycles usually damaging the host but not killing it the major classes of parasites are the protozoa which are single-celled organisms and the helminth worms which are multicellular while some parasites may be only a few micrometers in size many are significantly larger with some worms reaching several meters in length fungi are eukaryotic organisms that can exist comfortably outside a host but that will invade and colonize a host if given the opportunity fungi may be single-celled as in the case of yeast or multicellular as in bread molds prions are curious entities that are infectious but appear to be made entirely of protein and lack any type of nucleic acid prions cause disease by altering normal proteins in the brain of the infected hostbox 22-1classification of bacteriabacteria have been traditionally classified on the basis of their shapes and groupings their use of oxygen and their gram stain status despite the advent of dna technology these terms of reference remain entrenched in the microbiological research community for our discussions of bacteria in the context of immunology we have divided the bacteria into the extracellular and intracellular categories depending on where they live in the body in relation to host cells both these categories contain members of each of the groups described hereshapes and groupingsbacterial cells come in various shapes and groupings that are associated with specific nomenclature the most common bacterial shapes are rod-like which are the bacilli little staffs singular is bacillus spherical or ovoid which are the cocci berries singular is coccus and comma forms and spirals bacteria may also be star-shaped or square although these shapes are less common cocci are commonly grouped in pairs diplo chains strepto or clusters staphylo giving rise to diplococci streptococci and staphylococci bacilli are found in pairs and chains giving rise to diplobacilli and streptobacilli spirals are usually found singly but may occur as spirilla rigid helix or spirochetes flexible helix vibrios are comma-shaped bacteriause of oxygenmicrobes in general and bacteria in particular are often described with respect to their use of oxygen those that can use oxygen are called aerobes while those that do not are called anaerobes a microbe that uses oxygen when available but can live anaerobically in the absence of oxygen is said to be a facultative aerobe those microbes that must have oxygen to survive are called obligate aerobes while those that can grow only in the complete absence of molecular oxygen are called obligate anaerobes


gram stain statusbacteria are also classified into two groups according to how they appear when stained in the laboratory using the multi-step gram stain procedure developed in 1884 by hans christian gram one group of bacteria has cell walls with many layers of peptidoglycan interwoven with both lipotechoic and techoic acid these relatively thick cell walls retain the dark purple color imposed by the initial step of the staining procedure despite undergoing a later decolorizing step and counterstaining with the red dye safranin bacteria staining purple in this fashion are called gram-positive bacteria the other group called gram-negative bacteria have a cell wall with a thin peptidoglycan layer that loses its integrity during the staining procedure allowing decolorization to occur the purple color vanishes allowing the cells to stain red with safranin as well as peptidoglycan the gram-negative cell wall has an outer plasma membrane containing lipopolysaccharide macromolecules composed of lipid a conserved among all gram-negative species and an o-linked polysaccharide o-ps variable among gram-negative species functionally the o-linked polysaccharide confers virulence the ability to infect host cells on the bacterium it is the lipid a moiety that functions as an endotoxin capable of inducing the endotoxic shock described in box 17-2gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria can also be distinguished by their differential susceptibility to physical assaults as well as various enzymes and drugs for example gram-positive bacteria resist dry conditions better than gram-negative bacteria and cannot be crushed as readily gram-positive bacteria are more resistant to lysozyme digestion and killing by streptomycin and tetracycline but are highly susceptible to penicillin anionic detergents and basic dyes in contrast gram-negative bacteria resist lysozyme digestion and killing by penicillin but dry out easily are inhibited by basic dyes and are susceptible to killing by tetracyclinepanel b adapted from microbiology an introduction 6th and 7th edns 2002 2004 gerard j tortora berdell r funke christine l case eds published by benjamin cummings san francisco panel d courtesy of dr tony mazzulli mount sinai hospital torontodisease is not the same as infection infection is said to have occurred when an organism successfully avoids innate defense mechanisms and stably colonizes a niche in the body to establish an infection the invader must first penetrate the anatomic and physiological barriers that guard the skin and mucosal surfaces of the host secondly the organism must be able to survive in the host cellular milieu long enough to reproduce this replication may or may not cause visible clinical damage to the host tissues symptoms that we call disease it should be noted that sometimes the products released by a pathogen such as bacterial toxins are sufficient to cause disease even in the absence of widespread pathogen colonization an emerging infectious disease is a disorder that has come to light only within the past couple of decades or is changing in character such that it has an increased impact on the global population table 22-1
contains short descriptions of several emerging infectious diseasesin addition to direct destruction by pathogen actions host tissues are often injured by collateral damage inflicted by the immune response itself as it strives to destroy the pathogen this damage results in immunopathic disease symptoms ctls may directly induce the lysis of bystander host cells via cytotoxic cytokine secretion or phagocytes may release antimicrobial factors like h2o2 or free radicals that are also toxic to host cells a very dramatic example of immunopathic damage occurs in mice infected in the brain with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus lcmv elsewhere in the body this virus is quite harmless to the animals in the brain however the ctl response to the virus results in neuron cytolysis that kills the mice the endotoxic shock triggered by the lps of gram-negative bacteria refer to box 17-2 is another example of immunopathic damage several other examples are given in table 22-2

virulence is the ability to invade host tissues and cause disease in the host the more virulent a pathogen is the better able it is to resist the immune system many factors affect virulence how quickly the pathogen can access a host cell andor replicate whether the pathogen can express molecules that damage the host or dampen its immune response and whether the host mhc and prr molecules can recognize the pathogens processed peptides and pamps respectively if the immune system is able to eliminate the organism before it can successfully propagate the infection is said to have been abortive if however the pathogen multiplies despite the actions of the immune system the infection is productive whether an infection is abortive or productive depends on the initial dose of the pathogen accessing the host the virulence of the organism and the strength and rapidity of the immune responses mounted to combat the invasion the latter will be determined in part by whether the host has been previously exposed to the pathogen in question in the last phase of a productive infection the progeny of the pathogen escape the original host and travel to new onesan ongoing struggle or horse race is thus established between a pathogen and the immune system the pathogen tries to replicate and expand its niche and the immune system tries to eliminate the pathogen or at least confine it the interval between the time of infection and the onset of disease is called the incubation time which can vary considerably in length depending on the lifestyle of the pathogen an infection is said to be acute when it causes disease symptoms that appear rapidly but remain for only a short time a persistent infection is one in which the pathogen remains in the hosts body for prolonged periods or possibly throughout life persistent infections may result in chronic disease if symptoms are experienced on an ongoing or recurring basis in other cases a persistent pathogen may lurk for an extended time without producing any symptoms in which case the infection is latent a pathogen may or may not be infectious during latency a person with a latent infection that can be transmitted unknowingly to others is a carrier
the threat of pathogen attack has prompted hosts to evolve immune responses designed to repel and neutralize the invaders and stop their appropriation of host resources naturally the pathogens whose evolution occurs much more rapidly than that of their hosts have responded with the development of various evasion strategies designed to outwit or compromise the hosts immune response for example a host population may be resistant to a certain pathogen because of an effective neutralizing antibody response that prevents the pathogen from gaining a foothold on host cells however if the pathogen undergoes a mutation that allows it to make novel use of a host surface protein to enter the cell the pathogen can escape the humoral response the host population is once again susceptible to diseaseas described in chapter 20 the first lines of defense encountered by any pathogen are the intact skin and mucosae the vast majority of microorganisms cannot penetrate the tough keratin layer protecting the epidermis and any pathogen arriving on the skin surface has to compete with the commensal flora for space and nutrients furthermore the routine shedding of skin layers often deposes a pathogen before it has a chance to establish a firm foothold similarly in the mucosae pathogens ingested into the gut or inhaled into the respiratory tract are for the most part trapped by mucus and secretory iga coating the mucosal surfaces microbicidal molecules in the body secretions and the low ph and hydrolases in the gut also take their toll however should there be a wound in the skin or the mucosae that allows a pathogen access to tissues underlying the epithelium the consequences can be severe some organisms are opportunistic pathogens in that they do not cause disease unless offered an unexpected opportunity by a failure in host defense staphylococcus aureus is an example of an extracellular bacterium that is not particularly invasive and that normally colonizes the skin surface without harming the host if inhaled s aureus is successfully repelled by an intact respiratory epithelial layer however should the skin experience a tear or the respiratory epithelium be damaged by trauma or another more invasive pathogen s aureus can take advantage of the breach and establish a serious infection when the opportunity arises to invade the respiratory tract staphylococcal pneumonia can result opportunistic invasions are a major problem in hosts immunocompromised either by disease or by design for example patients on immunosuppressive therapy following a tissue transplant or those whose immune systems have been destroyed by hiv are vulnerable to infection by the opportunistic pathogens pneumocystis carinii and candida albicans
a small minority of microorganisms are invasive pathogens capable of entering the body even when surface defenses are intact as we learned in chapter 20 some viruses and bacteria as we shall see later in this chapter can target the antigen-collecting m cells of the mucosal follicle-associated epithelium fae to effect entry while other pathogens have the capacity to adhere to host molecules expressed on cutaneous or mucosal epithelial cells still other pathogens exploit host surface molecules as receptors inducing receptor-mediated internalization many highly invasive pathogens can be found in the group a streptococcus bacteria that cause 15000 severe infections per year in the united statesmost times a pathogen that succeeds in penetrating the skin or mucosae either through a wound or via exploitation of host cell receptors meets effective innate defense in the form of subepithelial macrophages and nk cells and intraepithelial  t cells fig 22-1
 table 22-3
contains a list of the abbreviations used in the figures in this chapter molecules on the pathogen surface may be recognized directly by the prrs of resident macrophages by the activatory receptors of nk cells and by the restricted tcrs of  t cells and nkt cells inflammatory responses are mounted that first draw neutrophils into the site of incursion different types of pathogens elicit the production of different classes of chemokines that facilitate the inflammatory response for example acute infection by an extracellular gram-positive bacterium such as streptococcus pneumoniae results in the production of predominantly cxc chemokines particularly il-8 that summon the neutrophils required to eliminate the bacteria the lipopolysaccharides of the cell walls present in gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli are also powerful inducers of cxc chemokine secretion in contrast infection with a bacterial spirochete such as borrelia burgdorferi leads to a more chronic condition eventually requiring action by macrophages and lymphocytes infection with this extracellular organism provokes the secretion by activated macrophages of cc eg mcp-1 or c eg lymphotactin chemokines that attract the required cellsinflammatory cells responding to an invading pathogen produce toxic substances such as nitric oxide no and acute phase proteins and cytotoxic and activatory cytokines such as tnf and ifn complement components that either have leaked into the tissue from the blood or were produced by cells in the site of attack may be activated by either the alternative or lectin pathways the pathogen will then be coated in c3b or c3d enhancing phagocytosis via complement receptors on phagocytes mac-mediated destruction of the pathogen may also ensue if a membranous structure is present other complement components serve as chemoattractants drawing more phagocytic cells to the site of attack after phagocytes have engulfed an invader molecules such as lactoferrin are introduced into the phagosome to sequester iron atoms further inhibiting bacterial growth despite all these measures a pathogen may avoid phagocytosis opsonized or otherwise and access the blood circulation bacteremia viremia and parasitemia are terms referring to the presence in the blood of bacteria viruses or parasites respectively innate defense in the blood falls to blood monocytes and neutrophils should the pathogen reach the liver or the spleen the macrophages present in these organs attempt to confine the invader a pathogen tough enough to escape these measures may successfully colonize other organs and cause serious abscessesas the innate response proceeds the pathogen or some of its components interact with the prrs expressed on macrophages and dcs and are ingested resulting in activation of these cell types such that they become capable of acting as apcs for the adaptive response the products of many species of bacteria and protozoa particularly lipopolysaccharides are potent activators of dcs promoting their maturation into fully competent apcs as well the dna of some parasites and bacteria particularly if it is unmethylated can activate dcs via binding to tlr9 the dna of these organisms but not that of vertebrates contains stretches of unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanosine residues called cpg motifs tlr9 appears to be specific for these motifs lipopolysaccharides also induce the upregulation of the b7 molecules cd40 and mhc class i and ii on the dc surface and promote dc migration to the secondary lymphoid tissues cytokine production by dcs including tnf il-12 il-10 il-6 and lfn is induced the arrival of activated antigen-bearing macrophages and dcs in the local lymph node stimulates the activation of naive t and b cells the adaptive immune response then proceeds in its bid to eliminate the pathogen as is described later the adaptive response effector mechanisms most effective in countering a pathogen are determined by the invaders lifestyle and mode of replicationwe move now to a discussion of each class of pathogen the details of the immune response effector mechanisms employed by the host to combat them and the evasion tactics used by each to escape the immune systemthe most common extracellular bacteria causing acute human infections are species of streptococcus and staphylococcus for example streptococcus pneumoniae also known in short-hand as pneumococcus infection can lead to pneumonia while group a streptococci are responsible for the severe throat infections commonly known as strep throat staphylococcus aureus is responsible for many minor infections of the skin and mucosae but also produces toxins causing food poisoning or toxic shock syndrome a much more serious disease caused by either staphylococcus aureus or group a streptococci alone or by both in combination is necrotizing fasciitis more commonly known as flesh-eating disease necrotizing fasciitis is characterized by the sudden onset of a rapidly spreading inflammatory infection that destroys the fascia the layers of tissue covering the subcutaneous muscle layers the skin and subcutaneous tissue become separated from the underlying muscles and the patient experiences fever severe pain and a reddened swelling that spreads extremely quickly under the surface of the affected body part affected limbs may have to be amputated necrotizing fasciitis most often occurs in adults who have undergone surgery or experienced physical trauma of some sort or who have compromised immune systems thankfully this disease is rare incidence of 0307 per 100000 persons per year but it is fatal in 2030 of casesone of the most feared but rare diseases resulting from a gram-positive bacillus infection is botulism caused by a neurotoxin see later produced by clostridium botulinum c botulinum is an anaerobic bacterium that commonly resides in the form of dormant spores in soil fresh water and house dust and on the surfaces of many foods upon introduction into a suitable low oxygen habitat the bacterium resumes replication and production of the neurotoxin unfortunately such an environment is sometimes provided by home-canned or home-preserved foods that did not receive adequate heat treatment within 836 hours after consuming food contaminated by even a minuscule amount of c botulinum neurotoxin the patient experiences blurred or double vision slurred speech swallowing and breathing difficulties and muscle weakness due to paralysis of the muscle caused by the neurotoxin recovery may take weeks or months and 78 of patients diean example of a pathogenic gram-negative coccus is neisseria meningitidis a member of the meningococci n meningitidis causes bacterial meningitis a severe inflammation of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord the meninges about 10 of the general population carries these bacteria harmlessly in the nose and back of throat however in the rare event that these bacteria enter the blood travel to the brain and attack the meninges toxins produced by these organisms induce inflammation that damages the brain the patient complains of a severe headache rash lethargy and a stiff neck and avoids looking at bright lights in some cases the patient may enter a coma which can be fatal for unknown reasons children under the age of 5 years and college and university students are at particularly high risk for contracting bacterial meningitis kissing and the sharing of items such as food and beverage utensils or even musical instrument mouthpieces can transmit the bacterium between individuals
e coli strain o157h7 is a gram-negative bacillus that causes hemorrhagic colitis more commonly known as hamburger disease e coli o157h7 lives harmlessly in the intestines of most food animals including pigs chickens and cattle during slaughter the bacterium transfers to the exterior surfaces of the butchered meat in the case of beef the grinding of a cut of beef into hamburger distributes the bacterium throughout the meat if this hamburger not cooked thoroughly and is eaten the bacterium survives and commences replication in the human gut the consumption of water contaminated by the manure of farm animals can also cause the disease the patient experiences hemorrhagic colitis bloody diarrhea which may be accompanied by vomiting abdominal cramps and fever a toxin see later produced by e coli o157h7 attacks the endothelial cells lining the bodys small blood vessels allowing the leakage of blood into the tissues a potentially fatal complication of hemorrhagic colitis that occurs in 27 of infected patients usually the young or very old is hemolytic uremic syndrome because the toxin can kill the endothelial cells lining the tiny blood vessels of the glomerulus of the kidney severe kidney damage can result such that the patient may permanently require dialysis after recovery about 5 of hemolytic uremic syndrome cases are fatala particularly nasty subgroup of extracellular gram-negative bacteria are the spirochetes including members of the genera borrelia leptospira and treponema b burgdorferi is the pathogen that causes lyme disease lyme disease named after the connecticut town in which it was discovered is characterized by a skin rash often accompanied by acute arthritis andor carditis the pathogen is transmitted to humans by way of tick bites various species of leptospira cause leptospirosis a disease characterized by acute fever that can lead to liver and kidney damage contact with urine from leptospiruric animals including pet dogs is the primary route of transmission to humans syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by invasion of the genital mucosae by treponema pallidum the pathogen replicates rapidly at first but then can enter a latent phase recurrences erupting several years after the initial infection can lead to damage of the aorta central nervous system eyes and earsan organism that has become a topic of much public concern lately is the organism that causes anthrax bacillus anthracis this large gram-positive extracellular bacterium is a common pathogen of hoofed livestock and range animals it lives in the soil of farm and range lands and produces spores that can survive in soil for decades while b anthracis infection occurs commonly in livestock it rarely infects humans indeed prior to the bioterrorism attacks through the postal system in the united states in the fall of 2001 the last case of inhalation anthrax in the united states was recorded in 1976 when b anthracis does infect a human the resulting anthrax disease takes one of three forms inhalation the most lethal cutaneous and gastrointestinal if left untreated any type of anthrax can lead to septicemia and death cutaneous anthrax the most common form usually occurs after introduction into a skin abrasion of bacteria from contaminated meat wool hides or leather of infected animals skin lesions develop within 12 days of exposure and become necrotic patients may also experience fever and lymph node swelling gastrointestinal anthrax occurs after consumption of raw or undercooked contaminated meat severe abdominal symptoms including bloody diarrhea vomiting and fever occur within a week of exposure inhalation anthrax is contracted by breathing aerosolized spores of b anthracis it was originally thought that thousands of spores had to be inhaled to cause disease but that number has been revised downward in light of the deaths of mail workers exposed to more modest bacterial loads within 7 days of exposure to aerosolized b anthracis symptoms resembling a viral respiratory illness ensue that rapidly progress to shock respiratory failure and sometimes meningitis death occurs in 75 of cases even with aggressive antibiotic therapydifferent exotoxins cause disease by different means and in different locations depending on the proclivities of the individual bacterial species for example infection with v cholerae results in the local release of an exotoxin that binds to gut epithelial cells a massive release of electrolytes and tissue fluids is induced that is manifested as the severe diarrhea that characterizes cholera although they are derived from extracellular bacteria many bacterial exotoxins have the ability to translocate into mammalian cells and wreak havoc on intracellular processes the diphtheria exotoxin secreted by corynebacterium diphtheriae travels the body systemically and is absorbed by cells of the heart and peripheral nervous system the toxin inhibits protein synthesis in these cells leading to myocarditis and neuritis the diphtheria exotoxin also promotes colonization of the throat by the bacterium which provokes an acute inflammatory response resulting in severe respiratory obstruction as mentioned previously c botulinum produces a neurotoxin that blocks the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles resulting in paralysis this toxin is much feared as a potential biological weapon because a dose of less than 1 g is fatal to humans another clostridium species clostridium tetani synthesizes a neurotoxin that causes uncontrollable muscle contractions other exotoxins trigger specific host cell necrosis such as the leukocidin produced by s aureus that is toxic to granulocytes another example is the exotoxin produced by e coli o157h7 which causes severe hemorrhaging because it blocks protein synthesis within vascular endothelial cells and kills them b anthracis produces two exotoxins called lethal toxin and edema toxin that damage phagocytes in an unknown way lethal toxin is composed of a zinc protease called lethal factor and a protein called protective antigen while edema toxin is composed of an adenylate cyclase called edema factor plus protective antigenextracellular bacteria furnish many examples of situations in which the adaptive immune response to the infection results in immunopathic disease in some cases the destruction is caused by endotoxins and in others an exotoxin is responsible it is also becoming apparent that prolonged infection with many organisms can sometimes lead to the production of antibodies or activation of t cells that cross-react with self tissues causing inflammation and possibly autoimmune disease the concept of molecular mimicry in which a pathogen antigen resembles a self antigen enough to provoke an attack on self tissues by anti-pathogen antibodies and t cells is explored fully in chapter 29damage to a host caused by an endotoxin is always immunopathic and occurs by the same mechanism in each case as described in box 22-1 the cell wall of a gram-negative bacterium contains lipopolysaccharides composed of the endotoxin lipid a and one of several o-linked polysaccharides o-ps not only are the o-ps moieties often specific to a particular bacterial species but they are also immunogenic leading to their designation as o-specific antigens when the immune system responds to these antigens and destroys a gram-negative bacterium its membrane disintegrates and lipid a is released into the blood or gastrointestinal tract the presence of lipid a induces a massive release of cytokines particularly tnf that cause high fever and endotoxic shock refer to box 17-2 for example in the case of helicobacter pylori infection th1 cells responding to this organism produce large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines principally tnf and ifn that exacerbate the injury to the gastric lining and promote the formation of stomach ulcers thus current treatments for ulcers include a course of antibiotics to tackle the problem at its rootan effect similar to endotoxic shock can result from the polyclonal activation of cd4 t cells by bacterial exotoxins that are superantigens refer to box 14-2 the reader will recall that t cell activation by a superantigen does not depend on either specific peptide or costimulation the simultaneous activation of a wide variety of different t cell clones results in the production of huge quantities of pro-inflammatory cytokines in addition some of the activated t cell clones may be directed against self antigens these clones would normally be held anergic in the presence of the self antigens in the host but may go on to attack self tissues after non-specific activation by the bacterial exotoxinextracellular bacteria by definition cannot routinely hide within host cells thus the antibodies of the humoral response are generally highly effective against these species indeed patients who are deficient in immunoglobulins agammaglobulinemic and infected with an extracellular bacterium can be successfully treated by a passive transfer of specific anti-bacterial antibodies for a normal healthy individual the polysaccharides present in bacterial cell walls make perfect ti antigens for b cell activation while other bacterial components supply td antigens that induce primarily a th2 response and help for b cells recognizing bacterial td antigens anti-bacterial antibodies of the polymeric igm isotype dominate in the vascular system while igg antibodies because of their smaller size are able to access the tissuesas we learned in the first section of this book antibodies can neutralize bacteria by physically blocking them from attaching to host cell surfaces even though they do not need to enter host cells for replication most extracellular bacteria adhere to host cells to avoid being swept off or out of the host by skin sloughing or movement of the intestinal contents small hair-like molecules called pili on the exterior surface of the bacterium allow it to stick to glycoproteins on host cells via a lectin-like mechanism different bacterial species bear different types of pili that interact with different ligands on host cells in different locations thus the nature of the pili can determine where in the body the bacteria will attempt to establish colonization binding of antibody to a protein in the pili can inhibit bacterial adherence to a host cell allowing the invader to be flushed awayantibodies can also serve as opsonins coating the surface of the bacterium such that it becomes a more attractive target for phagocytosis mediated by neutrophils and macrophages that express fc receptors extracellular bacteria are generally very vulnerable to the killing mechanisms that operate within a phagosome changes in ph within the phagosome defensins and the action of the reactive oxygen intermediates rois and reactive nitrogen intermediates rnis all contribute to bacterial killingantibodies are also made against the exotoxins used by bacteria to kill or disable host cells antitoxins are antibodies that bind to the toxin itself not the bacterium producing it and either cause its rapid removal or block its active site effective antitoxins are often of the igg isotype because of the ability of this class to diffuse into the tissues antitoxins can also act as opsonins and enhance the clearance of the toxin by phagocytes sometimes secretory iga can act as an antitoxin by preventing a toxin from making contact with and damaging a body tract such as the airway if the toxin is the sole element causing disease in the host the production of the antitoxin alone will be enough to restore health for example human resistance to tetanus relies on the presence of antibodies directed against the exotoxins produced by clostridium tetani the tetanus toxoid vaccination that we receive as infants followed by tetanus boosters every 10 years is a preparation of inactivated tetanus exotoxin that serves to induce and maintain the production of neutralizing antitoxin antibodies see ch 23 not surprisingly antigenic variation can influence antitoxin effectiveness for example the composition of a bacterial exotoxin may vary slightly among strains such that an antitoxin generated in an exposure to one strain may not recognize the epitopes of exotoxin produced by a later infection with a second strain the advantage of secondary response levels of antibody is lost as the host is forced to mount a primary response to the new epitopeall three pathways of complement activation can be brought to bear on extracellular bacteria the binding of antibody to a pathogen allows mac-mediated destruction of some bacterial species by the classical pathway of complement activation the alternative pathway can be activated in the absence of antibody by peptidoglycan in gram-positive cell walls or lps in gram-negative cell walls because of their more delicate membrane structure gram-negative bacteria usually succumb more rapidly to complement-mediated lysis than gram-positive bacteria lastly the lectin pathway is activated by the binding of mbl to the distinctive sugars arranged on the surfaces of bacterial cells as we saw in chapter 19 complement-mediated lysis is particularly crucial for defense against the neisseria group of gram-negative extracellular bacteria patients lacking the terminal complement components are still able to resist most bacterial infections but not those initiated by these pathogensresolution of an infection by an extracellular bacterium cannot always be directly equated with elimination by the antibodies of a th2 response for example infection with the extracellular bacterium yersinia enterocolitica is associated primarily with a th1 response an interesting observation since this pathogen was originally thought to replicate intracellularly other particularly invasive or insidious extracellular pathogens such as the spirochetes provoke a combination of th1 and th2 responses for example immune responses to b burgdorferi and t pallidum have both humoral and inflammatory cell-mediated components even so these organisms are difficult to eradicate and development of a secondary response adequate to protect against re-infection develops only slowly if at all a clue to this intransigence may arise from the study of immune responses against borrelia recurrentis which causes recurring febrile episodes most of these bacteria are eliminated by the humoral response but a few mutate just at the very end of the acute infection and escape immune system eliminationmast cells play a prominent role in defense against extracellular bacteria in particular against gram-negative species expressing a bacterial adhesin protein called fimh mast cells lurking in the malt both phagocytose the offending bacteria and release inflammatory mediators such as tnf leukotrienes especially lt4 il-6 and histamine one of
the primary functions of these mediators is to promote the release of il-8 and thus recruit neutrophils to the site of pathogen invasion lt4 is itself a powerful chemoattractant for neutrophils and tnf enhances the microbicidal activities of these cells the importance of mast cells for defense against gram-negative bacteria has been convincingly demonstrated in ww mice mutant animals that lack mast cells whereas wild-type mice were able to shrug off a peritoneal challenge with a fimh-expressing enterobacterium over 80 of ww mice died after infection with this pathogen if the ww mice were injected with tnf neutrophil emigration into the site of infection increased and the mice survivedmany species of gonococci enhance their chances of maintaining adhesion to a non-phagocytic host cell by routinely and spontaneously altering the expression of their pili a large number of normally silent loci in the gonococcal genome allow frequent gene conversion refer to box 21-3 between the active pilin locus and the silent loci resulting in an altered nucleotide sequence that translates into an adhesion protein of modified amino acid sequence neutralizing antibodies directed against epitopes in one version of the pilin protein may not see the new pili allowing the bacterium to maintain its adhesion and establish an infectioncertain pathogenic bacteria secrete proteases that cleave antibody proteins for example neisseria gonorrhoeae haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus sanguis express iga-specific proteases that degrade both siga antibodies in the blood and secretory iga antibodies protecting the mucosae these proteases are preferentially directed against iga1 and usually cleave this molecule in its hinge region in this case the antibody loses the domains required for binding to fc receptors limiting its effector functions in addition the truncated antibody may bind to the pathogen using its fab region but lacks the ability to agglutinate the microbes a similar protease from proteus mirabilis which causes urinary tract infections can cleave iga1 iga2 and iggmany extracellular bacteria including n meningitidis s pneumoniae and h influenzae avoid phagocytosis by covering themselves in a polysaccharide coating called a capsule encapsulated bacteria the capsule confers a charge and hydrophilic character to the bacterial surface that inhibits binding to phagocyte receptors c3b may still attach to the bacterial surface but the capsule sterically interferes with the binding of the phagocytes receptors to the c3b instead the host must synthesize opsonizing antibodies to allow a phagocyte to successfully attach to these invaders encapsulated bacteria therefore have more time several days than unencapsulated bacteria to reproduce undisturbed making them more dangerous pathogens for example alveolar macrophages cannot engulf the encapsulated bacterium s pneumoniae unless it is opsonized allowing early establishment of the bacteria in the lungs eventually antibodies to components of the capsule are made that facilitate destruction of the bacteria by complement-mediated lysis however if this tactic is not rapid enough pneumonia can result those with deficits in the humoral response such as the very young the very old and the immunocompromised are especially susceptible to infections with encapsulated bacteria to protect healthy adults at particular risk of exposure to these pathogens a vaccine has been developed that contains the capsule components of several species see ch 23 a dangerous wrinkle in the capsule story is that some streptococci have capsules made of substances that are chemically identical to human components such as hyaluronic acid antibodies raised against such substances might have the unwelcome collateral effect of promoting autoimmunity such considerations have mandated caution in vaccination against these pathogenssome extracellular bacteria avoid capture by hostile phagocytes by entering non-phagocytes such as epithelial cells and fibroblasts the pathogens inject bacterial proteins into the host cell that promote cytoskeletal rearrangements facilitating macropinocytosis the bacteria are taken up by the non-phagocytes and thus gain unmolested access to the tissues receptor-mediated endocytosis can be exploited in a similar way for example enteropathogenic e coli injects the tir translocation intimin receptor protein into the cytoplasm of epithelial cells the act of injection induces a rearrangement of the host cell cytoskeleton that results in tir being fixed in the plasma membrane ready to act as a receptor for the surface protein intimin on the bacterium receptor-mediated endocytosis ensues importing the bacterium into the non-phagocytic cellsome species of yersinia have direct anti-phagocyte activity y enterocolitica is an extracellularly replicating enteric pathogen that targets the fae of the pps and causes severe diarrhea this bacterium forestalls phagocytosis by attaching to the exterior of a looming macrophage and injecting a set of so-called yop proteins into the macrophage cytoplasm among the yop proteins is yoph a phosphatase that binds to certain tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the macrophage that are thought to be involved in intracellular signaling and the operation of its actin cytoskeleton when yoph dephosphorylates these host proteins disruptions in intracellular signaling block integrin-mediated phagocytosis of the bacterium a different yop protein appears to induce the apoptosis of macrophages at least in vitro
evasion of the complement system is a time-honored strategy employed by a vast array of pathogens specific methods include avoiding recognition by complement proteins removing any attached complement proteins exploiting various host rca regulators of complement activation proteins to either inactivate the complement cascade or gain access to a host cell and expressing molecules that resemble host complement components or rcas many anti-complement strategies employed by extracellular bacteria are shared by intracellular bacteria viruses and parasites box 22-3
explores in depth several of these tactics from the point of view of a particular complement system componentbox 22-3avoidance of the complement system by pathogensthe complement system is a vital contributor to the defense of the host in both the innate and adaptive immune responses naturally therefore pathogens have devoted much time and energy to devising ways to confound the complement system or to make use of it for their own ends pathogens can avert complement-mediated destruction by presenting a cell surface that does not permit deposition of c3b avoiding recognition by shedding incipient complexes as they form by destroying or inhibiting various complement proteins by acquiring host rca proteins andor by expressing molecules that closely resemble host rca proteins at any one time a given pathogen may be able to use just one or several of these mechanisms to protect itselfa pathogen can avoid complement recognition if the surface moieties it expresses do not bind c3b or antibody well or at all the surface glycoproteins of some parasites and capsules of some bacteria fit this description for example some species of gram-negative bacteria avoid detection by expressing lps residues with unusual side chain sugars these sugars mask the lps determinants that would normally bind to c3b and activate complement via the alternative pathway another avoidance mechanism is the shedding of activatory surface moieties or immune complexes as occurs for the parasites schistosoma mansoni and trypanosoma cruzi respectively some organisms express molecules that disrupt one or more complement activation pathways for example protein h expressed by streptococcus pyogenes binds to c1 but does not allow the cascade to proceed competitively inhibiting the classical pathway several members of the poxvirus and herpesvirus families secrete proteins that block formation of the alternate c3 convertase even if either c3 or c1 has succeeded in initiating complement activation many pathogens such as the bacterium escherichia coli and the parasite leishmania major respond by shedding the complex particularly at the mac formation stage proteolytic degradation and phosphorylation of complement components are also used by many organisms to derail mac assembly before it can go too far some organisms like certain borrelia and salmonella species express proteins that inhibit the terminal complement proteins so that c6 deposition is blocked or c9 polymerization is inhibitedanother effective strategy for blocking complement-mediated destruction is to acquire the host rca proteins that normally protect host cells budding viruses take sections of the host cell membrane with them as they emerge and embedded in the membrane are host rca proteins daf and mirl are acquired by hiv and vaccinia in this way other organisms express molecules that adsorb soluble rca proteins from the host plasma the host rca proteins retain their regulatory activity even when bound to a bacterial surface so that the alternative pathway of complement activation is inhibited for example the fluid phase rca proteins factor h and c4bp can be bound to the m proteins of streptococcus pyogenes the c4bpm protein binding is completely sufficient to halt complement-mediated opsonization and phagocytosis c4bp has also been shown to bind to all known strains of bordetella pertussis in neisseria gonorrhea both surface sialic acids and an outer membrane protein called porin can bind factor haltering the expression of host rca and cr proteins is another means of countering complement some intracellular pathogens induce new expression of rca proteins to block complement-mediated destruction thus preserving the pathogens chosen home for example daf and mcp expression are upregulated on cells infected with human cmv and a modified form of daf appears on cells infected with plasmodium berghei hiv downregulates the expression of cr1 and cr2 on the infected host cell reducing opsonized phagocytosis hiv also reduces the expression of c5ar by monocytes decreasing the chemotaxis of these cells to sites of infection and inflammation a related mode of pathogen defense is the expression of molecules that resemble host rca proteins proteins with similar structures and functions to mammalian cr1 daf mcp c4bp and mirl have been described in viruses such as vaccinia kshv and hsv as well as in parasites such as schistosoma entamoeba and trypanosoma studies of herpesvirus saimiri have shown that this virus has apparently acquired the cdna for mammalian mirl and incorporated it into the viral genome the virus induces the expression of a gpi-anchored protein in the host cell membrane that closely resembles monkey mirl and protects against mac-mediated lysislastly some bacteria and parasites proteolytically inactivate complement cascade products such as the anaphylatoxins c5a and c3a a lack of these molecules dampens the inflammatory response and gives the pathogen more time to multiply or hide for example a membrane-bound enzyme that removes the c-terminus of c5a is expressed on the surface of streptococciperhaps the simplest approach to evading complement has been taken by the organism causing syphilis t pallidum the outer membrane of this gram-negative bacterium is strikingly devoid of transmembrane proteins offering almost no place suitable for the deposition of complement components other bacteria avoid complement-mediated lysis due to the nature of the o-ps of their cell wall lipopolysaccharides classical complement activation mediated by antibodies directed against the o-ps can eliminate a bacterium however if the polysaccharide chains of the o-ps are very long and project a great distance from the bacterial cell wall the mac cannot assemble on the bacterial surface and the invader is spared bacteria expressing o-ps with short polysaccharide chains are vulnerable to complement-mediated lysismany extracellular bacteria secrete enzymes that inactivate various steps of the complement cascade for example group b streptococci which cause neonatal meningitis contain sialic acid in their cell walls which can block alternative complement activation by degrading c3b that is attempting to attach to the pathogen surface several streptococci species also produce m proteins that can bind to the fluid phase rca protein factor h and fix it onto the bacterial surface in its hijacked site the recruited factor h makes any c3b that has attached susceptible to degradation and thus protects the microbial surface even if a host develops antibodies to a particular m protein these antibodies tend not to be cross-reacting and there are more than 80 different types of m proteins this means that the host will likely still be vulnerable to a subsequent infection with a different streptococcal strain expressing a different m proteingonococci and meningococci may have the most complex approach to avoiding death by complement these organisms induce the host to produce blocking antibodies that recognize particular proteins on the surface of the bacteria but are of isotypes that are poor at fixing complement such as iga the blocking antibodies compete with complement-fixing antibodies for binding to the bacterial surface and prevent bacterial destruction by complement-mediated lysis in addition steric hindrance by the blocking antibodies interferes with the deposition of c3b and thus thwarts the alternative pathway of complement activationintracellular bacteria have evolved the ultimate escape from phagocytes complement and antibodies they move right inside the host cell and complete their reproduction out of reach of these host defenses some species infect non-immune system host cells such as hepatocytes and epithelial and endothelial cells while others show a strong predilection for macrophages while some intracellular bacterial species cannot survive outside of a host cell others merely make intracellular replication a preference like extracellular bacteria most intracellular bacteria access the host via breaches in the mucosae and skin but some are introduced directly into the bloodstream by the bites of vectors such as ticks mosquitoes and mitesintracellular bacteria generally enter the host cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis and are thus first confined to intracellular vacuoles some species remain in the vacuolar compartment while others leave it to take up residence in the cytosol because of their desire to replicate within a host cell and keep it alive for this purpose intracellular bacteria are generally not very toxic to the host and do not produce tissue-damaging bacterial toxins because of their low toxicity infections with intracellular bacteria have extended incubation times however their intracellular lifestyle makes infections with these organisms difficult to resolve completely these factors mean that infections with intracellular bacteria tend to result in chronic or recurrent rather than acute disease cell-mediated immunity is crucial for combating infections by intracellular bacteria thus immunocompromised individuals who lack the ability to mount cell-mediated immune responses are particularly at risk for infection with these pathogensimportant species of intracellular bacteria belong to the salmonella listeria brucella rickettsia and legionella genera table 22-6
 salmonella typhi is an encapsulated gram-negative enterobacterium that causes typhoid fever in humans salmonella typhimurium causes the equivalent of typhoid fever in mice humans can be infected by s typhimurium if they eat improperly cooked meat from infected cattle in this case the infection results in food poisoning like all salmonella species s typhi and s typhimurium transcytose across m cells in the mucosae however unlike the extracellular salmonella enteritidis bacteria which cause poultry-related food poisoning s typhi and s typhimurium invade macrophages to replicate and thus are intracellular pathogens another food-borne intracellular pathogen is listeria monocytogenes a gram-positive rod that infects the cytoplasm of macrophages and hepatocytes l monocytogenes causes meningeal or systemic infections most often in sheep and cattle but sometimes in humans unlike most bacteria listeria can multiply quite successfully at low temperatures meaning that the infection continues to grow in contaminated food even when it is refrigerated listeria infection has also been associated with miscarriages and stillbirths in humans and cattle mouse models of listeria infection listeriosis have been very helpful in discovering how the immune system combats intracellular pathogens see later however for all its use in experimental models it is not yet clear how l monocytogenes makes its way across the intestinal barrier into the liver and spleen and finally across the bloodbrain barrier various brucella species are transmitted to humans via contact with animals and result in high fevers rickettsia rickettsii is transmitted into the bloodstream via tick bites and proceeds to attack endothelial and smooth muscle cells causing rocky mountain spotted fever legionella pneumophila the relatively recently identified pathogen that causes the lung disorder known as legionnaires disease replicates only within macrophagesmore familiar examples of intracellular bacterial pathogens belong to the mycobacterium genus m tuberculosis causes tuberculosis and m leprae infection leads to leprosy the mycobacteria do not produce bacterial toxins and cause only mild inflammation on their own however these bacteria are extraordinarily hard to remove and it is the prolonged host response to a mycobacterial infection that causes most of the tissue damage consider m tuberculosis a slow-replicating 12 hour aerobic bacillus that gravitates to well-aerated tissues such as the lung tubercular disease associated with m tuberculosis is caused not only by inflammatory damage in the lungs induced by the bacteria but also by the hosts adaptive immune response the persistence of the bacteria summons activated t cells that supply products and contacts that hyperactivate macrophages the hyperactivated macrophages in turn secrete copious amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines that result in lung damage in addition the macrophages may eventually form granulomas to wall off the bacteria these granulomas are the tubercles lumps or knobs on the lungs that give the disease its name eventually the inner circle of macrophages in the tubercles breaks down and the bacilli are released if the bodys defenses can arrest the disease effectively at this point the lesion calcifies and becomes visible in x-rays as scarring on the lung if the disease is not arrested the bacilli persist and may become dormant for months or even years at some point when the immune system is weakened due to poor health malnutrition or other infections the bacilli in the center of the tubercle may be able to proliferate again however in this situation bacterial multiplication takes place outside macrophages for the first time should the tubercles rupture millions of bacteria are released into the lungs the patient becomes highly contagious at this point due to the release of bacilli during coughing episodes from the lungs the bacteria disseminate throughout the patients body and induce the formation of seed-sized tubercles in infected tissues body defenses may be overwhelmed leading to the weight loss coughing often with blood and loss of vigor known collectively as consumptiontreatment of tb is a challenge because the slow growth habit of the bacterium and its ability to hide in macrophages or other locations for extended periods mean that the patient is often asymptomatic indeed 90 of individuals infected with m tuberculosis remain clinically healthy an asymptomatic patient is sometimes reluctant to continue with the long-term course of antibiotics needed to successfully treat the disease a classical tb test involving the cutaneous injection of tuberculin antigen often called purified protein derivative ppd into the skin indicates whether an individual is or has been infected with m tuberculosis and thus may still be harboring the bacterium plate 22-1
 a pronounced reddened reaction on the skin around the inoculation site after about 48 hours is a dth response memory t cells responding to the inoculated antigen activate macrophages that produce cytokines inciting local inflammation in the very young a positive tb test probably means that an active tb infection is occurring in older people a positive test can result from either an active infection or from a previous infection that has been cleared or from vaccination in these cases follow-up testing is done by x-ray examination of the lungs which can distinguish between an active and a calcified lesion there may also be an attempt to culture the bacterium from the patient a new generation of tb tests under development includes variations of elisa assays that measure the production of igm antibodies or activation of t cells directed against epitopes specific to m tuberculosis
healthy individuals living in generally sanitary environments such as those in most of the developed world are usually able to successfully fight off m tuberculosis however the immune systems of those living in developing countries and socio-economically depressed areas of developed countries may be stressed just enough to put them at increased risk for tb attempts have been made to slow the spread of tb in such populations by antibiotic treatment and vaccination programs see ch 23 however it takes at least 6 months of intense chemotherapy to cure a tb patient because of the limited effectiveness of available drugs against entrenched m tuberculosis moreover poor patient compliance with this stringent regime has led to the rise of multi-drug resistant strains of m tuberculosis in addition administration of the bacillus calmette-gurin bcg strain of mycobacterium bovis used as a vaccine against tb does not always induce complete cell-mediated immunity these factors have led to a maddening persistence and recurrence of tb in susceptible populations it is estimated that there are 2 billion people worldwide who are latently infected with m tuberculosis and that about 510 of these experience re-activation of the bacterium leading to active disease tuberculosis kills about 16 million people per year worldwide
m leprae the organism responsible for leprosy grows even more slowly than m tuberculosis taking about 12 days to replicate in humans because the optimal growth temperature for this organism is 30 c m leprae preferentially establishes infections just under the skin the bacterium infects the peripheral nerves in this location and causes visible skin lesions two clinical types of leprosy have been identified based on disease phenotype and the strength of the cell-mediated immune response plate 22-2
 tuberculoid leprosy also called neural leprosy is associated with a vigorous cell-mediated immune response the lesions which are confined to the skin contain moderate numbers of bacteria however the damage to peripheral nerves causes loss of nerve function that frequently leads to injury anti-mycobacterial antibody titers are low in these patients however if the infected patient mounts only a weak cell-mediated response to the organism tuberculoid leprosy may become lepromatous leprosy this form of the disease is characterized by severe skin lesions containing large numbers of bacteria that can destroy underlying bone and cartilage leading to loss of structures such as the fingers and the nose anti-mycobacterial antibody titers are high in these patients but are ineffective in controlling the diseaseearly infections by intracellular bacteria are controlled by killing mechanisms associated with neutrophil phagocytosis for example infection of epithelial cells by l monocytogenes generally induces the apoptosis of these cells releasing chemoattractant molecules that draw neutrophils to the area bacteria released from the dying cells are phagocytosed by the neutrophils whose defensins and powerful respiratory burst usually kill the invadersif neutrophil killing does not suffice the monocytemacrophage arm of the innate response is activated the ability of a macrophage to kill phagocytosed bacteria is influenced by
proteins that scientists are only now beginning to investigate for example mice that have a mutation of a gene called nramp1 natural resistance associated macrophage protein 1 have an increased susceptibility to bcg infections upon phagocytosis of a microbe during the innate response the wild-type nramp1 protein is recruited to the membrane of the macrophage phagosome and integrates within it it is thought that the presence of nramp1 in the phagolysosomal membrane somehow influences the microenvironment within the phagolysosome and hence its killing ability human homologues of nramp1 have been found in neutrophils monocytes and macrophages another group of proteins important for the killing of intracellular pathogens at least in mice are the p47gtpases a family of gtp-hydrolyzing proteins of 4748 kda these transmembrane enzymes whose expression is greatly upregulated in response to ifns and lps are thought to be localized in either the er or the golgi functionally the p47gtpases appear to regulate the maturation and processing of pathogen-containing phagosomes hastening the demise of the invader interestingly different members of the p47gtpase family are required for effective resistance to different classes of intracellular pathogens studies of knockout mice have shown that while the p47gtpase igtp is required for normal resistance to the protozoan parasite leishmania major it does not play a crucial role in defense against the intracellular bacteria l monocytogenes or m tuberculosis in contrast knockout mice lacking the p47gtpase lrg47 are highly susceptible to infection with l monocytogenes s typhimurium or m tuberculosis as well as l major
as well as engulfment of pathogens by phagocytosis tlr-mediated internalization by macrophages contributes to the resolution of intracellular bacterial infections for example lipoprotein and lipoglycan components of mycobacteria are recognized by tlr2 and tlr4 expressed on the surfaces of mammalian macrophages stimulation of these tlrs leads to nf- activation which in turn leads to upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase inos and production of no as well as the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokinesdespite the existence of nramp1 and the p47gtpases it is not unusual for an intracellular bacterium phagocytosed by activated macrophages to be resistant to routine phagosomal killing mechanisms for this reason macrophage hyperactivation is a crucial step in the clearance of many intracellular pathogens the reader will recall that a positive feedback mechanism exists between macrophages and th1 cells that is required for macrophage hyperactivation macrophages activated by exposure to the pathogen secrete il-12 which influences activated t cells to differentiate into th1 effectors the ifn secreted by the activated th1 cells acts on the macrophages to hyperactivate them such that they gain the enhanced microbicidal powers detailed in chapter 4 foremost among these powers is the capacity to produce the large quantities of rois and rnis that efficiently kill almost all intracellular pathogensthe il-12 secreted by activated macrophages also activates nk cells as described in chapter 18 nk cells detect infected host cells by their lack of mhc class i expression which is typically downregulated by the infection and destroy them by natural cytotoxicity activated nk cells also secrete copious amounts of ifn which promotes both macrophage hyperactivation and th1 cell differentiation mice deficient for transcription factors such as stat1 and irf2 which are required for ifn signaling are highly susceptible to listeria infection reinforcing the key role ifn plays in fighting intracellular bacteria t cells are also of importance in combating at least some intracellular infections the reader will recall that the tcrs of the human v2v2  t cell subset directly recognize small pyrophosphate-like molecules many species of intracellular bacteria particularly the mycobacteria release phosphorylated metabolites of this type as they attempt to colonize the host these metabolites engage the v2v2 tcr causing expansion of this lymphocyte population high numbers of  t cells can be found in the acute lesions of leprosy patients and in the lungs of mice immunized with aerosols containing mycobacterial components as described in chapter 18 it is thought that  t cell effector functions cytolysis ifn secretion probably precede and overlap those of  t cells filling any gaps in defense between the broadly specific neutrophils and nk cells and the highly specific  t cellsin terms of the adaptive immune response defense mediated by mhc class i-restricted cd8 ctls is critical in cases of infection by many species of intracellular bacteria if the bacterium replicates in the cytosol of the infected cell some of its component proteins will enter the endogenous antigen processing pathway and be presented on mhc class i on the host cell surface as well components derived from the degradation of a phagocytosed bacterium or antigens secreted by it can be released into the cytosol allowing peptides from these molecules to be cross-presented on mhc class i such cells function as target cells for tc in the local lymph node or memory ctls in the periphery for example studies of l monocytogenes have demonstrated that cd8 ctls are crucial for resolving infections with this pathogen mice deficient for either  tcr components or 2m and thus mhc class i show decreased resistance to l monocytogenes infection similarly mice that are normally resistant to tuberculosis can be rendered susceptible if cd8 t cells are depleted by treatment with antibodies prior to infection however cytolysis via the perforin or fas pathways does not appear to be a big factor in cd8 t cell-mediated defense against intracellular bacteria unlike antiviral defense see later studies in knockout mice have shown that fas-mediated cytolysis is not required for any stage of host defense against l monocytogenes or m tuberculosis and perforin-mediated cytotoxicity is important only for containing disease in the chronic stages of l monocytogenes and m tuberculosis infections rather cd8 ctls contribute to anti-bacterial defense primarily by releasing ifn and tnf which are critical both for inflammatory cell influx and direct killing of infected cells and by secreting granulysin a molecule that has direct anti-microbial activity knockout mice deficient for the expression of either tnf or ifn or the receptors for these molecules show increased susceptibility to infections with l monocytogenes furthermore animals treated with anti-tnf or anti-ifn antibodies show increased susceptibility to listeriosis while those treated with anti-il-4 actually show increased resistance human patients lacking the ifn receptor are highly susceptible to certain types of mycobacterial infectionsunconventional ctl subsets also contribute to defense against intracellular bacteria many types of intracellular bacteria secrete proteins that can be processed into peptides containing n-formyl-methionine as we learned in chapters 10 and 11 these peptides can be bound by non-classical mhc class ib molecules such as h-2m3 and presented to  cd8 t cells several listeria peptides can be presented by h-2m3 in mice and a role for this type of presentation has been proposed for the early stages of the response to listeria infection however this type of priming appears to induce only minimal memory responses in the case of mycobacteria infected dcs can present non-peptide glycolipid bacterial antigens on the non-polymorphic mhc-like molecule cd1b two subsets of cd1b-restricted ctls have been defined in m tuberculosis-infected mice one subset uses fas-mediated cytolysis to kill infected host cells but not the pathogen while the other subset uses perforin-mediated cytolysis to simultaneously eliminate both the infected host cell and the pathogen both subsets also secrete ifn in humans ctls directed against glycolipid antigens have been isolated from tuberculosis patients and these cells directly recognize and lyse infected macrophages in vitro  t cells and nkt cells bearing cd1c- and cd1d-restricted tcrs may also play a role in anti-mycobacterial defense in vivo but the antigens recognized by these tcrs have yet to be identifiedcd4 t cells make a significant contribution to defense against intracellular bacteria not only because of the il-2 they secrete to support tc differentiation but also because these cells are required for the hyperactivation of macrophages bacterial antigens either secreted by the bacteria themselves or released by necrotic infected cells are taken up by professional apcs and presented to cd4 t cells in association with mhc class ii the ifn produced by nk cells activated early in the infection favors the differentiation of th1 effectors activated th1 cells then supply the intercellular contacts particularly cd40l and tnf and ifn that drive the hyperactivation of macrophages and if necessary the formation of granulomas see laterwhile the il-12 secreted by activated and hyperactivated macrophages and dcs is vital for the th1 response to intracellular pathogens it is not the only important cytokine as discussed in chapter 17 il-18 acts synergistically with il-12 to promote ifn production and th1 differentiation resistance to infection by species of yersinia salmonella and cryptococcus is enhanced by administration of il-18 to wild-type mice and il-18 mice show increased susceptibility to infection with intracellular pathogens such as mycobacteria and l major il-27 is required for the initiation but not maintenance of th1 responses mice lacking il-27r thus show decreased ifn production which increases their susceptibility to l major infectionthe importance of the th1 response in defense against intracellular pathogens is nicely illustrated in human immune responses to m leprae infection when the t cells surrounding the lesions of the mildly affected tuberculoid leprosy patients described previously were isolated and tested for cytokine production they were found to secrete ifn it was hypothesized that these patients mounted a th1 response that promoted cell-mediated immunity and ameliorated the disease in contrast the t cells surrounding the lesions in the more severely affected lepromatous patients were found to produce predominantly il-4 and il-10 these patients appeared to have mounted a th2 response that favored humoral immunity less effective against intracellular pathogens over cell-mediated immunity this difference is likely attributable to genetic differences between patients that affect the th1th2 polarization of th cells responding to this pathogenwhen an intracellular pathogen is able to resist killing even by ctls and hyperactivated macrophages the body takes the approach of if you cant remove em confine em a group of hyperactivated macrophages fuses to form a granuloma that walls off the pathogen from the rest of the body as described previously for chronic tb infection fig 22-4
and plate 22-3
 scattered among the macrophages in the inner layer of the granuloma are numerous cd4 t cells while an outer ring of cd8 t cells forms the exterior layer eventually the exterior of the granuloma becomes calcified and fibrotic and cells in the center undergo necrosis in some cases all the pathogens trapped in the dying cells are killed and the infection and inflammation are resolved in other cases a few pathogens remain viable but dormant within the granuloma causing it to persist granuloma persistence is an overt sign that the disease is becoming chronic an event that results in the breakdown of the structure of the granuloma can release the trapped pathogens back into the body to commence replication anew should the host be immunosuppressed for some reason and unable to marshal the t cells and macrophages necessary to form new granulomas the pathogen may be released into the bloodstream from which it can infect other organs throughout the body and even cause deathcytokines play a critical role in granuloma formation sustained ifn production by th1 cells and ctls is required to maintain macrophage hyperactivation tnf production by hyperactivated macrophages is crucial not only for early chemokine synthesis to recruit fresh cells to the incipient granuloma but also for aggregating these cells and establishing the wall around the invaders secretion of il-4 and il-10 by th2 cells late in the adaptive response serves to control the formation of granulomas damping them down as the bacterial threat is containedalthough it may seem counterintuitive at first antibodies can contribute to defense against intracellular pathogens some antibodies have been shown to block the access of bacteria to host receptors used for cell entry in addition newly arrived bacterial cells or those transiting the extracellular space before invading the neighboring host cell can be opsonized or subjected to classical complement-mediated lysis it is further speculated that antibodies taken into the phagosome with the bacterium can act in this location for example monoclonal antibodies to listeriolysin o llo a bacterially produced molecule that facilitates the escape of l monocytogenes from the phagosome into the host cytosol have been shown to provide protection against l monocytogenes infections in this wayevolution has confined intracellular pathogen killing to the phagosome of professional phagocytes consequently internal damage to the phagocyte itself is prevented and non-phagocytic cells which do not create phagosomes run no risk at all in view of the compartmentalized nature of phagocytosis intracellular bacteria can evolve in one of two ways to improve their chances of survival they can either enter and replicate in non-phagocytic cells or enter phagocytic cells and employ strategies to avoid phagolysosomal destruction one example of an intracellular bacterium that targets a non-phagocytic cell is
m leprae which infects schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system the schwann cells which wrap around the axons of nerves and generate the myelin sheath express a surface protein called -dystroglycan this protein normally has a role in early development and morphogenesis but in this case acts as a receptor for m leprae the microbe enters the schwann cells and is protected from phagocytosis similarly l monocytogenes expresses internalin proteins that bind to the host adhesion molecule e-cadherin allowing the bacteria to enter non-phagocytes l monocytogenes also deliberately accesses phagocytes using the host cell fc and complement receptors but then employs survival tactics to prevent killing within the phagosome these tactics include the synthesis of the listeriolysin o protein mentioned previously llo induces pore formation in the membrane of the phagolysosome allowing the bacterium to escape into the relative safety of the cytoplasm
m tuberculosis has devised several different ways of avoiding phagolysosomal destruction first when this bacterium finds itself being engulfed in a macrophage phagosome it recruits a host protein called taco tryptophan-aspartate-containing coat protein to the cytoplasmic surface of the developing phagosome the presence of taco inhibits the fusion of the phagosome with lysosomes and other vesicles containing hydrolytic enzymes and specialized killing components secondly mycobacteria also produce nh4
 which reverses the acidification of phagolysosomes and promotes fusion with harmless endosomes thirdly m tuberculosis infection of macrophages interferes with stat1-mediated transcriptional responses to ifn signaling blocking the expression of genes needed for microbicidal action and hyperactivation as a result of these three strategies mycobacteria can survive within host phagosomes for long periods the bacteria may remain active or enter a state of dormancy in which many of their metabolic pathways are downregulated other intracellular bacteria focus on blocking the rois produced within the phagosome the phenolic glycolipid found in m leprae neutralizes rois while other bacterial species produce superoxide dismutase and catalase that break down rois and hydrogen peroxide catalase may also inhibit the generation of rnis
s typhi and s typhimurium preferentially enter the body via the m cells of the pps once in the dome below the fae these bacteria induce resident macrophages to capture them by macropinocytosis inside the macrophages the bacteria secrete a protein called spic that efficiently blocks fusion of lysosomes with phagosomes and other molecules that decrease the recruitment of nadph oxidase to the phagolysosome still other bacterial products confer resistance to cationic peptides these measures permit the salmonella to survive within the macrophage for a relatively short period of time however because macrophages are mobile the bacterial infection is quickly disseminated all over the body in typhoid carriers the disease becomes chronic as the bacteria accumulate in the gall bladder and are shed for several months or even indefinitely into the feces transmission to fresh hosts is achieved under conditions of poor sanitation when the feces of an infected person enter the water supply consumed by non-infected individuals an infected human does make antibodies to the capsule of s typhi and carriers have such antibodies in their plasma but the antibody is not protective while the bacterium is hidden in the macrophages eventually macrophages harboring s typhi are induced to undergo apoptosisthe ultimate escape for an intracellular pathogen is to make it into a new host cell without attracting the attention of the immune system at all ultrastructural studies have shown that in host cells infected with l monocytogenes the bacterium induces the actin-based formation of a pseudopod that invaginates into a neighboring non-phagocytic cell the neighboring cell engulfs the pseudopod which contains the bacterium plus bits of the original host cell cytoplasm and pinches it off to form a secondary vacuole surrounded by a double plasma membrane plate 22-4
 the bacterium then uses llo and phospholipases to forge its way through both sets of host membranes and enters the cytoplasm of the new host cell free to start the cycle anew the beauty of this tactic is that the bacterium is never extracellular meaning that antibodies can never bind to it indeed although low levels of natural igm antibodies to listeria have been detected in naive inbred mice these antibodies do not play a significant role in resistance to natural listeria infectionsthe llo molecule of l monocytogenes provides another means of defense in addition to its pore-forming capacity it has been observed that contact with llo irreversibly inactivates cd4 t cells in in vitro experiments antigen-specific cd4 t cells were exposed to apcs that were either infected with l monocytogenes or treated with bacterial llo peptides t cells treated in this way became anergic and could not be activated by subsequent exposure to a known stimulatory peptide even after llo was removed the mechanism underlying this inactivation is unknown but may be related to the antagonism of tcrs by altered peptide ligands see ch 14
m tuberculosis escapes t cell attack by interfering with apc function infection of dcs by this pathogen promotes downregulation of the expression of mhc class i and ii and cd1 decreasing the presentation of non-peptide antigens the number of t cell clones that can be brought to bear on the pathogen is thus reducedlike many species of bacteria viruses are obligate intracellular pathogens however unlike bacteria viruses consist only of dna or rna genomes packaged in proteinaceous capsids viruses therefore do not have their own protein synthesis machinery and rely on subverting that of the host cell the genomes of viruses are much smaller than those of other classes of pathogens being limited to about 100 genes at most the smallest viruses make do with four genes most of the genes in a virus genome encode structural proteins or are required for viral replication but a surprisingly large number of genes in the more complex viruses encode proteins that undermine the host immune response or regulate host cell apoptosis many of these genes are dispensable for viral replication in vitro emphasizing their function as countermeasures to the host immune response in vivo viruses with a small genome count on rapid replication and dissemination to new host cells to establish an infection before the immune system can respond viruses with larger genomes need more time to replicate and are transmitted more slowly accordingly these organisms have developed ways of interfering with various components of the host immune response that allow sufficient time for the establishment of an infectionviruses usually use a host receptor to bind to and enter the cell followed by replication and virion assembly within the cell progeny virions released into the local area can infect neighboring host cells and initiate new replicative cycles that facilitate widespread dissemination of the virus progeny virions that reach the blood circulation are free to spread systemically different viruses have different relationships with their hosts viruses may vary with respect to the species they can infect host range the kinetics of their replication and their propensity to cause either acute or chronic disease naturally a successful virus is not so virulent that it wipes out all members of its target species since that would prevent the viruss own future replication viruses that damage the host cell during infection are said to be cytopathic while those that merely take over cell functions without damaging the host cell are non-cytopathic in addition to virally induced cytopathy it is not unusual for the hosts own immune response to the virus to result in immunopathic damage to host tissuesafter an initial infection some types of viruses remain in the body and establish a persistent infection unlike bacteria and parasites which often give rise to chronic disease in cases of persistent infection most viruses that persist in the body do so in a latent state during latency viral activity is held in check by cell-mediated immunity the host experiences no symptoms and the virus remains in a non-infectious mode in which no new virus particles are assembled however as the host ages or faces immune system challenges such as other infectious agents cancer or immunosuppressive drug treatments the cell-mediated response weakens this weakening increases the likelihood that the latent virus will become reactivated leading to recommencement of a productive infection with associated symptoms a common example of this type of latent viral infection occurs with the virus that causes chicken pox varicella zoster virus vzv also known as human herpesvirus 3 or herpes zoster after an initial infection that results in the characteristic chicken pox rash the virus moves up to the dorsal root ganglia of sensory nerves that reach into the skin and becomes latent usually for years upon reactivation the viral infection spreads down the affected nerves to the skin causing the formation of vesicles called shingles that are very painful to the host and are teeming with infectious virus particles herpes simplex virus hsv acts in a similar way on nerves supplying the mouth area giving rise to cold sores after a period of latency cytomegalovirus cmv persists in a latent infection that causes no symptoms and is not infectious as long as cell-mediated responses are intact and ongoing if the virus becomes reactivated patients may come down with pneumonitis or hepatitis and may shed infectious virus in their urinethe oncogenic viruses are an important group of latent viruses both dna and rna viruses are represented in this heterogeneous group their common characteristic being an association with malignancy in a small percentage of hosts infection with these viruses is usually inconsequential to everyday health but in some individuals the replication of these pathogens disturbs the host cell cycle in such a way that the cell is transformed and becomes cancerous the dna oncogenic viruses include human papillomavirus hpv cervical cancer epstein-barr virus ebv burkitts lymphoma and nasopharyngeal cancer and hepatitis b virus hepb liver cancer the rna oncogenic viruses are all retroviruses meaning that they possess a reverse transcriptase enzyme that allows them to make a cdna copy of their rna genome that can integrate into the host cell dna in humans the retrovirus human t cell leukemia virus htlv causes t cell leukemias and lymphomas see ch 30 the human immunodeficiency virus hiv which causes aids is also a retrovirus see ch 25 hiv-infected individuals have a higher incidence of various lymphomas see ch 30 more on oncogenic viruses and immune responses to them appears in chapter 26adenovirus is a dna virus that most often infects the upper respiratory tract of young children but that can also affect the eye and gastrointestinal tract disease is usually acute but mild with symptoms ranging from those associated with the common cold to tonsillitis if the virus attacks the lower respiratory tract bronchitis and pneumonia can result while 50 of adenovirus infections in otherwise healthy children are asymptomatic adenovirus can kill immunocompromised individualsadenovirus is one of the best-studied pathogens at the molecular level the virus first expresses e1a genes that force the infected host epithelial cell to enter s phase the viral dna then replicates after about 7 hours various e1b e2 e3 and e4 transcription units are subsequently activated that supply structural proteins for the virus and other proteins that control host cell functions and viral resistance to the immune response virions are assembled within 24 hours and are released from the lysed host cell by 4872 hourscytomegaloviruses are -herpesviruses meaning that they are large double-stranded dna viruses human cmv is endemic in all human populations but causes only sub-clinical infections in immunocompetent hosts due to control by cd8 t cells however in immunocompromised hosts such as fetuses aids patients and transplant recipients who may acquire cmv from their transplants the active virus can cause severe or even fatal disease about 1015 of cmv-infected fetuses suffer brain damage while infected adults may come down with pneumonia hepatitis nephritis encephalitis andor an increased incidence of bacterial and fungal infections cmv is also capable of adopting a latent state see later in which the inactive virus is found predominantly in the kidney liver and heartebv is a dna herpesvirus that preferentially infects b cells of young children by exploiting host cr2 molecules in developing countries ebv is endemic and almost all young children contract a mild infection this early exposure confers a degree of resistance to ebv in later life and adolescents and young adults are rarely ill with ebv infections in developed countries early childhood ebv infection is much less common and an individuals first encounter with the virus may occur during adolescence such later infections produce a more serious glandular fever called infectious mononucleosis mono which is characterized by extreme fatigue this type of ebv infection is particularly contagious in part because the virus is very active in the salivary gland kissing disease in addition as mentioned previously ebv is an oncogenic virus it persists in the body and may cause malignant transformation of cells in a small proportion of cases persistent ebv infection of tonsillar cells can result in nasopharyngeal cancer while persistence of ebv in resting memory b cells leads to burkitts lymphoma in the laboratory ebv is often used to immortalize cultured b cells in vitro to establish b cell linesthe hepatitis b virus is an enveloped dna virus that preferentially infects hepatocytes clinical symptoms of hepb infection include jaundice nausea vomiting fatigue and pain in the abdomen and joints hepb infections may be either acute or chronic transmission is primarily by sexual contact or via contaminated needles used to inject intravenous drugs although body fluids such as saliva and breast milk can be infectious as well about 30 of acute infections are asymptomatic when the virus adopts a latent state in which the viral genome integrates into the host genome a chronic hepb infection is established and these persons become hepb carriers who may or may not show symptoms chronic hepb infections may eventually lead to more serious conditions such as cirrhosis of the liver and hepatic cancer the propensity for hepb infection to become chronic is greatest in the very young that is in 90 of individuals who are infected with the hepb virus when under the age of 1 year the infection becomes chronic in contrast only 5 of those who are infected when over the age of 5 years continue to harbor the virus latently the who estimates that worldwide 12 billion people are infected with hepb and 350 million of these infections are chronic about 1525 of chronically infected persons die of hepb-related disease each yearthe hepatitis c virus is a small enveloped single-stranded rna virus with effects very similar to those of hepb except that the infection becomes chronic at a much higher rate fully 80 of all individuals infected are unable to clear the virus the major mode of hepc transmission is via exposure to contaminated blood either through blood transfusion see box 25-1 in ch 25 or the sharing of contaminated needles it remains controversial whether hepc is also transmissible through sexual contact worldwide at least 34 million new hepc infections occur each year and an estimated 3 of the worlds population is currently infected of those chronically infected 1020 go on to develop cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer and an estimated 04 of these die each year in the united states chronic liver disease is the 10th leading cause of death among adults and studies suggest that 40 of all such cases are due to hepc infection in developed countries chronic hepc infection is the most common reason for liver transplantsthe mechanism by which hepc establishes chronic infection is not yet understood most individuals attacked by hepc mount humoral and cell-mediated responses against the virus but these responses are not usually sufficient to clear it moreover hepc exhibits considerable genetic heterogeneity with six major genotypes and over 100 strains the envelope proteins of different hepc strains can diverge by as much as 50 such that neutralizing antibodies that are effective against one strain may not be effective against another strain more on the difficulties of dealing with hepc appears in chapter 23because an extensive discussion of hiv and aids appears in chapter 25 we include only a few brief comments here hiv is a retrovirus that exhibits extreme antigenic variation hiv infects both macrophages and cd4 t cells and destroys the latter the lack of cd4 t cells fatally cripples adaptive immune responses in these patients and they usually die of either opportunistic infections or unusual tumors the who estimates that worldwide over 42 million people are currently infected with hiv and that more than 3 million infected persons die each year of aidsthe influenza virus is an enveloped rna virus with a segmented genome as most of us know from personal experience the flu is a nasty respiratory infection that initiates in ciliated epithelial cells but eventually produces symptoms that affect the entire body much of the malaise associated with the flu can be attributed to the large quantities of ifn produced by immune system cells fighting the infection headaches chills high fever muscle aches weakness and dry cough are common symptoms most of which are resolved within 2 weeks however the virus abrogates the normal function of the ciliated epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract decreasing the expulsion of pathogens in the mucus macrophage and neutrophil functions may also be suppressed in the local area of infection as a result opportunistic bacteria may become established in the respiratory tract and go on to cause potentially fatal pneumoniapart of the difficulty in combating influenza viruses is that a number of different strains exist in the human population because the principal proteins of these strains differ slightly another example of antigenic variation an immune response mounted against one strain does not guarantee protection against another strain thankfully neither chronic nor latent infections occur with influenza virus influenza virus has been responsible in the past for several hemispheric and global epidemics in which the elderly and the immunocompromised were killed in large numbers even today influenza virus infections cause significant morbidity and mortality particularly among the aged and chronically ill on a global scale it is estimated that the annual bout of influenza infection causes 35 million cases of severe disease and 250000500000 deathsthe measles virus is a cytopathic enveloped rna virus that initially attacks the upper respiratory tract but then spreads via the lymphatics and blood circulation to most other tissues the characteristic red measles spots that appear all over the body are due to cell-mediated immune responses against infected host cells acute measles infections are highly contagious and the virus is easily spread to new hosts through respiratory secretions moreover measles virus can survive for at least 60 minutes in aerosolized droplets allowing it to spread through ventilation systems globally an estimated 40 million new measles infections occur each yearat the cellular level the virus primarily targets monocytes macrophages lymphocytes and dcs by binding to a membrane glycoprotein called slam signaling lymphocyte activation molecule cd150 however the measles virus can also penetrate the walls of cerebral capillaries and enter the cns where it infects neurons due to the loss of function of multiple types of immune system cells measles patients experience profound immunosuppression that makes them highly susceptible to secondary infections that may be severe or even fatal in unvaccinated individuals the disease can have significant mortality 12 million deaths due to measles occur worldwide each year while most survivors enjoy lifelong immunity to this virus they are not entirely without risk some variant strains of the measles virus have defects in their surface proteins that block expression of viral antigens on the infected host cell surface meaning that these cells escape the immune response in a small percentage of individuals these variants persistently infect the cns and cause a chronic progressive neurological disease called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis sspe more on the measles virus appears in chapter 23polio virus is a small non-enveloped rna virus that replicates first in the intestinal tract the virus is shed into the feces of an infected individual and spreads to new hosts via feces-contaminated food or water in the later stages of an infection the virus moves to the blood and spreads to the spinal cord and cns while most infected individuals recover completely in a small number of patients the virus causes poliomyelitis permanent muscle paralysis due to the destruction of the motor nerves of the cns in fact in the pre-vaccine era poliomyelitis was the leading cause of permanent disability in the united states the disease was called infantile paralysis at that time because of the large number of children affected when viral destruction of brain stem cells resulted in paralysis of the respiratory muscles the patient had to be placed in an iron lung artificial breathing apparatus even today polio virus infection is fatal in 25 of poliomyelitic children and in 1530 of adults in aging survivors the neurological damage suffered during an acute infection may be manifested as post-polio fatigue similar in symptoms to chronic fatigue syndrome polio is now almost unknown in the americas europe and the antipodes due to a very successful vaccination campaign see ch 23 although it continues to plague some populations in asia and africa
rabies is a disease characterized by hyper-excitability and spasms of the mouth and pharynx that occur when swallowing liquids this latter feature can sometimes lead to foaming at the mouth andor a fear of water hydrophobia the disease is caused by the rabies virus an enveloped rna virus upon entering the body the virus replicates first in skeletal muscle and connective tissue it then enters and spreads along the peripheral nerves to the spinal cord and cns where it eventually causes encephalitis initial symptoms are slow to develop and may include irritability fever pain and fatigue that can progress to hallucination and paralysis the rabies virus readily infects cats dogs raccoons foxes bats and skunks all of which are creatures that interact quite frequently with humans the bite of a rabid animal is usually fatal for humans unless a course of injections of protective anti-rabies antibodies is undertaken immediately see ch 23 the virus replicates in slow waves meaning that the passive supply of relatively short-lived antibodies must be replenished several times to ensure elimination of the virusrhinovirus rhino nose is a non-enveloped single-stranded rna virus and a member of the picornavirus family over 100 rhinoviruses are known about 50 of common colds are caused by some kind of rhinovirus about 10 of common colds are due to infection with a different type of virus such as adenovirus while the cause in 40 of cases is unknown rhinoviruses thrive in the upper respiratory tract particularly the nose and throat the infection is thus characterized by the familiar symptoms of sneezing excessive nasal secretion runny nose and congestion stuffy nose complications of rhinovirus infection include spreading of the virus from the throat to the sinuses lower respiratory tract and middle ear resulting in sinusitis laryngitis and otitis media respectivelythe virus that causes sars severe acute respiratory syndrome is a novel member of the coronavirus family coronaviruses are enveloped single-stranded rna viruses with an asymmetric shape and surface spikes positioned so as to resemble a crown most human coronaviruses are associated with only mild respiratory disease thus the world was caught off-guard in early 2003 by the severity of the atypical pneumonia caused by the newly emerged sars coronavirus over 8000 cases of infection leading to more than 700 deaths were recorded in this initial outbreak scientists speculate that the sars virus may have arisen in a sudden species jump from healthy civet cats to their owners in china in late 2002symptoms of sars are flu-like and include fever chills malaise dry cough shortness of breath and headache liver damage and lymphopenia are also often present damage to the alveoli of the lungs is progressive and can be fatal the virus spreads between humans by close contact such as touching a contaminated surface or breathing in aerosol droplets created by the coughing or sneezing of an infected individual at the cellular level the sars virus replicates chiefly in respiratory epithelial cells although other tissues such as eyes heart liver kidney and other cell types such as macrophages may also be targeted unlike most coronaviruses the cytopathic sars virus can be cultured in vitro aiding the study of its infection mechanismsthe smallpox virus variola was introduced in chapter 1 although this virus has been eliminated globally in the wild in this age of bioterrorism it behooves us to briefly comment on it variola is a highly infectious member of the dna poxvirus family smallpox disease is characterized by pain fever and a severe blistering of the skin that leaves disfiguring marks particularly on the face of the infected individual refer to plate 1-1 smallpox infection is fatal in 30 of cases there is controversy over whether stocks of variola should be maintained for vaccine development more on this issue appears in chapter 23as recounted in chapter 1 jenner used the cowpox virus to vaccinate against smallpox back in the late 1700s in modern times the vaccinia virus is used vaccinia is an enveloped double-stranded dna virus and a member of the poxvirus family that includes cowpox and variola smallpox curiously it is not clear how the vaccinia virus arose some researchers have speculated that early attempts at developing a better smallpox vaccine resulted in a recombination of cowpox virus with another poxvirus that resulted in the vaccinia virus while vaccinia does replicate in human cells it usually causes relatively mild illness rash low fever enlarged lymph nodes papule at the site of vaccination and is only very occasionally fatal as described in more detail in chapter 23 vaccinia is under intense investigation as a vector for dna vaccinesinterferon secretion is one of the earliest means by which the body defends itself against virus infections as we learned in chapter 17 the type i interferons were first discovered on the basis of their antiviral activities host cells infected with a virus produce ifn and ifn which in turn initiate a series of metabolic events in neighboring cells that result in their adopting an antiviral state the reader will recall from chapter 17 that ifn and ifn induce the synthesis of the host enzyme pkr which is inactive until it encounters a dsrna molecule such as a viral genome among other substrates activated pkr phosphorylates first itself and then eif2 a factor necessary for translation of both host and viral proteins since the virus relies on the host cells translation machinery for viral protein synthesis viral reproduction is halted ifns also induce expression of 25a synthetase an enzyme activated by dsrna that generates short 25 oligoadenonucleotides these 25a molecules activate rnase l which degrades both viral and cellular rnas again blocking translation surprisingly mice deficient for pkr are capable of mounting effective immune responses to almost all viruses except vesicular stomatitis virus vsv suggesting that redundancy for pkr function or a parallel antiviral pathway exists these matters are under investigationas well as their involvement in the antiviral state ifns trigger the expression of multiple genes with profound effects on both the innate and adaptive immune responses see ch 17 these effects combine to control infection by a very broad spectrum of viruses ifns enhance phagocytosis regulate the production of cytokines and no and promote the differentiation of monocytes into dcs ifn is crucial for the mounting of a th1 response necessary to support cell-mediated defense consistent with the finding that mice lacking ifnr are highly susceptible to vaccinia infection ifn has been used with success in the clinic against hepatitis infections emphasizing the importance and utility of this family of moleculesthe intracellular nature of viral replication means that viral antigens are processed by the host cells endogenous antigen-processing pathway and peptides are displayed on mhc class i on the surface of an infected cell the viral peptides that constitute the t cell epitopes may be derived from almost any internal structural or envelope protein of the virus although nucleoproteins and matrix antigens are favored ctls kill most virus-infected cells using perforin-mediated cytotoxicity or by inducing fas-mediated apoptosis but also secrete the cytotoxic molecules granulysin tnf and ifn the objective is to rapidly kill an infected host cell prior to virus assembly and thus block viral spread studies of knockout mice lacking either cd8 or 2m and thus mhc class i have shown that these animals are highly susceptible to virus infectionsan interesting twist to ctl-mediated elimination of viruses arises with respect to hepatocytes it seems that unlike the case for any other cell type low levels of viruses infecting hepatocytes are controlled solely by cytokine action that does not lead to cytolysis for example lcmv and mouse cmv are cleared from murine liver cells primarily by the action of ctl-synthesized ifn in sharp contrast to the cytolytic elimination of these viruses in other cell types in a poorly defined mechanism the binding of ifn to its receptor on an infected hepatocyte activates intracellular degradation of viral components curing the cell without killing it in the case of hepatocytes infected with hepb virus both tnf and ifn must
bind to their respective receptors on the hepatocyte surface to induce selective degradation of the viral genome as the virus replicates within the hepatocyte again the threat is removed without killing the liver cell liver cells are killed when viral loads are high because the heightened inflammatory response sparked by large numbers of virus particles recruits activated macrophages in the cytokine-rich milieu of the inflamed liver the macrophages commence expression of cd40l which engages cd40 expressed on hepatocytes this interaction induces fasl expression on hepatocytes making them vulnerable to fas-mediated apoptosis should fasl be engaged either by fas on the surface of the same hepatocyte or on an adjacent hepatocyte cell death is induced which can eventually lead to clinical liver damage this type of liver pathology is prominent in severe cases of hepb and hepc infection in humansimmunopathology following ctl activation also arises with htlv-1 infection the vast majority of people infected with htlv-1 go on to become carriers of the virus in about 3 of carriers the virus causes the adult t cell lymphomaleukemia that gives this virus its name see ch 30 however another 25 of carriers develop a chronic neurological disease called hamtsp htlv-associated myelopathytropical spastic para-paresis the principal clinical feature of hamtsp is chronic inflammation of the spinal cord it has been postulated that those individuals who mount a particularly strong ctl response restrict htlv-1 spreading very efficiently reducing the concentration of viral antigens that might otherwise induce inflammation in an individual mounting a less effective ctl response viral antigens are allowed to accumulate a continuous cell-mediated response is stimulated that is accompanied by large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines that result in inflammation and damage within the cns of the patientsome virus infections are combated by ctl responses that do not require cd4 t cell help in either cytokine or intercellular contact form dcs play prominent roles in such viral infections for example influenza virus on its own can activate dcs such that they strongly upregulate b7 costimulatory molecules even in the absence of cd40 stimulation in other words the dcs become fully mature apcs able to activate cd8 t cells directly without the need for help cd40l engagement from cd4 t cells a similar scenario holds for lcmv infection in mice while antibody and cd4 t cell responses do occur in response to lcmv infection it is the cd8 ctl cell response that is critical for defense studies have shown that strong primary ctl responses can be mounted to lcmv in the absence of cd4 t cell help reflecting the putative ability of this virus to access and directly activate apcsas was true for intracellular bacteria whole virions or their components may be taken into a professional apc by receptor-mediated endocytosis or phagocytosis the viral proteins are then subjected to the exogenous pathway of antigen processing and viral peptides displayed on mhc class ii can activate cd4 t cells th cells are important for defense against most viruses because these cells both license apcs for naive cd8 tc cell activation and supply the t help required for humoral responses to viral td antigens for example neutralizing antibodies play a key role in the elimination of many rhabdoviruses and the production of these antibodies is completely dependent on cd4 t cell help similarly humoral and cell-mediated responses to adenovirus infections depend on cd4 t cell help in the form of cd40l contacts mice deficient for cd40l are highly susceptible to adenovirus since the mutant animals fail to produce adequate titers of antibodies and mount only minimal ctl responses finally as one might expect cd4 knockout mice readily succumb to a broad range of virus infectionssurface components of virus particles can directly activate the lectin and alternative complement pathways leading to the lysis of enveloped viruses in addition opsonization of viruses by complement components c3b and c3d promotes phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages that bear complement receptors simultaneous binding of a c3d-coated virus particle to the cr2 b cell coreceptor cd21 and the bcr of a b cell promotes b cell activation and production of virus-specific antibodies as mentioned previously such antibodies can neutralize virions and trigger classical complement-mediated destruction of either the virus or the infected host cell displaying viral antigensa virus that can adopt a latent state escapes the attention of the immune response at least temporarily many viruses have the ability to persist and even multiply in cells in a defective form that renders them non-infectious for a period of time the virus then waits until conditions in the host such as drug-induced immunosuppression or immunodeficiency associated with disease or aging provide better odds of survival and transmission to new hosts in most cases latency involves the inactivation of viral gene transcription needed for productive infection and the subsequent expression of new viral latency-associated transcripts lats reversal from latency back to productive infection requires some type of reactivation of the productive infection genes that can only occur when the immune response is weakeneddifferent viruses achieve latency in different ways the retroviruses like hiv become latent by integrating a cdna copy of their rna genome into the dna of a host cell in such a way that there is limited transcription of viral genes see ch 25 the herpesviruses which are large double-stranded dna viruses with genomes encoding numerous viral proteins rely on other means of transcriptional control for example both vzv and hsv are herpesviruses that can establish latent infections in the neuronal ganglia neurons express little or no mhc class i and so are relatively safe havens to which these viruses can retreat the viral genome persists in only 001 of the neuron population but does not integrate into the host dna rather the viral genome forms a complex with host nucleosomal proteins that blocks transcription of productive infection genes a new set of lats is then transcribed to maintain latency another important human viral pathogen that adopts latency is cmv latent cmv takes up residence in leukocytes and endothelial cells concentrated around the kidneys heart and liver it is not yet clear whether the cmv genome integrates into the host dna during latency or whether there is complete silencing of productive infection genes there is some evidence for lat-like transcripts in cells infected with latent cmvebv and kaposis sarcoma herpesvirus kshv formerly called human herpesvirus-8 hhv-8 are herpesviruses whose latency is associated with the development of host tumors as mentioned previously ebv infection is linked with b cell lymphomas and nasopharyngeal carcinomas while kshv appears to cause the kaposis sarcoma often found in aids patients unlike the oncogenic retroviruses however the genomes of these oncogenic dna viruses do not integrate into the host dna productive infection is halted via downregulation of productive infection genes and subsequent upregulation of lats for example ebv latency correlates with the downregulation of the ebna3 family of viral antigens it is these proteins that normally supply immunodominant peptides for ebv-specific ctls the virus then upregulates expression of ebna1 ebv nuclear antigen-1 a protein essential for ebv latency however as is described in more detail later the structure of the ebna-1 protein blocks its presentation on mhc class i molecules obscuring the virus from ctl recognitiona common way for a virus to hide from the host immune system is to change its antigenic stripe over successive generations expressing antigenically new forms of viral proteins that may not be recognized by existing memory lymphocytes or antibodies in populations previously exposed to the virus such antigenic variation as a means of viral survival is most likely to be important in hosts that are long-lived such as humans host longevity means that multiple re-infections of an individual can occur improving the chance that the virus will remain in circulation this factor is particularly important if the virus lacks the ability to become latentrapid modification of viral antigens through random mutations is known as antigenic drift antigenic drift usually involves proteins expressed on the surface of the virion that would normally be the target of neutralizing antibodies extensive antigenic drift is a hallmark of influenza virus which lacks proofreading enzymes and thus experiences high rates of mutation of its rna genome during replication minor mutations to the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins present on the surface of the influenza virion arise at a rate of about 1 in 106 virus particles these minor variants often replicate preferentially in the host as they cannot be neutralized by existing antibodies raised against earlier strains new strains of influenza arising due to continual antigenic drift spread fairly quickly through a population and are responsible for localized influenza outbreaks a similar form of antigenic drift can be observed in human rhinoviruses as well as in foot-and-mouth disease virus hiv undergoes very rapid antigenic drift even within a given infected individual due to the error-prone reverse transcriptase involved in the replication of its genome see ch 25perhaps unique to the influenza virus is its ability to undergo antigenic shift another type of variation that is less frequent but much more radical and dangerous antigenic shift can occur because the influenza virus genome exists as eight separate single-stranded rna segments each of which encodes a discrete protein involved in viral function with such a genetic structure two different influenza strains that simultaneously infect a single host cell can undergo a reassortment sometimes inaccurately called recombination of their genomic segments fig 22-6
 virus particles containing new combinations of parental rna suddenly arise dramatically changing the spectrum of protein epitopes presented to the immune system another factor favoring antigenic shift is the ability of many strains of influenza virus to infect an intermediate host such as a pig or chicken before being passed on to humans these animal hosts are known as animal reservoirs reassortment of gene segments can also occur in an animal reservoir again leading to new combinations of proteins expressed in the progeny viruses an antigenically novel flu virus can then infect the human population safe from antibodies and ctls raised during previous exposure or vaccinationbecause influenza infections occur seasonally the appearance of entirely new strains from one winter to the next seemed very sudden to early workers in the field initiating the use of the term shift antigenic shifts were responsible for the global or pandemic outbreaks of influenza that occurred in 1918 1946 1957 asian flu and 1968 hong kong flu as an example of how severe the influenza virus can be consider the pandemic of 1918 even with the relatively slow nature of international travel in the early 20th century this version of the influenza virus swept around the world and killed close to 20 million people within a few monthsantigen processing pathways offer a wealth of opportunities for a virus to sabotage the initiation of an adaptive immune response fig 22-7
 without mhc class i expression a peptide cannot be presented to either cd8 tc cells or ctls so that many viruses have targeted various steps of mhc class i protein synthesis and peptide display some viruses such as cmv avoid mhc class i presentation of viral antigens by infecting mesenchymal or epithelial cells that have very low mhc class i expression as a result almost no viral antigens are displayed to alert passing t cells other viruses attempt to circumvent mhc presentation by producing viral proteins that resist proteolysis meaning that peptides capable of fitting in the mhc binding groove are not generated for example as mentioned previously an important protein expressed by latent ebv is ebna-1 a molecule important for the maintenance of latent ebv in the host cell the ebna-1 protein contains about 200 gly-ala repeats that resist proteolysis blocking the presentation of peptides from this antigen and thus the activation of t cells directed against it cytomegalovirus expresses a kinase called pp65 that phosphorylates a viral transcription factor such that it cannot be processed by the infected cells antigen processing machinerystill other viruses prevent peptide loading by blocking the normal synthesis of mhc class i adenovirus makes a small protein called e19 that has a lysine-containing er retention motif e19 binds to mhc class i molecules and the er retention motif traps the complex within the er abrogating peptide display on the cell surface so that ctl killing does not occur in contrast human cmv produces glycoproteins such as the us3 protein that induce the deglycosylation of some classes of newly synthesized mhc class i chains the abnormal mhc class i proteins are then conveyed to the proteasomes for degradation similarly the vpu protein of hiv see ch 25 destabilizes newly synthesized mhc class i molecules preventing them from ever reaching the surface some murine cmv proteins such as m06 bind tightly to mhc class i chains and act as lysosomal targeting sequences causing the mhc class i chain to be destroyed in this organelleanother way to interfere with the mhc class i pathway is to alter the interaction of the peptide and the tap transporter complex as we learned in chapter 11 peptides generated in the cytosol must be imported via the tap machinery into the lumen of the er for attachment to mhc class i and eventual presentation on the target cell surface the process occurs in two steps the atp-independent binding of peptides to the tap heterodimer and the atp-dependent translocation of the peptides into the lumen of the er in ebv-infected b lymphoma cells the transcription of both tap-1 and tap-2 is downregulated reducing peptide loading and thus presentation of viral antigens to cd8 t cells herpesviruses express small proteins that interfere with peptide binding to tap on the cytosolic side of the er other viruses express proteins that allow the peptide to bind to tap but then trap the complex on the luminal side of the er blocking its release and subsequent interaction with mhc class imhc class i presentation can also be inhibited by events closer to the cell surface for example a mouse cmv protein called m04 associates with mature peptidemhc class i structures at the cell surface interfering with tcr- andor coreceptor-mediated interactions with cd8 t cells another example is the multifunctional nef protein of hiv see ch 25 certain amino acid motifs in nef promote its association in the plasma membrane with the host clathrin proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis other sequences in nef allow it to bind to certain mhc class i molecules among other proteins see later this nef-mediated physical connection between mhc class i and clathrin forces the internalization of the mhc class i molecule the lysosomal degradation of mhc class i follows so that the surface level of mhc class i is drastically decreasedone last note in addition to sabotaging mhc class i antigen presentation hiv attempts to avoid ctl attack by producing variant peptides that act as tcr antagonists for hiv-specific ctls see ch 25 presentation of these peptides blocks the activation of the ctl subsets that recognize them protecting the infected host cell from cytolysisbecause nk cells are activated in the absence of mhc class i they are crucial for the control of viruses that actively interfere with the processing of antigen and attachment to mhc class i however as one might expect mechanisms exist that thwart this means of host defense too human cmv expresses an mhc class i-like surface molecule called ul18 that engages the nk inhibitory receptor and fools the cell into thinking it has detected normal mhc class i fig 22-8
 the virus proceeds with its replication undisturbed poxviruses and herpesviruses also express mhc class i homologues many of which have deficits in peptide binding we mentioned previously that the nef protein of hiv depresses surface expression of mhc class i blocking antigen presentation to ctls interestingly the expression of the non-classical mhc class i molecules hla-c hla-e and hla-g is not affected by nef leaving at least some mhc class i-like molecules to bind to the inhibitory receptors of nk cells the human cmv protein ul40 actually upregulates expression of hla-e increasing the numbers of non-classical mhc class i molecules able to bind nk inhibitory receptors curiously some small viruses such as the flavivirus west nile virus upregulate conventional host mhc class i expression in an infected cell in the hopes of staving off nk-mediated destruction it is thought that this measure allows these rapidly reproducing viruses to complete their life cycle and disseminate long before the mhc class i-dependent ctl response can be brought to bearbecause cd4 th cells support antiviral responses by delivering t help to antiviral b cells and ctls the mhc class ii antigen presentation pathway has also become a target of viral evasion strategies one of the easiest ways to block mhc class ii presentation is to avoid getting antigens into professional apcs for example the rabies virus preferentially infects neurons and is very slow to replicate and lyse these cells meaning that viral antigens are not easily collected by apcs until quite some time after the virus has entered the body the natural immune response to rabies is thus considerably delayed interestingly because the virus replicates relatively slowly an individual bitten by a rabid animal can be successfully treated with a post-exposure vaccine as an alternative to the administration of anti-rabies antibodies the rabies vaccine contains an inactivated form of the virus that is injected directly into regions of the body where apcs are present rapidly inducing an immune response see ch 23 effectors activated by these apcs may then take steps to eliminate the rabies-infected neurons before the virus can spread furtherother viruses take more indirect approaches to inhibiting mhc class ii antigen presentation fig 22-9
 when a virus infects a cell it produces ifns that act on neighboring cells to induce the expression of many genes among them mhc class ii as we learned in chapters 10 and 17 ifn transduces its signals through the jak-stat pathway activating the transcription factor ciita required for mhc class ii expression the iee protein of human cmv is produced early during infection and blocks ifn signaling by destabilizing the jak molecule resulting in failed ciita activation and thus reduced mhc class ii expression proteins from adenovirus eg e1a can also affect mhc class ii expression by influencing intracellular levels of activated jak and statalthough they differ in primary sequence the secondary structures of newly synthesized mhc class i and ii molecules are quite similar this similarity allows the us2 molecule of human cmv to bind to mhc class ii molecules and target them for proteosomal degradation before they can enter the endocytic compartment as was true for mhc class i in contrast human herpes simplex virus-1 hsv-1 expresses the gb viral protein that prevents mhc class ii molecules from entering the endocytic system but does not trigger their degradation other viruses interfere with mhc class ii presentation after the mhc molecule has entered the endocytic system the pathway to peptide loading of mhc class ii molecules is so complex that there are many opportunities for viral interference the us3 protein of human cmv competes with invariant chain for binding to mhc class ii papillomaviruses express small proteins such as e5 that disrupt the acidification of the endocytic compartments inhibiting proteolysis and the generation of antigenic peptides similarly the talented nef protein of hiv can interfere with the proton pump required to acidify endosomesmhc class ii molecules that have reached the cell surface are still not safe from some viruses in addition to its ability to associate with the proton pump hiv nef induces internalization of surface mhc class ii molecules just as it does for mhc class i molecules forcing them back into the endocytic system and to the lysosomes for destruction ebv expresses a membrane glycoprotein called bzlf2 that interacts with mhc class ii molecules intracellularly and on the cell surface it is thought that this interaction inhibits antigen presentation to cd4 t cells leading to a failure in t cell activationsome viruses block the initiation of immune responses directed against them by inhibiting the survival or maturation of dcs for example htlv-1 infects dc precursors and prevents their further differentiation into immature dcs capable of capturing antigen the infection of immature dcs by hsv-1 and vaccinia precludes dc maturation in response to cytokines other viruses such as vaccinia and canarypox virus kill dcs by inducing apoptosis measles virus forces dcs to form large aggregations called syncytia in which the virus replicates freely but further dc maturation is stymied when human cmv infects a dc it blocks its upregulation of costimulatory molecules so that the dc may anergize rather than activate any naive t cell it encounters alternatively virus infection may turn the dc into a t cell killer infection by human cmv or measles virus upregulates the expression of fasl on the dc surface forcing it to kill fas-bearing t cells with which it comes into contactsome viruses take the approach of interfering with b cell activation leading to antibody production the nucleocapsid protein np of the measles virus binds to the host fcriib protein which as we learned in chapter 9 exerts a negative regulatory effect on b cell activation the binding of viral np to fcriib appears to enhance negative signaling such that b cell activation is dampened and antibody production is decreased other viruses such as hsv-1 thwart antibody-mediated destruction by expressing viral fc receptors on the infected host cell surface these viral fcrs are capable of binding to host antiviral igg molecules that have bound viral antigen thus when a host antibody binds to a viral antigen on an infected host cell surface in an effort to initiate complement-mediated lysis or adcc the viral fcr binds to the fc portion of the complexed igg and makes it inaccessible neither adcc nor classical complement activation can be triggered and the infected host cell is not destroyedviruses use many of the same mechanisms as other pathogens to avoid complement-mediated destruction and the reader is therefore referred once again to box 22-3 briefly many viruses express homologues of the rca proteins that control complement activation pathways and some viruses directly inhibit host rca proteins or alter the expression of these molecules other viruses fool the immune system by budding through the host cell membrane acquiring the surface phenotype of the host and its membrane-integrated rca proteinsseveral viruses have developed mechanisms that disrupt the antiviral state ebv blocks the initiation of the antiviral state by expressing the barf1 gene barf1 encodes a soluble decoy receptor for the monocytemacrophage growth factor csf-1 barf1 thus decreases the concentration of csf-1 available to stimulate monocytes and macrophages macrophage proliferation and monocyte secretion of ifn are inhibited blocking the delivery of signals that protect neighboring cells when hsv infects a cell that has already established the antiviral state ie eif2 has been phosphorylated by pkr the virus expresses phosphatases that dephosphorylate eif2 allowing viral protein translation to resume the vaccinia and hepc viruses synthesize proteins that compete with pkr as sites for phosphorylation while ebv and adenovirus express rnas that bind to pkr but inhibit its activation hsv also produces inhibitory analogues of the 2-5a molecules that block rnase l activation permitting viral protein synthesis to proceedother viruses block host transcription leading to establishment of the antiviral state kshv produces proteins that are homologous to the host irf transcription factors these viral proteins bind to irf-binding sites on the host dna but do not permit transcriptional activation as a result expression of ifn-inducible genes does not occur and the antiviral response is blocked similarly adenovirus e1a proteins interfere with the formation of transcription factors required for the transcription of ifn-inducible genes inhibiting host cell responses to the ifnsalthough hiv preferentially infects cd4 t cells the very presence of cd4 appears to inhibit the release of newly assembled hiv virions from the t cell see ch 25 hiv thus has developed tactics for going after the cd4 molecule the hiv vpu protein promotes the degradation of newly synthesized cd4 molecules in the proteasome as it does for mhc class i while the nef protein promotes internalization and lysosomal destruction of surface cd4 as it does for surface mhc class i and ii poxviruses and herpesviruses also produce proteins that trigger internalization and destruction of cd4 there is some debate as to whether the primary function of this mechanism is to promote the release of virions or to compromise t cell activation both may be relevanthost cell apoptosis prior to completion of replication is a distinct disadvantage for the more complex viruses with larger genomes inspiring these viruses to develop means of blocking host cell death both genome size and tissue specificity of infection influence strategies to manipulate host apoptosis since different apoptotic pathways may be triggered in different tissues by different stimuli host cell apoptosis is most commonly induced by ctl degranulation nk cytolysis fasfasl interaction or the binding of tnf to tnfr many of the steps leading to apoptosis in each of these pathways are subject to viral interference fig 22-10
the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis induced by engagement of the death receptors fas and tnfr is blocked by different viruses in different ways adenovirus expresses several e3 proteins that combine to form the receptor internalization and degradation rid complex rid removes fas and tnfr1 from the host cell surface by inducing the internalization of fas and tnfr these molecules are directed into the endosomes followed by transport to the lysosomes where they are degraded cell death induced by an encounter with a t cell or monocyte expressing tnf or fasl is thus avoided several poxviruses express soluble or membrane-bound homologues of tnfr such as crmb cytokine response modifier b that act as decoy receptors for tnf and related cytokines as was discussed in chapter 17 myxoma virus produces a secreted homologue to tnfr called m-t2 that blocks tnf-mediated apoptosisother viruses have targeted signal transducers further down the tnfr and fas signaling paths an adenovirus e1b protein blocks the oligomerization of fadd necessary for the activation of caspase-8 several herpesviruses and poxviruses express proteins called vflips viral flice inhibitory proteins that contain deds death effector domains capable of binding to fadd and caspase-8 association with vflip blocks the initiation of the caspase cascade caspase-8 activation is also inhibited by the direct binding of the crma protein of cowpox virus the e3 protein of adenovirus and similar proteins in herpesviruses and vaccinia virus these inhibitors are all serpins members of the serine protease inhibitor superfamilywe have mentioned in previous chapters the anti-apoptotic properties of the mammalian bcl-2 protein bcl-2 blocks the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis by regulating the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane to ion traffic such that the release of cytochrome c from these organelles is inhibited in the absence of cytochrome c caspase-9 cannot be activated many viruses have sought to manipulate host cell apoptosis by either altering intracellular levels of host bcl-2 or expressing bcl-2 homologues for example herpesvirus samurai hvs expresses a homologue of bcl-2 called orf-16 that blocks mitochondria-mediated apoptosis two other examples can be found during ebv infection in its productive infection phase ebv expresses a bcl-2 homologue called bhfr1 that blocks apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli however during its latent phase ebv expresses the lmp-1 protein instead this molecule which closely resembles a constitutively active cd40 molecule is anti-apoptotic because it upregulates intracellular levels of host bcl-2 and stimulates the activities of the host transcription factors nf-b and ap-1 these transcription factors promote cell survival this persistent stimulation by lmp-1 is thought to drive abnormal b cell survival and proliferation to the point of malignant transformation a fourth example is the e1b-19k protein of adenovirus e1b-19k binds to and inhibits those members of the bcl-2 family that promote cell death rescuing the host cell from apoptosis lastly kshv produces a protein called vbcl-2 which closely resembles human bcl-2 and blocks apoptosis of infected host cellsas well as by death receptor engagement host cell apoptosis can be induced by external factors such as uv-irradiation which generates free radicals or the presence of chemically reactive molecules such as hydrogen peroxide the genomes of several types of viruses contain genes whose products are homologous to cellular enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase and neutralize the effects of free radicals expression of such genes in transfected cells in vitro can protect them from cell death induced by uv-irradiation or hydrogen peroxide but not apoptosis induced by tnf or fas ligation these anti-apoptotic mechanisms are likely to be relevant in vivo as wellsometimes a virus wants to induce the apoptosis of its infected host especially a non-enveloped virus incapable of budding once the virus has completed replication and new virus particles have been assembled the virus needs a way to get its progeny out of the cell by inducing apoptosis of the infected cell optimal dissemination of the progeny is achieved without the inflammation generated by necrotic death an immune response is thus less likely to be mounted some examples of viruses that are thought to facilitate apoptosis in order to exit an infected cell include chicken anemia virus sindbis virus hiv-1 and human parvovirusmany viruses express proteins that interfere with regulation of the host cell cycle and subvert cell functions to viral use products of the tumor suppressor genes p53 and rb see ch 26 are favorite targets p53 induces cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to dna damage and rb blocks the division of cells with genetic abnormalities interestingly different proteins in the same virus can have seemingly opposing effects for example the e1a proteins of adenovirus influence the regulatory functions of p53 and induce p53-dependent apoptosis while other adenovirus proteins bind to p53 and trigger its destruction adenovirus e1a proteins also bind to members of the rb group and the p300cbp family of transcriptional co-activators disrupting host cell cycling similarly the large t antigen of sv40 binds to both p53 and rb proteins and inactivates them in hepb virus the px protein binds to host p53 and either promotes or inhibits p53-mediated apoptosis depending on the immediate microenvironment in contrast the e2 protein of hpv regulates p53-mediated cell cycle arrest rather than apoptosis in epithelial cells the hpv e6 protein binds to p53 protein and targets it for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in this case levels of p53 are kept low enough in the infected cell that the cell can continue to divide allowing further propagation of the virusearly in viral infections host cells are induced to produce copious quantities of cytokines with potent antiviral effects chemokines that govern the recruitment of infection-fighting leukocytes are also released the inhibition of the production or action of cytokines and chemokines is thus a desirable strategy from the viruss point of view for example members of the poxvirus family evade immune surveillance by altering the local cytokine milieu and making it less favorable to the cellular cooperation that underpins an immune response in particular the ifns tnf il-1 il-12 and various chemokines are targeted by different viruses we have already mentioned that some viruses interfere with the pro-apoptotic signal transduction associated with tnf and that both kshv and adenovirus express proteins that inhibit ifn-inducible gene transcription poxviruses express a protein that blocks maturation of the precursor form of il-1 while a human cmv protein disrupts the transcription of chemokine genes other viruses have attempted to head off the host immune response by inducing the down-regulation of cytokine receptor expression for example the surface expression of cxcr4 on cd4 t cells is decreased following infection by several types of human herpesviruses chemotaxis is inhibited and the calcium flux that supports intracellular signaling is suppressedinhibition of il-12 production is a major goal of many viruses since this cytokine is crucial for th1 differentiation for example ebv synthesizes a homologue of the il-12p40 subunit that can bind to host il-12p35 the imposter may competitively inhibit the activity of host il-12 contributing to a dampening of th1 responses ebv also produces a protein called bcrf1 which is homologous to mammalian il-10 like il-10 bcrf1 suppresses il-12 production by macrophages and ifn production by lymphocytes further downregulating th1 responses the measles virus takes a different approach to il-12 inhibition at least in vitro when the laboratory strain of measles virus binds to the rca mcp cd46 on cultured dcs and macrophages il-12 production by these cells is inhibited studies done in vitro to ascertain the underlying mechanism of this inhibition have shown that il-12 synthesis can be impaired even in uninfected cells by the cross-linking of fcrs cd46 or the complement receptor cr3 on the host cell surface it is speculated that the aggregation of cd46 by the measles virus delivers signals that block the transcription of both il-12 subunitsas discussed in box 17-3 of chapter 17 certain viruses appear to have appropriated and subverted mammalian genes for cytokines and cytokine receptors producing proteins that are homologous to host cytokines and cytokine receptors in general the viral cytokines compete with host cytokines for host receptors while the viral cytokine receptors divert the cytokine away from the host receptor these interactions generally result in abnormal intracellular signaling and altered chemotaxis for example poxviruses synthesize a cc chemokine homologue called mc148 that binds with high specificity to ccr8 and blocks the chemotaxis of lymphocytes macrophages and neutrophils in vitro on the other hand hhv-6 synthesizes a viral cytokine u83 that binds to host cc or cx3c chemokine receptors but increases the calcium flux in an infected host cell chemotaxis of mononuclear cells to the site of viral infection appears to be enhanced providing the virus with a supply of new cells to infect sometimes a virus produces viral cytokines with seemingly opposite effects on chemotaxis for example kshv produces a viral cytokine vmip-ii that antagonizes the cxcr5 and ccr5 receptors preferentially expressed on th1 cells suppressing their chemotaxis however kshv also synthesizes another viral cytokine called vmip-1 that binds to the ccr8 receptor expressed preferentially on th2 cells promoting the chemotaxis of these cells why kshv should want to regulate th cell behavior in this way is not knownwith respect to viral cytokine receptors we have already mentioned the tnfr homologues produced by poxviruses and myxoma virus that block tnf from inducing host cell apoptosis similarly vaccinia virus secretes an ifnr homologue that intercepts ifn and an ifnr homologue that binds ifn myxoma virus also produces huge amounts of an ifnr-like viral cytokine receptor called m-t7 that binds host c cc and cxc chemokines disrupting leukocyte extravasation into infected tissues the p35 protein expressed by vaccinia and other poxviruses acts like a decoy chemokine receptor although it does not structurally resemble one p35 binds to cc chemokines with higher affinity than does the host receptor sequestering host chemokine molecules and reducing the efficiency of the immune response the m-t1 protein of myxoma virus is another secreted molecule that binds and inhibits several chemokines in vitro and blocks the influx of monocytes into sites of acute infection in vivo the opposite strategy has been adopted by kshv the suspected natural host cells of this virus are endothelial cells and b cells kshv induces the expression of a viral transmembrane receptor called orf74 in the host membrane orf74 closely resembles cxcr2 an il-8 receptor however unlike cxcr2 orf74 is constitutively active constantly stimulating signaling pathways associated with the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and vascular endothelial growth factor vegf the increase in vegf production is thought to trigger the formation of new sites of vascularization facilitating the spread of the virus to fresh host cells orf74 may also regulate the migration of virus-laden b cells to lymphoid organs here virions released from lysing host cells would find fresh susceptible b cells to infect enhancing propagation of the virusother examples of virus-encoded homologues to mammalian immune system proteins may be found in the viral semaphorins mammalian semaphorins are signaling proteins that were first studied in neuronal cells but later identified in hematopoietic cells the structurally diverse semaphorin superfamily includes secreted gpi-linked and transmembrane molecules each of which contains a cysteine-rich sema domain of about 500 amino acids the first recognized function of semaphorins was one of conveying signals guiding the growth of axons during embryonic neuronal development but the fact that certain viruses have apparently acquired the genes for semaphorins implies the subversion of some kind of immunological function the genome of vaccinia virus contains the gene for a small semaphorin called a39r that has a truncated sema domain when a39r expression is engineered in human monocytes this protein downregulates icam-1 expression induces synthesis of il-8 tnf and il-6 and inhibits migration in response to chemoattractants the relevance of these activities to in vivo viral infections is under investigationas mentioned at the start of this chapter the term parasite covers a vast range of organisms that differ considerably in size complexity form replication mode and pathogenicity at one end of the scale are the protozoans parasitic protozoan species are single-celled organisms whose behavior resembles that of bacteria or viruses they often replicate directly within host cells including within leukocytes important protozoan parasites for humans are l major p falciparum and trypanosoma brucei which causes african sleeping sickness table 22-11
 at the other end of the scale we have the parasitic worms many helminth species which include the trematodes flukes and worms that attack the lungs and liver cestodes tapeworms in the gut lumen and nematodes roundworms and hookworms primarily in the intestinal lumen are also major human pathogens these organisms are complex multicellular beasts that reproduce inside a hosts body but outside its cells or outside of the host entirely however in the latter case millions of parasite eggs or larvae are often deposited in places like water sources where access to a host is made easy the growth and maturation of the parasite then occur within the hostmany parasites have multi-stage life cycles and operate through a vector an intermediary organism that attacks the ultimate host indeed each stage of a parasite may be able to infect a different host this is a problem from a public health point of view since a parasite that can make use of an invertebrate vector such as a mosquito or takes up residence in an animal reservoir such as a raccoon is much harder to deal with than a pathogen that infects humans only as well as taking steps to fight pathogen infections of humans measures to control the mosquito or raccoon population must be implemented from an individuals point of view that fact that some parasite stages may be intracellular while others are extracellular means that the infected individual must be able to mobilize both the cell-mediated and humoral arms of the immune response to eliminate the pathogen the multiplicity of these factors makes it very difficult to design effective vaccines to combat parasites we will now briefly describe some of the more important parasites and their modes of infection before moving on to the immune responses required to control themthe malarial parasite p falciparum has a very complex life cycle fig 22-11
 when a female anopheles mosquito bites an infected human to acquire a blood meal it takes up rbcs bearing p falciparum gametocytes when the gametocytes reach the mid-gut of the mosquito they commence maturation and 24 hours later combine to form worm-like zygotes that mature into ookinetes each ookinete penetrates into the mosquitos mid-gut wall forms an oocyst and starts to produce progeny called sporozoites within it when an oocyst bursts the sporozoites are released and migrate to the mosquitos salivary glands when the infected mosquito bites a human 520 sporozoites are injected into his or her subcutaneous tissues within minutes of injection the sporozoites race through the blood to the liver and invade hepatocytes in these cells the sporozoites replicate asexually and asymptomatically for 210 days producing thousands of merozoite progeny the infected hepatocytes then lyse each releasing 1000030000 merozoites into the bloodstream where they invade erythrocytes and express parasite proteins on the rbc surface within the erythrocytes the merozoites mature into schizonts that reproduce asexually and exponentially the rbcs lyse 48 hours later releasing new progeny merozoites into the blood where they attack more erythrocytes this synchronized rupture of the erythrocytes is felt as the cyclical constellation of chills fever and sweating that constitutes clinical malaria these symptoms are due to the release of tnf and il-1 by macrophages responding to the presence of lysed rbcs however not all rbcs are lysed by the merozoites within some infected rbcs the merozoites develop into the sexual male and female gametocyte forms these gametocytes can persist for years in the host the cycle repeats when another mosquito bites the infected human and takes up rbcs infected with gametocytesinterestingly individuals that suffer from sickle cell anemia are resistant to malaria sickle cell refers to the abnormal shape of the erythrocytes in these individuals this shape is caused by an altered hemoglobin protein that arises from a particular mutation in the hemoglobin gene in addition to inducing sickling of the erythrocytes the mutated hemoglobin protein appears to hinder the intracellular replication of the parasite the sickle cell mutation occurs most frequently in africa where the advantage it confers over malaria has resulted in its selection despite its associated anemia in other words the prevalence of sickle cell disease in africa is mainly the result of evolutionary pressure exerted by malaria other mutations in individuals naturally resistant to malaria inhibit the penetration of the erythrocytes by the parasite
leishmania are obligate intracellular protozoan parasites that preferentially invade macrophages in both humans and animals these parasites have a two-stage life cycle and operate through sand flies as a vector these insects introduce the parasite into the host when taking a blood meal the promastigote stage is the form transmitted by the invertebrate vector while the amastigote stage is the intracellular form that establishes infection in the vertebrate host depending on the species of leishmania the skin or the viscera of the host is affected l major causes cutaneous leishmaniasis characterized by skin lesions and erosion of cartilage in the face and ears death can result from asphyxiation or starvation if much of the nasopharyngeal cartilage is destroyed the less common visceral leishmaniasis is a systemic disease caused by leishmania donovani splenomegaly release of tnf and severely decreased levels of leukocytes are its signature features
toxoplasmosis is caused by the spore-forming protozoan toxoplasma gondii this organism primarily infects and reproduces in cats the parasite causes no illness in the infected cat but when the parasite enters its sexual stage in the feline intestine oocysts containing sporozoites are formed that are then shed into the feces these feces may then contaminate food water or soil consumed or handled by other animals or humans if a mouse drinks water contaminated with t gondii oocysts and an uninfected cat eats that mouse the cycle repeats in the new host if an oocyst is ingested by a human the sporozoites are released from the oocyst and travel through the blood and lymph to various tissues causing infections of the eye muscle and brain in healthy adult humans the symptoms of
t gondii infection are usually mild and resemble mononucleosis at worst however in immunocompromised individuals such as aids patients sporozoites reaching the brain or eye can cause cerebral abscesses and neurological damage or retinitis leading to visual impairment pregnant women face the greatest danger from t gondii infection which is why mothers-to-be are warned not to change the litter boxes of their pet cats infection during pregnancy can cause severe brain damage or vision problems in the fetus or even stillbirth
t brucei is a flagellated protozoan parasite that uses the blood-sucking tsetse fly as a vector both humans and cattle can be bitten by the tsetse fly and thus be infected causing devastation on two fronts in african villages in the first stage of a human infection which can extend for months or even years the trypanosomes replicate freely in the blood and cause limited disease symptoms include fever headaches joint pain and itchiness however in the second stage of the human disease the parasite crosses the bloodbrain barrier and attacks elements of the cns victims show confusion loss of appetite lethargy poor coordination tissue wasting and severe disruption of the sleep cycle hence the name african sleeping sickness the disease is fatal without treatment and irreversible neurological damage can occur if treatment is not started before the onset of the second stage t brucei can also cross the placenta and kill the developing fetus of an infected pregnant woman
another trypanosome trypanosoma cruzi causes chagas disease t cruzi which is carried by small blood-sucking insects called triatomines is endemic in the southern united states central america and south america it is estimated that more than 20 million individuals are infected with t cruzi and that this parasite causes 50000 deaths each year the disease course has three stages acute indeterminate and chronic only 1 of newly infected individuals show symptoms including fatigue fever and a distinctive swelling at the site where the triatomine accessed the body in most individuals these difficulties are resolved without treatment however if t cruzi is not completely cleared the infection enters an indeterminate stage that can prevail for decades the patient remains asymptomatic because the infection is kept under control by effective antiparasite cell-mediated and humoral th1 immune responses about one-third of chagas disease patients go on to the chronic stage of the disease in which much more serious symptoms appear 1040 years after the initial infection these patients exhibit a life-threatening inflammatory cardiomyopathy characterized by the infiltration of cd8 t cells and macrophages and the presence of dth lesions the esophagus and colon also become enlarged interestingly t cruzi itself is not found in high numbers in the affected organs leading some researchers to suspect that the symptoms of chronic stage chagas disease may be autoimmune in origin that is high levels of parasites present at the acute stage of the infection prime the immune system to cause damage to self tissues many years later see ch 29 indeed healthy mice that receive isolated cd4 t cells from mice chronically infected with t cruzi soon show myocardial pathologythe schistosoma worms members of the trematode family cause a disease called schistosomiasis in humans the disease is associated with proximity to large static bodies of water in developing countries because the intermediate host for these worms is a freshwater snail parasite eggs hatch in fresh water and penetrate into the snails the larvae multiply in the snails exit from the snails into the water and attack and penetrate the skin of any nearby human the immature schistosomes migrate first to the lungs and then to the liver intestine and blood eggs from reproducing schistosomes can get trapped in the walls of the intestine or the sinusoids of the liver inducing a chronic inflammatory response products from the eggs can be directly toxic to liver cells sometimes causing the hosts death to corral these egg products and block further development and dissemination of the parasite granulomas form around the egg deposits after several weeks the granulomas are slowly replaced by collagen to form scars that can interfere with blood flow particularly in the liver
echinococcus tapeworms a genus of the cestodes reproduce only in dogs but the eggs can be ingested by humans and cause alveolar echinococcosis the eggs hatch in the human intestine and the larvae burrow through the intestinal wall into the lymphatic and blood circulatory systems the larvae take up residence in various tissues and form large cysts especially in the liver kidney lung and brain if a cyst ruptures a sometimes-fatal ige-mediated hypersensitivity reaction see ch 28 to the highly immunogenic contents of the cyst can occura wide variety of helminth parasites is included in the nematode worm group many of which cause well-known and severe diseases in humans ascariasis is an infection of the lung by members of the ascaris giant roundworm genus ascaris eggs ingested by humans hatch into larvae that penetrate the intestinal wall enter the blood and travel to the lung severe inflammation in the lung can result from vigorous ige-mediated attacks on ascaris antigens in this location trichinella spiralis is another nematode whose larval form survives in cysts in uncooked meat this parasite causes trichinosis when the meat is eaten and digested the larvae develop into adults in the gut lumen penetrate the intestinal mucosa and produce more larvae in this location that enter the lymphatics and blood circulation the larvae take up residence in muscles such as those of the tongue diaphragm and eye onchocerca volvulus is a nematode worm that causes african river blindness larvae are transmitted by african black fly bites to humans and the parasites migrate to the subcutaneous tissues the larvae develop into adults that produce numerous microscopic thread-like progeny called microfilariae the microfilariae can attack the eye inducing inflammation that can rapidly lead to blindness elephantiasis is a severe swelling of the lower limbs and trunk that results from the blockage of the lower lymphatic vessels by the microfilariae of the worms wuchereria bancrofti and brugia malayi plate 22-5
 these worms are transmitted by mosquitoesalthough most protozoan parasites adopt intracellular habitats for at least some of their life cycle humoral immune responses to these organisms do occur all the effector mechanisms ascribed to antibodies for defense against extracellular bacteria refer to fig 22-2 apply to defense against small extracellular parasites both natural and antigen-specific antibodies may act as opsonins for the extracellular stage of protozoans which unlike the helminths are small enough to be phagocytosed as well adcc classical activation of the complement cascade and neutralization have all been described as effective means of eliminating these organisms for example high titers of neutralizing antibodies that recognize epitopes of a large surface molecule called msp1 expressed on the p falciparum merozoite surface can block the infection of new erythrocytes by merozoites released from a lysing rbc some of these antibodies appear to result from cd1-mediated presentation of part of the msp1 protein to nkt cells which may supply help to b cells in the form of secreted il-4 complement-mediated lysis of merozoite-infected rbcs via the classical pathway also occurs in addition to antigen-specific antibodies there are abundant natural antibodies present in human serum that recognize widely distributed carbohydrate antigens parasites bearing these molecules in their cell walls can trigger both the classical and lectin pathways of complement activationlike many intracellular bacteria some parasites eg l major resist destruction within an ordinary phagosome and actually enjoy life within a macrophage these protozoans are resistant to or fail to induce the ordinary respiratory burst in activated macrophages only in a hyperactivated macrophage are there sufficient levels of rni to efficiently kill such parasites tnf produced by hyperactivated macrophages also plays an important but ill-defined role in anti-l major responses since administration of anti-tnf antibodies to cultures of ifn-treated macrophages blocks their ability to kill l major if even hyperactivated macrophages cannot clear the infection a granuloma is formed to contain the threatwe saw for intracellular bacteria that the hyperactivation of macrophages requires a th1 response how does the antiparasite th1 response arise in the case of l major the primary target of infection is the macrophage however l major also infects langerhans cells in the epidermis which become the prime initiators of the t cell-mediated immune response to this organism in mouse models l major infection of dcs immediately induces these cells to produce copious quantities of il-12 this il-12 drives activated anti-parasite th0 cells along the th1 path an event absolutely crucial for defense against l major because these cells secrete the ifn required to hyperactivate macrophages mouse strains that are abnormally susceptible to l major infection such as the inbred strain balbc are naturally incapable of inducing th1 responses and mount ineffective th2 responses instead th2 responses are unhelpful in this situation because th2 cytokines such as tgf il-4 il-10 and il-13 inhibit ifn production and suppress the activation of inos the same effect can be demonstrated in knockout mice lacking the genes for ifn itself molecules regulating ifny production or components of the ifn receptorin addition to macrophage hyperactivation ifn has other powerful effects that make it the key molecule in anti-protozoan defense fig 22-12
 first of all ifn is directly toxic to forms of many protozoan pathogens including the sporozoite form of p falciparum studies in vitro have shown that ifn eliminates sporozoites from infected hepatocytes in culture and mice treated with ifn prior to infection with sporozoites are partially protected secondly ifn establishes a positive feedback loop of th1 differentiation because it stimulates il-12 production by dcs and macrophages this il-12 in turn triggers additional ifn production by nk and nkt cells in fact mice and monkeys treated with il-12 alone are able to resist sporozoite infections thirdly ifn is a potent inducer of inos in infected macrophages induction of inos results in the production of intracellular no which eliminates either the parasite itself or the entire infected cell as well ifn upregulates the expression of p47gtpases localized in the er or golgi the p47gtpase lrg47 is essential for defense against l major t gondii and t cruzi lastly ifn upregulates the expression of fas on the infected macrophage surface rendering it susceptible to fas-mediated apoptosis when it contacts a fasl-expressing t cellthe cd40-cd40l intercellular contact is also crucial for anti-parasite th1 responses as evidenced by the increased susceptibility of cd40l and cd40 mice to l major infection engagement of cd40 on macrophages and dcs by cd40l on activated t cells promotes the production of il-12 by these apcs in the absence of such engagement and il-12 production the th1 response and ifn production cannot be sustained and the animals become vulnerable to the parasite injection of il-12 into cd40l-deficient mice can partially protect them against l major infectionin infected cells in which protozoan parasites escape from the macrophage phagosome into the cytosol parasite antigens may enter the endogenous antigen processing system and be presented on mhc class i cd8 t cells are then activated and respond to the threat indeed acute disease in experimental mice caused by l major or t gondii is exacerbated if the host is depleted of cd8 t cells by injection of anti-cd8 antibodies prior to infection however ctl-mediated cytolysis is not actually very effective against acute protozoan infections rather it is the secretion of ifn by activated parasite-specific ctls that is important similarly ifn secretion by  t cells has been implicated at the sporozoite stage of malarial infections since parasite loads are increased in animals lacking these cells it should be noted that while perforin-mediated cytotoxicity is not effective in the acute stage of t gondii infection in mice this mechanism is important for controlling the chronic stages of infectionwhile th1 responses are best for combating protozoan parasites th2 responses are vital for defense against large multicellular helminth worms in fact in vitro antigens from the surface of a worm egg can trigger an abrupt switch from an incipient th1 response to a th2 response humans naturally resistant to schistosoma mansonii exhibit high levels of th2 cytokines whereas those susceptible to this pathogen have high levels of th1 cytokines furthermore susceptibility to s mansonii infection in humans has been found to be under the control of a gene called sm1 interestingly this gene occurs in a chromosomal region 5q31-33 that encodes several molecules that regulate t cell differentiation it is speculated that sm1 may be involved in influencing th1th2 immune deviationthe anti-helminth th2 response requires the involvement of ige eosinophils and mast cells a combination that does not contribute significantly to defense against other types of pathogens fig 22-13
 activated cd4 t cells are critical for anti-helminth defense because these cells differentiate into effectors supplying the th2 cytokines and cd40l contacts required for isotype switching to ige by b cells circulating ige directed against worm surface molecules can bind to the pathogen attracting the attention of circulating eosinophils expressing fcri molecules at a moderate density alternatively prior to encountering specific antigen the anti-parasite ige may bind to mast cells expressing high levels of fcri allowing these cells to pre-arm against the parasite in either case the interaction of parasite antigen anti-parasite ige and fcri triggers intracellular signaling within eosinophils and mast cells that induces degranulation in close proximity to the worm eosinophil granules contain a variety of chemical substances that work directly and indirectly to kill the worm some molecules degrade the skin of the worm creating an opening that allows other eosinophils to penetrate into its underlying tissues these cells also degranulate and release additional toxic proteins and peptides that kill the worm in addition certain enzymes released from the eosinophil granule can further stimulate the release of histamine by activated mast cells histamine causes the contraction of host intestinal and bronchial smooth muscles that is associated with peristalsis and bronchospasm the actions of these muscles can shake the parasite loose from its grip on the mucosae and expel it from the body histamine is also directly toxic to some helminth parasitesthe th2 cytokines il-5 il-4 and il-13 are vitally important for defense against helminth worms il-5 strongly promotes the proliferation differentiation and activation of eosinophils and supports the differentiation of plasma cells that have undergone isotype switching to iga production as we learned in chapter 20 iga is the precursor to secretory iga that coats the mucosae and fends off parasite attachment particularly that of schistosome worms in humans il-5 expression is strongly associated with resistance to s mansonii infection il-4 and il-13 suppress macrophage production of il-12 inhibiting ifn production and hence the development of a th1 response il-13 is also required for the development of airway hyperresponsiveness and the alterations to gastrointestinal fluids and the functions of intestinal smooth muscle and epithelial cells that accompany gi pathogen expulsion both il-4 and il-13 are effective in inducing th2 responses to nematode and schistosome infections but the response to a specific parasite may rely more heavily on one cytokine than the other for example il-13 is more important than il-4 for the expulsion of nippostrongylus brasiliensis from the gut of mice but either will do for the elimination of trichurus muris
the simplest evasion strategy is of course to avoid detection in the first place l major hides from the immune response by sequestering itself within host macrophages some schistosomes are masked from immune surveillance by the surface acquisition of host self antigens such as blood group glycolipids and forms of mhc class i and ii molecules the dense forest created by these host molecules blocks the host antibodies from binding to parasite surface antigens other schistosomes and other protozoans repel antibody attack by shedding their membranes ejecting the immune complex of the parasite antigen and host antibodylike viruses parasites use antigenic variation to avoid detection for example t brucei spontaneously modifies its expression of surface molecules to forestall recognition by circulating antibody there are multiple perhaps as many as 1000 separate genes encoding versions of the dominant surface glycoprotein vsg variable surface glycoprotein covering the trypanosome each trypanosome expresses only one copy of the vsg gene at a time but regularly shuts down that gene and switches to another that results in a glycoprotein coat of a slightly different amino acid sequence antibodies raised to the first vsg protein may not recognize the second allowing the parasite to escape recognition and thus destruction
p falciparum has evolved multiple means of antigenic variation to confound immune surveillance first of all different strains of p falciparum express variant-specific forms of a large number of non-cross-reacting antigens on the surfaces of infected host erythrocytes these strains tend to be endemic to a particular geographic region an individual resistant to one strain of the parasite who travels to a new region will therefore likely be susceptible to the strain dominant in that region moreover within the same host successive populations of rbcs infected with the same strain of p falciparum can express slightly different versions of certain parasite proteins the expression of the novel antigens confounds antibodies previously raised against the antigens expressed in the first wave in addition many proteins necessary for parasite development are expressed only during the developmental stage in which they are required this strategy minimizes the window of time during which a particular anti-parasite antibody can be effective by the time antibodies to an early stage antigen are raised the parasite may have either become intracellular or moved on in its life cycle such that the early antigen is no longer expressedmost parasites have developed strategies to avoid destruction by the effector cells in which they have hidden the macrophage phagosomes in which t gondii is contained are unable to fuse with lysosomes sparing this organism attack by hydrolytic enzymes like many intracellular bacterial species the protozoan t cruzi enzymatically lyses the phagosomal membrane prior to lysosomal fusion and escapes to the cytoplasm of the host cell while a significant proportion of early stage l major promastigotes succumb to lysosomal destruction of phagosomal contents the later stage is somehow able to resist digestion there is evidence that the receptor used by the later stage parasite to access macrophages may not trigger a complete respiratory burst making the phagosome a less hostile environment for the late stage invader some parasites such as the intestinal protozoan entamoeba histolytica turn the tables and lyse resting granulocytes macrophages and lymphocytes with which they come in contactparasites have developed unique approaches to avoiding complement-mediated destruction while the stages of many parasites that live in invertebrate vectors can be easily eliminated by mac attack those stages that infect vertebrate cells have modified their cell membranes so that these organisms no longer trigger the alternative complement activation pathway furthermore there is evidence that the vertebrate stages of several parasites express a molecule that functionally resembles the mammalian rca protein daf still other parasites can proteolytically repel complement-activating molecules that have attached to their surfaces or cleave the fc portions of membrane-bound antibodies for example l major can induce the release of the entire complement terminal complex from its surface some parasites can secrete molecules that force fluid phase complement activation resulting in exhaustion of complement componentsactive manipulation of the host immune response is a tactic used by some sophisticated parasites including p falciparum certain epitope variants produced by this parasite promote secretion by t cells of the immunosuppressive cytokine il-10 rather than ifn resulting in downregulation of mhc class ii expression inhibition of no production and decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines by t cells in addition plasmodium-infected rbcs express a parasite-encoded adhesion protein that allows the rbcs to bind to integrins on the surfaces of dcs and macrophages this binding blocks the activation of macrophages and interferes with the maturation of dcs thus inhibiting apc function and t cell responses the erythrocytic stage of malaria infection can also induce the accelerated apoptosis of antigen-specific memory t cells l major uses slightly different tactics to manipulate the host immune response the reader will recall from our previous discussion of viral evasion strategies that the cross-linking of cd46 complement receptors or fcrs on macrophages by viral components inhibits il-12 production at the transcriptional level similarly molecules expressed by l major promastigotes and amastigotes can bind to macrophage cr3 and fcrs respectively and reduce il-12 production the th1 response that would kill the parasite is thus inhibited lastly some parasites secrete hormone-like peptides that appear to downregulate the host immune responsefungi tend to be either unicellular and yeast-like spherical such as candida species or multicellular and filamentous like aspergillus some fungi live commensally on the topologically external surfaces of the body while others live most of their lives in the soil as a mass mycelium of thread-like processes hyphae dimorphic fungi adopt a yeast-like form at one stage in their life cycle and a hyphal form at another stage fungal cells have a cell wall like bacteria but also a cell membrane like mammalian cells however the fungal cell wall lacks the peptidoglycans teichoic acids and lipopolysaccharide components of the bacterial wall and the main component of the fungal cell membrane is ergosterol rather than the cholesterol found in mammalian cell membranesmost fungal species are not harmful to healthy humans however immunocompromised individuals can suffer from acute infections that sometimes go on to become persistent such is the case with many candida and aspergillus species which are part of the normal host flora but which can start to become invasive if immune surveillance by phagocytes fails species of soil-living filamentous fungi produce progeny in the form of conidia spores which can become airborne and thus inhaled by a host within the host the conidia develop into either hyphae or other specialized forms better suited for host tissue invasion however a pathogenic fungus accesses the body its primary target tissue is usually the vascular system invasion of blood vessels by a growing fungus chokes off the blood supply to the host tissue damaging or killing it the exceptions are the dermatophytes filamentous fungi that infect the skin hair and nails these organisms which include species of epidermophyton microsporum and trichophyton cannot penetrate the living cellular tissue of a healthy host and so are restricted to parts of the body that lack living cells such as the keratinized outer layer of skindiseases caused by fungal infections are called mycoses important fungal pathogens are blastomyces dermatitidis histoplasma capsulatum candida species aspergillus species cryptococcus neoformans and pneumocystis carinii table 22-13
 blastomycosis occurs when conidia of the yeast-like fungus b dermatitidis are inhaled this organism replicates extracellularly to cause a pulmonary infection that spreads through the blood to the skin bones and male urogenital tract but not the gut in contrast h capsulatum is an intracellularly replicating yeast-like fungus that causes histoplasmosis inhaled microconidia develop into histoplasma that take up residence preferentially in local respiratory macrophages a progressive pulmonary disease resembling tuberculosis can spread to the secondary lymphoid organs mucosae gut and adrenal glands candida species such as c albicans and c tropicalis lurk in the normal flora at the mucosae but not in the skin and cause disease only if these mucosal barriers are compromised a deficiency of neutrophils in the host neutropenia leaves him or her especially vulnerable to candidiasis such candida infections are usually fairly superficial in nature such as vaginitis and cystitis but can progress to infections of the eye skin and brain inhalation of spores of aspergillus species causes a variety of diseases and can induce allergic responses conidia of three species a fumigatus a flavus and a niger are particularly pathogenic for humans causing invasive pulmonary infections that can be fatal if allowed to entrench again neutropenia is an aggravating factor clumps of filamentous aspergillus readily colonize previously damaged airway tissues aspergillus species also produce mycotoxins that damage hepatocytes macrophages and ctls c neoformans is a yeast-like fungus often present in pigeon droppings when the unencapsulated spores of cryptococcus are inhaled by a host the parasite enters the lung and synthesizes a protective capsule that inhibits phagocytosis if the infection becomes established the result may be cryptococcosis a syndrome of pulmonary infection accompanied by meningitis p carinii is a unicellular eukaryote that although classified as a fungus shares structural features with the protozoan parasites p carinii infection causes pcp pcarinii pneumonia a common feature in immunocompromised individuals especially aids patients inhalation of p carinii results in severe lung damage in hosts lacking cell-mediated immune responses spread of the infection to other tissues does not usually occuras mentioned previously most fungi do not establish infections in humans with competent innate and adaptive immune responses cell-mediated innate immunity is the primary means by which fungus infections are controlled neutrophils and macrophages both carry out vigorous phagocytosis and produce powerful anti-fungal defensins these defensins induce an osmotic imbalance in pathogens such as candida and cryptococcus that kills them neutrophils and macrophages also secrete copious quantities of il-1 il-12 and tnf as we have seen il-12 stimulation activates nk cells that contribute to fungal cell killing via cytokine secretion rather than natural cytotoxicity ifn produced first by activated nk cells and later by activated th1 cells also hyperactivates macrophages which can initiate granuloma formationinterestingly a fungus present in its unicellular yeast-like form tends to provoke a protective th1 response whereas its hyphal form tends to induce a non-protective th2 response there is some evidence that either distinct subsets of dcs or distinct receptors on dcs respond to the two different fungal morphologies these dcs then proceed with phagocytosis and antigen processing and presentation and influencing th1th2 differentiation in the direction best suited to eliminate the particular form of the fungus present the identity of the receptors driving this recognition is not yet clear but it has been shown that much like it binds to the lps of bacteria tlr4 can recognize and bind to the polysaccharide glucuronoxylomannan gxm present in the capsule of c neoformans in addition in one model of candida infection tlr4-deficient mice had a higher pathogen burden than wild-type controlsthe th1 response induced by exposure to airborne fungal spores or invasion by skin or mucosal fungal flora that have a yeast-like form is mediated by cells producing copious quantities of il-2 and ifn accordingly il-12 production has an anti-fungal effect as evidenced by the fact that mice deficient for the p40 subunit of il-12 are highly susceptible to c albicans infection as mentioned previously neutrophils along with macrophages appear to be the key producers of il-12 during fungal infections thus individuals with neutropenia show enhanced susceptibility to attack by these pathogens the exception appears to be p carinii infection in animal models it is macrophagemonocyte production of tnf and il-1 that is most important for defense the production of these cytokines depends on cd40l contacts supplied by activated t cellsth2 responses are comparatively rare during infections with yeast-like fungi those patients that respond with th2 responses in place of th1 responses when attacked by a yeast-like form show decreased resistance to the fungus such a bias appears in patients suffering from chronic mucosal c albicans infections while dth responses in the skin counteract fungal invasion the presence of th2-associated antibodies such as ige and igg4 in the absence of a dth response can actually predispose patients to recurrent fungal infections t cells play a significant role in anti-fungal defense at the mucosae mice deficient for  t cells show enhanced susceptibility to c albicans infections in wild-type mice polyclonal expansion of  t cells in the gastric mucosa occurs upon oral exposure to c albicans protein antigens isolated from certain fungi can be used in vitro to stimulate human  t cells to produce factors promoting b cell differentiationother than the secretory iga that defends the mucosae antibodies are thought to contribute in only a limited way to defense against fungi antibody-mediated opsonization may promote phagocytosis and thus contribute to the presentation of fungal antigens that activates th1 cells mice deficient for b cells show a deficit in cell-mediated immunity that allows the establishment of infections with candida species and p carinii
while fungal cells can activate the complement cascade they are generally resistant to complement-mediated lysis however they are subject to phagocytosis when opsonized by complement products fungi also express analogues of complement receptors that facilitate adherence to host cells and may also promote phagocytosis pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by products of complement activation also contribute to anti-fungal defenseas mentioned previously many fungi adopt different forms at different stages in their life cycles making immune defense necessarily more complex the structure of the fungal cell wall and membrane means that fungi generally can avoid complement-mediated lysis in addition many fungi have developed strategies to offset the effector actions of neutrophils macrophages ctls and nk cells table 22-14

many fungi produce toxins and other molecules that have immunosuppressive effects some appear to mediate immune deviation biasing the hosts immune reactions to ineffective th2 responses at the expense of th1 responses others have more direct inhibitory effects for example gliotoxin a metabolite produced by a fumigatus inhibits the activation of nf-b in stimulated t and b cells blocking the transcription of genes needed for differentiation a molecule called protein 43 acts in an unknown way to suppress immune responses during murine candida infections h capsulatum infection in mice results in no production that downregulates lymphocyte proliferation the gxm polysaccharide present in the capsule of c neoformans spores not only blocks phagocytosis and inhibits neutrophil migration but also has downregulatory effects on adaptive immunity in its free form gmx blocks production of il-12 by monocytes downregulates b7 expression on macrophages and activates regulatory t cells in addition melanin produced by c neoformans inhibits both th1 and th2 responses in mice the bad1 molecule of b dermatitidis binds to cr3 on macrophages and blocks the production of tnf by these cellsfor decades scientists were puzzled by a number of related neurodegenerative diseases found in both humans and animals these diseases came to be known as spongiform encephalopathies se because they all caused cns lesions that rendered the brain sponge-like spongiform encephalopathies which are invariably fatal include variant creutzfeldt-jakob disease vcjd and kuru in humans scrapie in sheep and bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease in cattle over the years it was found that each of these diseases could be transmitted to experimental animals by injecting brain extracts from patients or animals that had died of se indeed d carleton gajdusek was awarded a nobel prize in 1976 for his discovery in the early 1960s that kuru in humans represented a new form of infectious disease however while an infectious etiology had been clearly established the actual agents involved remained mysterious analysis of the scrapie agent revealed it to be extremely resistant to heat formalin and both uv- and ionizing irradiationall treatments that normally destroy infectious pathogens furthermore scrapie kuru and vcjd did not provoke any of the normal immune responses expected during an infection an infectious etiology was also difficult to reconcile with the earlier identification in the 1930s of a rare familial form of vcjd that presumably had a genetic etiology finally an se would occasionally arise in a sporadic manner in a patient or animal with no history of familial or infectious transmissionin the 1970s stanley prusiner of the university of california at san francisco attempted to purify the scrapie agent to determine its molecular nature surprisingly protocols that destroyed nucleic acids had no effect on scrapie infectivity while procedures known to destroy proteins reduced its infectious strength by 1982 prusiner concluded that the agent responsible for scrapie infectivity was a protein devoid of any nucleic acid an unprecedented discovery in biology at this point he coined the term prion to identify this novel type of pathogen that was both proteinaceous and infectious the scrapie agent was therefore denoted as prpsc prion protein scrapie further work by prusiner established that prpsc was actually a conformational isomer of a normal glycoprotein found on the surfaces of many mammalian cells this normal glycoprotein was denoted prpc prion protein cellular it turns out that upon exposure to a prpsc molecule a prpc molecule undergoes a dramatic change in conformation an -helical region of the native prpc protein spontaneously re-folds into the -pleated sheet structure characteristic of prpsc this refolding process appears to be facilitated by an as-yet-unidentified co-factor perhaps a membrane lipid it is also unclear exactly where the conversion occurs although there is some evidence pointing to the minute infoldings of the plasma membrane generated during pinocytosis called caveolae as the site in any case when prpsc is introduced into a fresh host it acts as a template for the refolding of existing host prpc molecules into additional copies of prpsc in other words the disease-causing prion can effectively replicate itself in a new host and a mass conversion of the hosts prpc molecules to the prpsc conformation occurs fig 22-15
 unlike prpc the misfolded prpsc has profoundly altered physicochemical properties when the prpsc protein invades cells of the cns it induces brain degeneration that is manifested as the clinical signs of se intriguingly no other part of the body appears to be affected by the presence of prpsc for his discovery of prions and his investigations into the mechanisms by which they cause disease dr prusiner was awarded a nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1997we emphasize that in this infectious form of prion disease there is no mutation of the prpc gene of the host and no change in the amino acid sequence of the affected prpc proteins the disorder is purely one of protein misfolding interestingly it appears that misfolding of native proteins may be implicated in other neurodegenerative disorders such as alzheimers disease parkinsons disease and frontotemporal dementia other forms of prion disease are inherited rather than infectious and do involve a mutation of the hosts prpc gene more than 20 such mutations have been identified some of which may account for the sporadic cases of prion disease that have been reported over the years once a mutated prpc gene arises de novo in one individual the pathogenic gene is passed down to his or her offspringthe bse epidemic in great britain in the 1990s was likely a case of infectious prion disease caused by the feeding of scrapie-infected sheep offal to cattle a small number of humans who consumed beef processed from these cattle then acquired the prpsc protein and became ill with vcjd the use of sheep offal as animal feed is now banned but 1 million cattle were thought to have been infected with prions before this restriction came into place infectious prions are also responsible for the human disease kuru kuru was found almost exclusively among the fore people of new guinea a tribe that used to routinely engage in ritualistic cannibalism this practice included eating the brain tissue of dead relatives some of whom had died of kuru at the urging of missionaries the practice of cannibalism ended in the late 1950s so that the incidence of kuru has declined steadily since that timeprion infection destroys the brain without inducing either a humoral or cell-mediated adaptive response the hosts t cells are usually tolerant to the prpsc protein as it is merely a naturally occurring host protein with modified secondary structure thus almost all peptides generated from newly formed prpsc will be seen as self peptides by extension in the absence of the activation of prion-specific t cells no td humoral response can be mounted furthermore although the foreign conformation of prpsc might be recognized by the bcr of a b cell the antigen itself cannot act as a ti immunogen as it has neither the large size or multi-valency needed to stimulate b cells directlydespite the preceding work in experimental animals has shown that the prpc protein can be immunogenic in so-called prp00 mice in which the gene encoding prpc has been knocked out the natural tolerance to the protein is absent and a normal prpc-specific humoral response is seen after immunization with murine prpc in adjuvant in another experiment prp00 mice were immunized with plasmids expressing dna see ch 23 encoding human prion proteins inducing production of mouse anti-human prpc antibodies similarly chickens immunized with either human or bovine prpc coupled to the carrier klh generate antibodies directed against human or bovine prpc such anti-prpc antibody preparations are useful for both the study of prions and as potential tools for the diagnosis prevention and treatment of prion diseasesin view of the natural tolerance to prpc discussed previously one might assume that the immune system is neutral with respect to prion diseases however it appears that the immune system may actually promote the progress of prion disease both directly and indirectly in a natural setting prion infection occurs by a peripheral route usually oral leukocytes are among the first cells to take up the prions but the replication of the prions via prpc conversion causes no harm to these cells in contrast to the severe damage done to neurons however leukocytes are apparently responsible for the subsequent introduction of prions into the cns in addition it seems that the fdc in the lymphoid follicles is required for the replication of prions that precedes their spread into the nervous system the mechanism remains obscure but is an absolute requirement for prion disease progression there is also evidence that the activation of specific complement components plays a role in the initial trapping of prions in the lymphoid organs soon after infection this too may relate to fdc function since c3dc4b-opsonized antigens interact with cr2cr1 complement receptors on fdc and may therefore be important for the intracellular accumulation of prions in the fdc other studies have suggested that macrophages and dcs can be involved in prion disease and that a microbial or viral pathogen may sometimes act as a triggering co-factorindirect support for the involvement of the immune system in prion pathogenesis comes from studies of mouse models of scrapie infection in these experiments susceptibility to prion disease correlated with the functional status of the immune system for example while mitogenic stimulation of lymphoid cells enhanced prion disease susceptibility lymphoid suppression achieved by either corticosteroid administration or splenectomy reduced it in addition studies of mice assessed at various time points after birth showed that increasing susceptibility to prion infection correlated with the progressive maturation of the immune system lastly and perhaps most strikingly scid mice which cannot mount either t or b cell-mediated responses were resistant to infection by the bse or scrapie agents while immunologically reconstituted scid mice were not a more complete understanding of prion infection and disease processes will be critical to development of prevention strategies and therapies for these fascinating but deadly disordersthis brings us to the end of our description of natural immune defense against pathogens we move now to a discussion of manufactured immunity to pathogens created by the techniques of vaccination
summaryimmune responses have evolved to combat the five major types of pathogens extracellular bacteria intracellular bacteria viruses parasites and fungi for all types of pathogens the mechanisms of innate immunity offer an immediate response that either foils the establishment of infection or slows the infection down until adaptive immune mechanisms can target the pathogen more effectively when an adaptive immune response is activated the elements that will be most effective depend on whether the pathogen is extracellular or intracellular extracellular entities that are relatively small such as extracellular bacteria virus particles protozoan parasites and some fungi can be targeted by antibody and then cleared effectively by antibody-and complement-mediated mechanisms that involve either direct lysis or phagocytic destruction protozoan worms are also subject to antibody assault because they are extracellular however these organisms are too large to be subsequently engulfedinstead specialized antibody isotypes such as iga and ige are produced to ensure that the worm does not become anchored in the host in addition mediators released by degranulating mast cells and eosinophils act on worm tissues to degrade them intracellular bacteria and replicating viruses which are found inside host cells and cannot be targeted by antibody must be eliminated by cytolytic mechanisms mediated by ctls nk cells nkt cells and  t cells a successful immune response against a given pathogen thus depends on cells and cytokines of the innate response inducing th responses of the appropriate subtype with th1 responses being required for cell-mediated immunity against internal threats and th2 responses being needed for humoral responses against external threats in the quest for continued survival many pathogens have evolved complex evasion strategies intended to compromise the success of the immune response invoked
the various homodimers and heterodimers of nf-b are kept inactive by association with cytoplasmic inhibitory proteins 28 they are ib ib and ib and also the p105 and p100 precursors of p50 and p52 are there roles for the - - -subunits of the ikk complex 29 ikk is a histone h3 kinase that moves into nuclei to associate with the promoters of nf-b-responsive genes 30 31 ikk contributes to nf-b dna binding on gene promoters thus it derepresses il-8 ciap2 and more yet it creates a negative feed-back loop for nf-kb and macrophage activation 32 32b 33 in fact ikk resolves inflammation by switching off the canonical pathway by accelerating turnover of crel and rela ikk attenuates ikk driven nf-b activation and so inflammation it can also promote adaptive immunity via the non-canonical pathway 33when nemoikk shuttles into nuclei it creates feedback by repression of nf-b gene expression nemo binds to other proteins like rip and a20 and it regulates the ikk-related kinases ikk and tbk1 tank binding kinase 1 which regulate interferon regulatory factors irf3 and irf7as for ikk it can increase the activity of hypoxia-inducible factor 2 hif2 33b so linking hypoxia to innate immunity and inflammation and it activates a subset of ifn-stimulated genes for sure ikk promotes the canonical pathway of nf-b activation fig 111a 29 ikk promotes the map kinases and cell proliferation eg in skin keratinocytes 29 all the actions are tissue specific yet ikk exerts negative control over the production of il-1 34furthermore in some situations ikk can suppress m1 host defence macrophages so that it is anti-inflammatory34b but it promotes m2 immune regulation macrophages 34cthere is an alternative means of nf-b activation 35 lymphotoxin baff b cell-activating factor cd40l or rankl receptor activator of nf-b ligand activate nik nf-b-inducing kinase and it then acts on ikk homodimer whose target is nf-b2 p100 phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination of the p100 is only partial the n-terminal p52 is released and joins with relb to enter the nuclei fig 112 this alternative path via p52relb enables baff blys to activate b lymphocytes the alternative path essentially provides organogenic chemokines 4 for the development of lymphoid tissue 36 and adaptive immunity the nf-b2 is also required for establishment of thymic central tolerance through an aire-dependent pathway 37 aire is the autoimmune regulator gene and nf-b2 is required in medullary thymic epithelial cells
whenever rankl stimulates osteoclastogenesis the nf-b2 p100 path is implicated 38 acting on receptor rank on bone stromal cells rankl stimulates their nfatc1 and c-fos so that osteoclasts are formed this activation is reinforced by ca2-calmodulin cam stimulation of nfatc and of cam kinase iv which stimulates camp response element-binding protein creb on the promoter for osteoclast marker genes nik has been shown by the study of mouse knockouts to control the activities of lymphocytes and osteoclasts in inflammatory arthritis 39 nik mice have no peripheral lymph nodes defective t and b cells and impaired rankl-induced osteoclastogenesis one might also be interested that when ultraviolet light acts on skin to cause immunosuppression by induction of treg cells rankl on keratinocytes first stimulates rank on langerhans cells vitamin d3 which is immunosuppressive also induces rankl 40all nf-b activation pathways share the proteasome-mediated step fig 111 structures of nuclear factor kappa b nf-b family members all five nf-b members are related through the conserved rel homology domain rhd which contains sequences for dna binding dimerization inhibitor association and nuclear localization the members c-rel rela and relb contain a c-terminal transactivation domain tad the function of the tads is enhanced by phosphorylation and acetylation the second group the p105p50 and p100p52 arises as precursors p100 and p105 that are partially proteolysed by the 26s proteasome to yield the mature p52 and p50 units they contain c-terminal sequences with inhibitory ankyrin ank repeats and this means that they can also function as unit i-kappa b ibs and retain rel proteins in the cytoplasm the five to seven ankyrin repeats of inhibitory ib proteins interact with nf-b dimers and mask their nuclear localization signals nlss that causes the degradation of the inhibitory proteins posttranslational modifications like phosphorylation 42 acetylation 43 or prolyl isomerization modulate the activity of the p65 or p50 subunits thus acetylation of multiple lysine residues by p300cbf acetyltransferases fig 48 modifies the behaviour of nf-b components acetylation works as an intranuclear molecular switch 44 acetylation of p65 stops inhibition by ib and controls nuclear nf-b oxidative stress via its formation of h2o2 which enhances degradation of ib enhances nf-b activity 22b thus macrophages have increased production of cyclooxygenase 2 cox-2 prostaglandin e2 pge2 and matrix metalloproteinase 1 mmp-1 45activation of nf-b-inducible genes table 111 usually takes place by means of the p65p50 dna binding heterodimers of the classical pathway significant fluctuation in p50 levels can alter the abundance and composition of nf-b complexes within a cell when animals or cells are exposed to repeated small doses of lps the output of cytokines via nf-b activation is thwarted and the animals or cells show endotoxin tolerance the explanation is that p50p50 homodimers are formed instead of the p65p50 and the consequence is suppression of nf-b-inducible genes 46 p65 has a transactivation domain whereas p50 does not p50p50 homodimers as produced by il-10 or by protein kinase a are inhibitory cells that are tolerant to endotoxin still respond to lps with the degradation of ib and nuclear translocation of p50 and p65 yet they cannot form il-1 in such cells it was found that relb represses inflammatory gene expression 47 alternatively in endotoxin tolerance mobilization of toll-like receptor 4 tlr4 into lipid rafts is curtailed 48p53 turns out to be a buffer of the innate immune system because p53 works as an antagonist of nf-b to dampen chronic inflammation p53null macrophages show very high release of cytokines il-1 il-6 and il-12 in response to lps or ifn in fact p53 downregulates stat1 and proinflammatory cytokines 49 in some cells like leucocytes ib negatively regulates intranuclear nf-b activity 50 we have noted how lps exposure can attenuate tnf gene transcription because nf-b p50 homodimers bind to the tnf promoter in addition lps induces bcl-3 b cell lymphoma 3 which is an anti-inflammatory regulator 32b51 bcl-3 is only located in cell nuclei and it associates with p50p50 homodimers and acts as a negative regulator of tlr signalling 52 bcl-3 reduces transcription of proinflammatory cytokines it mediates some of the anti-inflammatory activities of il-10 sect 1216 bcl-6 is another transcriptional repressor protein repression by bcl-6 is cell-type specific bcl-6 negatively regulates the expression of the nf-b1 p105p50 subunit in macrophages it negatively regulates the chemokines monocyte chemotactic peptide 1 mcp-1 mcp-3 and mip-1 53 indeed in bcl-6 mice there is florid t helper lymphocyte th2-mediated inflammation bcl-6 is essential for formation of germinal centres and for a normal antibody response 54 bcl-6 suppresses p53 expression in germinal centre b lymphocytes bcl-6 interacts with tf miz-1 to suppress p21 and thus to allow proliferation of germinal centre b cells 55 activating mutations or chromosomal translocations that affect bcl-6 are relevant to b cell lymphomas 56 57 the t 314 translocation affecting bcl-6 is part of diffuse large b cell lymphoma dlbclone should consider the pharmacological means of control of nf-b table 112 commensal gut bacteria like bacteroides reduce the activity of nf-b in gut mucosal epithelial cells actually bacteroides species activate perioxisome proliferator-activated receptor- ppar receptors which take rela out of cell nuclei of the gastrointestinal gi epithelium hence cytokine production via nf-b is suppressed 58 clearly inflammatory reactions at the gut mucosa can cause much trouble hence note that local gi macrophages show downregulation of their trem1 triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cell 1-activating receptors trem would amplify cytokine-induced responses this is explained by the local environment in which there is plentiful il-10 suppressive cytokine and transforming growth factor- tgf 59enhanced nf-b activity occurs in the gut mucosa in inflammatory bowel diseases in crohns disease there is high expression of the immunoproteasome so that there is enhanced processing of the p105  p50 and enhanced degradation of inhibitor ib then p50c-rel is important for ifn induction of proteasomes via il-12-driven th1 cell responses 60phosphorylation of crel is needed for antiviral responses accordingly tbk1 tank binding kinase-1 and ikk phosphorylate the c-terminal of crel so that p50crel can bind at nf-b sites 61 tbk also phosphorylates irf3 this means that interferors ifn are induced 101007978-1-60327-538-514 62anti-inflammatory cytokines il-10 and il-13 suppress the activation of nf-b unlike many cytokines il-10 does not activate the nf-b heat shock proteins inhibit nf-b by stopping the degradation of ib 22c there is accumulating information on drugs and antioxidants like n-acetylcysteine 63 resveratrol of red wine or the polyunsaturated fatty acid pufa conjugated lineoleic acid cla 64 that inhibit nf-b activation and thus have anti-inflammatory propertiesthose with therapeutic inclinations will be interested in physiological mediators and drugs that can be used to inhibit nf-b table 112 the immunosuppressant cyclosporin stops rela activation and so reduces il-2 formation by t lymphocytes 65 decoy deoxynucleotides or negative mutants of nf-b are used by the biochemist a recent review of pharmacological aspects of nf-b 66 listed inhibitory peptides for nf-b that have been used in anti-inflammatory exploration the cyclopentenone 15-deoxypgj2 is anti-inflammatory by virtue of its ability to modulate tfs 67 it also acts to potentiate nitric oxide no stopping neutrophil ingressin this amazing list of diverse agents note that t regulatory suppressor lymphocytes act in part by inhibition of nf-b thus li et al 68 demonstrated how suppressor lymphocytes stop the presentation of cd86 on antigen-presenting cells apcs ibns is an inhibitor that binds to nuclear relp65 it accounts for negative selection of thymocytes 69 and t lymphocytes or macrophages 32bdendritic cells dcs use nf-b for their maturation and they use nf-b to help form th1 lymphocytes and cd8 cytotoxic t cells nf-b p50-rela determines the differentiation of dcs and their survival and their formation of il-12 depends on nf-b p50-crel 70 not surprisingly we know of numerous microorganisms that are able to subvert nf-b activation to gain entry into the body 71 conversely if there is p38 map kinase activation that will lead to nf-b induction of inflammatory genes 72 nf-b supports adaptive immunity and the elimination of microbial invadersglucocorticoids on that list are immunosuppressive agents their glucocorticoid receptors grs suppress the activity of creb-binding protein cbpp300 induce corepressors like histone deacetylase 2 hdac2 73 similarly pge2 is anti-inflammatory by virtue of the fact that it enhances the expression of ib and ineffectual p50p50 homodimers form 74 it turns out that 125oh2 vitamin d3 and 124oh2d2 inhibit tnf expression by macrophages what is more these forms of vitamin d increase the activity of ib thus they inhibit nf-b activity 75obviously using ppar and - agonists fig 414 is a way of dealing with inflammation ppar knockout mice show augmented inflammation in them there is marked expression of tnf and il-1 and expression of fas ligand in the course of carrageenan-induced paw oedema or carrageenan-induced pleurisy 76the involvement of effector molecules in physiological or pathological processes can now be elucidated or confirmed by the use of gene knockout ko or transgenic tg mice into which an extra gene is inserted already examples have been mentioned mouse models that lack almost all the known genes for g protein -subunits have been generated to give insight into g protein signal pathways gq-deficient platelets fail to aggregate in response to thrombin adenosine diphosphate adp or thromboxane a2 txa2 due to lack of agonist-induced phospholipase c activation mice lacking gq have increased bleeding times and are protected against thromboembolism mice with knockout of gene granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gm-csf develop silting of the lungs by alveolar proteinosis which is a clear indication of the cause of this rare condition transgenic mice that overexpress phospholipase a2 which generates leukotrienes and platelet-activating factor paf fig 62b develop exuberant atherosclerosis they show enhanced oxidation of their plasma low-density lipoprotein ldl mice that lack neutrophil elastase ne cannot clear infections with intracellular bacteria 77 mice deficient in cathepsin g succumb to staphylococcus aureus 78 the subtleties of nf-b controls are gradually being elucidated by techniques like this cf 79 b lymphocytes with rela deficiency were killed easily by exposure to tnf since they had reduced expression of flice ie caspase 8 and of bcl-2 antiapoptotic protein clearly nf-b enables b cell survival by eliminating the effects of tnf toxicity this may remind one that c-flip inhibitor of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway is known to promote nf-b signalling and cell survival 80 rna interference rnai is a mechanism for sequence-specific posttranscriptional inhibition of gene expression acting on double-stranded rna molecules small interfering rnas can be applied to mammalian cells thus rnai was used to show how phospholipase d pld-1 colocalises with actin filaments at the adhesive surfaces of macrophages 81 rnai has been used to assess the role of p50 nf-b1 protein in the maturation of monocyte-derived dcs sirna for p50 reduces the transcription of il-12 p40 absence of nf-b1 p50 or of c-rel leads to impaired survival of dcs and lack of il-12 production il-12 production in macrophages is blocked when the ifn receptor or the tnfri are removed by gene deletions in mice nf-b2 p52 derived from precursor p100 when eliminated in knockout mice results in dcs with enhanced relb activity enhanced relb is accompanied by enhanced mhc class ii molecule expression on apcs and an increased ability to induce cd4 lymphocytes table 113
various pathways help to stimulate the expression of cox-2 such as ros tumour promoters growth factors oncogenes and cytokines her2neu related to the epidermal growth factor receptor egfr does this in breast cancer also in breast and colon cancers there is activation of nfat nuclear factor of activated t cells which leads to cox-2 induction and so formation of pge2 tumours with elevated cox-2 will be invasive 82 indeed typical metastatic gene products are cox-2 intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 icam1 vascular endothelial growth factor vegf and metalloproteinase 9 see 101007978-1-60327-538-518generally transcription of cox-2 gene is promoted by pkc ras signalling and especially map kinase induction of nf-b and cebp and factors that stimulate activator protein 1 ap-1 83 84 fig 113 this is similar to induction of cytokines consider the situation when helicobacter pylori causes chronic gastritis study of tfs in gastric epithelial cells showed cox-2 promoter induction by nf-b ap-1 and cebp nf-il-6 85 in fig 113 note the canonical tata motif and several important enhancer elements affected by transactivators proinflammatory mediators can activate ribosomal s6 kinase rsk which enhances cebp binding to the cox-2 promoter sphingosine-1-p by stimulation of nf-b also stimulates cox-2 activity 86
cox-2 expression in neutrophils is promoted by ros induction of nf-b in response to cell membrane events 87 likewise when monocytes interact with platelets or p-selectin-coated surfaces there is activation of nf-b and so cox-2 in a second phase il-1 stabilizes the cox-2 messenger rna mrna which it does by silencing of the binding protein are thus there is enhanced translation 88 induction of cox-2 in macrophages is also biphasic and requires cebp and cebp tfs 89 conserved elements in the macrophage cox-2 gene promoter as revealed by analysis after exposure to lps are cre2nf-b-cebpap-1cre1e-boxtata the e-box mediates transcriptional repression whilst the other cis-elements are activating at 6 h after lps administration cox-2 gene transcription was completely dependent on phospho-c-jun along with the p50 of nf-b 90 one can compare this information with the details of the promoter for cox-2 in airway smooth muscle cellswith regard to the discussion in 101007978-1-60327-538-54 one can expect that there will be histone acetylation on h3h4 at the cox-2 promoter and phosphorylation of h3 histonesthere are different patterns of histone h4 acetylation induced by il-1 or by bradykinin whereas il-1-induced transcription utilises nf-il-6 nf-b and cre bradykinin uses cre 91 induction of cox-2 in macrophages is complicated normally any response to nf-b activation is rapid full cox-2 expression in macrophages is delayed since there first has to be induction of tnf by ifn 92 in mesangial cells tgf is able to stimulate cox-2 93 when mouse macrophages respond to virus or double-stranded rna dsrna there is selective induction of jun n-terminal kinase jnk and p38 and therefore activation of nf-b that activates cox-2 94as a lesson consider how the peptidoglycan of bacterial cell walls stimulates tlr2 receptors hence there is nf-b activation that activates cox-2 and pge2 is produced this pge2 then acts on ep2ep4 surface receptors of the macrophages so that camp is produced and protein kinase a is activated which then accounts for ser276 phosphorylation on the p65 of nf-b the consequence is that peptidoglycan elicits the secretion of il-6 95 pge2 induction of stat3 is operative in this process 96transactivation of a particular gene requires a large complex of proteins figs 48 419 in their inactive state ppars are complexes in the cell cytoplasm along with corepressor proteins on activation they dissociate and move into the nuclei where ppars form heterodimers with retinoid x receptors fig 414 ppar receptors are highly expressed in macrophage-derived foam cells in atheroma it was found that ppar receptors are involved in the differentiation of monocyte macrophages and that ppar receptors help to regulate their inflammatory activities 97 in macrophages ppar serves as a stimulus for the anti-inflammatory action of carbon monoxideppar will promote the survival of lymphocytes since they suppress ros by boosting antioxidants and they attenuate any decline in adenosine triphosphate atp 98 yet fatty acid ligands for ppar can inhibit proliferation of activated t lymphocytes through inhibition of il-2 formation and induced t cell apoptosis the ppar associates with nfat so the dna binding and transcriptional activation of the il-2 promoter is blocked also ppar receptors are expressed on dcs and ppar ligands inhibit the release of il-12 99 dcs treated with synthetic ppar ligands have reduced ability to stimulate lymphocytes people are getting excited about the potential use of ppar ligands in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis 100 ppar agents will decrease synovial production of tnf il-6 il-8 metalloproteinases 101 and no doubt il-12 fig 1212both ppars and liver x receptors of the nuclear-receptor superfamily function in combination with the grs to repress inflammatory response genes 102 ncor nuclear receptor corepressor and smrt corepressor complexes which are able to interact with nf-b and ap-1 maintain the repression of inflammatory response genes cf fig 114
ppar receptors respond to a different set of ligandsdrugs ppar receptors are also expressed on monocyte macrophages and ligands can induce apoptosis of those cells ppar receptors dampen endothelial cell inflammatory responses in aged mice oxidative stress-induced nf-b is apparent in many tissues fortunately ppar agonists restore the cellular redox balance so there is amelioration of the production of inflammatory cytokines 103 since nf-b is inhibited cf fig 114 fenofibrate has been shown to repress il-17 expression in cultured splenocytes and by th-17 cells exposed to caecal bacterial antigensof course if liver x receptors will suppress inflammatory genes appropriate agonists will have enormous potential cytokine release by monocytes in response to lps has been investigated 104 as yet it is not clear how the process operatessurvival of a cell depends on a supply of growth factors from serum and on contact with neighbouring cells or adherence to extracellular matrix proteins 105 the erk pathway fig 43 has the capacity for survival induction but is negatively regulated by phosphatases in conjunction with the proapoptotic p38jnk paths hence cancer cells should not emerge protein kinase b akt confers the attributes of cell survival 106 pi3 kinase pi3k produces ptdins345p3 fig 26 which binds to akt so that it can translocate to the cell membrane where it is phosphorylated by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 pdk-1 when il-2 acts on immune cells akt ensures their survival either a growth factor like pdgf platelet-derived growth factor or a cytokine like tnf will activate akt which then associates with and phosphorylates ikk so that nf-b is activated concurrently akt suppresses proapoptotic influences 107 akt sequesters the proapoptotic protein bad it inhibits caspase 9 and it reduces transcription of fas ligand cf fig 83 conversely since ceramide-activated pkc and protein phosphatase 2a pp2a negatively regulate the akt survival pathway 108 this explains how ceramide often mediates cell apoptosis nevertheless the 4-subunit of pp2a and other phosphatases works to keep apoptosis in check and to maintain cell survival 109it will help to be precise about what akt can contribute akt can inactivate a death receptor-mediated apoptosis b mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis and c p53-induced apoptosis akt via cot serine-threonine kinase activates nf-b nf-b supports antioxidant enzymes akt phosphorylates glycogen synthase kinase 3 gsk3 ensuring glucose uptake and metabolism gsk3 is important in embryonic development when akt promotes the survival of adult cells akt phosphorylates and inhibits gsk3 110 and thus enables supportive changes in glucose metabolism gsk3 is essential for cell survival but too much or too little will cause apoptosis on the one hand components of the nf-b system are phosphorylated by gsk3 to promote nf-b activity conversely if p53 binds nuclear gsk3 it is activated and promotes the transcriptional and apoptotic actions of p53 111 gsk3 supports formation of proinflammatory cytokines by inducing nf-b and creb interaction with coactivator cbp gsk3 inhibitors are thus anti-inflammatory 112both growth factor and cytokine survival factors for cells like insulin-like growth factor 1 igf-1 or il-3 activate akt which phosphorylates bad at three sites and it then binds 14-3-3 protein and it bad is sequestered in the cytosol so apoptosis cannot occur when macrophages meet endotoxin they have to survive when lps interacts with tlr4 receptors figs 122 125 rip links tlr4 to pi3k and so to akt and cell survival 113 monocyte survival derives from surface ceacam1 cd66a which connects with pi3k and hence to akt activation insulin growth factors i and ii direct protein anabolism and they are mitogens haemopoietic cells that are destined to die when il-2 or il-3 is withdrawn are protected by igf-1 igf-1 is antiapoptotic for many cells 114 and in many cancers an autophosphorylated igf-1r igf-1 receptor mediates antiapoptosis the biochemical scenario is that when igf-1 acts on its igf-1r there is recruitment of a docking protein insulin receptor substrate 2 irs-2 as for insulin and that leads to activation of pi3k pi3k activates a pdk-1 and in turn that activates akt kinase naturally the kinase-regulated signalling pathways are controlled by phosphatases one is calcineurin which will dephosphorylate bad and so reverse the effect of akt phosphorylation the other is pten phosphatase as in fig 26 the product of a tumour suppressor gene 115 116 the function of pten is to hydrolyze 3-phosphorylated inositol phospholipids 117 thus pten acts in opposition to pi3k fig 26 in malignancies both copies of pten are deleted or mutated loss of pten in cells leads to akt drive and this is accompanied by resistance of cells to apoptotic stimuli 118 hence cancer is likely to arisethere are other survival kinases suppressors of myc-induced apoptosis called the pim 
kinases 119 myc induces proliferation but also increased apoptosis of nonmalignant cells however defects in control of apoptosis allow myc to act as an oncogene akt or pim control this both akt and pim inactivate bad pim kinases are implicated in cancers and lymphomas pim kinase was discovered by its ability to stop myc-induced apoptosis in a mouse model of lymphoma cytokines via jak-stat action sect 129 induce pim kinases pim1 -2 -3this section emphasizes the importance of nf-b for cell survival nf-b suppresses apoptosis fig 82 since nf-b supports bcl-2 and bcl-xl it supports the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins ciapc and xiap and c-flip works in its favour 120 it room yet the jnk cascade can work in opposition to the gadd45 and xiap proteins which promote antiapoptosis 120 table 113 likewise the p38 map kinase pathway is proapoptotic 121 122 actually induction of nf-b in some cells enables them to stay alive long enough to acquire genetic errors hence nf-b activity can promote carcinogenesis 5 and help metastases 123 such carcinogenesis is oxygen radical mediated 124 yet generally nf-b is acting to suppress tumour cell growth for it aids triggering of p53 and arf fig 175 however if cells lose their tumour suppressor genes nf-b then promotes oncogenesis 125insulin is a potent anabolic hormone whereas glucose elicits proinflammatory effects insulin is anti-inflammatory for its action suppresses nf-b ap-1 and early growth response 1 egr-1 tfs of course insulin is a principal pancreatic autoantigen relevant to diabetes 126 yet one could be interested in how signalling by the insulin receptors compares with other mechanisms discussed in this text insulin receptor stimulation in insulin-responsive cells leads to translocation of glut4 and glucose transport the insulin receptor is an 22 heterotetrameric complex in which two -subunits and two -subunits are linked by disulphide bonds insulin binds to the extracellular -subunits and it thereby transmits a signal across the plasma membrane that activates the intracellular tyrosine kinase of the -subunit the one -subunit phosphorylates its partner on specific tyrosine residues accordingly the receptor tyrosine kinase induces phosphorylation of irss on multiple tyrosine residues these irs phosphotyrosine residues act as docking sites for sh2 domain containing proteins including the p85 regulatory unit of pi3k fig 27 hence the p110 catalytic unit of pi3k the lipid kinase unit will lead to glucose transport 127 128 other proteins that dock at the insulin receptor include adaptor proteins shc and grb2 growth factor receptor-bound protein leading to ras-map kinase signalling for the mitogenic action of insulin the shp2 phosphatase 129 and cbl casitas b lineage lymphoma proteinthe pi3k fig 115 p110 catalytic unit creates phosphoinositides pi345p3 pi34p2 and pi3p at the plasma membrane fig 26 they increase glut4 translocation but do not actually increase glucose transport that could be mediated by as160 akt substrate of 160 kda 130 the plasma membrane target for the glut4 vesicle is the t-snare called syntaxin 4 inactivation of glut4 in muscle leads to raised plasma glucose and glucose toxicity that results in insulin resistance 131 insulin action is facilitated by the formation of ros at multiple signalling targets 132 but substantial ros produced in response to tnf or dexamethasone creates insulin resistance 133
there is subtle control by suppressor of cytokine signalling socs proteins first socs3 reduces the phosphorylation of irs-1 and its subsequent association with the p85 of pi3k second the socs1 and -6 can inhibit insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity thereby reducing the phosphorylation of irs-12 and the downstream events irs-1 and irs-2 are targeted for proteasomal degradation socs1 and -3 are elevated in rodent models of insulin resistance and diabetesin adipocytes of obese persons with type 2 diabetes irs-2 becomes the main docking protein for pi3k 134 local tnf acting on the adipocytes is a cause of insulin resistance 135 ganglioside gm3 on fat cells corresponds to insulin resistance tnf-induced insulin resistance involves activation of inhibitory serine kinases or tyrosine phosphatases which inhibit the insulin signalling path it works through h2o2 generation also there is serine phosphorylation of irs-1 rather than irs-1 tyrosine phosphorylation that causes reduced insulin receptor kinase activity in skeletal muscle tnf inhibits akt phosphorylation causing insulin resistance 136 ceramide by blocking insulin stimulation of akt leads to insulin resistance 137 tnf can also produces insulin resistance in skeletal muscle by activation of ib kinase inhibitor of nf-b in a p38-dependent manner 138 most particularly there is upregulated jnk which impairs the action of irs 12 138bcrucially we now realize that adiponectin receptors mediate antidiabetic metabolic effects adiponectin promotes glucose uptake fatty acid oxidation and ppar ligand activities adiponectin is decreased in obesity in type 2 diabetes and whenever there is insulin resistance 139 there is more interest in adipokines from fat stores the cytokine resistin inhibits insulin signalling in liver and muscle in mice 140 141insulin resistance is essentially due to decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into skeletal muscle the muscle pi3k with its p110 catalytic unit and p85 regulatory unit actually shows increased transcription of the p85 and of splice variants p55 and p50 and the increase of these subunits must reduce pi3k activity by competing for phosphotyrosine targets 142 insulin resistance is accompanied by endothelial cell dysfunction and there is enhanced aggregability of platelets insulin-resistant macrophages are integral to the problem of metabolic syndrome 143 when they are controlled by knockout of jnk1 insulin resistance is ameliorated and mice are resistant to high-fat diet-induced obesity 144colca 145 rationalized the complex situation by proposing that insulin resistance is a physiological compensation to excessive oxidative metabolism a new successful set of antidiabetic drugs the thiazolidinediones tzds 146 enhances ppar-retinoid x receptor heterodimer formation fig 414 and offsets insulin resistanceinsulin and angiotensin ii ang ii play pivotal roles in the metabolic and circulatory systems failure in their proper actions leads to diabetes mellitus and hypertension respectively 147 there is cross-talk at multiple levels between these systems that affects the action of antihypertensive drugs used in the control of cardiac hypertrophy and energy acquisition by heart muscle thus insulin actually promotes a significant increase of at1 receptor protein expression in vascular smooth muscle cells cf fig 510the insulin signalling system described stems from a balance between tyrosine phosphorylation of irs-1 and the negative effect of irs-1 serine phosphorylation too much of the latter occurs in insulin resistance fig 115 in fact pi3k erk and jnk as activated by angii catalyse the serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and the irs-1 and indeed of pi3k impairing insulin-promoted activation toward akt hence in contrast to the effect of insulin irs-12-associated pi3k activity and thereby endothelial nitric oxide synthase enos activity is inhibited by ang ii in a dose-dependent manner 148 so insulin-induced vasodilatation is thwarted by ang ii furthermore ang ii induces socs3 activity to impair signal transduction through the jak2stat5 signal pathway 149mtor is mammalian target of rapamycin it is an integrator of cellular energy status nutrient and growth factor signals and the coordinator of cell growth and cell cycle progression 150 tor directs cell surface expression of various nutrient transporters amino acids also stimulate mtor via the class 3 pi3ks 151 since insulin and igf-1 are anabolic fig 116 shows how those receptors connect via irs proteins to activation of pi3k and hence akt in its turn akt phosphorylates and inhibits substrates like the foxo forkhead tfs bad gsk3 and tuberin or hamartin tuberin characteristic of benign tumours called hamartomas as seen in tuberose sclerosis 152 153 inhibits tor but tuberin is inhibited by akt this means that akt activity stimulates glucose uptake and cell growth and proliferation and apoptosis is inhibited actually mtor exerts negative feedback on pdgf receptors 154 the tor pathway requires nutrients like the amino acid leucine and then tor complex 1 mtorc1 activates s6 kinase and promotes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e eif4e 155 additionally mtorc2 regulates polarization of the actin cytoskeleton furthermore should cell atp levels fall the energy-sensing kinase ampk inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis fig 11 because it promotes torc2 phosphorylation which blocks its nuclear accumulation 156 ampk is a fuel sensor in muscle ampk is activated by exercise 157 it is a key metabolic regulator in liver heart and muscle ampk is activated by cell camp and it will stimulate fatty acid -oxidation that means that if hepatic ampk is inactivated as occurs in diabetes there is fatty acid synthesis and development of hyperlipidaemia in t cells ampk controls metabolic steps required for cell proliferation 158
the tuberose sclerosis 1 and 2 tsc1-tsc2 protein complex heterodimers integrate cues from growth factors the cell cycle and nutrients to regulate the activity of mtor p70 s6 kinase 4e-bp1  eif4e and ribosomal s6 protein 159 as you will predict hypertrophy of cells is achieved by augmentation of their rna and protein content formation of mrna is determined a by growth factor  ras-erk-mnk-1  eif4e and b by the path mtor  p70 s6 kinasenote that these molecules in fig 116 do not form a linear signal pathway but they act as agonists and antagonists of each others activities stimulation of mtor and s6 kinase by amino acids requires participation of a class 3 pi3k called hvps34 human vacuolar protein sorting 34 160 pi3ks promote glycolysis and thus production of atp as in other situations pten controls pi3k activity loss of pten in mice leads to hyperactive signalling to tor and disturbance of the control of haemopoietic stem cells and a liability to leukaemia 161 understandably mtor must be implicated in carcinogenesis 162gsk3 inhibitors are anti-inflammatory witness that inhibitors like thiazolidinediones tzds attenuate carrageenan-induced lung injury 163in t cells akt is activated maximally when there is coligation of the tcr and cd28 fig135 moreover t cells have ampk1 which is rapidly activated with tcr triggering via the adapter molecules lat and slp76 fig 134 164 when amino acids are supplied mtor phosphorylates components of the translational apparatus like the eukaryotic initiation factor eif4e and p70 s6 kinase cytokines also induce pim1pim2 kinases which help maintain a high rate of glycolysis and protein translation 165rapamycin is a useful immunosuppressant for allograft transplants yet rapamycin does not phenocopy the effects of nutrient or growth factor deprivation actually it fails to prevent the early stages of t lymphocyte activation including cell cycle entry and upregulation of cell surface activation markers outstandingly rapamycin by its inhibition of mtor and thereby of the phosphorylation of s6 kinase and eif prevents cell hypertrophy of a remaining kidney after unilateral nephrectomy 166s6 kinase is integral to multiple pathways in which cells are rendered unresponsive to insulin as during chronic insulin exposure elevation of free fatty acids and perhaps tnf exposure a feedback leads to irs12 serine phosphorylation and hence downregulation accordingly there is insulin resistance and impaired cell survivalchronic localised activation of mtor results from genetic loss of certain tumour suppressor genes like tsc1 pten in cowdens disease and 1kb1 peutz-jeghers syndrome 167armed as we are now with so much new knowledge we can tackle the question of how alveolar macrophages ams survive so well even though they are exposed continually to chemical pollutants ros inflammatory mediators and microbial invaders in fact ams have two survival pathways a the pi3k  akt pathway and b erk activity that leads to inhibition of proapoptotic proteins but good antiapoptosis the hunninghake group 168 investigated how it is that erk activity leads to sustained protein translation initiation via eif4e or hypophosphorylated active eif2 actually erk decreases proapoptotic jnk activity by stabilizing mpk7 dual phosphatase when jnk activity is low there is higher activity of phosphatase pp1 accordingly there is hypophosphorylation of translation initiation factor eif2 so there is ongoing protein translation that means survival of the amsthe utmost important step in the drug discovery process is the identification of a drug target in general particular in vivo binding site of a drug through which the drug exerts its action is known as a drug target from the therapeutic point of view understanding the mechanism of drug binding inhibition and regulation of the target protein activity is very important to combat the viral diseases once the drug target has been validated the next step is to identify characterize and design inhibitory molecules various viral targets and the strategies that are used to identify these viral and vaccine targets are summarized below1viral surface proteins and the strategies used to target these proteins this includes viral surface glycoprotein and viral receptors these are potential candidate for antiviral and vaccine development strategies used to target these include receptor-based and ligand-based drug designing in receptor-based drug designing mapping of ligands is done ligand molecules are engineered by assembling little pieces in a stepwise manner within the binding pocket constraint in ligand-based approach ligands for a specific receptor are determined using biophysical simulations and construction of chemical libraries availability of structural information is expanding the possibilities of identifying vaccine candidate by screening and mapping epitopes using bioinformatics tools such as epivax epimatrix tan et al 2012 de groot and moise 20072targeting the viral proteinsenzymes here peptidomimetic drugs are designed against various viral enzymes such as proteases various techniques such as x-ray crystallography nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and computational studies have also enabled for the successful designing of antiviral drugs tsantrizos 2008 wei and zhou 20103targeting proteinprotein interactions mutational and cell-based yeast two hybrids and various biophysical methods such as surface plasmonresonance isothermal calorimetry fluorescence energy resonance transfer fret-based differential scanning calorimetry have helped in studying essential proteinprotein interactions that are potential antivirals mutational studies at protein interfaces result in the increase or decrease of binding affinity of one viral protein with other protein hence implying their beneficial role in viral life cycle brito and pinney 20174targeting host factors various cellular proteins of the signal transduction pathway are a potential drug target antiviral molecules against host factors involved in viral replication are being targeted to prevent the hijack of host system by virus strategies like rapid immunoaffinity purification targeting a virushost protein followed by mass spectrometry to identify associated protein can be implied rowles et al 20135targeting rna-protein interactions using riboproteomics approach that profiles rna-protein interactions and rna coimmunoprecipitation which helps to identify all the proteins interacting with the viral rna salim et al 2016 yeh et al 2016 figure 191 figure

x-ray crystallography is the most powerful and reliable method to obtain a macromolecular structure it is used to determine structures of viruses and viral proteins by growing crystals ilari and savino 2008 the three components of x-ray crystallography are protein crystals source of x-rays and detector crystallographers aim high-powered x-rays at a tiny crystal and molecules arranged in the crystal lattice scatter the x-rays onto an electronic detector the intensity of each diffracted ray is detected and fed into a computer which uses a mathematical equation to calculate the position of every atom in the crystallized molecule the result is a three-dimensional digital image of the molecule rhodes 2010 x-ray crystallography is helpful in revealing the detailed three-dimensional structures of thousands of proteins many advances in drug discovery and medicine are due to the x-ray crystallography by identifying the drug targets in many diseasesmacromolecular crystallography is a very powerful technique for drug discovery it has a prominent role in finding drug targets in many diseases that are major challenges today for example hiv protease structure was identified by using x-ray crystallography klei et al 2007 knowledge of the structure led to the identification of various antiviral compounds that interacted with the active site of the enzyme munshi et al 1998 in a similar way the structure of many proteins of the viruses which can be targeted to stop the viral invasion can be computationally predicted with the help of three-dimensional crystal structures of targeted virus or viral protein this invites the structures-based drug designing against a particular targeted viral protein not only in drug discovery but x-ray crystallography has also paved a way for making the drugs more effective as molecular details of drug and with targeted site are revealed at the atomic level adding to this atomic structure of the potential viral target in complex drug also elucidates the mechanism of inhibition of the drug how it interacts at molecular level what makes it work and so on munshi et al 1998another powerful biophysical technique is nmr spectroscopy which gives information not only about the structure but also the dynamics of viral proteins and their complexes marion 2013 nuclei of single atoms absorb different radio frequencies according to the environment of protein these adsorption signals may be perturbed by adjacent nuclei this determines the distance between nuclei these distances in turn can be used to determine the overall structure of the protein nmr is a successful technique used to find out how proteins interact with each other and with small molecules or drugs that can inhibit the interaction bakail and ochsenbein 2016 it can also be helpful in identifying possible hits for pharmaceutical use structures generated from the nmr structure analysis indicate the number of conformations for the protein in solution that are useful in designing small antiviral molecules against the targeted protein active site li et al 2017in recent years major advancements have been made in cryo-electron microscopy cryo-em technique and it has emerged as one of the most useful and powerful structural biology techniques that enable the characterization of complex biological systems cryo-em has evolved as a powerful tool in structure determination of macromolecular complexes that are not suitable for crystallographic and nmr studies murata and wolf 2018 structure prediction of protein or virus models is done using the electron density of cryo-em maps hence cryo-em is a reliable method for structure determination of macromolecules macromolecular complexes such as drug bound to viral enzyme active site or neutralizing antibody bound to virus surface epitope can be studied using cryo-em technique ripoll et al 2016 this availability of structural knowledge leads to rational design and synthesis of more potent drug molecules and vaccines for viral diseasesdrug design and drug discovery are of extreme importance in animal and human health care computational computer-based approaches serve as an important role in structure-based drug design structure-based drug design utilizes the three-dimensional structure 3d of a protein target to design the potential candidate drugs that bind selectively with high affinity to the drug target anderson 2003 computational approaches utilize various methods for structure-assisted designing of drug molecules the objective of designing a drug based on the availability of the 3d of protein is to invent or advance a molecule that binds tightly to the drugable site by competing with natural substrates of the protein and further moderating its inhibition function for viral therapy such a structure-picked drug molecule found on the basis of the protein structure is more effective and less toxic molecular docking methods use the spatial shape of the protein active site to which the drug is expected to bind for selecting a suitable compound that has the potential of being rationally designed as effective antiviral drugs de ruyck et al 2016 for some proteins whose crystallization is difficult to perform homology modeling can be put to use it constructs a 3d model of a given protein on the basis of related similar or known structures homologous structures however when the crystal structure of a protein is already known then the knowledge regarding its active site residues involved in catalysis becomes important followed by computational virtual screening of compound libraries of small molecules small molecules are selected by docking them to the target protein molecular docking and simulation predicts the binding orientations of potential molecules drug candidates to protein targets so as to predict the affinity and activity of such small molecules katsila et al 2016 a number of powerful software programs for example autodock hex gold flexx dock glide surflex and ligandfit are being used to predict the docking calculations selected in silico potential drug candidates are then tested in vitro for their antiviral effects or so the use of computers and computational methods forms the core of computational drug design availability of protein 3d structures high-performance computing etc is enhancing the modern day drug discovery process computational tools offer the advantage in a way that the new drug candidates are more quick and cheapvarious structure-based approaches in identifying and designing antiviral drugs for some animal viruses are discussed below table 191

the incubation period for fmdv usually ranges between 112 days symptoms include high fever for 23 days blisters inside the mouth leading to foamy saliva blisters on the feet swelling in testicles of mature males and decline in milk production in cows the disease can also lead to myocarditis inflammation of the heart muscles and death in newborn animals some asymptomatic-infected domestic animals may also serve as carriers except pig jamal and belsham 2013fmdv has seven distinct serotypeso a c southern african territories 1 2 3 sat1 sat2 sat3 and asia-1 serotypes o and a were discovered by vallee and carre serotype c was discovered by waldmann and trautwein later another three serotypes were identified in samples from south africa the last serotype was identified from a sample that was collected at okara punjab and pakistan from a water buffalo longjam et al 2011
fmdv is a 2530 nm spherically shaped particle fmdv virion has a symmetric protein shell called capsid enclosing the nucleic acid capsid consists of 60 copies of capsomers and each capsomer is composed of four structural polypeptides namely vp1 vp2 vp3 and vp4 fmdv genome consists of single-stranded positive-sense rna about 83 kb in length rna encodes a single but long orf about 7 kb the viral orf is flanked by a long 5-utr and a short 3-utr viral genome has 3 poly-a tail a small protein around 2425 residues long known as vpg or 3b encoded by 3b region of the viral genome is covalently attached to the 5 end of the genome this vpg protein is released into the infected cell and plays no role in translation initiation viral orf is translated into a polyprotein of around 250 kda which is cleaved by two virus-encoded proteases namely leader lpro and 3cpro to form structural and nonstructural proteins generally orf is divided into four areas due to the different functions of mature polypeptides these regions arel region p region p2 region and p3 region l region located at 5 end to the capsid and encodes for lpro p region which encodes for precursor capsid polypeptide and generates 4 capsid proteinsvp4 vp2 vp3 and vp1 is cleaved by viral protease p2 region codes for three viral proteins2a 2b and 2c p3 region codes for four viral proteins3a 3b 3cpro and 3dpol 3c is a viral protease and 3d acts as rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp viral nonstructural proteins play an important role in virus-mediated host evasion longjam et al 2011the first fmdv nsp that is translated is lpro whose region lies in the polyprotein preceding the capsid precursor protein this protein has two alternative forms namely labpro and lbpro in vitro and in vivo forms lpro is a papain-like protease that releases itself from the polyprotein via cleavage between its c-terminus and the n-terminus of vp4 lpro is major virulence factor and not required for viral replication lpro cleaves host translation initiation factor eif4g and thus represses host-cell translation this shuts off the host cap-dependent mrna translation lpro also suppresses the host innate immune reaction to viral infection by blocking the interferon activityfmdv 2a is 18 amino acid peptides and lacks protease motifs however it has characteristic c-terminal motif gluxasnprogly2apro2b 2a is cleaved from p1-2a precursor by 3cpro or by 3cdpro 2a cleavage event occurs only during polypeptide synthesis in such a way that 2a peptide remains connected to p1 structural protein precursor p1-2a 2a-2b cleavage is not a proteolytic event but a modification of the translational machinery by 2a peptide this helps in the release of 2a protein while allowing the synthesis of the downstream proteins to proceed 2b protein is viroporin that is hydrophobic transmembrane low molecular weight protein fmdv 2b codes for a 154 aa peptide slightly longer than other viroporins and contains two predicted putative transmembrane domains located at positions 83104 aa and 119137 aa the transmembrane hydrophobic domains interact with phospholipid bilayer to increase membrane permeability and facilitate the release of viral particles 2b is crucial for viral pathogenicity 2c protein is 318 amino acid long proteins consisting of amphipathic helix in its n-terminal this nsp is involved in many biological functions linked to membrane targeting3a protein a 153 aa peptide is conserved in most fmdv strains most of the coding region in n-terminus 175 position encodes a hydrophilic as well as a hydrophobic domain capable of binding to membranes that is why fmdv 3a has membrane binding activity based on this hydrophobic motif 3b protein known as vpg is covalently bound to 5-terminus of the genome the first step in the replication of the picornavirus genome is the uridylylation of the vpg peptide primer the genome has a 5 terminal feature of vpgupu covalently linked which allows the use of vpg as a peptide primer to synthesize viral rna 3cpro is a chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease that is responsible for most cleavages of viral polyprotein 3dpol is rdrp and synthesizes positive and negative strand viral rnas it has a catalytic component of rna replication and plays an important role in the life cycle of fmdv 3dpol sequences are highly conserved among different serotypes as well as subtypes of fmdv gao et al 2016vaccines limited the spread of the virus during epidemics in fmd-free countries as well as in endemic regions thus playing a vital role in fmd control recently vaccines are typically produced by the inactivation of the whole virus such vaccines have the quantity and stability of the intact viral capsids in the final preparation first promising novel fmd vaccine was licensed for manufacture and to be used in the united states park 2013 this adenovirus-vectored fmd vaccine causes in vivo expression of viral capsids in vaccinated animals another promising vaccine is composed of stabilized and empty fmdv capsids that are produced in vitro in a baculovirus expression system cao et al 2016 other areas under research include enhanced adjuvants vaccine quality control procedures vaccine protection and immune correlationvarious proteins of fmdv have been targeted to design antivirals against them structural-based and computational approaches have been used to find out potent inhibitor molecules against fmdv in 1994 the first crystal structure of fmdv in reduced form was reported in 2004 crystal structure of fmdv rdrp 3d polymerase has been determined in ligand-free and in complex with a template-primer rna ferrer-orta et al 2004 fig 193
some conserved amino acid side chains bind to the template-primer in the complex which helps in mediating the initiation of rna synthesis this crystal structure sheds light on important information for studies on viral rna replication and the concept of designing antiviral compounds in 2006 the crystal structure of fmdv 3c protease was reported it revealed new insights into the structural-functional aspects of the viral replication enzyme the crystal structure of fmdv 3cpro confirmed that it belongs to family of chymotrypsin-like cysteine proteases barrett and rawlings 2001 the protein comprises of two six-strand barrels and between these barrels on one face of the protein lies the peptide binding cleft that has the active site of the enzyme this fmdv 3c protease crystal structure paved the way for structural-based drug design curry et al 2007 fig 194
in 2010 several inhibitor molecules against the crystal structure of fmdv 3dpol were identified these targeted a novel binding pocket on 3dpol which could be used for future structure-based drug design studies durk et al 2010 fig 195
knowledge of the 3d structure of viral capsids allowed for the engineering of the thermostable capsids however capsid stability and effectiveness of the viral vaccines was a concern so in 2015 a molecular dynamics md-based strategy for the evaluation of mutations which is designed to increase the stability of capsid through increased noncovalent interactions was developed therefore this designed md protocol allowed derivation of structural-based design of stabilized fmdv viruses and empty capsids which allowed for the development of stable vaccines kotecha et al 2015 in 2018 the crystal structure of mutant viral polymerases with less sensitivity to ribavirin was reported ferrer-orta et al 2010
hsv is an enveloped dna virus that has 150200 nm diameter and a linear ds dna around 120 to 230 kbp the virus has an icosadeltahedral capsid consisting of 162 capsomers it has a large segment containing viral proteins and an external trilaminar lipid envelope constituting at least 12 glycoproteins the genome is composed of two regions namely unique long region ul and unique short region us linked covalently to each other and flanked by three segments hsv has three origins of replication orione copy of oril and two copies of oris vadlapudi et al 2013hsv lytic cycle is divided into three steps viral entry viral replication and viral assembly and exit viral entry depends on the type of cell initially viral glycoproteins bind to the host-cell receptors and after that viral envelope either fuses with plasma membrane or undergo endocytosis only five of the total twelve viral envelope proteins are essential for viral infection such as glycoprotein c gc gb gd gh and gl gb acts as a homooligomer whereas gh and gl form a functional heterooligomer the binding of gc to heparan sulfate initiates virus contact with the host cell postinfection into nucleus host rna polymerase ii initiates viral gene expression  early and late genes hsv dna replicates via a sigma or rolling-circle mechanism after that post-dna replication genes are transcribed forming viral structural components and required for capsid assembly these are transported into nucleus via nuclear localization sequences the procapsid is then packaged along with viral dna to form a mature capsid after being assembled inside the cytoplasm capsids are enveloped by budding into golgi compartment and are finally secreted out from the infected cells herpes viruses have the ability to undergo latency in the hosts for lifetime during latency viral transcription is shut off except for 83 kb transcript which is associated with latency and thus called latency associate transcript this is unstable polyadenylated primary transcript and is further processed into two stable introns with extended half-lives when reactivated by proper stimuli such as ultraviolet stress immune-suppression these viruses get activated and entered lytic cycle resulting in spreading various diseases boehmer and nimonkar 2003a number of antiviral molecules that target hsv-1 and hsv-2 are present all are nucleoside analogs except foscarnet and cidofovir while acyclovir famciclovir and valaciclovir are used to treat the majority of cases of hsv-1 and hsv-2 bacon et al 2003 other medications such as foscarnet valganciclovir ganciclovir and cidofovir have activity against the alpha herpesviruses and are recommended in certain circumstances such as the treatment of some acyclovir-resistant hsv antiviral drugs for the treatment against hsv infections have been developed over the past 40 years however most drug-resistant hsv isolates have been reported such as resistance to acyclovir etc so this demands the need of highly effective low toxicity drugs in hsv-resistant isolates here is the whole antiviral designing process based on the structural findings of hsv jiang et al 2016 viruses of the family herpesviridae are cause innumerable human diseases up to the year 2000 the available treatments were largely ineffective with the exception of a few drugs for treatment of herpes simplex virus hsv infections however for some dna viruses of this family advancement was made for biochemistry and structural biology of the enzyme viral protease revealing common features that can be exploited in the development of a new class of antiherpesvirus drugs so herpesvirus proteases were identified as a unique class of serine protease with a ser-his-his catalytic triad a new single domain protein fold was determined by x-ray crystallography for the proteases of hsv it was shown that dimerization is unique for serine proteases and is required for activity of the hsv proteases with this known fact of dimerization there was a serious impact on functional analysis and inhibitor discovery the conserved functional and catalytic properties of the herpesvirus protease enzyme lead to common considerations in the process of inhibitor discovery crystal structures of the herpesvirus proteases allowed more direct interpretation of ligand structureactivity relationships waxman and darke 2000 fig 196
in addition screening of chemical libraries provided some novel structures as starting points for drug development in 2000 human herpesvirus hhv capsids using log-phase cultures of body cavity-based lymphoma 1 cells induced with 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate were obtained for electroncryo microscopy and computer reconstruction the 3d structure of the hhv-8 capsids revealed that a capsid shell is composed of 12 pentons 150 hexons and 320 triplexes arranged on at516 icosahedral lattice this structure is similar to those of herpes simplex virus type 1 hsv-1 and human cytomegalovirus which are prototypical members of alpha and beta herpesviruses respectively wu et al 2000 till 2006 herpesviruses were the second leading cause of human viral diseases especially dangerous in immunocompromised individuals common therapies for herpes viral infections used nucleoside analogs such as acyclovir and target the viral dna polymerase essential for viral dna replication but the problem is that this class of drugs exhibits a narrow antiviral spectrum and resistance to these agents was an emerging problem so the need of the hour was a better understanding of herpes virus replication that could help in the development of safe and effective broad-spectrum antiherpetic in 2006 the first crystal structure of a herpesvirus polymerase the herpes simplex virus type 1 dna polymerase at 27  resolution was reported liu et al 2006 fig 197
the structural similarity of this polymerase to other polymerases allowed constructing high confidence models of a replication complex rc of the polymerase and of acyclovir as a dna chain terminator a novel inhibition mechanism was established in which a representative of a series of nonnucleosidic viral polymerase inhibitors the 4-oxo-dihydroquinolines bound at the polymerase active site as well as interacting noncovalently with both the polymerase and the dna duplex most viruses need cell-entry proteins called fusogens in order to get into the host cell it was known that herpes virus fusogen does not act alone but needs a complex of other viral cell-entry proteins in 2010 this complex structure was determined then it turned out that this protein complex is not a fusogen but it regulates fusogen it was also established that certain antibodies interfere with this complex so that it cannot regulate fusogen this gave a clue that certain antiviral can be designed which target this interaction can in turn prevent viral infection mesri et al 2010 the nonnucleoside inhibitors of hsv dna polymerase target the site that is less important for the binding of a natural nucleoside or nucleoside inhibitor in 2012 using crystal structure of hsv dna polymerase a possibility of new lead molecule based on a-pyrone analogs as nonnucleoside inhibitors came into light using structure-based modeling approach karampuri et al 2012in 2012 different in silico approaches were applied to virtually screen for potential inhibitors targeting glycoproteins gbghgl complex formation interface of hsv using structure-based virtual screening on gb and ghgl glycoproteins many potent inhibitor molecules separately target the active residues involved in their binding activity hussain basha and naresh kumar 2012 in 2016 nature products and new antivirals mechanisms were suggested to target the hsv proteins like dna helicaseprimase complex to fight the drug resistance of hsv new types of molecules are anti-hsv agents such as flavonoids sugar-containing compounds and peptides jiang et al 2016 new antiviral mechanism included the lethal mutagenesis was proposed as a novel chemotherapeutic strategy for drug resistance the high frequency of mutations in the viral genome leads to a large danger of genetic mutations causing reduction in viral infective activities therefore lethal mutagenesis may be effective in weakening the capacity of the virus for drug resistance only one nucleoside analog ribavirin exhibits a broad spectrum of antiviral activity against dna and rna-based viruses by 2018 structure of the hsv portal-vertex at subnanometer resolution solved by cryo-em and single-particle 3d reconstruction has been reported mcelwee et al 2018 this led to a number of new discoveries including the presence of two previously unknown portal-associated structures moreover 3d reconstruction revealed that the viral dna is packaged within the capsid as a left-handed spool that is arranged in concentric shells adding to this data has also shown a molecular machine that plays a critical role in the replication cycle of an important family of human pathogens so this can be targeted and can be used in designing antiviralsreplication of coronavirus occurs in the cytoplasm upon viral entry in the host cell it uncoats and rna genome is deposited into the cytoplasm rna has 5 methylated cap and a 3 polyadenylated tail this allows the rna to attach to ribosomes for translation because of the enzyme replicase encoded by the viral genome the rna transcribes into new copies of rna a protease nonstructural protein of coronavirus cov cleaves off each nonstructural protein from the long polyprotein fehr and perlman 2015 there are following types of human coronaviruses 1 human coronavirus 229e 2 human coronavirus oc43 3 sars-cov 4 human coronavirus nl63 hcov-nl63 new haven coronavirus 5 human coronavirus hku1 6 middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov previously known as novel coronavirus 2012 and hcov-emcunfortunately there are no effective antivirals against coronavirus there is an urgent need to develop new strategies to prevent and to control coronavirus infections and to understand their biology replication and pathogenesis of these viruses better understanding of the function of cov proteins in the virus replication and transcription mechanism may lead to the development of pioneering antivirals in 2003 structural and functional properties of spike protein of coronavirus were characterized bosch et al 2003 the function the viral spike glycoprotein is to mediate entry of coronavirus in 2003 the crystal structure of sar-covmpro main protease was also solved xue et al 2007 it revealed that the main protease structure forms a homodimer with three domains in each monomer the antiparallel -barrel structure of domains i and ii is similar to other coronavirus proteases it forms a chymotrypsin-like fold responsible for catalytic reactions in 2005 native structure of coronavirus 3clpro was reported which was solved by x-ray crystallography bacha 2008 sars-cov main protease mpro is a protein that is required for the maturation of sars-cov and is vital for its life cycle thus making it an attractive target for structure-based drug design of antisars drugs lu et al 2006 crystal structure of sars-covmpro with inhibitor n1 was also reported yang et al 2005 fig 198
in 2006 the structure-based virtual screening on a chemical database containing 58855 compounds based on the 3d structure of sars-covmpro was performed active compounds selected from this virtual screening approach also confirmed by the bioassay were taken as the templates to build the core structure for analog search finally the complex structures of potent inhibitors with sars-covmpro were solved by x-ray crystallography it helped to further study the sars-covmpro inhibition mechanisms of these compounds in 2012 26- crystal structure of the feline coronavirus nsp7nsp8 complex solved by x-ray crystallography was reported xiao 2013 in 2015 many broad spectrum inhibitors against 3clpro enzyme of coronavirus were identified based on crystal structure of this enzyme and virtual screening methods berry et al 2015 the 3clpro of coronavirus proved to be an effective drug discovery target it has even been termed as the achilles heel of coronaviruses cov helicase is one of the most evolutionary conserved proteins in nidoviruses and hence making it an important target for drug development hao et al 2017 in 2018 first full-length crystal structure of the mers-cov helicase was reported cov helicase has an n-terminal cyshis-rich domain ch with three zincs a beta-barrel domain and a c-terminal sf1 helicase core durai et al 2015 these findings are very helpful to provide novel structural information essential for structure-based drug design against cov
the nsp1 protein an mrna capping enzyme has both guanine-7-methyltransferase mtase and guanylyltransferase gtase activities so nsp1 mediates the methylation and capping functions of viral abu bakar and ng 2018 sinv nsp1 protein does not require membrane association for its enzymatic function the gtase activity of sinv nsp1 is metal-ion dependent whereas metal is not required for mtase enzymatic activity of nsp1 tomar et al 2011 nsp1 protein the alphavirus capping enzyme is a potential drug target because it has a distinct molecular mechanism of capping the viral rnas than the conventional capping mechanism of host nsp1 catalyzes the methylation of guanosine triphosphate gtp by transferring the methyl group from s-adenosylmethionine to a gtp molecule at its n7 position with the help of nsp1 mtase followed by guanylylation reaction which involves the formation of m7gmpnsp1 covalent complex by nsp1 guanylyltransferase gtase kaur et al 2018 the alphavirus nonstructural protein nsp2 possesses various enzymatic activities the n-terminal region contains a helicase domain that has seven signature motifs of superfamily 1 sf1 helicases it functions as rna triphosphatase that performs the viral rna capping reactions it also functions as nucleotide triphosphatase and thus facilitating the rna helicase activity the c-terminal region of nsp2 contains a papain-like cysteine protease which is responsible for processing the viral nonstructural polyprotein abu bakar and ng 2018 narwal et al 2018 singh et al 2018 the crystal structure of the nsp2 cysteine protease of veev was reported in the free and e64d-bound states which are the first report of an inhibitor bound alphaviral nsp2 protease structure the structures and identified active site residues in this study may assist the discovery of potential protease inhibitors against veev hu et al 2016 the exact role of alphavirus nsp3 protein is not much clear in the rc the nsp3 protein has the n-terminal macro domain phosphatase activity or nucleic acid binding ability the alphavirus unique domain and the c-terminal hypervariable domain recently it has been shown that nsp3 has a role in pathogenicity abu bakar and ng 2018 the nsp4 polymerase is the most highly conserved protein in alphaviruses with 50 identity in amino acid a core rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp domain is at the c-terminal end which has rna synthetic properties of the viral rc it has tatase activity that suggests a novel function of the alphavirus rdrp in the maintenance and repair of the polya tail an element required for replication of the viral genome tomar et al 2006over the last decade in asia europe and the americas the alphaviruses reemergence has focused on the need of selective inhibitors at present no antiviral treatment is available viral targets within alphavirus rc include various molecular determinants structural and functional analysis of these targets can make the structure-based drug design and development of antivirals against alphaviruses possiblensp1nsp1 nsp1nsp2 nsp1nsp3 nsp1nsp4 nsp2nsp4 and nsp4nsp4 interactions are identified in chikv many of these interactions are shown similarly in sinv and semliki forest virus sfv abu bakar and ng 2018 nsp1 recruits other nsps as discussed in literature and is crucial for sfv replication by membrane association lampio et al 2000 nsp1s interaction with all other nsps is very important and is an attractive target for drug development inhibition of nsp1 anchoring in the spherules occurs when its affinity for the cell membrane is perturbed this will inhibit the recruitment of the other nsps and thus preventing the initiation of rc formation nsp2 protein has viral replication and host evasion strategies which can be targeted for the viral inhibition nsp2 has rna helicase rna triphosphatase nucleoside triphosphatase and auto-protease activities it is an important cofactor for the maturation of viral rc kappes 2014 the nsp2 protease is a good drug target because many viruses are targeted in the same way human immunodeficiency virus hiv and hepatitis c virus this has led to the development of many fda-approved inhibitors lenz et al 2010 weber and agniswamy 2009 nsp4 is virus-specific and is rna polymerase it can be a good target to inhibit the viral dna duplication and its survival for in silico drug designing the crystal structure of nsp2 protease is of great interest nsp2 protease domain crystal structures of the veev chikv and sinv are also present with protein data bank pdb entries 2hwk 5ezq 3trk and 4gua respectively in 2015 crystal structure of nsp2 protease from chikv at 25  was submitted pdb id 4ztb using this crystal structure various peptidomimetic inhibitors were designed against nsp2pro in 2016 dhindwal et al 2017 in 2018 a fret-based protease assay was used to analyze the proteolytic activity of chikv nsp2 protease this protease assay was used to assess the inhibitory activity of these peptidomimetic compounds identified it was concluded that two peptidomimetic compounds pep-i mmsinc database id mms03131094 and pep-ii mmsinc database id mms03927237 inhibited chikv nsp2 protease activity and can be potential antiviral drugs singh et al 2018 to find out a few potential inhibitors against chikv nsp2 protease homology modeling and computer-aided drug design strategies have been implemented for the first time bassetto et al 2013 potential inhibitors based on structural studies and molecular simulations have been reported nguyen et al 2015 singh et al 2012lopinavir and nelfinavir potent hiv protease inhibitors are fda-approved inhibitors against chikv a number of highly selective chikv and veev nsp1 capping enzyme inhibitors are reported recently which interrupt the nsp1-gtase activity delang et al 2016 gigante et al 2014 gigante et al 2017 nucleoside analogs are also shown to be effective against several alphaviruses such as ribavirin which inhibit the chikv and sfv genome replication by depleting gtp pools briolant et al 2004 moreover the inhibition of nsp4 rdrp by ribavirin through its interaction with cys483 residue increases the replication fidelity coffey et al 2011 d-n4-hydroxycytidine nhc another nucleoside analog is the most potent inhibitor of veev it can serve as a substitute for ribavirin because it cannot develop nhc resistant mutants favipiravir is another nsp4 inhibitor and is a potent antiviral against chikv infection by inhibiting its interaction with lys291 residue delang et al 2014 compound-a could potentially inhibit rdrps ribonucleotide selection function by targeting met2295 wada et al 2017 however it is believed that by chemical modification compound-a may be a starting point for reducing its toxicity in 2017 3d structure of capsid protein of aura virus in complex with piperazine was reported at 22  piperazine is a small heterocyclic molecule and docking studies have shown that it binds to hydrophobic pocket of chikv capsid protein it can be effective as an antialphaviral drug aggarwal et al 2017 in 2018 crystal structure of chikv capsid protease domain was determined at 22  it was found that small molecules such as s--mandelic acid and ethyl 3-aminobenzoate target capsid hydrophobic pocket these bind to the conserved hydrophobic pocket of cp sharma et al 2018 this may serve as a basis for the development of antivirals against chikv infections in 2018 crystal structure of nsp2pro was determined at 259  which revealed that the protein consists of two subdomains an n-terminal protease subdomain and a c-terminal methyltransferase subdomain additionally structure insights revealed that access to the active site and substrate binding cleft is blocked by a flexible interdomain loop in chikv nsp2pro this may serve beneficial for structure-based drug design and optimization of chikv protease inhibitors narwal et al 2018 recently a high-throughput elisa-based assay was developed to screen inhibitors against divalent metal-ion-dependent alphavirus capping enzyme kaur et al 2018 various inhibitors such as sinefungin aurintricarboxylic acid and ribavirin were assessed and their inhibitory effect against nsp1 was reported in addition nsp2 protease-based cell-free high-throughput screening assay for evaluation of inhibitors against emerging chikv has been developed saha et al 2018 these successful methods for identifying antiprotease molecules together with a high-throughput screening assay can lead to the development of industrial level large-scale screening platform for identification of protease inhibitors against emerging and reemerging virusesparamyxoviruses are the main cause of respiratory disease in children one of two viral surface glycoproteins the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase hn has various functions in addition to being the major surface antigen that induces neutralizing antibodies in 2000 the crystal structure of multifunctional newcastle disease virus paramyxovirus 1 hn alone and in complex with inhibitor was reported fig 199
the structure provides the basis for the structure-based design of inhibitors for a range of paramyxovirus-induced diseases crennell et al 2000 in 2005 the crystal structure of the secreted uncleaved ectodomain of the paramyxovirus was presented yin et al 2005 in 2012 combined x-ray crystallography and cryo-electron tomography were done to show the structure of matrix protein of newcastle disease virus a paramyxovirus structure and sequence conservation imply that other paramyxovirus matrix proteins function similarly habchi and longhi 2012 in 2012 it was established that favipiravir may serve as antiviral against these viruses hendra virus hev and niv are bat-born paramyxoviruses in 2013 experimental findings in animals have demonstrated that a human monoclonal antibody targeting the viral g glycoprotein is an effective postexposure treatment against hendra and niv infection also a subunit vaccine based on the g glycoprotein of hev affords protection against hendra and niv the vaccine has been developed for use in horses in australia it is the first vaccine against a biosafety level-4 bsl-4 agent to be licensed and commercially deployed hev is one of the members of the henipavirus genus of paramyxoviruses which are designated bsl-4 organisms because of the high mortality rate of niv and hev in humans paramyxovirus cell entry is mediated by the fusion protein f and this is in response to binding of a host receptor by the attachment protein during posttranslational processing the fusion peptide of f is released upon receptor-induced triggering it is inserted into the host-cell membrane f undergoes a dramatic refolding from its prefusion to postfusion conformation this brings the host and viral membranes together allowing entry of the viral rna in 2015 the crystal structure of the prefusion form of the hev f ectodomain was reported the structure shows great similarity with the structure of prefusion parainfluenzavirus 5 fusion protein wong et al 2016 in 2018 first successful treatment of henipavirus infection in vivo with a small-molecule drug suggests that favipiravir should be evaluated as an antiviral treatment option for henipavirus infections dawes et al 2018
avian influenza virus belongs to the family orthomyxoviridae these are negative sense single-stranded viruses these are classified into three types a b and c based on the antigenic difference in their nucleoproteins nps and matrix proteins influenza a is the major pathogen that causes epidemic influenza the influenza a genome is composed of eight rna segments five segments code for one protein each and the other three code for two proteins each the proteins are hemagglutinin ha na matrix protein 1 m1 m2 proton channel np nonstructural protein 1 ns1 nuclear export protein nep also known as ns2 polymerase acid protein pa polymerase basic proteins pb1 and pb2 and a protein named pb1-f2 which is expressed from a second reading frame 1 of the pb1 gene pb1 pb2 and pa form the rna polymerase the surface glycoproteins ha and na provide distinct antigenic properties to the influenza virus influenza a viruses are further organized according to ha and na subtypes du et al 2012 sixteen ha subtypes h1h16 and nine na subtypes n1n9 have been identified the subtypes of the 1997 bird flu and the 2009 swine flu viruses have been indicated above in 2001 crystal structure of h5 avian hemagglutinin was reported in 2008 crystal structure for the ns1 effector domain of avian influenza virus a was reported hale et al 2008 in 2009 crystal structure of an avian influenza polymerase was reported fig 1910
this unbolted many possibilities to target the viral protein for designing of new antiinfluenza therapeutics yuan et al 2009 in 2015 three inhibitors against protein na were approved by fda namely zanamivir relenza glaxo smith kline oseltamivir tamiflu roche and peramivir rapivab biocryst zanamivir was the first approved inhibitor among these shen et al 2015 in 2017 structure-based drug discovery studies were done by targeting the papb1 interaction many potent antiinfluenza drugs were reported with the help of in silico simulation studies watanabe et al 2017there are vaccines against pestiviruses and the correct vaccine strain should be given depending on the herds location and the endemic strain in that region the vaccination must be given regularly to maintain immunity there are various species in the genus pestivirus-border disease virus bovine viral diarrhea virus bvdv classical swine fever virus etc kumar et al 2014 in 2004 crystal structure of rdrp from bvdv was reported pdb id 1s4f this structure explained many possibilities where inhibitor molecules could bind this shed light on various inhibitors binding sited on the protein leading to opportunity of designing many structure-based inhibitor molecule choi et al 2004 fig 1911

in 2012 crystal structure of bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 bvdv1 envelope glycoprotein e2 was reported pdb id 2yq2 el omari et al 2013 on the basis of the crystal structure of bvdv e2 protein small-molecule high-throughput docking was performed to identify the molecules that likely bind to the envelope protein e2 of bvdv several structurally different compounds were purchased as well as synthesized these were then assayed for antiviral activity against bvdv their possible binding determinants were characterized by md simulations a common pattern of interactions was observed between active molecules and amino acid residues in the binding site in e2 these findings are believed to offer a better understanding of the interaction of bvdv e2 with these inhibitors as well as benefit the discovery of novel and more potent bvdv antivirals el omari et al 2013 in 2015 crystal structure of the ns3 helicase of the pestivirus was reported pdb id 4cbg tortorici et al 2015 in 2017 the closed-conformation crystal structure of the full-length pestivirus ns3 with its ns4a protease cofactor segment was established pdb id 5wx1 zheng et al 2017 fig 1912

in this chapter various viral proteins that are necessary for the survival of virus inside host are discussed such as viral polymerase viral helicase protease etc the approaches used in predicting the structure of these necessary proteins are elaborated various drug molecules or antivirals designed on the basis of structure of these proteins are highlighted the details of the available inhibitors and the potential antiviral candidates are disclosed vaccination status against animal viruses is discussed further improvement in these and the need of novel structure-based drugs and their clinical testing is emphasizedprotein structure-based drug design has been contributing to the drug discovery process since the early 1990s this structural knowledge of interaction between drugs and the target protein has been applied mainly to predict potency changes of chemically modified lead compounds with the help of 3d-structural information additional aspects of the drug discovery process have become predictable selectivity of compounds between homologous or orthologous proteins can be predicted this provides new possibilities to design selective compounds or predict the suitability of animal models for pharmacodynamic studies antivirals display a variety of mechanisms of action antivirals may enhance the animal immune system or block a specific enzyme or a particular step in the viral replication cycle as viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that use the hosts cellular machinery to survive and multiply it is essential that antivirals do not harm the host however a major concern is that viruses are continually developing new antiviral resistant strains due to their high mutation rate this demands for mandatory search or development of new antiviral compounds with the help of structure-based drug designing there is progress in preclinical drug discovery there is a deficit of information between identified hits and the many criteria that must be fulfilled side by side to convert these hits into preclinical candidates that have a real chance to become a drug this gap can be bridged by investigating and understanding the interactions between the ligands and their receptors accurate calculations of the free energy of binding are still elusive better knowledge of all these will help in finding good drug candidates to combat the diseases caused by animal virusesadaptation is an evolving long-term process during which a population of life forms adjusts to changes in its habitat and surrounding environments adaptation by the global community as a unit is vital to cope with the effects of increasing populations global warmingclimate change the chemical biological and physical impacts on life-sustaining ecosystems and competition for life sustaining and economically important natural resources the latter include water food energy metal ores industrial minerals and wood within this framework it is necessary to adapt as well to changes in local and regional physical conditions brought on by natural and anthropogenic hazards by health threats of epidemic or pandemic reach by social conditions such as conflicts driven by religious and ethnic fanaticism and by tribalism and clan tiesalthough the rate of global population growth is declining and is expected to fall to the replacement level by mid-twenty-first century it is still increasing by about 7580 million people annually see chap 101007978-3-319-09686-51 a grand part of the growth is taking place in africa asia latin america and the middle east that together already accounts for a 2014 population of 59 billion of the 72 billion people worldwide conversely populations are contracting or stable in most of western and eastern europe and japan together with the united states that has a stable population this latter group today is home to the other 13 billion people thus although there are two population situations to adapt to both have common problems of sustainability to addressthe principal problems with growing populations do not involve space although population density is a problem unto itself for reasons discussed in previous chapters the main problems are how to nourish people with food and water the chronic malnutrition that about 1 billion people suffered from in 2013 is likely to grow in number in some regions due to global warmingclimate change because humans cannot adapt to less food if they are already at subsistence rations for example the 2012 population in sub-saharan africa is 902 million people the population is projected to increase to about 125 billion in 2030 an increase of about 38  within the same time frame the united nations estimates that acreage under maize cultivation in the region will decline by 40  because of heat and drought brought on by climate change the loss of arable land for food production can be countered in sub-saharan africa if marker assisted hybridization of maize or maize genetically modified to withstand heat and drought come onto the seed market together with modified seeds for other food staples and if african nations that do not now accept gmo seeds do so in the future if not nations favored for food production by climate change will have a moral obligation to provide food staples to people in nations with declining food production at accessible costs based on their economies it is clear that what happens in sub-saharan africa and other regions with declining cultivation acreage or that will bear other effects of climate change eg drought shifting rain patterns will affect the rest of the worldwide community politically economically and socially the earths problems that associate with global warming climate change will be further discussed in the last section of this chapterwater is the staff of life it keeps the body hydrated and is necessary to grow food crops hydrate food animals and grow feed grains chemically or biologically polluted water does not serve these ends if ingested contaminated water can result in sickness as discussed in chap 101007978-3-319-09686-52 water stokes industry and manufacturing as well thus keeping economies in many countries contributing to a populations well-being by providing employment goods and services ideally these businesses contribute their fair share to a tax base that supports social needs eg education healthcare maintenance of infrastructure factory owners adapt and plan against water shortages by having a water recycling system in place but may also slow or stop production until operational water conditions return citizens with a reliable water supply can adapt to periods of water shortage by limiting use according to mandates by government officials but still have water for basic daily needs however persons in nations with a chronic per capita water shortage may not have this option to serve their daily needs unless water is imported or new water sources are found see chap 101007978-3-319-09686-52 if imported water is not an option to meet immediate essential needs an alternative adaptation for people and animals is to try to reach a location where water would be available to them with growing populations per capita water availability is greatly diminished table 101007978-3-319-09686-52 water shortages become endemic and people are at risk of existing at subsistence levels or dying most at risk from the lack of a basic water ration are pregnant women infants young children and old people water wars are a future possibility as nations battle for their peoples survival unless political differences are set aside and projects are supported to develop and share water sources in a welcome effort jordan israel and the palestinian authority signed a memorandum of understanding in the world bank december 2013 with specific aims 1 produce millions of cubic meters of drinking water for a water-deficient region 2 pipe 200 million cubic meters of water annually 180 km 110 mi from the red sea to the dead sea 3 build a desalination plant at aqaba that would supply water to aqaba and eilat 4 the israeli water utility would supply 2030 million cubic meters of drinking water to the palestinian authority for the west bank population at a reduced cost and 5 there would be an inflow of water to slow and in the future perhaps abate and reverse the shrinking of the dead sea funding for the estimated 400 million 5-year project will come from the world bank donor nations and philanthropic groupsas the global population increases and more people in developing and less developed nations have more disposable income there will be a growing draw on natural resources other than water and food to service their industrial agricultural and manufacturing needs and wants competition can force economic wars among national and multinational corporations for the resources necessary to provide goods and services and thus drive up prices for resources industries and manufacturing units that cannot compete economically for natural resources will shut down thus contributing to unemployment and downturns in economies because of falling domestic demand to keep order in the increasingly interdependent world economy accommodation for shared natural resources or substitutes for them at affordable prices is the adaptationnecessary this can be mandated by the world trade organization backed by other practical-minded international groupsanother adverse effect of growing populations that is a national resource that can be lost at the expense of some countries to the benefit of others is brain power this brain power has been cultivated at excellent universities in developing countries often times at little or no cost to students eg in medicine science engineering economics the arts who attend and graduate in increasing numbers where there are too many well-educated professionals but lack of employment opportunities for them in their fields of expertise educated people have the option of relocating to another country that can nurture and use the expertise many adapt to the employment problem by taking up this option this may mean moving from a developing country to a developed country or from a less developed country to a developing or developed country ultimately this loss of citizens with special skills can hurt a country to counter this brain drain or reverse it a country can adapt by investing in its future to create programs and conditions that keep talented professionals home or if they have emigrated entice them to return china and india are examples of countries that have successfully taken this tactwhen there are increases in a population because of immigration problems can ensue between immigrants and a general population adaptation to diversity and the multicultural experiences it brings to a community is often not a comfortable change the antipathy of some in a host country is based on slowness of the immigrants to learn the language and inability of host country citizens to understand what immigrants are saying among themselves this makes citizens feel uneasy some view immigrants as a threat to their own or a family members employment or advancement race difference is a factor that some cannot readily adapt to as is ethnicity with its traditions and customs unfamiliar to the general public religion can be divisive if adherents to its beliefs engage in acts of hatred detrimental to the host country fueled by fundamentalists and zealots who interpret religious writings as giving them license to commit crimes or absolving them of the crimes sadly many citizens paint an entire religious community with the taint of the relatively few evildoers adaptation to diversity is essential for our earths citizenry with joint efforts by all to resolve worldwide issues eg global warmingclimate change so as to become the keys to providing a sound future for coming generations there has to be a shared attack on global threats no matter what the language race ethnicity or religious beliefs are no matter social or economic status no matter whether a threat affects less developed developing or developed countriesin areas prone to earthquakes we know that earthquakes do not kill and injure people but that collapsing buildings and infrastructure do earthquakes are not predictable so that there is no adaptation by a timely evacuation to minimize deaths and injury however building structures to make them more earthquake resistant can save lives reduce injuries and protect property thus after a high-magnitude earthquake forensic engineering teams come to assess the damage and determine where and why damage and destruction took place within the context of the magnitude of an earthquake the type of motion it originated shaking jarring rolling its duration the area it affected and the geologic properties of rocks underlying structures foundations hazard assessment teams also evaluate other factors that contributed to additional damage such as ruptured gas lines that feed fires and ruptured water lines that inhibit fire control the engineers establish how construction can be improved in the future in terms of construction techniques and materials to prevent the types of collapses and utility failures they investigated municipalities revise building codes accordingly to direct reconstruction and future building projects where possible structures that withstood an earthquake with minor or no visible damage should be retrofitted to improve their resistance to the next big one with each event we gain more data on how to better construct earthquake-resistant structures and alter building codes to more stringent specifications in theory this adaptationto an irregularly recurring global event is good but in practice it is most applicable to nations with the economic resources for reconstruction according to revised building codes and where there is no corruption to allow a bypass of the code the same can be stated for retrofitting to give more resistance to earthquakes to existing structures many developed nations and nations rich in commodity exports eg oil have a moral obligation to donate funds material and expertise to help citizens in economically disadvantaged nations recover from a destructive earthquake some commodity-rich and economically sound nations do not do so directly whereas others big and small rally to help disaster victims for example immediately after megatyphoon haiyan devastated many regions in the central philippines in 2013 israel sent 250 medical doctors and nurses and field hospitals to help philippine citizens recover from the impacts of the typhoonas discussed in an earlier chapter volcanoes are predictable in terms of becoming active by emitting wisps of smoke bulging on a slope warming of the soil or nearby pond or lake waters emitting increasing concentrations of gases and showing increased low-frequency seismicity however this activity does not always result in an eruption a marked increase in measurements and observations especially the low-frequency seismic activity suggests that an eruption is imminent adaptation to living and working on or near a volcano means investing in equipment to monitor volcanic activity and listening to alerts from scientists monitoring its activity and being ready to evacuate by gathering important papers and precious mementos and prepared to load into transportation for evacuation to safe locations governments adapt by charging geologists to map out areas considered as high- moderate- and low-hazard zones in the volcano environs geologists do this by studying rocks deposited from past eruptions and assessments of the topography municipalities then pass zoning regulations applicable to the hazard levelgovernments have adapted to repeated periodic flooding in areas by creating flood control systems described in chap 101007978-3-319-09686-54 dams hold water during times of heavy andor extended rainfall and release any overflow into channels that move water away from urban or rural population centers levees increase the volume of water that can move through a channel thereby keeping it from spreading into populated areas and cultivated farmland for smaller waterways that flow through cities municipalities may invest in deepening widening and straightening channels as well as erecting walls so that more water can flow through the area more rapidly without coming out of a channel governments define zones on flood plains according to a recurrence interval of damaging floods eg 100 years as being off limits for residential and factoryplant construction as much as we plan to adjust to living in an area prone to flooding there is always the possibility of a megaevent that can overcome in situ control systems therefore as described chap 101007978-3-319-09686-54 governments adapt to this possibility by installing flood prediction equipment in drainage basins to provide warning to those at risk from rising and sometimes raging waters the warning gives people time to gather important documents and personal treasures and evacuate to safe areas the apparent increase in the frequency and magnitude of storms and resulting flooding in recent years is thought by many weather scientists to be related to global warming and the increased amount of moisture in the atmosphere from warmer oceans that gathers in clouds and precipitates during storms this will be discussed further in this chapter
adaptation to extreme weather events such as an extended period of drought heat waves and frigid weather means preparation to wait them out some municipalities adapt to repeated sometimes seasonal times of short-term drought by storing a 36 month water supply in surface or underground reservoirs during periods of normal precipitation that can be tapped conservatively as needed others may plan to move water via pipes or water tankers from where it is plentiful to where drought conditions exist otherwise to survive people move as best they can to where they have access to water in instances of years long drought crops and livestock and other life forms may be lost heat waves can kill adaptation to heat wave conditions means that water has to be available to people to avoid dehydration where possible homes should have air-conditioning or fans to keep people comfortable and municipalities should have cooling centers to which people can go personnel should check on senior citizens and escort them to cooling centers if necessary clearly economically advantaged nations have the resources to give support to citizens during natural hazards such as these these nations international organizations and ngos have a moral obligation to help economically disadvantaged nations as is possible when hazard conditions such as these threaten populationsthe most extreme of weather conditions that can injure and kill people and destroy housing and infrastructure are tropical storms that evolve into violent hurricanes typhoons monsoons by increasing wind speeds and sucking up moisture water as they track across oceans toward land when these storms make landfall they drive storm surges that can wreak havoc onshore communities and as they move inland precipitate heavy rains that cause life-threatening and destructive flooding these violent storms are destructive to coastal populations and island nations and have regional reach inland as they move along paths until they finally spend their energy or move out to sea on november 8 2013 the typhoon named haiyan the strongest recorded typhoon ever to make landfall smashed into the central philippines killing more than 2600 people injuring about 12500 and displacing almost 600000 people there was a 4-m 13 ft storm surge driven by winds measured at over 312 kmh 195 mih with gusts reaching 380 kmh 235 mih the typhoon flattened the city of tacloban that was home to 200000 residents and there was major flooding inland the weather alerts led to a government call for evacuation away from the predicted path of the storm and about 1 million people followed the evacuation warning surely saving many lives access to aid typhoon-ravaged areas was difficult and there were shortages of water food and medical care for many evacuees for several days the philippine central government and local officials were not prepared to deal with a storm of this magnitude but help started arriving from many nations worldwide there was a post-event concern of attending to sanitation needs of survivors to prevent outbreaks of diseases such as cholera typhoid fever hepatitis and dysentery if the philippine government had adapted by adopting better policies with respect to response to high-category typhoons in addition to the call for evacuation the impact of haiyan would have been ameliorated one would hope that this deficiency would be dealt with to limit the effects of future like disastersevacuation to prevent injury and death in coastal zones that could be struck by high winds heavy sustained rains and storm surges is dependent on weather bureau forecasts and warnings from police firefighters or other government-authorized personnel homeowners adapt to hurricanes by securing roofing with additional nails or special fasteners as a retrofit precaution and by boarding up windows on structures before an incoming storm hits governments have adapted to the onslaught of violent high-energy storms by constructing seawalls of varying designs and heights to protect population centers by damping the force of storm surges in china for example a seawall 672 m 22 ft in height and that has been heightened in the past protects shanghai from the full damaging effects of high-category typhoons as a result of rising sea level the shanghai seawall and other that protect coastal cities from being flooded by surges from high-energy tropical storms will have to be heightened to afford a greater degree of protection to people and propertywildfires can be a natural hazard when ignited by a lightening strike however most wildfires are started by human carelessness such as tossing a lit cigarette on a forest floor or failing to completely extinguish a campfire or by arsonists one may adapt to living in an area with a history of wildfires in two ways neither of which is practical or promises 100  protection first would be to clear an area of vegetation in a 30-m 100 ft swath around a dwelling or site for building second would be to build with nonflammable materials so that embers propelled during a wildfire could not ignite a structure adaptation to the advance of a wildfire would be to heed warnings to evacuate carrying a prepared case with important documents and other items of personal value to delay evacuation by going back to retrieve something from then home can be fatal as it was for two people in a recent june 2013 wildfire that destroyed almost 500 homes in colorado springs colorado usawhen there is a hazard event coming that calls for evacuation responsible and often economically advantaged governments have adapted to the threat by designating evacuation routes by providing transportation for people who need it by having evacuation centers stocked with water and food cots and blankets basic medical supplies and medical personnel and by having phone service available for people that need it in the case of a primary or triggered hazard that happens with little or no warning eg an earthquake a tsunami a volcanic mud flow search and rescue teams should be ready to move in soon after dangerous conditions ease and they can move with safety there should be medical attention to treat injured survivors and stations set up as soon as possible to provide water food and other essentials available to those that survived with little or no physical hurt these first steps at adaptation are the keys to survival recovery after a shock phase can be long and drawn out depending in grand part on a nations social and economic resources and physical and economic assistance from other nations international institutions and ngosglobal warming is a fact attested to by an overwhelming majority of the scientific community and unwaveringly supported by a february 2014 joint publication of the us national academy of sciences and the royal academy in the uk on the causes and evidence for global warming 1 as noted in earlier chapters during the past century measurements show that the earth has warmed by 08 c 144 f global warming is an ongoing process that is attributed in grand part to a slow but continuous and increasing buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere the greenhouse gas most associated with global warming is carbon dioxide co2 a plot of the increase of co2 content in the atmosphere with time against the increase in global temperature shows an excellent correlation of one with the other additional lesser contributors include methane ch4 nitrous oxide no2 and chlorofluorocarbons cfcs with the beginning of the industrial revolution and the increased use of coal as the principal energy source the content of co2 in the atmosphere was 280 parts per million 0028  the combustion of coal and later oil petroleum and natural gas emits co2 to the atmosphere initially and for many years thereafter the added greenhouse gases were taken up by vegetation for photosynthesis and was also absorbed by the oceans and other water bodies this kept the atmosphere co2 close to the 280 ppm pre-industrial level however with increased industrialization the need for electrical power and the use of internal combustion engines the amount of co2 generated was greater than what could be absorbed by nature and the content of co2 in the atmosphere increased during june 2013 its concentration reached more than 398 ppm an increase of over 40  over the pre-industrial concentration scripps institute of oceanography mauna loa measurement the increasing co2 content other greenhouse gases aerosols and particles acted as a media that admitted sunlight heat energy to the earths surface but did not let all of the heat escape back into the atmosphere this abets global warming in the past two to three decades the rush to industrialization in developing countries eg china india and brazil and their growing power needs and vehicular use has thwarted the implementation of international agreements to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants other industrial and manufacturing operations and the transportation sectora direct consequence of global warming is sea level rise slr caused by the progressive melting of icecaps and ice sheets in greenland the arctic and antarctica and of mountain glaciers in the himalayas the alps the rocky mountains and the andes the 20-cm 8 in sea level rise during the past century may see a rise of another 50 cm 20 in1 m 39 in during this twenty-first century one-third of the rise would be from the expansion of warmer sea water one-third from icecap and ice sheet melt and one-third from mountain glacier melt 2 in 2012 other researchers used computer models on existing data and proposed that 50  of sea level rise between 1903 and 2007 was from glacial melt 3 following the same line of investigation other scientists studied satellite data and ground measurements from alaska the canadian arctic greenland the southern andes the himalayas and other high mountains of asia and estimated that glacier contributions to sea level rise from 2003 to 2009 was 29  and together with ice sheet melt explained 60  of slr 4 a publication in 2012 estimated that ocean thermal expansion 0300 m deep and 300700 m deep contributed up to 35  to sea level rise 5 these latter two estimations are in line with the ipcc prediction for melting ice and ocean thermal expansion contribution to the estimated rise of sea level by the end of the century 2 with a rise in sea level marine waters encroach on land as the rise continues possibly at an increasing rate it threatens habitation in lowlying islands coastal villages and farmland in lowlying zones and heavily populated cities worldwide settled on inshore terrain close to sea level eg bangkok ho chi minh city jakarta manila miami new york boston buenos aires london rotterdamrising sea level and warming of ocean waters have other ramifications that affect coastal communities as well as inland areas as explained in chap 101007978-3-319-09686-57 the warmer surface water releases more water vapor with heat energy into the atmosphere when the water vapor molecules condense in clouds heat energy is released this energy gives more force to tropical storms as they form track to shore and move inland or storms that move close to and along a coast these storms may transition to hurricanes typhoons monsoons with the violent winds that cause destruction and heavy rainfall that triggers flooding if they move onto land we recognize that rising sea level means that tropical storms that impact a coast with storm surges have a farther reach inland with their destructive energy that is more pronounced when the surge occurs at high tide the surges also saturate farmland they reach with salt water that harms crops they also carry salt water into fresh water marshes and ponds thus disrupting ecosystems there the increase in the number of these extreme weather events and the increase in violence and destruction they wreak on land compared with like weather events in the recent past eg during the past 30 years strongly suggest that they are fueled to a significant degree by global warmingthere are two possibilities for adapting to the effects of rising sea level on coastal urban centers one impractical the other very costly but doable the impractical adaptation possibility is to move at-risk population centers inland out of the reach of the destructive tropical storms this does not lessen the threat of flooding the move is possible in some cases where land is available but such a move is not economically feasible one practical but costly adaptation to mitigate encroachment from sea level rise and the effects of tropical storm surges is to surround cities at risk within place seawalls 23 m higher than recorded high tides or higher depending on historical records and contemporary published data the walls can have a concave configuration so that surging waves lose energy when their lower parts hit and are curled back on themselves damping some wave energy or there can be a different configuration best for the sites to be protected similarly gates buried at strategic locations where there is ship access to consider can be built to be hydraulically driven so that they can rise from a near shore seabed site to mitigate the effects of storm surges both techniques have been used at different global locationswe have read that climate change affects land-based agricultural production both for crops and animal husbandry the warming climate at higher mid-hemispheric latitudes and at higher altitudes does not favor the growth and normal yield andor quality of many crops depending upon the degree of climate change and the linked changes that may follow it farmers can adapt in several ways to maintain or increase crop yield and nutrition value for example when warming starts diminishing the productivity of a traditional crop farmers can sow crops that are known to grow well in warmer temperature and give a satisfactory economic benefit however new groups of weeds pests and diseases will migrate to the warmer growth environment and will have to be dealt with in order to protect the new cropswhere the effect of global warming reduces water supply for rain-fed agriculture for crops irrigated with surface waters and for groundwater-irrigated crops when aquifer recharge does not balances discharge agriculturalists can adapt in two ways first is the use of a more efficient irrigation method that delivers water directly to a growing plant eg drip or focused irrigation this minimizes runoff and loss to evaporation second and similar to what was mentioned earlier is to sow a crop that needs less water to thrive and that delivers a good yield good-quality productanother result of global warming for some farmlands is a longer growing season in this situation growers can adapt by planting earlier and have the possibility of double cropping they can also grow a cultivar that is later maturing and that gives a product that brings a good market price however switching to new crops in a warmer growth environment means that there will be an invasion of a new set of weeds pests and diseases to ward offin any efficient operation and as emphasized in earlier chapters farmers adjust to a changing growth environment for a given cultivar by applying the optimum amounts of fertilizer and other agricultural chemicals as might be needed that nurture and protect it most effectively this reduces agricultural costs and lessens runoff of these chemicals to ecosystems where they can be harmfulglobal warming can bring on abnormal weather extremes that affect agricultural productivity in these cases farmers have to plan ahead based on recent history of these conditions in their regions drought heat waves and long-term rain or heavy rain in a short time present problems for both cultivars and food animals periods of less than average precipitation may last months or years depending on the amount of the deficit precipitation adaptation can include storing water in reservoirs and cisterns during times of rainfall to be tapped during a drought to sustain food animals and crops during a short-term not too severe drought there is also the option of trucking in water to sustain livestock long-term droughts when precipitation deficits are high take their toll on plants and animals to the detriment of agriculture in a region especially when accompanied by heat waves they have caused recent disasters for crops and food animals on all continents less antarctica farmers either wait out the bad times change the type of cropping they do the livestock they tend to or change careersthe adaptation from crops that have been grown successfully before the effects of global warming reduced yields and quality of a harvest to those same crops that can grow successfully under the advancing warming changes just described generally means that hybridized species have to be developed and used as warming increases at a location and slowly tracks to higher latitudes and higher altitudes thus growers turn to plants that are created by hybridization as described in chap 101007978-3-319-09686-53 traditional methods and marker-assisted selection methods within the same species and genetically engineered -modified -manipulated methods using different species hybridization is a slow process sped up markedly by genetic engineering a method that yields foodstuff not accepted by the european union and many nations outside the union especially in africa bred species are developed to carry one or more characteristics that favor crop resilience against the effects of climate change these include resistance to disease weeds and pests and tolerant of drought water stress heat short-term inundation and short-term saline exposure see chap 101007978-3-319-09686-53 hybrids have also been developed to give higher yields and more nutritious crops thus far research has been focused mainly on improving seed for world staples such as rice maize corn wheat sorghum and soybeanthere have been great successes where hybrid crops were agriculturalists adaptation so that the possibility exists that we can feed the earths growing populations and reduce chronic malnutrition when this is coupled with the opening of additional arable acreage and the use of improved farming methods for seeding watering and harvesting global food security can be strengthened for the existing world population and the future generations on earth however this will require economic and technical input by developed nations and international groups without basic sustenance people will have less resistance to diseases and there may be local or regional population crashes if diseases evolve into epidemics or pandemics that invade susceptible populationswarming of the open ocean water enclosed aquaculture operations in ocean waters and on land water bodies has affected marine fisheries and marine and estuarine aquaculture that grow food fish and shellfish and lakes that sustain fisheries in marine fisheries worldwide eg in the north atlantic off the coast of peru off the coast of the philippines some food fish or fish captured for other purposes eg to use in pet food to use to make fertilizer have migrated to cooler water in ecosystems with conditions conducive to their spawning and growth in some cases predators follow fish they prey upon that have migrated to cooler waters but in other cases they find new prey to sustain them in other situations they may become prey for larger fish in an ecosystem fishing fleets adapt by following the fish they hunt into cooler waters where ideally they capture the hunted species in quantities allotted them by national and international fishery governing body regulations if the quota system is followed this will allow recovery of fish populations and sustainable harvestingaquaculture operations that provide important supplies of food fish worldwide can adapt to warming waters by raising food fish or shellfish that will grow and multiply under the changed range of daynight temperature conditions if the fish they are farming cannot survive in the warmer waters aquaculturalists also have the option to move their facilities to cooler-temperature waters but the economic feasibility of doing this has to be evaluated by a benefit to cost analysis this analysis has to be for the time frame during which the cooler-ecosystem waters are estimated to remain stable within the framework of a time range against global warmingclimate change another adaptation is that food fish currently being raised can be genetically engineered to be resistant to a warmer growth environment without changing their nutrition yield growth rate and ability to reproduce
vaccines provide a main line of defense against many diseases smallpox has been eradicated on earth by vaccination polio has all but been eradicated globally except for a few pockets of the disease in pakistan afghanistan and nigeria where in some cases religious fundamentalists have beaten and killed health workers tasked with giving the vaccine to children and in other cases where parents have been warned by the zealots against allowing their children to be vaccinated recently 81 polio cases were diagnosed mainly in somalia but also in kenya this is attributed to the fact that by 2013 500000 children in somalia have not received the vaccine and are at risk from this highly contagious disease it is also attributed to cross-border migration of infected persons into kenya both governments are stepping up their vaccination programs there were 59 cases of polio diagnosed in the rest of the world in 2012
measles is a global disease that can be prevented by a vaccine that is safe and cost-effective measles may soon reach the near-eradication stage in 1980 and subsequent years 26 million people mainly children under 5 years of age died from measles since 2000 1 billion children were vaccinated 225 million in 2011 by 2011 84  of the worlds children received the measles vaccine up from 72  in 2000 from 2000 to 2011 deaths from measles dropped to 71  from 548000 to 158000 when the vaccination rate reaches 95  mainly in low-income countries the world will have brought another disease close to elimination 6
seasonal influenza is a global viral illness that afflicts 35 million people the sickness kills 250000500000 people with severe symptoms annually transmission of the virus takes place when an infected individual coughs or sneezes without covering hisher mouth and releases droplets that can be inhaled by someone up to a meter away transmission can also be from hands carrying the virus seasonal influenza affects all age groups but children less than 2 years old people over 65 and those with complicating medical problems are most at risk influenza is a disease to be controlled the principal control is by safe and effective vaccines that can prevent 7090  of influenza cases in healthy adults secondary controls are obvious for infected persons cover the mouth when sneezing or coughing and wash the hands frequently the influenza vaccine is taken once annually because strains of the influenza virus change from year to year adaptation is needed the adaptation is via a vaccine that is prepared with 3 or 4 strains that scientists determine will be most common during a coming season 7other types of influenza and respiratory illnesses have the potential to cause an epidemic or pandemic they include avian flu and its strains and swine flu if the strains develop the ability for person-to-person transmission after infection and sars severe acute respiratory syndrome and middle east respiratory syndrome  mers because there is human-to-human transmission of the sicknesses to the present the outbreaks of the animal influenza diseases have been contained by quarantining infected people during treatment and by culling flocks and herds or if available vaccination of healthy animals the latter two respiratory illnesses are caused by the coronavirus and infected people have been in isolation wards for sars an illness that broke out in 2003 and spread to 24 countries isolation of victims and treatment with antiviral drugs and steroids stopped the disease during 2004 mers is a recent 20122013 illness that has been confined to jordan saudi arabia qatar and the united arab emirates the mers virus has been found in camels infected persons are quarantined in hospitals but an effective drug treatment is still being sought to complement the normal hospital care-afforded patientshiv aids is a global epidemic that killed 25 million people in three decades since 1981 worldwide in 2011 there were 34 million people with hiv mainly 33 million or 97  in sub-saharan africa and southsoutheast asia the illness is caused by the exchange of body fluids semen vaginal excretions blood breast milk from an infected individual with an uninfected person more than 50  of the cases of hiv are from heterosexual activity there is no vaccine against hiv aids no cure for it but there is a cocktail of medicines antiretroviral treatment that control viral replication and allow an infected persons immune system to strengthen this keeps the illness at bay and afflicted people in general good health and productive in their communities in 2012 only 97 million less than 30  of those with hiv in low and middle economies received the antiretroviral treatment this is changing as more hiv carriers have access to antiretroviral therapy and there are more donations from economically advantaged countries to support hiv stabilization and reduction programs the number of new cases of hiv is not exploding because more than 50  of those infected are following protocols that reduce the transmission of the diseasethe prevention of transmission methods include access to male and female condoms blood screening before transfusions and needle and syringe exchange programs for sterile injections by drug users hiv testing and education programs and hiv treatment help prevent transmission because individuals in continuous treatment have a very low probability of passing on the disease male circumcision reduces the infection in men by about 60  there is still much progress to be made because there were 25 million new cases of hiv in 2011 with 18 million of that total in sub-saharan africa the hivaids is a global sickness that is slowly coming under control because of generous donations from governments and foundations in developed countries added to what low- and middle-income countries themselves provide to lower the prevalence and incidence of hiv in their populations 8
tuberculosis tb infected 87 million people globally in 2011 killing 14 million persons it is a bacterial disease that spreads among people when infected individuals cough sneeze or spit releasing bacteria into the air where they can be inhaled by others a meter away although tb occurs worldwide developing countries carry the largest burden of cases and deaths 95  the bulk of new cases are regional in asia 60  with sub-saharan africa reporting a large share as well with 2600 new cases per million inhabitants there is no vaccination for tb but the disease can be treated and cured the treatment is a half-year course of four antimicrobial drugs that must be taken without fail and thus requires continual supervision by healthcare personnel more than 51 million people have been treated and cured of tb since 1995 and perhaps 20 million lives saved by following the who stop tb strategy protocols including securing adequate sustained financing ensuring early reliable detection and diagnosis and providing approved treatment with a secure effective drug supply the number of people infected with tb is declining and from 1990 to 2011 the tb death rate dropped more than 40  the success in dealing with tb is muted somewhat because a strain of the bacterium that causes tb has evolved to be multidrug resistant  mdr-tb in 2011 310000 cases of this variant were reported of the 87 million cases worldwide mainly from india china and the russian federation these are treated with but do not always respond to the most effective anti-tb drugs research into new drugs to deal with this problem is ongoing 9 there is the question of whether people visiting or immigrating from these countries should be screened before a host country issues them entry visasregional illnesses threaten the health of 100s of millions of people mainly in tropical and subtropical areas and often affecting children one of these the guinea worm disease is trending toward elimination if not eradication this is a parasitic disease caused when people swallow water contaminated with infected water fleas microscopic copepods carrying worm larva the worms release penetrate the intestines and move through the body migrating under the skin until they emerge causing swelling and blistering people infected with guinea worm disease cannot contribute to their communities for months during the mid-1980s there were 25 million cases mainly in 16 african nations but attention to where the sources were so that they could be avoided and treated and assistance in generating clean water were adaptations that brought the number of cases down to less than 10000 in 2007 the number of cases continued to decline and was reduced to 542 in 2012 in four african countries south sudan chad ethiopia and mali there is no vaccine against guinea worm disease health officials adapt to counter this sickness in several ways as noted above access to clean drinking water is the best way to prevent infection the prevention or transmission of the worms from infected individuals to healthy persons by proper treatment and hygiene and the use of the larvacide temephos to eliminate the parasite-infected water flea vector and other prevention protocols are important in the control and effort to eliminateeradicate the disease 10 the jimmy carter institute atlanta georgia usa has been a principle force since 1986 in the fight to rid the world of guinea worm diseasein tropical and subtropical regions there are three mosquito-vectored diseases that put millions of people at risk yellow fever malaria and dengue fever yellow fever is an endemic viral disease in tropical regions of africa and latin america with 200000 cases reported annually that cause 30000 deaths there is no set treatment for afflicted people but there is an adaptive preventive measure a vaccine against yellow fever is available that is safe affordable and that gives lifelong immunity to the disease with one dose after 710 days for 95  of the people vaccinated when there is the onset of a yellow fever outbreak where the population lacks vaccination protection mosquito control is an essential first step in adaptation to prevent or slowdown transmission of the yellow fever virus spraying insecticides to eliminate breeding sites and kill adult mosquitos is the control used during epidemics to make time for vaccination campaigns in a population and for immunity to take hold there are limitations to the application of the yellow fever vaccine first is that babies less than 9 months of age should not be vaccinated or during an epidemic babies less than 69 months of age should not receive the vaccine second pregnant women should not be vaccinated except when there is an outbreak of the disease third people with a strong allergy to egg protein or those with a marked immunodeficiency or with a thymus problem should not receive the vaccine 11
malaria is a parasitic disease caused by the bite of an infected mosquito there is no vaccine against malaria but one is undergoing a clinical trial in seven african nations with results expected in 2014 a use or no use decision as a control method for malaria will be made in 2015 promising results from an early-stage clinical trial of an unconventional vaccine prepared with live weakened sporozoites of the malaria parasite were published in 2013 plasmodium falciparum was given to healthy 1845 year-old volunteers intravenously the volunteers were grouped to receive 26 doses and subsequently exposed to bite by five mosquitoes carrying the parasite none of the six that received five doses were infected with malaria three of the 12 that received four doses became infected whereas 16 of the 17 that received lower doses became infected of 12 that received no vaccine 11 became infected those that became infected were treated with malarial drugs and cured clearly higher dosages give protection against infection by malaria 12 more research and extensive clinical trials are necessary to determine how children respond to the vaccine with adjusted dosages and whether the results from early-stage trial are reproducible in larger volunteer populations if the results of additional clinical trials go well the hurdle of producing enough vaccine and adapting it to injection has to be facedforty percent of the deaths from malaria are of african children in the democratic republic of congo and nigeria in addition to sub-saharan africa populations in asia especially india and the greater mekong region and latin america suffer from the disease the effort to deal with the disease that is preventable and curable now centers on control and treatment to reduce the number of cases in 2010 the who reported that there were 219 million cases and 660000 deaths with an uncertainty range of 490000836000 in a 2012 report researchers suggested that the number of deaths was understated and that their computer model gave a figure for 2010 almost double 1238000 deaths 95  uncertainty interval of 9290001685000 13 the who stood by its figure stating that much of the data in the cited study were based on verbal testimony of how people had died not on laboratory diagnosis of samples either figure represents too many deaths from the disease and have to be reduced mosquito control is the adaptation that can reduce the transmission of the disease greatly this includes personal protection by use of proper clothing andor the application of mosquito repellent the use of long-lasting insecticidal pyrethroids treated nets to kill mosquitos and prevent nighttime bites and indoor residual spraying remains effective for months those people infected can be treated with oral artemisinin monotherapy followed by a second drug failure to complete the treatment as prescribed leaves parasites in a persons blood no other antimalarial treatment is available so that parasite resistance could become a serious problem for visitors to a malaria region antimalarial drugs taken before during and after a trip can protect them from the disease many countries in tropical and subtropical areas have used the above-cited strategies and others to work toward the elimination of malaria malaria eradication is the goal of the who 14
dengue fever is a female mosquito-borne virus that infects people with an influenza-like disease in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide the disease can kill if it evolves to severe dengue it is endemic in latin america and asia where most cases now occur since the 1970s the sickness has spread to more than 100 countries putting about 35  of the worlds 2013 population 25 billion people at risk dengue fever is especially endemic to urbansemi-urban environments humans are the main carrier of the virus after a mosquito bites an infected person each subsequent bite by the infected mosquito creates another carrier a mosquito can bite many people each time it feeds in the americas alone there were 16 billion cases of dengue fever reported in 2010 with 49000 being severe dengue there is no vaccination against dengue fever but research continues to develop one the main treatment for afflicted persons is to keep them hydrated adaptation to deal with slowing or stopping the spread of dengue fever involves three main tracks in addition to spraying insecticide to kill mosquitos the best control method to prevent the transmission of the virus is to deprive mosquitos of sites with shallow standing water where they can lay eggs and multiply control can be improved if communities cover and clean water storage containers regularly and use proven insecticides on them as necessary finally individual protection such as the use of mosquito repellants and insecticide-impregnated bed nets can help reduce the incidence of dengue fever as it has with malaria 15 although controls are known they are not always applied because of economics and other factors that prevent access to protection methods the result is that the number of cases of dengue fever reported continues to grow globally as populations increase in urban locations the incidence of dengue fever can be expected to increase as well unless strict controls are enforced until a safe and cost-effective vaccine is developed a positive aspect of the dengue fever problem is that recovery from one serotype of the virus gives immunity for life however there are four serotypes of the infectious virus so that recovery from one leaves a person susceptible to the others 15chagas is another regional disease it infects 78 million people annually mostly in 21 latin american countries it is a parasitic illness that evolves after the bite of a blood-feeding triatomine bug often on the face where it defecates close by leaving parasite-bearing feces parasites access the body when the feces are inadvertently smeared into the bite the eyes the mouth or any skin lesion the parasites circulate in the blood expressing their presence as a purplish swelling of one eyelid or as a skin lesion there are several other symptoms as well in this acute stage of the illness but these may be absent or mild if diagnosed early during this stage chagas disease is treatable the parasite is killed with the medicines benznodazole and nifurtimox taken for 2 months there are limitations as to who can take these medicines eg not by pregnant women or people with kidney or liver problems the untreated sickness can cause cardiac alterations and digestive problems that show up 2040 years after an untreated infection chagas disease can be spread by blood transfusion and by organ transplant making blood screening for the parasite essential before a procedure it can also pass to a fetus from an infected woman there is no vaccination against the illness so that control of the vector triatomine sp is necessary the controls adapted by many municipalities include insecticide spraying inside a home the use of treated bed nets and hygiene practices that protect food its preparation and its storage before eating it 16 the sickness may recur if control practices become lax chagas disease is spreading as populations emigrate from latin america to northern countries blood screening of visitors or immigrants from the countries where chagas is endemic may be necessary and treatment followed by an infected individual before a host country issues an entrance visa this would prevent the ingress and possible spread of chagasoutbreaks of diseases in town and cities is most often caused by bacterium-contaminated water or food and poor sanitation sicknesses such as cholera typhoid and various other diarrhea types are examples of such diseases they are all highly infectious if good hygiene practices are not followed these diseases are endemic in many countries where populations do not have access to safe water and adequate sanitation there are vaccinations for some of these sicknesses that may require more than one dose but they may not be completely effective or long lasting and require revaccination at times specified by medical personnel eg after 25 years otherwise infected persons can be treated with medicines such as oral rehydration pills or antibiotics adaptation for prevention is easier called for than realistically available washing hands with soap and clean water after visiting the toilet and as noted above access to safe water and good sanitation given the millions of people infected by these bacterial diseases and the hundreds of thousand that die from them annually generally in economically disadvantages countries there should be an expanding global priority to eliminate the disease-causing conditions and preparedness to combat an outbreak when it is reportedthere are important factors to consider when adopting plans to halt or meliorate the effects of health threats to people in the near and extended future one is the climate change-driven spread of tropical and subtropical diseases discussed earlier to newly warmer and moister higher-latitude and higher-altitude zones another is the growth of populations mainly in tropical and subtropical regions in africa asia and latin america together with this latter factor are the increasing populations and population densities in urban centers especially in the regions just cited an additional factor to consider is whether there is accessibility to populations by healthcare workers or by people to healthcare clinics or hospitals well-staffed and well-stocked with necessary pharmaceuticalscertainly future planning has to include funding to support research to develop vaccines for diseases that do not have vaccination as an option against an illness eg malaria dengue fever  in addition improvement of vaccines that are available but that are not completely effective in terms of protection or the length of time they are effective should be a priority in pharmaceutical and biotechnology laboratories scientists presented a fine review of the status of vaccine research from the design and development of vaccines to discussion of vaccines and infectious diseases eg hiv malaria tuberculosis pneumococcal disease and influenza 17 they also discuss vaccines against enteric infections and viral diseases of livestock as well as vaccines against non-infectious diseases eg cancer and against chronic non-infectious diseases continued and repeated education classes on how to prevent the transmission of diseases and free supplies of materials that work to this end eg insecticide-treated bed netting male and female condoms are essential to reducing the prevalence and incidence of diseases as are safe water and uncontaminated food as new medicines or combinations of medicines are developed tested and found to be effective in controlling diseases they become part of the protocol for either curing disease or controlling disease to reduce transmission while allowing persons to carry on with their lives in these times of easy and rapid migration one wonders whether screening of visitors or immigrants for diseases known to be endemic or active in the countries or regions from which they come should be required so as to prevent a carrier from infecting others and spreading a disease eg chagas disease cholera tuberculosis this was done at airports during the sars scare for people leaving or entering a country eg china and likely limited the transmission of the sars virus and spread of the diseasepreparedness for a disease outbreak response to an outbreak and management of resources during and post-outbreak are the keys to adapting to health threats that could affect future generations this means developing the capability to extend the reach of health services to regions where climate change brings warmer moister conditions to higher-latitude and higher-altitude ecosystems that are now reached by disease vectors that have expanded into these formerly cooler and drier environments as a result of global warming adapting to this reality and planning ahead makes it possible to deal with and stem an incipient outbreak of disease before it is transmitted and spread to the general population this becomes essential when there is a future disease outbreak in large dense populations in tropical and subtropical urban centers as well as those in regions warmed and humidified by climate change to subtropical and tropical settings remember that urban populations worldwide especially in africa asia and latin america are where much of the global population growth will take place during the next few generations under these conditions diseases can spread rapidly in many ways these include from bites of vectors by respired droplets after an infected person coughs or sneezes and by touching surfaces bearing viruses bacteria or parasites diseases are also spread by ingestion of contaminated water andor tainted food and by other methods of infection transmission disease transmission can be checked by rapid response teams with appropriate and sufficient supplies to treat and perhaps places to quarantine those in the infected populationlastly it must be noted that there are many other diseases in addition to those cited previously for which prevention treatment and cures are research priorities in laboratories worldwide in addition there are addiction diseases that can trigger health problems in important segments of society these include smoking eg emphysema lung cancer alcoholism eg cirrhosis of the liver drugs eg various psychological and physical ills and overeating obesity diabetes high blood pressure adaptation to these health threats involves public education forums through various media outlets counseling and sponsored groups with their individual group meeting and programs are assisting many in breaking from an addiction to the benefit of a healthier life adaptation to meet the health challenges in the past and in contemporary times has been a slow progressive adventure with many successes but with much yet to be done this is the planned path for the future meet the challenges of societal health threats resolve many and keep researching to resolve othersa special ipcc report in 2012 examines in a general way adaptation to a changing climate as a risk management approach 18 it uses pre-planning to reduce exposure and vulnerability to extreme hazard events by preparing for them beforehand responding to their impacts on people structures and infrastructure and having in place recovery systems that can act when a danger condition eases in this way there will be an ability of populations to cope with future risks brought on by a changing force with which a hazard impacts a community changes in the frequency of an occurrence and extension of the spatial reach of its destructive power much of this has been discussed in the chapters of the book you are readingan understanding of what is being done now to adapt to the various problems society faces during the second decade of the twenty-first stimulates proposals of how to adapt to them as global conditions change in the future to this end the world bank commissioned a study on the effects global warming as it increased from 08 c that exists on our planet now to what can be expected if the warming reached 2 c a change that many scientists believe we can adapt to and then reached 4 c as warming continues 19 the study centered on regions with high population growth and great susceptibility to be negatively impacted by climate changes 1 sub-saharan africa where food production is at risk 2 southeast asia where coastal zones and productivity are at risk and 3 south asia where there could be extremes of water scarcity and excess the effects of higher temperatures from global warming and climate change included what has been discussed in previous chapters of this book heat drought sea level rise coastal zones typhoons flooding river runoff water availability ecosystem shifts crop yields fishing aquaculture livestock health and poverty and tourism projections such as those published in the world bank study give impetus to governments international institutions multinational companies private foundations and ngos to think now to invest now and to research now for adaptations that can be realized in good time and that will provide global citizenry with a good quality of life where neededin this book we have examined existing human populations and the problems they are experiencing in the second decade of the twenty-first century and have also considered growing populations globally and additional problems future generations will experience we have discussed strategies on how to cope with many-faceted threats to citizens these include how to nourish those who need food and water how to shelter people safely from natural and anthropogenic hazards how to provide them with healthcare education and employment and how to prepare them for the evolving global warming and the physical and biological dangers that ensue from climate change given the present global conditions with about 14  of our earths population suffering from malnutrition and more than 21  not having access to safe water our capability of nourishing a billion and a half more people by 2035 is in question also problematical is our capability to provide for an additional billion people 15 years later or a total of at least 103 billion people by the turn of the century that is if we reach those population figures or have population crashes such as from pandemics that can kill scores of millions if a disease is not immediately treatable or an unlikely but possible nuclear conflagration that could do the same less likely yet is an explosion of a small asteroid or comet in the atmosphere such as happened in a poorly inhabited area of siberia in 1908 here an exploding mass more than 60 m in size knocked down millions of trees in an area greater than 2000 km2 close to 800 mi2 with energy thought to be 1000 times greater than the hiroshima atomic bomb clearly such an event could kill the population of a megacity if it were to occuranother question is whether national governments are economically strong enough and have the will to set priorities that adopt strategies to protect citizens from natural eg earthquakes and anthropogenic eg pollution hazards as well as from extreme weather conditions that are supported by global warming  pollution of the atmosphere but are naturally occurring countries can also improve social and economic conditions by investing in health care and education for their citizens in order to form a sound and knowledgeable cadre that would be attractive to investors interested in locating a development project that would provide employment again this is in question given limited national economic capabilities and the increasing numbers of people to be accommodated especially in several developing and less developed countries in africa asia latin america and the middle eastat this point we must ask what is the carrying capacity of the earth have we reached it at 7 billion given the billions who are today under served in developing and less developed countries some scientists will answer yes whereas others believe that advances in agriculture and technology can allow population expansion although to what point is not defined can countries that are poisoning their environments do a turn around to save their citizens from grief can they exert controls on operations that create unhealthy conditions that sicken people lessen agricultural production and otherwise disrupt local regional and global ecosystems at the expense of maintaining their gdp and increasing it this is not the case for many nations today that do not want to acknowledge that changes tomorrow may be too late and that the future begins now without action now to activate programs to sustain and nurture our ecosystem earth the future is bleak for many and bright for a few with action now we can strive toward an equalization in benefits for all citizens the intergovernmental panel on climate change completed the fifth assessment report april 2014 after this book was written climate change 2014 impacts adaptations and vulnerability it is a comprehensive and important contribution to the challenges presented to society by climate change now and in the future and how to manage them for the good of society the full text is online at wwwipccchreportar5
